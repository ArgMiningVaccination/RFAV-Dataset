The survey consists of a continuous sampling and interviewing of the civilian, noninstitutional population of the United States. In addition to the collection of information and the production of health statistics, research studies relating to survey methodology and improved techniques in data collection have been carried out since the beginning of the survey. As a result of these studies and of the experience gained in the collection process, many changes have occurred in the format, content, and administration of the question\u00ad naire, the collection document used in the survey. This report outlines the changes that have led to the improvement of data collection in the household survey since its inception. The expan\u00ad sion of the survey is also examined to provide for the gathering of information on supple- mental health-related topics. An earlier reportl published in 1964 covers the measurement concepts, the questionnaire development, and definitions used during the first 7 years of the survey. Certain components of the survey, particularly those dealing with the structure of the interview, the respondent, and the time references of the interview, are described in great detail. Since the present report is not directed primarily to the ideo\u00ad logical and behavioral aspects of the survey, the reader with interests in these areas is referred to the earlier report and to some of the methodo\u00ad logical studiesz-1 A released by the National Center for Health Statistics. However, in order to present a chronological description of changes in the survey, the timespan 1957-74 will be covered in the present report. HISTORY OF THE INTERVIEW SURVEY Background of the Suwey Legislation authorizing the U.S. Public Health Service to conduct surveys of illness and dis\u00ad ability was enacted in July 1956 (Public Law 652, 84th Congress). The Health Interview Survey, the first of a number of data-collection sy stems implementing the legislation, was organized during the fall and winter of 1956. The resources of the Bureau of the Census were obtained through contractual arrangement to prepare a sample design and to provide services for the collection and processing phases of the program. During February 1957, the procedures were pretested in the Washington, D.C., area and in Charlotte, N.C. From the findings of this pretesting, revisions were made in the collection procedures, and a national sample was pretested 1 during May and June 1957. Collection of data started officially on July 1, 1957, and has continued without interruption since that time. However, prior to the planning of the inter- view questionnaire and the construction of a sample design, it was necessary to develop some concepts relating to the kinds of information to be collected. In the development of concepts, survey personnel relied heavily on the experi\u00ad ences of researchers who had used the interview as a data-collection method. Early in the 1920's, certain populations in Hagerstown, Md., were selected for epidemiological studies and the measurement of levels of selected health char\u00ad acteristics in a local population. These studies continued during the next several decades. Dur\u00ad ing 1935-36, a major nationwide health survey was carried out with 737,000 urban households visited by interviewers. Both of these studies contributed to the knowledge concerning the basic kinds of health data that can be collected by household interview. Since 1936, with the development and refinement of sampling tech\u00ad niques and procedures, the interview method has been used as a means of data collection in a number of local studies of morbidity. Foremost among these are surveys conducted in Baltimore, Md.; Pittsburgh, Pa.; Hunterdon County, N.J.; Kansas City, Me.; New York City; and the State of California. Concepts Used in the Health Interview Survey Even though plans for the Health Interview Survey could be based on the experience and findings of many researchers, concepts and definitions have continued to develop with the expansion and growth of the survey. From information gathered in interviews, an attempt is made to describe the social, demographic, and economic aspects of illness, disability, and the use of medical services. Since interview data measure these health items in terms of the impact they have on the lives of individuals rather than in terms of medical criteria, the concepts of morbidity, disability, and the use of services differ basically from those used in scientific and medical studies. Morbidity. -Morbidity is considered as a departure from a state of physical or mental well-being, resulting from disease or injury, of which the affected individual is aware. Aware\u00ad ness connotes a degree of measurable impact on the individual or his family in terms of the restrictions and disabilities caused by the morbidity. Morbidity includes not only active or progressive disease but also impairments, that is, chronic or permanent defects that are static in nature, resulting from disease, injury, or con- genital malformation. The existence of morbidity in an individual caused by a particular disease, injury, or impairment is called a \"mor\u00ad bidity condition,\" or simply a \"condition.\" During the course of this condition, there may be one or more periods when the affected individual considers himself to be \"sick\" or \"injured.\" These periods are spoken of as episodes of illness. The period or periods of illness may coincide with the period during which the condition exists, or they may cover only a part of that period. A condition may involve no illness, in the usual sense of the word. Hence, illness is only one form of evidence of the existence of a morbidity condition. Other evidence might be a decrease in, or complete loss of, ability to perform various functions, par\u00ad ticularly those of the musculoskeletal system or the sense organs; or a change in the appearance of the body, such as a rash or lump, believed to be abnormal by the person affected. For the purposes of this survey, the concept of a morbidity condition is usually further limited by specifying that it includes only conditions as a result of which the person has taken one or more various actions. Such actions might be the restricting of usual activities, bed disability, work loss, the seeking of medical advice, or the taking of medicines. The start, or onset, of the condition is conceived to be the time when the person first becomes aware of it. If there is an illness associated with the condition, the start, or onset, is usually the time when the illness begins or the injury occurs. In many instances, it may be the time when a physician tells the person that he has a condition of which he was previously unaware. In the statement of this concept, there has been reference to the individual's awareness of his condition and to the individual's actions as a result of the condition. Obviously, in the case of children, the statement must be modified. It is 2 not always the child's awareness or the child's action that establishes the existence of a mor\u00ad bidity condition. Instead, it is the awareness and action of the people responsible for the care of the child, usually the parents. A simikir modifi\u00ad cation applies to adults who are not competent to care for themselves. Disability. -The term \"disability\" has several common uses. For example, a \"disability\" often means a condition that interferes with ability to work. Also, conditions are frequently classified as producing temporary partial, temporary total, permanent partial, or permanent total \"dis\u00ad ability y.\" In this sense, the various degrees of \"disability\" have some legal or official definition that is related to compensation. There is also the term \"disabling,\" which has been used in illness surveys for many years to describe a condition that prevents the individual from carrying on his usual activities for 1 or more days. It has been observed that speaking of a \"disabling condition,\" as the term has been used in surveys, meant to some people no less than severe chronic disability, despite the fact that the range of conditions covered might include such minor disability as the case of the common cold that laid the person up for a day or two. Because the other uses had gained such wide acceptance in certain fields, it was decided not to employ the term \"disability\" in this survey except in a very general sense where it is intended to cover the whole field of interference with activities caused by disease, injury, or impairment (in much the same way that the term \"morbidity\" is used for a generic rather than a specific concept) and also where other words used with it make clear the desired meaning, as in \"bed disability.\" For other specific indexes of disability, new terms that are more descriptive of the concepts of the survey have been and will be introduced. Furthermore, it was decided that the Health Interview Survey needed not one, but several different, specifi\u00ad cally defined indexes of disability to serve different purposes. These are presented in appendix III. The disability terms used in this survey may be grouped into the following three categories: (1) terms describing the individual's status dur\u00ad ing a specified day, or number of days, which are equally applicable to acute conditions or chronic conditions, to all members of the population, and to any day of the week, for example, restricted-activity day and bed-disabil\u00ad ity day; (2) terms describing the individual's status during a specified day, or number of days, which apply to both acute and chronic condi\u00ad tions but only to certain members of the population on days when they would have been working at a job or business, or going to school, if it had not been for their condition, for example, work-loss day and school-loss day; and (3) terms applying only to chronic conditions, or persons with one or more chronic conditions, which describe their usual status \"at the present time,\" meaning in this case during recent months, for example, \"chronic activity limita\u00ad tion\" and \"chronic mobility limitation.\" Since these terms were devised for use in this survey and have special meanings, it is especially important that the user of statistics from the survey become familiar with the concepts that the terms represent. Medical services and facilities.-The personaI interview can be used as a medium for determin\u00ad ing how illnesses, injuries, and impairments affect people\u2014the restrictions and disabilities they suffer and the medical care they receive. This latter term may be broadly interpreted to encompass the concept of utilization of medical services and facilities. It might be so broadly defined as to include everything that people use to care for their well-being, including such items as health sanitation, personal hygiene, and food intake. The Health Interview Survey measures the utilization of medical services and facilities in terms of medical attention, dental care, and hospitalization; use of X-ray facilities, preventive care services, nursing care services, and pros\u00ad thetic appliances and devices; self-treatment; and other similar components of medical care or services. The use of the concept of medical attendance necessitates defining the term \"physician\" and also defining what is meant by \"talking to\" or consulting a physician. The definitions are con\u00ad tained in appendix III. Medical attendance is broadly defined; it does not imply continued attendance or consuhation, nor does it require that the physician give the advice in person. The emphasis is on the fact that the condition was 3 brought to the attention of a physician and that the initial action necessary to set in motion the procedure of diagnosis and treatment was taken. Any definition more restrictive than this would involve the question of what constitutes ade\u00ad quate care-a question that is not a part of the subject matter of the survey. Two of the principal concepts in the area of medical care included in the interview are the physician visit and the classification of visits by type of service. These are closely paralleled by similar concepts in the area of dental care. In both of these areas, the following rules apply: (1) Included in the statistics are visits during which the service is given, not by the physician or dentist himself, but by some other person such as a nurse or dental hygienist acting under the physician's or dentist's supervision, and (2) excluded are visits during which the service consisted of a single procedure administered identically to a number of people who all came for the same purpose, as in a glaucoma or diabetes screening program. The first rule was adopted because it was believed to give a more useful measure of the total volume of care provided and because the concept as defined corresponded more closely to what the layman thinks of as a visit to the physician or dentist. The second rule, on the other hand, was introduced because certain types of service, particularly in the field of mass preventive care, seemed remote from the personalized care that is implied by the terms \"physician visit\" and \"dental visit.\" If a physician administered a test of-hearing to every child in a school classroom, It hardly seemed appropriate that every child be counted as having had one \"physician visit.\" Therefore, it was decided that the counting of such services could be better handled as a separate inquiry into the volume and type of preventive care services. The average layman responding in an inter- view cannot give accurate detailed information about the nature of the service performed at each visit. Consequently, visits have been classi\u00ad fied in broad groups according to the type of service. The definitions and method of classify\u00ad ing physician visits and the terms dealing with the classification of hospitalization are presented in appendix III. The use of X-ray facilities has been measured in terms of visits to X-ray facilities, the part-of-body X-rayed, and the place of service. The extent of personal and nursing care received at home has been the subject of inquiry in terms of the condition causing the require\u00ad ment, the duration of the care, who performed the service, and whether it was constant or part time. The use of prosthetic appliances and other devices has been concerned with the use of hearing aids, artificial limbs, braces, and wheel chairs. The condition causing the use of the appliance was determined, as was the extent of use. The use of home remedies and other forms of self-treatment, the extent of preventive care, the availability of medical care, and attitudes regarding medical care are items that have recently been added to the survey questionnaire. TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE SURVEY Statistical Design The sampling plan of the survey follows a multistage probability design, which permits a continuous sampling of the civilian, noninstitu\u00ad tionalized population of the United States. The sample is designed in such away that the sample of households interviewed each week is repre\u00ad sentative of the target population and that weekly samples are additive over time. This feature of the design permits both continuous measurement of characteristics of samples and more detailed analysis of less common character\u00ad istics and smaller categories of health-related items. The continuous collection has administra\u00ad tive and operational advantages as well as tech\u00ad nical assets since it permits fieldwork to be handled with an experienced, stable staff. In the first stage of the sampling process, primary sampling units (PSU'S) are selected from a universe of 1,900 such units, which are geographically defined and collectively cover the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Each PSU consists of a standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA) or one or two contiguous counties. In a series of successive sampling steps, a final sampling unit is selected, which consists typically of a cluster of neighboring households, 4 called a \"segment.\" (Segments of 4, 6, and 9 households have been used at various times.) A basic design has persisted throughout the existence of the survey, but among the modifica\u00ad tions, four have been sufficiently distinct to be identified by design dates: the designs of 1957, 1959, 1963, and 1973. In the original 1957 design, 372 PSU'S were selected from the uni\u00ad verse. Approximately 36,000 households within these sampling units were assigned for interview\u00ad ing, with the average size of assignment being 12 households per interviewer. In the 1959 design, the number of selected PSU'S was increased to 503, with a corresponding increase to 38,000 households per year and to 13.5 households per average assignment. Both the 1957 and the 1959 designs were based on population figures from the 1950 Decennial Census. In 1963, when population data from the 1960 census became available, many changes were made to increase the efficiency of design. The number of PSU'S was decreased from 372 to 357. The structure of segments and assignments was modified in three important respects: (1) segment size was changed from an expected six households to an expected nine households; (2) the nine households were alternate ones in a cluster of about 18 neighboring households, whereas, earlier, the six had been a compact cluster of six adjacent households; and (3) assignments in a given week consisted of paired neighboring segments in 1963, while, earlier, an assignment attempted to pair unlike segments. In the new design, heterogeneity is obtained by giving the same interviewer different types of segments in successive weekly assignments. One result accompanying these changes was an increase in the average size of assignment from 13.5 households to 16 households. The manner of selecting specific segments was changed for about two-thirds of the total sample, from area sampling to list sampling, using the 1960 census registers as the list frame. Most of the remaining third of the sample continued as an area sample. Finally, the evidence from better estimates of components of variance, plus the above changes, together with the benefits from joint designing with the Census/Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey led to a reduction from 503 to 357 PSU'S and an increase from 38,000 to 42,000 sample households. In July 1968, segment size was changed to six house- holds. In January 1973, the sample design was modified to reflect the 1970 Decennial Census. The number of PSU'S was increased from 357 to 376, and segment size was changed from six adjacent households to four adjacent households. Estimating Procedures Since the design of the interview survey is a complex multistage probability sample, it is necessary to use complex procedures in the derivation of estimates. The following four basic operations are involved: 1. Infiation by the reciprocal of the prob\u00ad ability o~selection.\u2014The probability y of selection is the product of the probabilities of selection from each step of selection in the design (PSU, segment, and household). 2. Nonresponse adjustment.-The estimates are inflated by a multiplication factor, which has as its numerator the number of sample house- holds in a given segment and as its denominator the number of households interviewed in that segment. 3. First-stage ratio adjustment. -Sampling theory indicates that the use of auxiliary infor\u00ad mation that is highly correlated with the vari\u00ad ables being estimated improves the reliability of the estimates. To reduce the variability between PSU'S within a region, the estimates are ratio adjusted to the 1960 populations within six color-residence classes. 4. Poststratz''cata'on by age-sex-color.-The estimates are ratio adjusted within each of\" 60 age-sex-color cells to an independent estimate of the population of each cell for the survey period. These independent estimates are pre- pared by the Bureau of the Census. Both the first-stage and poststratified ratio adjustments take the form of multiplication factors applied to the weight of each elementary unit (person, household, condition, and hospitrdization). The contribution of decedents to a total inventory of events, conditions, or services can be estimated. Since the sample of households is preselected for an entire collection year, it can be assumed that the continuous sampling pro\u00ad duces results that are analogous to those that would be obtained (with adjustment for seasonal 5 variation) if all sample persons were interviewed on a single day during the year. If it is also assumed that the death rate throughout the year is fairly constant and that the vast majority of deaths occur in the civilian, noninstitutionalized population, a complete survey conducted on July 1, for example, would include the experi\u00ad ence of approximately one-half of the decedents during a given year. Thus, the conditions, events, and services for the remaining half of the decedents are missing from the interview data regardless of whether the reference period of the interview item is 2 weeks or a complete year. In 1972, there were 1,962,000 deaths in the ~llited States. Estimates of the experience attributable to approximately 981,000 of these persons are missing from the interview survey. It has been established through methodological studies and from statistics provided by the Hospital Discharge Survey that individuals experience higher rates of disability and hospital episodes and receive a greater number of medical services during the last year of life than do persons in the general population.1s 31G!I T On the basis of these findings, it can be estimated that as a maximum the rates among the decedents missed in the survey might be three times as high as those for the surveyed popula\u00ad tion. Table A provides, for selected items, a rough estimate of the underestimation caused by the exclusion from the survey of the experience of decedents. In 1972, there were approximately 28 million discharges from short-stay hospitals, a rate of 13.9 discharges per 100 persons. If the rate of discharges among decedents were three times that in the general population, or 40 discharges per 100 persons, then 392,000 were omitted from the survey. The inclusion of these would have increased the rate of discharges to 14.1 per 100 persons. The effect of the ratio-estimating process is to make the sample more closely representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population by age, sex, color, and residence, which thereby reduces sampling variance. As noted, each week's sample represents the population living during that week and charac\u00ad teristics of the population. Consolidation of samples over a time period, for example, a calendar quarter, produces estimates of average characteristics of the U.S. population for the calendar quarter. Similarly, population data for a year are averages of the four quarterly figures. For prevalence statistics, such as number of persons with speech impairments or number of persons classified by time interval since last physician visit, figures are first calculated for each calendar quarter by averaging estimates for all weeks of interviewing in the quarter. Preva\u00ad lence data for a year are then obtained by averaging the four quarterly figures. For other types of statistics-namely, those measuring the number of occurrences during a specified time period\u2014such as incidence of acute conditions, number of disability days, or number of visits to a doctor or dentist, a similar computational procedure is used, but the sta\u00ad tistics are interpreted differently. For these items, the questionnaire asks for the respon\u00ad dent's experience over the 2 calendar weeks prior to the week of interview. In such instances, the estimated quarterly total for the statistic is 6.5 times the average 2-week estimate produced by the 13 successive samples taken during the period. The annual total is the sum of the four quarters. Thus, the experience of persons inter- viewed during a year-experience that actually Table A.

Such mterpretation leads to no significant bias. Rounding of numbers.-The original tabula\u00ad tions on which the data in reports are based show all estimates to the nearest whole unit. All consolidations were made from the original tabulations using the estimates to the nearest unit. In the final published tables, the figures are rounded to the nearest thousand, although these are not necessarily accurate to that detail. Devised statistics such as rates and percent distributions are computed after the estimates on which these are based have been rounded to the nearest thousand. Population figures. -Some of the published tables include population figures for specified categories. Except for certain overall totals by age, sex, and color, which are adjusted to independent estimates, these figures are based on the sample of households in the Health Interview Survey. These are given primarily to provide denominators for rate computation, and for this purpose are more appropriate for use with the accompanying measures of health characteristics than other population data that may be available. With the exception of the overall totals by age, sex, and color mentioned above, the population figures differ from figures (which are derived from different sources) pub\u00ad lished in reports of the Bureau of the Census. Official population estimates are presented in Bureau of the, Census reports in Series P-20, P-25, and P-60. Reliability of Estimates There are limitations to the accuracy of diagnostic and other information collected in household interviews. For diagnostic informa\u00ad tion, the household respondent can usually pass on to the interviewer only the information the physician has given to the family. For conditions not medically attended, diagnostic information is often no more than a description of symptoms. However, other facts, such as the number of disability days caused by the condi\u00ad tion, can be obtained more accurately from household members than from any other source, since only the persons concerned are in a position to report this information. The population covered by the sample for the Health Interview Survey is the civilian, non- institutionalized population of the United States living at the time of the interview. The sample does not incilude members of the Armed Forces or U.S. nationals living in foreign countries. It should also be noted that the estimates shown do not represent a complete measure of any given topic during the specified calendar period, since data are not collected in the interview for persons who died during the reference period. For many types of statistics collected in the survey, the reference period covers the 2 weeks prior to the interview week. For such a short period, the contribution by decedents to a total inventory of conditions or services should be very small. However, the contribution by decedents during a long reference period (e.g., 1 year) might be sizable, especially for older persons. Since about 38 percent of all deaths are attributable to diseases of the heart, at least 373,000 cases of heart diseases are missed in the survey. The prevalence estimates of other causes of death, with lower mortality rates, may be affected to a lesser extent by the exclusion of decedents. Errors Due to Sampling Variability Since the statistics presented in a report are based on a sample, they will differ somewhat from the figures that would have been obtained if a complete census had been taken using the same schedules, instructions, and interviewing personnel and procedures. As in any survey, the results are also subject to reporting and processing errors and errors due to nonresponse. To the extent possible, these types of errors were kept to a minimum by methods built into survey procedures. Although it is very difficult to measure the extent of bias in the Health Interview Survey, a number of studies have been conducted to examine this problem. The results have been published in several reports. The standard error is primarily a measure of sampling variabiIit y; that is, the variations that might occur by chance because ordy a sample of 7 the population is surveyed. As calculated for a report, the standard error also reflects part of the variation that arises in the measurement process. It does not include estimates of any biases that might be in the data. The chances are about 68 out of 100 that an estimate from the sample would differ from a complete census by less than the standard error. The chances are about 95 out of 100 that the difference would be less than twice the standard error and about 99 out of 100 that it would be less than 2?4 times as large. The relative standard error of an estimate is obtained by dividing the standard error of the estimate by the estimate itself and is expressed as a percentage of the estimate. For a report, asterisks are shown for any cell with more than a 30-percent relative standard error. Included in the appendix of all HIS reports are charts from which the relative standard errors can be deter- mined for estimates shown in the report. In order to derive relative errors that would be applicable to a wide variety of health statistics and that could be prepared at a moderate cost, a number of approximations were required. As a result, the charts provide an estimate of the approximate relative standard error rather than the precise error for any specific aggregate or percentage. The following three classes of statistics for the health survey are identified for purposes of estimating variances: 1.

Statistics on prevalence and incidence for which the period of reference in the questionnaire is 12 months. Type B. Incidence-type statistics for which the period of reference in the question\u00ad naire is 2 weeks. Type C. Statistics for which the reference period is 6 months. Type D. Statistics for which the reference pe\u00ad riod is 3 months. QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPMENT The health interview questionnaire consists of a core of questions concerning items about which information has been collected each year. These basic items include acute conditions and injuries, chronic conditions, days of disability due to acute or chronic conditions, limitation of activity caused by chronic conditions or impair\u00ad ment, hospitalization, and the social, economic, and demographic characteristics of the inter- viewed sample persons. During recent years, medical care provided by physicians and dental care have become core items. Information on certain other health-related items has been collected in the survey periodi\u00ad cally, usually at intervals from 2 to 5 years. In the early years of the survey, these topics were described as rotating items and consisted of measures such as mobility limitation due to chronic ilIness, dental care, and the proportion of hospital bills paid by insurance. As the survey developed, there was an increasing demand for more detailed information about some of the core items, such as detailed data on types of injuries, the duration of activity limitation, the accessibility of physicians' services, and conva\u00ad lescence folIowing hospitalization. The need for this information led to the expansion of certain areas of the basic questionnaire to provide for the collection of these data at periodic intervals, introducing a slightIy different category of rotating items. In addition, the questionnaire for a given year has usuaUy included one or more special supple\u00ad ments. While most of the supplements were originally planned for a l-year collection period, some of them deal with topics for which trend information is needed. Since the interview is the most efficient method of collecting this type of data, certain items are added to the basic questionnaire on a planned schedule. These items, which might be described as rotating supplements, include such topics as smoking habits, health insurance coverage, X-ray ex\u00ad posure, home care, the use of special aids, and personal health expenses. Other supplements, particularly those dealing with specific chronic conditions or impairments, have been added to the questionnaire on a less regular basis. This arrangement of expanded core items, rotating items, and supplements allows the survey to respond to changing needs for data and to cover a greater variety of topics, and at the same time provide for continuous informa\u00ad tion on certain fundamental topics. History of Questionnaire Format During the planning phase of the interview survey in 1956-57, two general questionnaire formats were considered. The one referred to as \"alternative B\" was designed to elicit informa\u00ad tion about conditions through the reporting of actions a person might have to take as a result of illness. For example, a respondent would be asked if he had to (1) cut out or reduce all or part of his activities regularly or from time to time, (2) change his activities, (3) change his diet, (4) take medicine or treatment over a long period of time, or (5) wear or use some special device. After a positive response to any of the above statements, the respondent would be asked, \"What was the matter?\" While the original intent of this proposed format was to elicit information about chronic conditions, the same general approach was applicable to both chronic and acute conditions. The other format, the one actually used during the first 10 years of the Health Interview Survey (July 1957-June 1967), provided for the reporting of all kinds of morbidity conditions through a series of direct questions designed to encourage the reporting of illnesses and injuries. In contrast to alternative B, no attempt at the time the condition was initially reported was made to determine if some action had been taken by the person because of the condition. This format was used to maximize the number of conditions reported regardless of their impact or severity and to apply the criteria of medical attention, restricted activity, or limitation of activity during the coding and transcribing of the collected data. The selection of this questionnaire format, which is usually identified as the condition approach, was influenced by its general accept\u00ad ance in earlier health surveys. Illness-recall questions, which had been formulated and used successfully in the collection of health data in earlier surveys, served as a prototype for the first questionnaire used in the Health Interview Survey. Using a tested collection procedure made it possible to begin the interviewing phase of the survey much earlier than would have been the case if a completely untested procedure such as alternative B had been adopted. The wording of the introduction to the illness-probe questions\u2014\"We are interested in all kinds of illness, whether serious or not\"\u00ad indicates the comprehensive nature of this section of the questionnaire. These questions were structured to elicit information about any departure from a state of physical or mental well-being resulting from disease or injury, that is, a morbidity condition. The questions that were limited to occurrences during the last week or the week before were designed primarily to aid in the reporting of acute conditions. MI reported conditions were recorded regardless of which type of question had prompted the reply. Whether these conditions were chronic was established later in the interview on the basis of a series of questions relating to the nature of the disease and its duration. During the succeeding years of the interview survey, the section of the questionnaire dealing with acute and chronic illness underwent certain changes. Progressive experience in survey collec\u00ad tion procedures on the part of the Health Interview Survey staff and the findings produced from continuing studies on survey methodology led to periodic changes, which in turn led to some improvement in the reporting of illness by the respondent. These changes included varia\u00ad tions in the order in which illness-recall ques\u00ad tions were asked, introduction of a small calendar outlining the recall period for the convenience of the respondent, restructuring of 9 the checklists of chronic diseases and impair\u00ad ments, the identification of the condition(s) causing either limitation of activity or limitation of mobility, and format changes to accommo\u00ad date revised data-processing procedures. Despite these changes in the questionnaire, certain kinds of health-related information con\u00ad tinued to be underreported in the survey, although to a lesser extent than in the first years of the survey when, on the basis of research studies comparing interview data with medical records, it had been established that chronic conditions were not completely reported in the interview. For example, the prevalence of selected chronic conditions has increased with changes in the questionnaire formats. Early in 1963, after 6 years of data collection and in accordance with a long-range plan set up during the early years of the survey, a general evaluation of the design and format of the survey was undertaken. A timetable was pre- pared, which provided for considering proposed changes, deciding whether to accept, reject, or modify the proposed changes, and pretesting and evaluating the approved changes. A target date of July 1, 1967, was established for the completion of the evaluation and for the intro\u00ad duction of any new procedures in the collection phase of the survey. During the 4-year evaluative period 1963-67, the ongoing survey continued in line with collection procedures developed during the early years of the survey. Evaluation of the survey in terms of questionnaire content and format led to major changes that were introduced in July 1967. The new questionnaire introduced as a data- collection instrument in July 1967 resembled the approach suggested by the alternative B method of data collection considered at the beginning of the interview survey. The illness- recall questions, with a 2-week reference period, were replaced with probe questions pertaining to health-related actions during the period-for example, cutting down on usual activities, spending days in bed, losing time from work or school, or seeking medical attention. Informa\u00ad tion about conditions responsible for such actions was obtained from persons with positive response to the health-related action-probe questions. Methodological studies, which had been conducted since the beginning of the survey, showed that chronic conditions are generally underreported in interviews. They also indicated that the expansion of a checklist of chronic conditions to include as many descriptive titles as possible will increase the probability of a person reporting a condition, assuming that he is aware of its existence. These findings led to the decision to restrict the collection of prevalence data on chronic conditions to specific types of conditions during a given collection year. This change in collection procedure was independent of the approach suggested by the alternative B method of data collection. However, since both procedural changes were experimental during the collection year July 1967-June 1968, they were tested on the new questionnaire introduced in the field. Concentrating on a group of chronic condi\u00ad tions involving a specific system of the body (e.g., those affecting the digestive system) rather than on the entire spectrum of chronic condi\u00ad tions not only improves the quality of response but also permits the collection of more detailed diagnostic information related to that body system. The survey plan calls for the collection of different types of conditions each year, so that within 5 or 6 years after the initiation of this plan, information on the prevalence of virtually all chronic conditions will have been obtained. Once the decision had been made to modify the collection procedure for chronic conditions by emphasizing a specific type of condition during a given year, it was necessary to develop, at the same time, procedures that would provide comparable data for other measures of morbid\u00ad ity that had been derived previously from data collected on all types of chronic conditions. One of these measures, the number of persons with limitation of activity (long-term disability), had previously been generated by consolidating the data on activity limitation attributable to specific chronic conditions reported by an indi\u00ad vidual to represent the activity limitation status of that individual. The most obvious alternative to this consolidation was to build a person-data foundation in terms of the degree of activity limitation and then ascertain the conditions 10 responsible for the activity limitation status of the individual. The Basic Questionnaire The many procedural changes in the format and administration of the questionnaire during the course of the survey preclude a discussion of the content according to the sequence of the interview. For this reason, the description of the changes that have occurred will be presented on a topical basis covering the major areas of the questionnaire. Social, economic, and demopaphic character\u00ad istics. \u2014After the interviewer identifies herself as a representative of the Bureau of the Census, the agency that serves as collection agent for the interview survey, she verifies the address as the one assi~ed on the first page of the question\u00ad naire and then starts the interview by asking questions to determine the social, economic, and demographic characteristics of the sample persons. Since the beginning of the survey, many changes in the wording of the questions designed to elicit this type of information have been made in order to improve their specificity and to increase the accuracy of the information obtained (figure 1). The transferring of questions relating to education, military service, employment, and marital status to a later section of the interview, as indicated by the numbering of the questions in the 1974 ques\u00ad tionnaire, made it possible to obtain data on health-related items nearer the beginning of the interview. Questions on personal characteristics that have been added, deleted, or included on an irregular basis follow: 1. PIace of birth was asked for fiscal years 1958 and 1959 only. 2. Current activity status was added as a basic item to the questionnaire beginning in fiscal year 1960. 3. Questions relating to occupation and industry were included in the questionnaire for fiscal years 1962 and 1963 and were incorporated as a continuing item beginning in fiscal year 1966. 4. During calendar years 1968 and 1969, the question on income status was expanded to obtain information about the receipt of public assistance, relief, or weIfare pay\u00ad ments to any of the family members. 5. On the calendar year 1973 and 1974 questionnaires, an attempt was made to check the accuracy of the questions on age and income by ascertaining the year of birth and the amount of income for each family member. 6. During calendar year 1973, information on the number of times married was obtained for all persons who had ever been married. Illness and injury recalL-Because of the new approach in eliciting information on acute and chronic conditions introduced during the interim period, July 1967-December 1968, it is necessary to divide the description of the de\u00ad velopment of the illness-recall questions into two chronological periods: (1) the first 10 years of the survey, ending in June 1967, and (2) the foIlowing years beginning in July 1967 and continuing through calendar year 1974. 1. July 1957-June 1967: From a comparison of the illness and injury recall for fiscal years 1958 and 1967, it becomes obvious that several changes in questionnaire format occurred (figure 2). During the introduction to the probe questions in the later questionnaire, the respon\u00ad dent was given a small calendar on which the 2-week period referred to in the succeeding questions was outlined in red. This innovation was introduced on the fiscal year 1965 question\u00ad naire to aid the respondent in identifying the reference period for all \"2-week questions.\" Minor changes in wording and emphasis were made to stress the reference period and the presence of recurrent or seasonal conditions. A revision of the checklists of chronic condi\u00ad tions and impairments and the division of cards A and B into two parts were initiated on the fiscal year 1966 questionnaire and retained during fiscal year 1967. These changes were made in an effort to increase the reporting of chronic illness, an area of underreporting that had been identified by methodological studies conducted since the beginning of the survey. 2. July 1967-December 1974: As described earlier, the questionnaire introduced as a data- collection instrument in July 1967 resembled 11 ------- ------------------ ---- -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- -------------------- -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -1- male, listed. ask \"AW IWu:+dd murAtIshiP ml... 20 f.

Questions relating to illness and injury recall, fiscal years 1958 and 1967. 13 the approach suggested by the alternative B method of collection considered at the beginning of the survey. The illness and injury recal questions, with a 2-week reference period, were replaced with questions pertaining to health-related actions taken during the reference period. Information about conditions respon\u00ad sible for such actions was obtained from persons giving positive responses to these questions (figures 3aand 3b). The 18-month period, July 1967-December 1968, was considered as a trial period for the new \"person\" approach in data collection. Because of this decision, it was felt that informa\u00ad tion on one-half of the sample population should be collected on the new questionnaire and that information on the other half should be elicited by means of the \"condition\" approach used in the first 10 years of the survey. Estimates based on the two samples are described and compared in Vital and Health Statistics report, Series 2, Number 4811. It was found that no drastic changes in levels and relationships of health measures resulted from the adoption of the \"person\" approach. The designation of these 18 months as an interim experimental period made it possible for re- visions to be made during this time by adding, deleting, or rewording questions. It also pro\u00ad vided for an orderly transfer of the data-collec\u00ad tion period for a given questionnaire from a fiscal to a calendar year basis (beginning in January 1969). This change in the collection period was initiated in order to make the data from the interview survey more comparable to other health-related statistics. During the interim period, two new areas were added to the 2-week recall questions in an attempt to elicit certain kinds of conditions: one related to dental visits for the treatment of oral conditions and the other was directed to hospitalization during the 2-week period for emergency or other types of care. However, neither of these areas produced a sufficient number of reportable conditions to justify including them on a permanent basis; the dental probe question relating to conditions was dropped from the questionnaire for calendar year 1971, and the hospital probe question was deleted on the calendar year 1970 questionnaire. Other revisions in the illness recall area during the trial period, shown in figure 4, included (1) the expansion of the introduction to the 2-week recall questions to inform the respondent of the purpose of the survey, the areas of questioning, and the beginning and concluding dates of the period outlined on the calendar, (2) the re- arrangement of questions relating to disability caused by reportable conditions to obtain infor\u00ad mation on work- and school-loss days prior to information on activity-restricting days, and (3) an addition in the area of 2-week physician visits to elicit illnesses due to pregnancy. All of these three changes in format proved to be quite effective and have remained practically unchanged through 1974. A gradual decline in the number of injuries reported in the survey during the late 1960's and during 1970 led to the addition of a specific area related to injury recall on the calendar years 1971-74 questionnaires. The decision to restrict the collection of prevalence data to specific types of chronic con\u00ad ditions during a given collection year was imple\u00ad mented by the collection of data on digestive conditions during the interim period July 1967- December 1968. The collection schedule for this type of information during succeeding years follows: Calendar year 1969-Conditions of the bones, joints, muscles, and skin Calendar year 1970-Conditions of the res\u00ad piratory system Calendar year 197 l-Impairments Calendar year 1972-Conditions of the cardio\u00ad vascular system CaIendar year 1973-Conditions affecting the nervous system, glandular disorders, and conditions of the genitourinary system Calendar year 1974-No chronic condition list The specific conditions and illnesses included for each of these are shown in appendix IV.

Questions relating to illness and injury recall, as revised during tha interim period July 1867-Decamber 1888. (see figure 5). Questions in table I were designed to elicit information relating to (1) whether the condition had ever been attended by a 'physician, (2) the most accurate description the respondent could give about the nature of the condition, (3) days of restricted activity, bed disability, and work- or school-loss days caused by the condition, and (4) certain facts about the onset of the condition to determine whether it was acute or chronic. The principal change in this portion of the questionnaire through fiscal year 1965 was not in the wording of the specific questions in the table, but in the interviewers' instructions included in the heading of the table. These instructions were expanded in the questionnaires for fiscal years 1960 and 1961 and were then unchanged through fiscal year 1965. In the computer processing of the data for fiscal years 1966 and 1967, a photographic process, identified as FOSDIC: was used by the Bureau of the Census, the agency that carried out the statistical processing of the interview data through fiscal year 1968. With this pro\u00ad cedure, it was not feasible to use the question\u00ad naire table I format, so each reported condition was carried through a separate \"condition page,\" which also included questions on accidents 'Filmed Optical Sensing Device for Input to Computers. resulting in injury and on activity and mobility limitation. The wording of the questions relating to conditions and the interviewers' instructions were not changed to a great extent, but the questionnaire format was quite different. The \"condition page\" concept has been continued through calendar year 1974. With the introduction of restricting the collec\u00ad tion of information on chronic conditions to those affecting a specific system (beginning in July 1967), it was felt that the amount of data relating to the history, treatment, and develop\u00ad ment of such conditions should be increased. Since the new \"person approach\" called for the collection of information on activity and mobil\u00ad ity limitation on a person basis, as described earlier, the questions relating to limitation were transferred to another area on the questionnaire, and detailed information on specific chronic conditions was obtained by adding a section identified as AA to each condition page. Section M was revised to some extent during the trial period (July 1967-December 1968) and has remained as an integral part of the condition page through calendar year 1973 (figure 6). Limitation of activsly.-During the first 8 years of the survey, through June 1965, infor\u00ad mation on limitation of activity due to chronic conditions was obtained from questions at the end of questionnaire table I.

She was then asked to select the degree of limitation that was most descriptive of the sample person (figure 7). By means of interviewer instructions keyed to the duration of conditions and check- lists of conditions, these questions were limited to those persons for whom chronic conditions are questions on accidents resulting in injury, which appear in were reported. The respondent was then asked to identify the reported condition(s) that caused the specific degree of activity Imitation. During the period July 1965-June 1967, the questions remained virtually unchanged, but the transfer in format from questionnaire table I to the \"condition page\" led to a corresponding change in the format of the questions on limitation of activity.

In the questionnaire format adopted in JuIy 1967, the restriction regarding the presence of chronic condition(s) was removed, and questions relating to the degree of activity limitation were asked for all sample persons. This change was necessary because it was no Ionger possible to derive complete estimates of limitation status from previously reported conditions when only specific body systems were included in the checklists of chronic conditions. Other major changes in administering the questions relating to activity limitation were as follows: (1) instead of asking the respondent to select the appropri\u00ad ate limitation status from a printed card, the interviewer read the options to the respondent, and (2) the questions relating to the usual activ\u00ad ity of the sample persons were moved from the section on personal characteristics to an area immediately preceding the limitation of activity questions. The latter change was necessary because the options from which the respondent selects the appropriate Imitation status are keyed to the usual activity of the sample person (figure 8). During the 18-month period ending in Decem\u00ad ber 1968, many changes were made in the word\u00ad ing, format, and arrangement of the questions on limitation of activity, The interviewing prob\u00ad lems and data-processing difficulties were not completely resolved until 1970 when a satisfac\u00ad tory series of questions was obtained. Unlike other health-related items, such as physician or dental visits that are objective by nature, limita\u00ad tion of activity represents an opinion or attitude on the part of the respondent. Because the questions require a subjective judgment by the respondent, even minor changes in the wording or the sequence of the questions may cause marked variation in response. The format used in the questionnaire fielded in January 1970 has been retained with few changes through December 1974. During fiscal years 1960 and 1961, informa\u00ad tion on the duration of limitation of activity was obtained for all persons who were either unable to carry on their usual activity or limited in the amount or kind of usual activity, In addition, those 17 years or over were asked if they had been working up until the time the limitation started. Questions relating to the duration of limitation of activity were not asked again until January 1969. During that year, all persons with any degree of limitation were asked: About how long has he: Been limited in._. Been unable to Had to go to a certain type of school? H Less than 1 month _ months \u2014 years This question has continued to be on the questionnaire through December 1973. Hospitalization. -Similar to the procedure used in recording illness and injury, questions on hospitalization are asked in two stages: (1) hospitalization recall questions asked during the early part of the interview (figure 9) and (2) questions regarding the cause, duration, and place of hospitalization. Changes in format for recording information on hospitalizations are also quite similar to those for recording illness data in that an area of questionnaire table II (see figure 10), analogous to questionnaire table I, was used during the fiscal years 1958-65, and a hospital page, comparable to the condition page, has been used during fiscal year 1966 through calendar year 1974. An early methodological study, the findings of which were published in Vital and Health Statistics report, Series 2, Number 7,4 revealed that hospitalizations during the year prior to the week of interview are underreported in the household interview. In an attempt to improve the completeness and accuracy of reporting, the following two major changes were made in the hospitalization recall area: (1) an additional question, inserted for fiscal year 1961 and retained thereafter, reminds the interviewer to inquire about hospitalizations for deliveries when a child under 1 year of age is listed as a household member, and (2) beginning in fiscal year 1963, there was a change in the time reference for the recall questions. This latter change consisted of the addition of an extra period of recall extending the period to the 1st of the month preceding the 12-month period prior to interview. For example, respondents 21 ---- ------------------------------------- ------------------ ------------------------------------------------------ -------------- -- ---------------------------------- ------------------- ---------------------------------------------------- MOST OF WE 12 MONTHS -wt., t.

Recall questions relating to hospitalization, fiscal year 1958 and calendar year 1974. interviewed during July 1963 were asked about hospitalizations occurring since June 1, 1962. However, only hospitalizations within the 12- month period were used for the derivation of estimates for hospital episodes. These revisions have continued with only minor wording changes through December 1974 (figure 9). The wording in questionnaire table II, deal\u00ad ing with the cause, duration, and place of hospitalization , remained virtually unchanged from July 1958 through June 1965 (figure 10). However, the instructions to the interviewer pertaining to the administration of this area of the questionnaire were expanded in order to increase their specificity. In keeping with the format change from questionnaire table II to the \"hospital page,\" to accommodate the FOSDIC method of data processing in fiscal years 1966 and 1967, the hospital page has been retained on the questionnaire through December 1974 with only minor changes in question location and interviewer instructions (figure 11). During the period January 1968 through December 1970, a question was added to ascertain if the hospital episode was the first admission for the designated cause of hospitali\u00ad zation. This question was not retained because it was confusing to the respondent and the information obtained was of questionable value. During certain years of the survey, either questionnaire table II or the \"hospital page\" has been expanded to obtain information on topics specifically related to hospitalizations. These topics-the portions of the hospital and/ or surgical bills paid by insurance and convales\u00ad cence following hospitalization-were not planned originally as rotating items. However, their importance and timeliness have led to their inclusion on a rotating basis. Questions pertaining to the part of the bill paid by insurance were asked during fiscal years 1959, 1960, 1964, 1967, and 1968 (figure 12). During the years 1959, 1960, and 1964, the questions relating to insurance cover- 23 -- Oul ., 0,. + *_ _- A \u2014- :: A &m.. d ..m mm. rj Y.. laN.

Questions on the \"hospital page;' calandar year 1974. age were comparatively simple and straight- forward. In fiscal year 1967, an attempt was made to determine- the actu~ sources ;f pay\u00ad ment and the amount paid by each source. The information obtained was found to be incom\u00ad plete and of questionable accuracy since many respondents did not have records available or had never been informed about the sources or amounts of payment. Nevertheless, the same format was continued during fiscal year 1968. Since the period July-December 1968 was a part of the experimental period for the \"person approach\" method of data collection, it was felt that a new format on insurance payments could be tested during that period. As a result, the source options, as shown in figure 12, were combined into four groups, but the questions were further complicated by the addition of questions pertaining to surgical bills. During this period, the information was collected on a supplemental document to the questionnaire. The data collected on this topic durinq 1967 and 1968 did not provide ade\u00ad quate-information for the derivation of reliable estimates. During calendar year 1972, the most recent year for which data on hospitzd expense have been collected, information on the actual amount of payment for the hospital stay was limited to that paid by the family (out-of- pocket expense). By returning to the concept used in the early years of the survey, informa\u00ad tion was elicited about the proportion of the bill paid by insurance. To obtain information on the sources of payment, the respondent was handed card H and was asked to select those sources that had paid any part of the hospital bill. The options on card H, which were much more definitive than those on the 1967 questionnaire, consisted of the following: 1. Total or partial payment by self or family 2.

Supplementary questions pertaining to con\u00ad valescence following hospitalization were added to the survey questionnaire during fiscal years 1961 and 1967, and during the interim period, July 1967-December 1968 (figure 13). In 1961, only those persons who had undergone surgery, had a child, or had a fracture set were asked -the convalescence questions that were - added to hospital table II.

Questions relating to convalescence following hospitalization, fiscal years 1961 and 1967, and calendar year two items of information about the conva\u00ad lescence were obtained: (1) the number of davs before a person returned to his usual ac~ivities full ti~e after he left the hospital, and (2) for a person still unable to pursue his usual activities, the number of days since he was discharged from the hospital. During the interim period July 1967-December 1968, this area of the cmestionnaire was administered to all persons 55 years of age and older for each hospital discharge during the year prior to interview. In addition, information was obtained on place of convalescence, number of days spent in bed, and number of days con- FY 195S fined to the house following discharge from the hospital. Accidents resulting in injury. \u2014During the interview, injuries due to accidents are usually reported in response to the illness and injury recall questions. From July 1957 through June 1967, there were specific recall questions re- Iating to injuries occurring during the 2 weeks prior to interview week and to the presence of >ffects of old injuries. Through 'fiscal year 1965, in addition to entering each injury on a separate line in table I of the questionnaire, the interviewer also completed for each injury a \"table A,\" which described the class and TABLE A (Accidents and Iniuri.s) Lls&No. 1.

Essentially the same information needed to classify the injury was obtained each year. However, the questions on the 1965 questionnaire were more specific and more detailed than those on the 1958 document. Beginning in July 1965, the equivalent of ques\u00ad tionnaire table A, a section on each condition page, was completed if an injury was reported. The questions on the condition page were worded quite similarly to those on questionnaire table A, and this same format has been used through De\u00ad cember 1974 (figure 15).

Questions on the \"condition pagan which relate to accidental injury, calendar year 1973 (first part of this page is shown in Figure 6). As in other areas of the questionnaire, the section describing accidents resulting in injury has been expanded during certain years of the survey in order to obtain detailed information on acci\u00ad dents. During calendar years 1969 and 1970, a question relating to objects causing accidents or injuries was added. In fiscal years 1960 and 1961, and again in calendar years 1971 and 1972, this area of the questionnaire was extended to obtain information on the circumstances of the accident and the resulting injury (figure 16). While the questions for the two collection periods were quite simikr, the format differed slightly. During both periods, the classification of the type of accident was made by the interviewer on the basis of the description and details provided by the respondent. Physician Visits. -Two types of information on physician visits are collected in the survey. One, the number of visits to a physician during the 2-week period prior to the week of the interview, is used to derive estimates of the total number of visits during the year for which the questionnaire is administered. The other, number of visits dur\u00ad ing the year prior to the interview and/or the length of time since a physician was seen, is the basis for estimates of frequency distributions of the population according to the annual number of physician visits (excluding hospital patient visits) and according to the interval since the physician was last seen. The development of the question\u00ad naire area on medical attention from fiscal year 1958 through fiscal year 1964 is shown in figure 17. While information on physician visits during the 2 weeks prior to interview is usually consid\u00ad ered as a basic core item in the survey, it has not been collected continuously in the survey. During fiscal years 1960-63, 1965, and the first half of 1966, no data on physician visits were collected. (January-June 1966 data were collected as a sup\u00ad plement. See Vital and Health Statistics, Series 10-Number 49, p. 4.) However, in January 1968, when the person approach method of data collec\u00ad tion was introduced for the recalI of illness and injury, recent medical attention (during the 2 weeks prior to interview) was established as a necessary continuing item and thus became apart of the basic core of questions. While the informa\u00ad tion on annual visits and the interval since last physician visit is not required for the person ap- 29 L . . .------- ..\".

In a similar format to that for conditions, injuries, and hospitalizations, questions relating to medical attention are asked in two stages: (1) the recall of visits fairly early in the inter- view and (2) the circumstances of the visit on the \"doctor visit\" page. This format, which has been in general use since fiscal year 1967, is shown as it appears on the questionnaire for calendar year 1974 (figure 18). During several years of the survey, the \"doctor \\isit\" page has been expanded to include questions on related items. From July 1966 through December 1968, information was elicited on the amount of the bill (or expected bill) for each physician visit during the 2 weeks prior to week of interview. In calendar year 1969, the following three questions pertaining to the availability of medical care were added: 1. About how long did it take to get there for the visit? 2. Did have an appointment for that visit? 3. Once he got there, about how long did wait to see the doctor? During calendar year 1972, a complete page was included in the questionnaire to obtain information on the most recent physician visit during the past 12 months for all persons who had not seen a physician during the 2-week period prior to week of interview (figure 19). An additional question was included on the doctor visit page during 1974 to determine if the respondent's blood pressure was taken dur\u00ad ing the visit. This question was in conjunction with a special supplement on hypertension that was administered to respondents in 1974. Dental visits. -Dunng the first 10 years of the survey, questions regarding dental visits were on the questionnaire only during fiscal years 1958, 1959, and 1964. Information about dental care during the 2 weeks prior to week of interview was elicited for all 3 years. 32 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- --------------------------------------- --- ------------------------------- ----------------------------- -------RECALL QUESTIONS \\ d.

Format of the \"1 2-months doctor visits page: calendar year 1972. 1 In addition, information about the interval since last dental visit was obtained in fiscal years 1958 and 1964, and about the frequency of dental visits during the past 12 months in fiscal year 1959 (figure 20). Information about dental visits during the 2-week period prior to the week of interview became a standard item in calendar year 1968 and has been used through December 1974, From responses to these questions, it was possible to derive estimates of the total number of dental visits made during the year. During calendar year 1968, with the new \"person approach\" on illness recall, an addi\u00ad tional question was added to the 2-week dental section for the purpose of eliciting oral or dental conditions. These questions were re\u00ad tained through caIendar year 1970. The 1971 FY 1958 questionnaire included questions relating to the type of dental service received. During calendar years 1970-74, data were collected that pro\u00ad vided estimates relating to the interval since the last dental visit and the frequency of visits during the 12 months prior to the interview. During 2 years of the survey, fiscal year 1958 and calendar year 1971, a question that provided information relating to edentulous persons was added to the questionnaire. During 1958 a single question, \"Is there anyone in the family who has lost all of his teeth?\" elicited this kind of information. During 1971, this question was followed by additional ones per\u00ad taining to ownership, use, and adequacy of upper and/or lower dentures (figure 21.)

During the first 4 years of the survey, fiscal years 1958-61, a single question regarding mobility limitation was asked at the end of question\u00ad naire table I (figure 22). This question was asked only for those persons for whom some degree of activity limitation had been reported. During the period July 1964 through June 1967, the next interval during which mobility Imitation data were collected, this restriction was removed and all persons with one or more chronic conditions were queried about their ability to move about; also, a question pertain\u00ad ing to the cause of the limitation was added. In keeping with the introduction of the \"con\u00ad dition page\" in July 1965, the format of this question changed but the wording remained essentially the same through June 1967. During calendar year 1971, a concerted effort was made to obtain definitive information on mobility limitation. Instead of asking the respondent to select the appropriate statement from a card, the interviewer read the options to the respondent and recorded the most suit- able degree of limitation for each sample Ila. Is thrre gnyone in the family who has lost ALL of hfs teeth? b. Who is this? Anyone lse? For each person with \"NO teeth,\" ask c, Does have false teeth? d, Does have n upper plate, a lower plate, or both? ---_ --_------------------a the upper :----------------------------------------------------person. this procedure produced inconsistent results; therefore, a modified flash- card version was used again in 1972 (figure 23). Control items.-At the completion of the health interview, the interviewer turns to page 1 of the survey questionnaire to ask certain questions about the living quarters in the sample household. The front page of the questionnaire serves the following purposes: (1) to provide space for a record of the calls made to obtain the interview and the Iength of the completed interview; (2) to obtain information about the size of the place and the annual amount of produce, data that are necessary in classifying the sample persons by place of residence (farm, nonfarm, etc.); (3) to record the number of rooms in the home (not all years); (4) to record the telephone number in case additional information is needed later by the interviewer; and (5) to provide information regarding the reason for noninterview in those assigned households where no interview was conducted.

Questions releting to limitation of mobility, calendar year 19 included on the covering page. In most pages, or table A on accidents and injuries, to instances, these items were added to remind determine if appropriate supplements had been the interviewer to check certain areas of the completed for persons with conditions that questionnaire, such as table I, the condition requ;red supplements for a specific year. In 38 calendar year 1970, during which the collec\u00ad tion of prevalence data on chronic conditions was limited to those affecting the respiratory system, a household item relating to the type of heating and air conditioning in the home was added to the first page of the question\u00ad naire. Supplements to the Basic Questionnaire Supplements to the questionnaire used in the Health Interview Survey are of the follow\u00ad ing two types: (1) rotating supplements, de- fined as those on the same general topic that have appeared during more than one collection interval, and (2) one-time or single supple\u00adments, described as those that have appeared during a single collection interval. As pre\u00ad viously noted, some of the rotating supple\u00ad ments were included according to a planned schedule; others, originally intended as one- time items, became rotating supplements when their timeliness and importance indicated a need for trend data. In table B, the special supplements are out- lined according to type of supplement and the period during which data were collected. Some of the supplements were included within the format of the basic questionnaire, while others were on separate documents. In appendixes and II, the actual configuration of the supple\u00ad ments is shown. Table B.

It results from a positive response to one of a series of \"medical-disability impact\" or \"illness-recall\" questions. In the coding and tabulating process conditions are selected or classified according to a number of different criteria such as whether they were medically attended, whether they resulted in disability, or whether they were acute or chomic; or according to the type of disease, injury, impairment, or symptom reported. For the purposes of each published report or set of tables, ordy those conditions recorded on the questionnaire that satisfy cer\u00ad tain stated criteria are included. Conditions except impairments are classified by type according to the Eighth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, Adapted for Use in the United States, 18 with certain modifications adopted to make the code more suitable for a household interview survey. Acute condition.-An acute condition is de- fined as a condition that has lasted less than 3 months and that has involved either medical procedures used to estimate incidence, the acute conditions included in this report are the conditions that had their onset during the 2 weeks prior to the interview week and that involved either medical attention or restricted activity during that 2-week period. However, certain conditions are aIways classified as chronic regardless of onset (see list under the definition of chronic condition). Acute condition groups. -In this report aIl tables that have data classified by type of condition employ a five-category regrouping plus several selected subgroups (Table I). Chronic condition.-A condition is con\u00ad sidered chronic if (1) the condition is described by the respondent as having been first noticed more than 3 months bef ore the week of the interview or (2) it is one of the conditions listed below that are always considered chronic regardless of the date of onset. Allergy, any Arthritis or rheumatism Asthma Cancer Cleft palate Clubfoot Condition present since birth Deafness or serious trouble with hearing Diabetesattention or restricted activity. Because of the ~ Epilepsy ~~e defifitiom show in this report are those used in CY Hardening of the arteries 1973 reports. Some of the definitions have been modified Hay fever through the years to improve clarity and to reflect minor Heart trouble methodological changes. Hemorrhoids or piles NOTE-A Iist of references follows the text. Hernia or rupture 127 Table 1.

Table 11. Chronic condition groups and the International Classification code numbers included in each category Condition causing activitv limitation International Classification coda number Tuberculosis, allforms .................. Impairments (except and absence) of upper extremities and shoulders ......................................... Impairments (except paralysis and absence) of lower extremities and hips .............................................. Condition not specified: Old age Other Im~az?ment.-Impairments are chronic or permanent defects, usually static in nature, resulting from disease, injury, or congenital malformation. They represent decrease or loss of ability to perform various functions, par\u00ad ticularly those of the musculoskeletal system and the sense organs. All impairments are classified by means of a special supplementary code for impairments. Hence, code numbers for impairments in the International Classijlca\u00ad tion of Diseases are not used. In the Supple\u00ad mentary Code, impairments are grouped according to type of functional impairment and etiology. The impairment classification is shown in Vital and Health Statistics, Series 10, Number 87,19 Prevalence of conditions.-In general, preva\u00ad lence of conditions is the estimated number of conditions of a specified type existing specified time or the average number existing during a specified interval ;f time. The prev; lence of chronic conditions is defined as the number of chronic cases reported to be present or assumed to be present at the time of the interview. Those assumed to be present at the time of the interview are cases described by the respondent in terms of one of the diseases on the list of conditions always considered chronic (see definition of chronic condition above) and reported to have been present at some time during the 12-month period prior to the interview. Incidence of conditions.-The incidence of conditions is the estimated number of condi\u00ad tions having their onset in a specified time period. As previously mentioned, minor acute conditions involving neither restricted activity nor medical attention are excluded from the 129 statistics. The incidence data shown in some reports are further limited to various subclasses of conditions, such as \"incidence of conditions involving bed disability.\" Onset of condition.-A condition is con\u00ad sidered to have had its onset when it was first noticed. This could be the time the person first felt sick or became injured, or it could be the time when the person or his family was first told by a physician that he had a condition of which he was previously unaware. Persons with chronic conditions.-The esti\u00ad mated number of persons with chronic condi\u00ad tions is based on the number of persons who at the time of the interview were reported to have one or more chronic conditions. Activity-restricting condition.-An activity- restricting condition is one that had its onset in the past 2 weeks and that caused at least 1 day of restricted activity curing the 2 calendar weeks before the interview week. (See \"Re\u00ad stricted-activity day\" under \"Terms Relating to Disability.\") Bed-disabling condition.-A condition with onset in the past 2 weeks involving at least 1 day of bed disability is called a bed-disabling condition. (See \"Bed-disability day\" under \"Terms Relating to Disability.\") Medically attended condition.-A condition wkh onset in the past 2 weeks is considered medically attended if a physician has been consulted about it either at its onset or at any time thereafter. However, when the first medical attention for a condition does not occur until after the end of the 2-week period, the case is treated as though there was no medical attention. Medical attention includes consultation either in person or by telephone for ' treatment or advice. Advice from the physician transmitted to the patient through the nurse is counted as well as visits to physicians in clinics or hospitals. If during the course of a single visit the physician is con\u00ad sulted about more than one condition for each of several patients, each condition of each patient is counted as medically attended. Discussions of a child's condition by the physician and a responsible member of the household are considered as medical attention even if the child was not seen at that time. For the purpose of this definition, the term \"physician \" includes doctors of medicine and osteopathic physicians. Terms Relating to Disability Disability.- Disability is the general term used to describe any temporary or long-term reduction of a person's activity as a result of an acute or chornic condition. Disability &y.-Short-term disability days are classified according to whether they are days of restricted activity, bed days, hospital days, work-loss days, or school-Ioss days. All hospital days are, by definition, days of bed disability; all days of bed disability are, by definition, days of restricted activity. The con- verse form of these statements is, of course, not true. Days lost from work and days lost from school are special terms that appIy to the working and school-age populations only, but these too are days of restricted activity. Hence, \"days of restricted activity\" is the most inclu\u00ad sive term used to describe disability days. Restricted-activity day.-A day of restricted activity is one on which a person cuts down on his usual activities for the whole of that day because of an illness or an injury. The term \"usual activities\" for any day means the things that the person would ordinarily do on that day. For children under school age, usual activities depend on whatever the usual pattern is for the child's day, which will in turn be affected by the age of the child, weather conditions, and so forth. For retired or elderly persons, usual activities might consist of almost no activity, but cutting down on even a small amount for as much as a day would constitute restricted activity. On Sundays or holidays, usual activities are the things the person usually does on such days\u2014going to church, playing golf, visiting friends or relatives, or staying at home and listening to the radio, reading, watching television, and so forth. Persons who have permanently reduced their usual activities because of a chronic condition might not report any restricted-activity days during a 2-week period. Therefore, absence of restncted-activit y days does not imply normal health. 130 Restricted activity does not imply complete inactivity, but it does imply only the minimum of usual activities. A special nap for an hour after lunch does not constitute cutting down on usual activities, nor does the elimination of a heavy chore such as cleaning ashes out of the furnace or hanging out the wash. If a farmer or housewife carries on only the minimum of the day's chores, however, this is a day of restricted activity. A day spent\" in bed or a day home from work or school because of illness or injury is, of course, a restricted-activity day. Bed-disability day.-A day of bed disability is one on which a person stays in bed for all or most of the day because of a specific illness or injury. All or most of the day is defined as more than half of the daylight hours. All hospital days for inpatients are considered to be days of bed disability even if the patient was not actually in bed at the hospital. Work-1oss day.-A day lost from work is a day on which a person did not work at his job or business for at least half of his normal workday because of a specific illness or injury. The number of days lost from work is deter- mined only for persons 17 years of age and over who reported that at any time during the 2-week period covered by the interview they either worked at or had a job or business. (See \"Currently employed persons\" under \"llemo\u00ad graphic Terms.\") School-1oss day.-A day lost from school is a normal school day on which a child did not attend school because of a specific illness or injury. The number of days lost from school is determined only for children 6-16 years of age. Person-day. -Person-days of restricted activ\u00ad ity, bed disability, and so forth are days of the various forms of disability experienced by any one person. The sum of days for all persons in a group represents an unduplicated count of all days of disability for the group. Condition-day. -Condition-days of restricted activity, bed disability, and so forth are days of the various forms of disability associated with any one condition. Since any particular day of disability may be associated with more than one condition, the sum of days for conditions may add to more than the total number of person-days. Chronic activity limitation. -Persons arc classified into four categories according to the extent to which their activities are limited at present as a result of chronic conditions. Since the usual activities of preschool children, school-age children, housewives, and workers and other persons differ, a different set of criteria is used for each group. There is a general similarity between them, however, as will be seen in the following descriptions of the four categories: 1. Persons unable to carry on major activity for their group (major activity refers to ability to work, keep house, or engage in school or preschool activities). Preschool children: Inability to take part in\" ordinary play with other children. School-age children: Inability to go to school. Housewives: Inability to do any housework. Workers and all other persons: Inability to work at a job or business. 2..Persons limited in amount or kind of maior. activity performed (major activity refers\" to ability to work, keep house, or engage in school or preschool activities). Preschool children: Limited in amount or kind of play with other chiIdren, e.g., need special rest periods, cannot play strenuous games, or cannot play for long periods at a time. School-age children: Limited to certain types of schools or in school attendance, e.g., need special schools or special teaching or cannot go to school full time or for long periods at a time. Housewives: Limited in amount or kind of housework, e.g., cannot lift children, -wash or iron, or do housework for long periods at a time. Workers and all other persons: Limited in amount or kind of work, e.g., need special working aids or special rest periods at work, cannot work full time or for long periods at a time, or cannot do strenuous work. 131 3. Persons not limited in major activity but otherwise limited (major activity refers to ability to work, keep house, or engage in school or preschool activities). Preschool children: Not classified in this category. School-age children: Not limited in going to school but limited in participation in athletics or other extra- curricular activities. Housewives: Not limited in housework but limited in other activities such as church, clubs, hobbies, civic projects, or shopping. Workers and all other persons: Not limited in regular work activities but limited in other activities such as church, clubs, hobbies, civic projects, sports, or games. 4. Persons not limited in activities (includes persons whose activities are not limited in any of the ways described above). Chronic mobility limitation. -Persons are classified into the following five categories according to the extent to which their mobility is limited at present as a result of chronic conditions: 1. Stays z%bed. Must stay in bed all or most of the time. 2. Stays in the house. Must stay in the house, but not in bed, all or most of the time. 3. Needs help getting around. Able to go out- side but needs the help of another person or of a special aid such as a cane or wheelchair in getting around. 4. Has trouble getting around j?eely. Does not need the help of another person or a special aid but has trouble in getting around freely. 5. Is not limited in mobility. Not limited in any of the ways described above. Terms Relating to Persons Injured Injury condition.-An injury condition, or simply an injury, is a condition of the type that is classified according to the nature of injury code numbers (N800-N999) in the Inter- national Classification of Diseases. In addition to fractures, lacerations, contusions, burns, and so forth, which are commonly thought of as injuries, this group of codes includes effects of exposure, such as frostbite, adverse reactions to immunization and other medical procedures, and poisonings. Unless otherwise specified, the term \"injury\" is used to cover all of these. Since a person may sustain more than one injury in a single accident, e.g., a broken leg and laceration of the scalp, the number of injury conditions may exceed the number of persons injured. Statistics of acute injury conditions include only those injuries that involved at least 1 full day of restricted activity or medical attend\u00ad ance. Person injured.-A person injured is one who has sustained one or more injuries in an accident or in some type of nonaccidental violence. (See definition of injury condition.) Each time a person is involved in an accident or in nonaccidenta.1 violence causing injury that results in at least 1 full day of restricted activity or medical attention, he is included in the statistics as a separate person injured; hence, one person may be included more than once. The number of persons injured is not equiva\u00ad lent to the number of accidents for several reasons: (1) the term \"accident\" as commonly used may not' involve injury at all, (2) more than one injured person may be involved in a single accident, so the number of accidents resulting in injury would be less than the number of persons injured in accidents, and (3) the term \"accident\" ordinarily implies an accidental origin, whereas \"persons injured\" as used in the Health Interview Survey includes persons whose injuries resuIted from certain nonaccidental violence. The number of persons injured in a specified time interval is always equal to or less than the incidence of injury conditions, since one person may incur more than one injury in a single accident. Place of accident. -Persons injured are classi\u00ad fied according to the type of place where the injury occurred. 1. Home. The place of accident is considered as \"home\" if the injury occurred either inside or outside the home but within the property 132 boundaries. \"Home\" includes not only the person's own home but also any other home (vacant or occupied) in which he may have been when he was injured. \"Home\" includes any structure that has the primary function of a dwelling unit and includes the structure and premises of such places as apartment houses and house trailers. Inside the house: Includes any room, attic, cellar, porch, or steps leading to an entrance of the house. However, inside the garage is not con\u00ad sidered as inside the house. Outside the house: Includes the yard, driveway, garage, patio, gardens, or walks. On a farm, only the premises adjacent to the house are considered as part of the home. Injuries due to accidents occurring on cultivated land, in barns, or other similar farm buildings would not be considered home injuries. 2. Street or highway. \"Street or highway\" means the entire area between property lines of which any part is open for the use of the public as a matter or right or custom. It includes the roadway, shoulder, curb, or public sidewalk; excluded are private drive- ways, lanes, or sidewalks. 3. Farm. \"Farm\" as a place of accident refers to accidents occurring in farm buildings or on cultivated land but does not include accidents occurring in the farm home or premises. A ranch is considered a farm. 4. Industn\"al place. \"Industrial place\" is the term applied to accidents occurring in an industrial place or on the premises. Included are such places as factories, railway yards, warehouses, workshops, logging camps, shipping piers, oil fields, shipyards, sand and gravel pits, canneries, and auto repair garages. Construction projects such as houses, buildings, bridges, and new roads are included in this category. Buildings under- going remodeling, with the exception of private homes, are classified as industrial places or premises. 5. School. \"School\" as a place of accident includes all accidents occurring in school buildings or on the premises. This classifica\u00ad tion includes elementary schools, high schools, coHeges, and trade and business schools. 6. Place of recreation. \"Place of recreation\" is used to describe accidents occurring in places organized for sports and recre~tion other than recreational areas located at a place already defined as \"home,\" \"industrial place,\" or \"school.\" Bowling alley, amuse\u00ad ment park, football stadium, and dance hall are examples of \"place of recreation.\" In \"place of accident\" classification of injuries the place is significant rather than the activity in which the person was engaged at the time of accident. Hence, an injury sus\u00ad tained by a person at a dance hall while he was at work is classified as a \"place of recreation\" injury. Likewise, an injury occurring while a person was engaged in a sport in an industrial place is classified as an \"industrial place\" injury. 7. Other. Accidents that cannot be classified in any of the above groups or for which the place is unknown are classified as \"other.\" Included in the classification are such places as restaurants, churches, business and pro\u00ad fessional offices, and open or wooded country. Classzj?cation of injured persons by activity restn\"ction or medical attendance. \u2014The classifi\u00ad cation of injured persons by activity restriction or medical attendance is based on the classi\u00ad fication of the injury. (See definitions for activity-restricting injury, bed-disabling injury, work- or school-loss injury, and medicaUy attended injury.) For example, a person may have received severaI injuries in a single acci\u00ad dent; if one of the injuries involved 1 or more days of restricted activity, 1 or more days in bed, or medical attendance, the person injured would correspondingly be classified as with restricted activity, with bed disability, or medically attended. Actz%ity-restra\"cting injury. -An activity- restricting injury is an injury that has caused at Ieast 1 day of restricted activity. (See defini\u00ad tion of restricted-activity day.) The incidence of activity-restricting injuries is estimated from the number of such injuries reported as having occurred in the 2 weeks before the interview week. For this reason, an injury that did not result in restricted activity until after the end 133 of the 2-week period in which it occurred is not classified as an activity-restricting injury. Bed-disabling injzwy.-An injury resulting in at least 1 day of bed disability is calIed a bed-disabling injury. (See also definition of activity-restricting injury.) Work-or school-loss injury.-An injury re\u00ad sulting in at least 1 day of work or school loss is called a work-loss injury or a school-loss injury. (See also definition of activity-restrict\u00ad ing injury.) Medically attended injury. -An injury for which a physician was consulted is called a medically attended injury. Consulting a physician includes consultation in person or by telephone for treatment or advice. Advice from the physician transmitted to the patient through the nurse is counted as medical con\u00ad sultation as well as visits to physicians in clinics or hospitals. If at one visit the physician is consulted about more than one injury for each of several patients, each injury is counted as medically attended. A parent consulting a physician- about a child's injury is counted as medical consulta\u00ad tion about that injury even if the child was not seen by the physician at that time. For the purpose of this definition, \"physician \" includes doctors of medicine and osteopathic physicians. The term \"doctor\" is used in the interview rather than \"physician\" because of popuku usage. However, the concept toward which all instructions are directed is that which is described here. An injury is counted as medically attended if a physician was consulted about it at its onset or at any time thereafter. However, the first medical attention for an injury that was experienced during the 2-week period prior to the household interview may not occur until after the interview. Such cases are treated as though there was no medical attention. An injury is counted as medically attended if a physician was consulted about it at its onset or at any time thereafter. However, the first medical attention for an injury that was experienced during the 2-week period prior to the household interview may not occur until after the end of the 2-week period. Such cases are treated 'as though there was no medical attention. Terms Relating to Class of Accident Class of accident. -Injuries, injured persons, and resulting days of disability may be grouped according to class of accident. This is a broad classification of the types of events that re\u00ad sulted in personal injuries. Most of these events are accidents in the usual sense of the word, but some are other kinds of mishap, such as overexposure to the sun or adverse reactions to medical procedures, and others are nonacci\u00ad dental violence, such as attempted suicide. The classes of accident are (1) moving motor vehicle accidents, (2) accidents occurring while at work, (3) home accidents, and (4) other accidents. These categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, a person may be injured in a moving motor vehicle accident that occurred while the person was at home or at work. The accident class \"moving motor vehicle\" includes \"home-moving motor vehicle\" and \"while Similarly, the classes \"while at work\" and \"home\" include duplicated counts, e.g., \"moving motor vehicle-while at work\" is included under \"while at work.\" Motor vehicle.-A motor vehicle is any mechanically or electrically powered device, not operated on rails, upon which or by which any person or property may be transported or drawn upon a land highway. Any object, such as a trailer, coaster, sled, or wagon, being towed by a motor vehicle is considered a part of the motor vehicle. Devices used solely for moving persons or materials within the con- fines of a building and its premises are not counted as motor vehicles. Moving motor vehicle accident.-The acci\u00ad dent is classified as \"moving motor vehicle\" if at least one of the motor vehicles involved in the accident was moving at the time of the accident. This category is subdivided into \"traffic\" and \"nontraffic\" accidents. 1. Traffic moving motor vehicle accident. The accident is in the \"traf fit\" category if it occurred on a public highway. It is con\u00ad sidered to have occurred on the highway if it occurred wholly on the highway, if it originated on the highway, if it terminated on the highway, or if it involved a vehicle 134 partially on the highway. A public highway is the entire width between boundary lines of every way or place of which any part is open to the use of the public for the pur\u00ad poses of vehicular traffic as a matter of right or custom. 2. Nontraffic moving motor vehicle accident. The accident is in the \"nontraffic\" category if it occurred entirely in any place othe than a public highway. Nonmoving motor vehicle accident.-If the motor vehicle was not moving at the time of the accident, the accident is considered a \"non- moving motor vehicle\" accident and is classi\u00ad fied in the \"other accident\" category. Accident while at work. -The class of acci\u00ad dent is \"while at work\" if the injured person was 17 years of age or over and was at work at a job or a business at the time the accident happened. Home accident.-The class of accident is \"home\" if the injury occurred either inside or outside the house. \"Outside the house\" refers to the yard, buildings, and sidewalks on the property, \"Home\" includes not only the person's own home but also any other home in which he may have been when he was injured. Other accident.-The class of accident is \"other\" if the occurrence of injury cannot be classified in one or more of the first three class-of-accident categories (i.e., moving motor vehicle, while at work, or home). This category therefore includes persons injured in public places (e.g., tripping and falling in a store or on a public sidewalk) and also nonaccidenta.1 injuries such as homicidal and suicidal attempts. The survey does not cover the mili\u00ad tary population, but current disability of various types resulting from prior injury occurring while the person was in the Armed Forces is covered and is included in this class. The class also includes mishaps for which the class of accident could not be ascertained. Terms Relating to Hospitalization Hospital .-For this survey a hospital is de- fined as any institution meeting one of the following criteria: (1) named in the listing of hospitals in the current Guide Issue of Hospitals, the Journal of the American Hospital Association, (2) named in the Iisting of hospitak in the Directories of the American Osteopathic Hospital Association, or (3) named in the annual inventory of non-Federal hospitah submitted by the States to the Health Care Facilities Service, HeaIth Services and Mental HeaIth Administration, in conjunction with the HiII-Burton program. Short-stay hospital.-A short-stay hospital is one in which the type of service provided by the hospital is general; maternity; eye, ear, nose, and throat; children's; or osteopathic; or it may be the hospital department of an institution. Hospital ownership. -Hospital ownership is a classification of hospitals according to the type of organization that controls and operates the hospital. The category to which an individual hospital is assigned and the definition of these categories follows the usage of the American Hospital Association. Hospital dizy.-A hospital day is a day on which a person is confined to a hospital. The day is counted as a hospital day only if the patient stays overnight. Thus a patient who enters the hospital on Monday afternoon and leaves Wednesday noon is considered to have had 2 hospital days. Hospital days dura\"ngthe year.-The number of hospital days during the year is the total number for all hospital episodes in the 12-month period prior to the interview week. For the purposes of this estimate, episodes overlapping the beginning or end of the 12-month period are subdivided so that only those days falling within the period are included. Hospital episode.-A hospital episode is any continuous period of stay of 1 night or more in a hospital as an inpatient except the period of stay of a well newborn infant. A hospital episode is recorded for a family member when- ever and part of his hospital stay is included in the 12-month period prior to the interview week. Hospital discharge.-A hospitaI discharge is the completion of any continuous period of stay of 1 or more nights in a hospital as an inpatient except the period of stay of a well newborn infant. A hospital discharge is recorded whenever a present member of the 135 household is reported to have been discharged from a hospital in the 12-month period prior to the interview week. (Estimates were based on discharges which occurred during the 6-month period prior to the interview.) Length of hospital stay.-The length of hospital stay is the duration in days, exclusive of the day of discharge, of a hospital discharge. (See definition of \"hospital discharge.\") Average length of stay.-The average length of stay per discharged patient is computed by dividing the total number of hospital days for a specified group by the total number of dis\u00ad charges for the same group. Type of hospital service. -Type of hospital service is a classification of hospitals according to the predominant type of cases for which they provide care. The category to which an individual hospital is assigned and the defini\u00ad tion of these categories follows the usage of the American Hospital Association. Terms Relating to Dental Visits Dental visit.-A dentaI visit is defined as any visit to a dentist's office for treatment or advice, including services by a technician or hygienist acting under a dentist's supervision. Interval since last dental visit.-The interval since the last dental visit is the length of time prior to the week of interview since a dentist or dental hygienist was last visited for treat\u00ad ment or advice of any type. Edentzdous persons. -Persons who have lost all their permanent teeth are classed as edentu- 10US persons. An edentulous person may have dentures but does not have any natural teeth. Type of dental service.-A dental service is a service received when a dentist or dental hygienist is visited. For purposes of this survey, dental services have been categorized into a number of broad types. If a single dental visit involves more than one type of dental service, each type of service is recorded. If a particular type of service is rendered more than once during a single visit, the type of service is nevertheless recorded only once. For example, if during a single dental visit one tooth is extracted and three teeth are filled, the types of services rendered during that visit are recorded as \"extractions\" and \"fillings,\" each category being recorded only once. The categories of type of dental service are defined as follows: 1. FzWings include temporary fillings, perma\u00ad nent fillings, inlays, and similar pro\u00ad cedures. 2. Extractions include any dentzd surgery and related activity such as removal of stitches. 3. Cleaning or examination includes all forms of dental prophylaxis, checkup, consultation, and X-rays. 4. Straightening includes orthodontic treatment and brace work and also fitting or repair of braces. 5. Gum treatment includes all periodontal work except prophylaxis. 6. Denture work includes taking impressions for false teeth, plate fitting or repair, and bridge work. 7. Other includes all types of dental service not listed above. Terms Relating to Physician Visits Physician visit.-A physician visit is defined as consultation with a physician, in person or by telephone, for examination, diagnosis, treat\u00ad ment, or advice. The visit is considered to be a physician visit if the service is provided directly by the physician or by a nurse or other person acting under a physician's supervision. For the purpose of this definition, \"physician\" includes doctors of medicine and osteopathic physicians. The term \"doctor\" is used in the interview rather than \"physician\" because of popular usage. However, the concept toward which all instructions are directed is that which is described here. Physician visits for services provided on a mass basis are not included in the tabulations. A service received on a mass basis is defined as any service involving only a single test (e.g., test for diabetes) or a single procedure (e.g., smallpox vaccination) when this single service was administered identically to all persons who were at the place for this purpose. Hence ob\u00ad taining a chest X-ray in a tuberculosis chest X-ray trailer is not included as a physician visit. However, a special chest X-ray given in a physician's office or in an outpatient clinic is considered a physician visit. 136 Physician visits to hospital inpatients are not included. If a physician is called to a house to see more than one person, the call is considered a separate physician visit for each person about whom the physician was consulted. A physician visit is associated with the person about whom the advice was sought, even if that person did not actually see or consult the physician. For example, if a mother consults a physician about one of her children, the physician visit is ascribed to the child. Interval since last physician visit. -The in\u00ad terval since the last physician visit is the length of time prior to the week of interview since a physician was last consulted in person or by telephone for treatment or advice of any type whatever. A physician visit to a hospital in- patient may be counted as the, last time a physician was seen. Place of visit.-The place of visit is a classifi\u00ad cation of the types of places at which a physician visit occurs. Definitions of the various categories are as follows: 1. Home is defined as any place in which the person was staying at the time of the physi\u00ad cian's visit. It may be his own home, the home of a friend, a hotel, or any other place the person may have been staying (except as an overnight patient in a hospital). 2. Office is defined as the office of a physician in private practice only. This may be an office in the physician's home, an individual office in an office building, or a suite of offices occupied by several physicians. For purposes of this survey, physicians con\u00ad nected with prepayment-group-practice plans are considered to be in private practice. 3. Hospital clinic is defined as an outpatient clinic or emergency room in any hospital. 4. Company or _industry health unit refers to treatment received from a physician or under a physician's supervision at a place of business (e.g., factory, store, office building). This includes emergency or first-aid rooms located in such places if treatment was received there from a physician or trained nurse. 5. Telephone contact refers to advice given in a telephone call by the physician directly or through a nurse. (Calls for appointments are excluded.) 6. Other refers to advice or treatment received from a physician or under a physician's general supervision at a school, at an insur\u00ad ance office, at a health department clinic, or any other place at which a physician consul\u00ad tation might take place. Type of medical service. -A medical service is a service received when a physician is con\u00ad sulted. For the purposes of this survey, medical services have been categorized into several broad types. A single physician visit may result in the recording of more than one type of medical service (though a particular type is not recorded more than once for any one physician visit). Definitions of the types of medical service are as folIows: 1. Diagnosis and treatment include (1) exami\u00ad nations and tests in order to diagnose an illness regardless of whether the examina\u00ad tions and tests resulted in a diagnosis and (2) treatment or advice given by the physician or under the physician's super- vision. The category includes diagnosis alone, treatment alone, and both combined. X-rays either for diagnostic purposes or for treat\u00ad ment are included in this class. 2. Prenatal and postnatal care include consulta\u00ad tions concerning the care of the mother during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. It excludes consultations for illnesses not related to pregnancy or delivery. 3, General checkup includes checkups for general purposes and also those for a specific purpose such as employment or insurance. If a diagnosis or diagnoses are made in the course of a general checkup, the physician visit is classified to \"diagnosis and treat\u00ad ment\" as weIl as to \"general checkup.\" If the consultation is for checking up on a specific condition, as, for example, when a person goes at regular intervals for a check on a tuberculous or heart condition, this is classified as \"diagnosis and treatment\" and not as \"general checkup.\" 137 4. Immunization includes this preventive service when provided by a physician or under a physician's supervision. A physician service which is for the sole purpose of receiving immunization ag~nst a p~ticular disease given at the same time and place that many other persons are receiving the identical immunization is excluded because of the rule for exclusion of such services in the definition of a physician visit. 5. Other includes eye refractions and specific preventive-care services (such as vitamin injections) not embraced by the above type of service categories. Also included are all visits where an unknown type of service was reported. Terms Relating to Special Aids Special aid.-A special aid is a device used to compensate for defects resulting from disease, injury, impairment, or congenital malforma\u00ad tion. Aids included in this survey are artificial limbs, braces, crutches, canes or walking sticks, special shoes, wheelchairs, walkers, and any other kind of aid for getting around, as follows: 1. Artificial limb is a device to replace a miss\u00ad ing leg, arm, hand, or foot. It does not have to have moving parts, but a device employed only for lengthening a leg where the whole leg or foot is present is not counted. 2. Brace is defined as any kind of supportive device for the arms, hands, legs, feet, back, neck, or head, exclusive of temporary casts, slings, bandages, trusses, belts, or crutches. Dental braces are excluded. 3. Crutch is a staff with a crosspiece at the top to support a person in walking. The point of support may be the axilla, upper arm, or forearm. For each crutch a second support is at hand level. 4. Cane or walking stick is a short staff, either straight or cu~ed at upper end, used to provide some support at hand level in walk\u00ad ing. 5. Special shoes are shoes of special construc\u00ad tion or desire which are used to help a person in get;ing around. Oversized shoe; of normal or usual construction are excluded. 6. Wheelchair is a chair mounted on wheels and usually propelled by the occupant by means of handrims attached to the two large side wheels. 7. Walker is a four-legged stand which provides support for a person. It is moved by lifting or by wheeling on casters. Terms Relating to Home Care Home care.-Care received at home is de- fined as any personal assistance or personal services received by a person at home as a result of illness, injury, impairment, or ad\u00ad vanced age. The person providing the care may have received a fee for his service or the service may have been provided free. Excluded from the definition of home care is any care pro\u00ad vided by a physician. However, care by all other persons whether the latter are profes\u00ad sionzd health workers or not is included. The amount of care varies from constant care for bedridden persons to only partial or inter\u00ad mittent. Type of care provided. -Type of care pro\u00ad vided has been classified into three general categories. These categories with the specific inclusions are as follows: 1. Personal care Walking up stairs or getting from room to , room: Includes assistance either in walking from one room to another or in going up and down stairs. This would include cases where someone must watch or stand behind a person as he walks up the steps in case he falls or stumbles. If the person is bedridden or never attempts to walk from one room to another or to walk up and down stairs, this type of care is ex\u00ad cluded since this kind of service is not rendered by anyone. Dressing or putting on shoes: Includes any care a person receives in dressing and the like because he is unable to dress himself without the help of another person because of some h-ealth problem. Not included is help in dressing that is not health related such as the wife 138 who ties her husband's ties because he never learned how to do it property or the husband who hooks the back of his wife's dress because it is difficult for her to reach. Bathing (shaving) or other toilet activities: Includes any assistance the person need in washing or shaving himself or in using a bedpan and so forth. Eating or having meals served in bed: Includes help if the person is unable to eat without assistance or has to have his meals served to him in bed. Not included in this definition is help in preparation of meals. 2. Medically related care Changing bandages: Includes assistance in changing dressing or bandages. Receiving injections: Includes injections received at home from someone other than a doctor. Other treatments: Includes all other treatments received from some other person at home such as the application of salves or ointments, wetpacks, etc. 3. Other types of care Changing bed positions: Includes assistance of another person in order to sit up or turn over in bed. Exercising or physical therapy: Includes receipt of physical therapy at home or in any exercise performed because of some illness, injury, or impair\u00ad ment. Cutting toenails.\u20ac Any other type of care not specified above.\u20ac Specifically excluded from types of care pro\u00ad vided are (1) any care received by the person outside his home, e.g., physical therapy at an outpatient clinic, (2) any care received from a physician either at the person's home or at the doctor's office, a clinic, a hospital, etc., and (3) maid service for cleaning, laundry, or preparation of meak. Duration of care. -Duration of care is the length of time prior to the week of interview that a person received home care. Extent of care.-Two major categories used to describe the extent of care received are constant care and partial or intermittent care. 1. Constant care was provided when the person was never left unattended or alone in the house even for short intervals or during the night. Although the person providing the care was immediately available at all times, the care did not have to be provided at all times. 2. Part-time care includes any care on a part- time basis. This includes care for persons who required constant care during inter\u00ad mittent episodes of a condition. Provider of care. -Three categories are used to classify provider of home care. 1. Related household member included any medical or paramedical personnel who were related to the individual requiring care. How- ever, related physicians were excluded from this category as well as the remaining ones. 2. Registered nurse who came to the home to provide care. 3. AU other persons providing care included practical nurses, physical therapists, and social workers. Nurse viszls.-Home visits by nurses include visits from nurses in the past 12 months by any kind of nurse, registered or otherwise. Family and Related Terms The definitions of families and unrelated individuals (family units) are the same as those used in the 1970 census. Family refers to a group of two persons or more related by blood, marriage, or adoption who are living together in the same household. Although the usual household contains only the primary family, a household can contain secondary families as well as individuals unre\u00ad lated to the family. A Iodger and his family who are not related to the head of the house- hold or a resident employee and his wife living in are considered a secondary family and not 139 part of the primary family. However, if the son of the head of the household and the son's wife and children are members of the house- hold, this subfamily is treated as part of the primary family. Individuals are persons (other than inmates of institutions) who are not living with any relatives. An unrelated individual can be (1) a household head living alone or with non- relative, (2) a lodger or resident employee with no relatives in the household, (3) a staff member of an institution who has no relatives living with him, or (4) a resident of a dormi\u00ad tory, lodging house, or other shared-residence facility who has no relative living with him. Head of family is usually the person re\u00ad garded as the \"head\" by the members of the group. Married women are never classified as heads if their husbands are living with them at the time of the survey except when the husband is a member of the Armed Forces. Only one person in each family can be desig\u00ad nated as the head. Therefore the number of heads of families is equal to the number of families. Other family members are all persons who are related to the head of the family by blood, marriage, or adoption. The category \"child under 17,\" used as a classifier of husband-wife families, refers to a child of these parents and includes an adopted child, a foster child, or a ward but excludes a grandchild. Terms Relating to Health Insurance Health insurance is any plan specifically designed to pay all or part of the medical or hospital expenses of the insured individual. The insurance can be either a group or an indl\u00ad vidual policy with the premiums paid by the individual, his employer, a third party, or a combination of these. Benefits received under the plan can be in the form of payment to the individwd or to the hospital or doctor. How- ever, the plan must be a formal one with defined membership and benefits rather than an informal one. For example, an employer simply paying the hospital bill for an employee would not constitute a health insurance plan. For the Health Interview Survey, health insurance excludes the following kinds of plans: (1) plans limited to the \"dread diseases\" such as cancer and polio, (2) free care such as public assistance, public welfare, and Medicaid, care given free of charge to veterans, care given under Uniformed Services Dependents Medical Care Program, care given under the Crippled Children Program or similar programs, and care of persons admitted to a hospital for research purposes, (3) insurance that pays bills only for accidents, such as liability insurance held by a car or property owner, insurance that covers children for accidents at school or camp, and insurance for a worker that covers him only for accidents, injuries, or diseases incurred on the job, and (4) insurance that pays only for loss of income. Hospital z'rzsurance.-Insurance that pays all or part of the hospital bill for the hospitalized person is called hospital insurance. The hospital bill is limited to the biII submitted by the hospital itself, not the doctor's or surgeon's bill or the bill for special nurses. Such a bill always includes the cost of room and meak and may also include the cost of other services such as operating room, laboratory tests, and X-rays. Swg\"cal insurance. -Insurance that pays in whole or part the bill of the doctor or surgeon for an operation whether performed in a hospital or in the doctor's office is surgical insurance. Insurance that pays the cost of visits to a doctor's office for postoperative care is incIuded as surgical insurance. Terms Relating to Acquisition and Cost of Medicines In order to obtain accurate and complete information relating to the acquisition and cost of medicines, the reference period is limited to the 2-week period prior to interview. The collected data are then appropriately weighted to provide annual estimates for medicine items. Prescribed medicine. -Prescribed medicine is defined as (1) any medicine obtained on a doctor's written prescription, (2) any medicine which has been prepared on the basis of a doctor's telephone call to a pharmacist, or (3) any medicine given by the doctor (or nurse) to a person to take home. Medicine obtained as a refill of a previous prescription is considered prescribed medicine. Medicines and injections 140 administered in a medicaI facility are excluded. Acquisition of prescribed medicine. -Each time the medicine is actually obtained on the basis of a prescription is considered an acquisi\u00ad tion. If the medicine is specifically prescribed for two persons, it is counted as two acquisi\u00ad tions. Each time the prescription is refilled is considered a separate acquisition. Cost per acquisition of prescribed medicine. -The amount paid (or to be paid) by a person, his family, or friends and any part paid by health insurance is recorded for each acquisi\u00ad tion of medicine for each person. If the medi\u00ad cine was obtained without cost, the source from which the medicine was obtained free of charge is recorded. If the medicine was ob\u00ad tained for two persons, haIf of the cost is allocated to each person. Similarly if the medi\u00ad cine was obtained twice for one person, half the total cost is allocated per acquisition. Nonprescn\"bed medicine. -Nonprescribed med\u00ad icine is defined as medicines obtained with- out a prescription. The term includes tonics, pills, salves, ointments, vitamins, first-aid items, and other medicines or medications. Users of nonprescn\"bed medicine. -Persons in the family who used or might use each non- prescribed medicine are recorded. Cost of nonprescn\"bed medicine during period per user. -The amount paid (or to be paid) for a given type of nonprescribed medi\u00ad cine actually obtained during a period of time is allocated equally among each user (or poten\u00ad tial user) of the medicine. Nonprescribed medi\u00ad cine obtained \"free from doctor\" (or other source) is recorded as having no cost. Terms Relating to Corrective Lenses Corrective lenses. -Corrective Ienses include eyeglasses and contact lenses. The term is lim\u00ad ited to visual aids worn to correct or improve vision and therefore excludes sunglasses worn only to filter light, safety glasses worn only for protection of the eyes, hand magnifying glasses, and other such devices. However, if the safety glasses are worn ako for correction or improvement of vision, they are considered corrective lenses as are prescription sunglasses. Type of correction. -Lenses are used for the correction of near vision, distance vision, and defective vision due to specific eye conditions. Lenses prescribed for the correction of near vision aid the person in reading or doing close work. For persons who cannot read, the term \"close work\" is defined as seeing smzdl objects clearly enough to recognize what they are. Lenses prescribed for the correction of distance vision aid the person in seeing distance objects and are used in such activities as driving a car, watching a moving, or seeing entries on a blackboard. Persons who reported having bi\u00ad focals are considered as having correction for both near and distance vision, but the use of both types of lenses is verified by the inter- viewer. When the respondent reported ordy in terms of an eye condition such as astigmatism or strabismus, the type of correction is classified as other than correction of near or distance vision. For persons who obtained their corrective lenses without a prescription, the respondent's reply regarding type of correction is accepted. Frequency of use of corrective lenses.-The options read to the respondent, \"all of the time, most of the time, hardly ever, never\" represent a descending scale of frequency of use. For persons who use their lenses for the correction of near vision only or distance vision only, the scale refers only to the pur\u00ad pose for which the lenses were prescribed or intended, e.g., if a person uses his lenses to read only the daily newspaper each morning and does no other reading or close work, he is considered as a person who uses his glasses \"all of the time\" for \"reading or close work.\" If a person has both eyeglasses and contact Ienses or more than one pair of either, the question on frequency of use applies to all lenses used, e.g., if a person wears contact lenses at work and eyeglasses at all other times, he is con\u00ad sidered as wearing corrective lenses \"all of the time.\" Source of optical prescr@tion.-Prescriptions for corrective lenses are usually obtained from either an ophthalmoIogist or an optometrist. An ophthalmoIogist is a physician who spec\u00ad ializes in the medical and surgical care of the eyes and may prescribe drugs or other treat\u00ad ment as well as lenses. An optometrist per- forms visual analysis by examining the eyes, 141 prescribing lenses and other vision aids, visual training, and orthoptics or other optical aids. The optometrist does not treat eye diseases or perform surgery. Terms Relating to Cigarette Smoking iVorzwnoker.-A person who has never smoked more than 100 cigarettes (five packs) during his entire life is considered to have never smoked cigarettes. Persons who have never smoked cigarettes are also referred to as \"never smokers.\" Ever smoked cigarettes. -Persons who have smoked more than 100 cigarettes (five packs) in their entire lives are classified as having ever smoked and are further described as present smokers and former smokers. They also are referred to as \"ever smokers.\" Present cigarette smoker.-Any person who reported a current rate of cigarette smoking is classified as a present smoker. The rate may range from less than one cigarette per day to 99 or more cigarettes per day. If a person has stopped smoking cigarettes only temporarily because of illness, economic reasons, or the like, he is still considered a present smoker. Former cigarette smoker.-Any person who has smoked at least 100 cigarettes during his entire life but reports smoking no cigarettes at the time of the interview is classified as a former smoker. Heaviest smoking rate. -A person's heaviest smoking rate is the daily rate of consumption during the period when he was smoking the most. The period of heaviest smoking can range from a short time to many years. Present smoking rate.-A person's present smoking rate is the number of cigarettes he reports to be smoking per day at the time of the interview. Time since last snzoked.-This is a measure of the interval of time since a former smoker last smoked cigarettes fairly regularly. Demographic Terms Age.-The age recorded for each person is the age at last birthday. Age is recorded in single years and grouped in a variety of distributions depending on the purpose of the table. Color.-The population is divided into two color groups, \"white\" and \"all other.\" \"AU other\" includes Negro, American Indian, Chi\u00ad nese, Japanese , and any other race. Mexican persons are included with \"white\" unless defi\u00ad nitely known to be Indian or of another race. Income of family or of unrelated individ- uals.-Each member of a family is classified according to the total income of the family of which he is a member. Within the household all persons related to each other by blood, marriage, or adoption constitute a family. Un\u00ad related individuals are classified according to their own income. The income recorded is the total of all in- come received by members of the family (or by an unrelated individual) in the 12-month period preceding the week of interview. In- come from all sources is included, e.g., wages, salaries, rents from property, pensions, and help from relatives. Education.-The categories of education status show the years of school completed. Only years completed in regular schools, where persons are given a formal education, are included. A \"regular\" school is one which ad\u00ad vances a person toward an elementary or high school diploma or a college, university, or pro\u00ad fessional school degree. Thus education in vocational, trade, or business schools outside the regtdar school system is not counted in determining the highest grade of school completed. L Education of head of family or of unrelated individuals. Each member of a family is classified according to the education of the head \"of the family of which he is a member. Within the household all persons related to each other by blood, marriage, or adoption constitute a family. Unrelated individuals are ckissified according to their own education. 2. Education of individual. Each person aged 17 years or older is classified by education in terms of the highest grade of school completed. Man\"tal status. -Marital status is recorded only for persons 17 years of age or older. The marital status categories in this report are as follows: 1. Under 17 includes all persons aged O-16 regardless of their marital status. 142 2. Married incIudes all married persons not separated from their spouses. Persons with common-law marriage are considered as married. 3. Never marrz\"ed includes persons who were never married and persons whose only marriage was annulled. 4. Separated includes married persons w~o have a legal separation or who have parted because of other reasons. This does not in\u00ad clude persons separated from their spouses because of the circumstances of their employment or service in the Armed Forces; these persons are considered married. 5. Widowed and divorced include, respectively, all persons who said they were either widowed or legaUy divorced. Living arrangement.-The four categories of living arrangements shown in this report are as follows: 1. Living alone. Living alone is defined as living in a one-member household. 2. Living with nonrelative. Living with non- relative is defined as living in a household with another person or persons none of whom are related to the person by blood, marriage, or adoption. 3. Living with relatives-marn\"ed. This category includes married persons who are living in a household with another person or persons one or more of whom are related to them by blood, marriage, or adoption. Persons with common-law marriages are considered to be married. For purposes of this category, \"married\" excludes widowed, divorced, or separated. Persons whose only marriage was annulled are counted as \"never married.\" 4. Living with relatives-other. This category includes children living with parents or relatives; it also includes persons who are widowed, divorced, separated, or never married who are living in a household with another person or persons one or more of whom are related to them by blood, mar\u00ad riage, or adoption. Persons whose only mar\u00ad riage was annulled are counted as \"never married.\" \" Separated\" refers to married per- sons who have a legal separation or who have parted because of marital discord. Usual activity.-All persons in the population are chissified according to their usual activity during the 12-month period prior to the week of interview. The \"usual\" activity, in case more than one is reported, is the one at which the person spent the most time during the 12-month period. Children under 6 years of age are classified as \"preschool.\" All persons aged 6-16 years are classified as \"school age.\" The categories of usual activity used in this report for persons aged 17 years and over are usually working, usually going to school, usually keeping house, retired, and other activ\u00ad ity. For several reasons these categories are not comparable with somewhat similarly named categories in official Federal labor force statis\u00ad tics. First, the responses concerning usual activ\u00ad ity are accepted without detailed questioning since the objective of the question is not to estimate the numbers of persons in labor force categories but to identify crudely certain popu\u00ad lation groups that may have differing health problems. Second, the figures represent the usual activity status over the period of an en- tire year, whereas official labor force statistics relate to a much shorter period, usually 1 week. Third, the minimum age for usually working persons is 17 in the Health Interview Survey, and the official labor force categories include all persons aged 14 or older. Finally, in the definitions of specific categories which follow, certain marginzd groups are classified differently to simplify procedures. 1. Usually working includes persons 17 years of age or older who are paid employees; self- employed in their own business, profession, or in farming; or unpaid employees in a family business or farm. Work around the house or volunteer or unpaid work such as for a church is not counted as working. 2. Usually going to school includes persons 17 years of age or older whose major activity is going to school. 3. Usually keeping house includes female persons 17 years of age or older whose major activity is described as \"keeping house\" and who cannot be classified as \"working.\" 4. Retired includes persons 45 years old and over who consider themselves to be retired. In case of doubt, a person 45 years of age or older is counted as retired if he or she has either voluntarily or involuntarily stopped working, is not looking for work, 143 and is not described as \"keeping house.\" A retired person may or may not be able to work. 5. Other activity includes all persons 17 years of age or older not classified as \"working,\" \"retired,\" or \"going to school,\" and females 17 years of age or older not classified as \"keeping house.\" Geographic region.-For the purpose of classifying the population by geographic area, the States are grouped into four regions. These regions, which correspond to those used by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, are shown below. Region States included Northeast . . . . . Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania North Central . . Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, Nebraska South . . . . . . . . Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Texas, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, \" Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, California, Hawaii Place of residence. -The place of residence of a member of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population is classified as inside a standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA) or outside an SMSA either farm or nonfarm. 1. Standard metropolitan statistical areas. The definitions and titles of SMSA'S are estab\u00ad lished by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget with the advice of the Federal Com\u00ad mittee on Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas. There were 212 SMSA'S defined for the 1960 decennial census. The definition of an individuzd SMSA involves two considerations: first, a city or cities of specified population which constitute the central city and identify the county in which it is located as the central count y; second, economic and social relation- ships with contiguous counties (except in New England) which are metropolitan in character so that the periphery of the specific metropolitan area may be determined. SMSA'S are not limited by State boundaries. In New England SMSA'S consist of towns and cities, rather than counties. The metropolitan population in this report is based on SMSA'S as defined in the 1960 census and does not include any subsequent additions or changes. 2. Central cities. Each SMSA must include at least one central city. The complete title of an SMSA identifies the central city or cities. If only one central city is designated, then it must have 50,000 inhabitants or more. The area title may include, in addition to the largest city,. up to two city names on the basis and in the order of the following criteria: (1) the additional city has at least 250,000 inhabitants or (2) the additional city has a population of one-third or more of that of the largest city and a minimum population of 25,000. An exception occurs where two cities have contiguous boundaries and constitute, for economic and social purposes, a single community of at least 50,000, the smaller of which must have a population of at least 15,0000 3. Farm and nonfarm residence. The population residing outside SMSA'S is subdivided into the farm population, which comprises all non- SMSA residents Iiving on farms, and the nonfarm population, which comprises the remaining outside SMSA population. The farm population includes persons living on places of 10 acres or more from which sales of farm products amounted to $50 or more during the previous 12 months or on places of less than 10 acres from which sales of farm products amounted to $250 or more during the preceding 12 months. Other persons living outside an SMSA were classified as nonfarm if 144 their household paid rent for the house but their rent did not include any land used for farming. Sales of farm products refer to the gross receipts from the sale of field crops, vegetables, fruits, nuts, livestock and livestock products (milk, wool, etc.), poultry and poul\u00ad try products, and nursery and forest products produced on the place and sold at any time during the preceding 12 months. Occupation.-A person's occupation may be defined as his principal job or business. For the purposes of this survey, the principal job or business is defined in one of the following ways. If the person worked during the 2-week refer\u00ad ence period of the interview, or had a job or business, the question concerning his occupation (or what kind of work he was doing) applies to his job during that period. If the respondent held more than one job, the question is directed to the one at which he spent the most time. For an unemployed person, this question refers to the last full-time civilian job he had. A person who has a job to which he has not yet reported, and has never had a previous job or business, is classified as a \"new worker.\" Shown below are the occupation classes pre\u00ad sented in this report and their code numbers as Occupation Classification Census Code White-collor workens Professional, technical, 401-580, R, S Operatives, except transport . .... 601-596, T Transport equipment operatives found in the Classified Index of Occupations and Industries, U.S. Bureau of the Census (June 1971). Industry.-The industry in which a person was reportedly working is classified by the major activity of the establishment in which he worked. The only exceptions, the few establish\u00ad ments classified according to the major activity of the parent organization, are as follows: laboratories, warehouses, repair shops, and storage facilities. The industry categories presented in this report are shown below with the corresponding codes found in the Classified Index of Occupa\u00ad tions and Industries, U.S. Bureau of the Census, and the Standard Industrial Classification ManuaZs (SIC), U.S. Office of Management and Budget, (1967). Industry Clussi~icution Census Code SIC Code Agricultural F, 995-988 88 In labor force.-All persons 17 years and over who worked at or had a job or business or were looking for work or on layoff from work during the 2-week period prior to the week of interview are in the labor force. The labor force consists of persons currently employed and currently unemployed. Definitions of these categories, similar to those used by the Current Population Survey, are as follows: 1. Currently employed. Persons 17 years of age and over who reported that at any time during the 2-week period covered by the interview they either worked at or had a job or business are currently employed. Current employment includes paid work as an employee of someone else; self-employment in business, farming, or professional practice, . .and unpmd work m a family business or far.,,, 145 Freelance workers are considered currently employed if they had a definite arrangement with one employer or more to work for pay according to a weekly or monthly schedule; those without a definite employment schedule are counted as employed, unem\u00ad ployed, or not in the labor force depending upon their activity during the 2-week period covered by the interview. Persons temporarily absent from a job or business because of illness, vacation, strike, or bad weather are considered employed. Excluded from the currently employed population are (1) persons receiving revenue from an enterprise but not participating in its operation, (2) persons doing housework or charity work for which they receive no pay, (3) seasonal workers during the portion of the year they were not working, and (4) persons not working even though they had a job or business but who were on layoff or looking for work. 2. Currently unemployed. Persons 17 years and over who during the 2-week period prior to interview did not work or had no job or business but were looking for work and those who had a job but were on layoff or looking for work are considered currently unemployed. The number of currently employed and currently unemployed persons estimated from the Health Interview Survey (HIS) will differ from the estimates prepared from the Current Population Survey (CPS) of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. This occurs because of sampling variability and the following primary conceptual differences: (1) HIS estimates are for persons 17 years of age and over, while CPS estimates are for persons 16 years of age and over; (2) HIS uses a 2-week reference period, while CPS uses a l-week reference period; and (3) HIS is a continuing survey with separate samples taken weekly, while CPS is a monthly sample taken for the survey week that includes the 12th of the month. Not in labor ~orce.-Persons not in the labor force are all persons under 17 years of age and other persons who did not at any time during the 2-week period covered by the interview have a job or business, were not looking for work, and were not on layoff from a job. In general, persons excluded from the labor force are youths under 17, retired persons, physically hardcapped persons unable to work, and house- wives or charity workers who receive no pay. Also excluded are persons receiving revenue from but not participating in a business and seasonal or freelance workers not looking for work. Class of roorker.-Persons in the labor force are classified according to class of worker as follows: 1. Private paid workers are persons working for a private employer for wages, salary, or commissions. This includes compensation by tips; piece rates or pay in kind; and wages or salary from settlement houses, churches, unions, and other nonprofit organizations. 2. Federal Government workers are persons who work for any branch of the Federal Govern\u00ad ment including employees of Government- owned bus lines and utilities, civilian employees of the Armed Forces, and persons elected to Federal offices. 3. Other government workers are persons who work for any branch of government other than the Federal Government, e.g., State, city, or county. Included in this group are civilian employees of the National Guard, persons elected to paid offices, employees of international organizations such as the United Nations, and employees of foreign govern\u00ad ments. 4. Self-employed workers are persons working for profit or fees in their own business, farm, shop, or office. \"Own business\" includes persons who have their own tools or equip\u00ad ment and provide services on a contract, subcontract, or job basis. Officers of corpora\u00ad tions are not classified as owning their own business, even though they do own all or part of the corporation stock; such persons are considered as \"private paid.\" A person who operates a farm for himself, regardless of whether he owns or rents the land, is considered self-employed. 5. Other class of worker includes (1) persons working without pay on a farm or in a 146 business operated by a relative, (2) persons Quarter.-The quarters used by the Health who have never worked in the past but have a Interview Survey are actually 13-week periods job or business which will begin in the near rather than 3 calendar months. Since each future, (3) persons who have not worked in 13-week period begins on a Monday and ends on the past but are presently looking for work, a Sunday,.. the actual dates of the beginning ~d and (4) persons for whom no information as end of each 13-week period may o\"verlap- into to class of worker is available. another calendar quarter. 000 147 APPENDIX IV CHECKLISTS FOR SELECTED CHRONIC CONDITIONS: 1968-73 CONDITIONS OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM: 1968 NOW I'm going to read a list of conditionti I 16a.
