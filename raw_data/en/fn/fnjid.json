In search of our era's consummate healers, we've screened the worlds of both natural and conventional medicine. Here, these modern masters share their personal strategies for maintaining good health, high energy, and mental clarity. Keeping a cold at bay \"At the very first sign of a cold, I toss a couple of andrographis supplements down my throat. I never travel without them.\" Chris Kilham, an ethnobotanist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, conducts research around the world to develop and introduce traditional plant-based medicines to Western users. An herb with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, andrographis is used in Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine to treat a wide variety of infections and diseases. It may also boost production of antibodies and macrophages (cells that ingest viruses), making it effective against the common cold. The herb reduces fever, too. Swedes have long used the andrographis remedy Kan Jang for colds and flus and take it regularly throughout the winter for immune support. You can buy andrographis (called Chuan Xin Lian) from a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner or at health food stores. Take as directed at the first sign of a cold or fever. Kilham is founder of Medicine Hunter Inc. Playing it safe with cell phones \"I always use an earpiece with my cell phone to lower my risk of developing brain cancer.\" Keith L. Black, MD, renowned neurosurgeon and scientist in Los Angeles, uses groundbreaking techniques he developed that enable chemotherapy drugs to pass the blood-brain barrier and attack brain cancer. Black is not convinced that cell phones are safe. A recent Finnish study published in the International Journal of Cancer showed that using a cell phone exclusively on one side of the head over a 10-year period increased brain tumor risk by 39%. Until the issue of cell phone safety is resolved definitively, play it safe and purchase a headset; reliable ones can be found for as little as $10. Using an earpiece keeps the microwaves that your phone emits far away from your head. The explosive growth of cell phones has occurred only in the past decade \u2014 too short a time to reveal a spike in brain cancers, which are thought to develop slowly. Black is director of the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Morning meditation \"I do tai chi, qigong, and meditation every morning for 30 minutes.\" Steven K. H. Aung, MD, a family physician in Edmonton, Alberta, treats pain and illness by combining traditional Chinese and modern treatments. For his integrated approach to medicine, he was awarded the Order of Canada in 2006. Recent studies have shown that tai chi, a centuries-old Chinese art, can lessen anxiety and depression, relieve chronic pain, improve sleep quality, and reduce the risk of falls in older adults. Starting at age 7, Aung began learning the ancient techniques from his grandfather, a traditional Chinese physician. \"I don't get sick,\" says Aung, \"and I never have pain.\" Many YMCAs and senior centers offer classes, but you can also find one in your area at or . Aung is an associate clinical professor in the department of family medicine at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. An apple a day... \"I eat fibrous foods daily to prevent tooth decay.\" Richard T. Hansen, DMD, a holistic dentist in Fullerton, CA, has pioneered a variety of uses for lasers in dental care \u2014 for instance, to eliminate potentially harmful bacteria in the mouth before oral surgery. Raw vegetables, apples, and even fish, turkey, and steak act as natural abrasives that scrub the surface of the teeth while you chew, says Hansen. \"They also massage the gum tissue, which makes the gums healthier.\" He suggests eating raw vegetables as often as you can \u2014 \"the greener and more colorful, the better.\" Hansen's theories date to at least 1939, when Canadian dentist Weston Price published \"Nutrition and Physical Degeneration,\" an account of his travels around the world observing the diets and dental health of indigenous cultures. Those who ate traditional local foods packed with the fat-soluble vitamins A and D, such as meats, shellfish, and animal fats, had perfect dental arches, no tooth decay, and virtually no chronic disease. Those who ate modern, processed food had extensive decay and a host of modern maladies like arthritis and cancer. Hansen is founder and director of the Advanced Health Research Institute, a teaching and research center in Fullerton. Savor natural surroundings \"I try to connect with nature every day.\" Tori Hudson, a naturopathic physician in Portland, OR, specializing in women's health, uses nutrition, nutraceuticals, herbs, bioidentical hormones, and other alternative therapies to treat gynecological conditions. One of the main principles of naturopathic medicine is the vis medicatrix naturae \u2014 usually interpreted as the ability of botanicals (herbs, food, etc.) to heal. \"It also means literally being in nature \u2014 surrounding yourself with the therapeutic smells, sounds, and visual beauty of a quiet, contemplative place,\" says Hudson, who lives amid meadows and forest, where she often hikes. She says being alone in the wilderness inspires new ideas as well as more awareness of her body, mind, and spirit. Wherever you live, savor natural surroundings \u2014 whether at the beach, in a forest, or at a neighborhood park or playground. \"You can tease out little islands of nature wherever you are \u2014 even in your own backyard,\" says Hudson. To find a public park, log on to the Project for Public Spaces' Web site, , and click on \"Great Public Spaces.\" Hudson is author of \"Women's Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine.\" Shake up the morning \"I drink a breakfast shake made with spirulina for sustained energy.\" Barbara Brennan, an international bioenergy therapist based in Florida, works with the body's aura to correct energy imbalances that lead to disease. Spirulina is a blue-green algae whose deep blue color comes from pigments such as chlorophyll, phycocyanin, and beta-carotene. Said to be one of the earliest life forms on the planet, spirulina first evolved around 3.6 billion years ago and now thrives in alkaline, freshwater environments. It's rich in protein, antioxidants, and B-complex vitamins and all the essential amino acids. Often called a superfood, spirulina is one of the most superior forms of plant protein and is widely available in health food stores. For a morning shake or a quick pick-me-up in late afternoon, puree 1 cup of soy milk, a banana (frozen or fresh), and 2 or 3 teaspoons of spirulina. You can also add pomegranate juice, berries, and yogurt. Brennan is author of \"Hands of Light: A Guide to Healing Through the Human Energy Field.\" Look on the bright side \"I maintain a positive outlook by putting worry and negative thoughts aside.\" Thomas Rau, MD, an integrative physician and director of the Paracelsus Klinik in Lustmuhle, Switzerland, uses special nutrition, detoxification, and natural therapies to treat chronic asthma, allergies, infections, and arthritis. Research has long equated optimism with good health. Rau, who often works 12-hour days, attributes his good health and stamina to his upbeat attitude. You can start small by practicing positive self-talk (I can handle this!). Putting a positive spin on negative thoughts isn't a skill you'll master overnight, but here's one tip Rau recommends that will keep you from focusing on the downside: Don't say anything more critical to yourself than you would to a colleague you respect. Rau is author of \"The Swiss Secret to Optimal Health.\" An egg for energy \"I eat an egg when my energy is flagging.\" Sarita Shrestha, MD, an Ayurvedic physician from Kathmandu, Nepal, helps women discover their prakuti, or \"true nature,\" so she can design an appropriate daily and seasonal dietetic and behavioral regimen. Eggs are a great source of protein, biotin (a B vitamin essential for healthy hair, skin, and nerves), and choline, a nutrient essential for brain development and memory. Shrestha, a vegetarian, prefers them hard-boiled but will make an omelet with spices when her \"fire is low.\" Try making an egg salad sandwich with Parmesan for lunch or an omelet for dinner. Don't skip the yolks, which are rich in choline; lutein; zeaxanthin; and vitamins A, D, E, and B6. Eggs from pastured hens (those that eat plants and most likely bugs) have three times as much omega-3 fatty acids, twice as much vitamin E, and 40% more vitamin A than eggs from birds fed a typical chicken-farm diet, according to research from Pennsylvania State University. To find eggs from pastured hens, check out . (\"Free-range\" eggs aren't necessarily from pastured hens.) A teacher at the Mount Madonna Institute in Watsonville, CA, since 2000, Shrestha is often referred to as the \"Mother of "}
