KSP-1007, which was developed through this project, advanced to clinical study in the U.S. Development of adjuvanted vaccinesWe are implementing development of adjuvanted vaccines by combining TLR7 agonist adjuvant, our foundation technology, with promising antigens from outside research institutes. We are working on malaria vaccines with Ehime University, etc. and a universal influenza vaccine with the National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition. We are also utilizing external funding with our malaria vaccine awarded from the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT Fund) grant and our influenza vaccine selected for the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) CiCLE (Cyclical Innovation for Clinical Empowerment) program.Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2022model, which pursues advanced industrialization and manufacturing expertise, and cutting-edge science. Thus, we are implementing five research and development projects aimed at providing therapies to patients with unmet medical needs, as well as therapies designed for radical cure. We are steadily promoting research projects mainly in Neurology and Ophthalmology areas in pursuit of early commercialization. We are also setting our sights on next-generation regenerative medicine (gene therapy, organ regeneration, genome editing, autologous cell therapy, and peripheral services including diagnosis and rehabilitation) and aim for global expansion (Japan, the United States, and Asia). First, we intend to realize financial contributions mainly in Japan and the United States during the next MTBP period (fiscal 2023-2027).Comprising two aboveground levels with a total floor area of 2,915 m\u00b2, Sumitomo Pharma Manufacturing Plant for Regenerative Medicine & Cell Therapy (SMaRT) is the world's first facility dedicated to the commercial manufacture of regenerative medicine and cell therapy products derived from allogeneic iPS cells. The Plant complies with the latest standards, including GCTP (Good Gene, Cellular, and Tissue-based Products Manufacturing Practice), a standard for manufacturing and quality management of regenerative medicine and cell therapy. In addition to manufacturing clinical study materials, we plan to carry out commercial production after obtaining approval. Furthermore, in 2022 we have started the construction of a manufacturing plant in the U.S. for cell therapy products. The facility will manufacture \"RETHYMIC\u00ae,\" an allogeneic cultured thymus tissue for which consolidated subsidiary Enzyvant Therapeutics Ltd. has obtained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We plan to also make the facility capable of producing allogeneic iPS cell-derived products, which we are looking to commercialize.Research in progress at the Regenerative & Cellular Medicine Kobe CenterThrough regenerative medicine and cell therapy products, we look to provide novel radical therapies for diseases for which only symptomatic relief and temporary suppression of progression have been available to date. To this end, we are also conducting research and development to create complex structures such as tissues and organs from iPS cells and put them into practical use as regenerative medicine and cell therapy products.In addition to our world-leading expertise in regenerative medicine and cell therapy field, we have the production infrastructure, know-how, and human resources to commercialize our products and therapies. We are also working for pharmaceutical deregulation aiming at commercialization.Through joint research with academia and others, we will contribute to global health and aim for commercialization during the next MTBP period (fiscal 2023-2027).Practice & "}
