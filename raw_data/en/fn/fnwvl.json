Before making a decision about what treatments or procedures to consider, a patient should understand the pros and cons of any treatment/procedure - the benefits and the risks. The risks include any side effects and any complications. To ensure that the patient understands the benefits and dangers of any treatments or procedures, various states, agencies, and medical boards require that the doctor who is responsible for the treatments and procedures should obtain a written informed consent from the patient. The written document should list the benefits and risks of the treatment or procedure. By signing and dating the written informed consent, the patient is acknowledging he/she has been informed of the possible consequences - and agrees that the treatments and procedures can be provided to the patient. The treatments and procedures that require a patient's informed consent include: - Medical research. The [Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/faq/informed-consent/index.html)(HHS) requires that researchers obtain the [legally effective informed consent](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/faq/what-is-legally-effective-informed-consent/index.html)of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, unless: - The research is exempt under federal law - There are appropriate waivers -if waivers are permitted for the type of research being conducted [FDA has its own set of informed consent requirements](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/informed-consent) - Treatments and procedures performed by a doctor or another type of health provider who has the legal authority to provide the treatment or procedure. What is the relationship between informed consent and a risk waiver? By signing the waiver (if properly worded), the patient does more than acknowledge his/her understanding of the pros and cons of the treatment or procedure. The signature on the informed consent form generally will be used by the doctor, hospital, or another healthcare provider to protect the doctor, hospital or another healthcare provider from liability. The liability protection is generally confined to complaints by the patient that an adverse consequence occurred during the treatment or procedure - that was identified on the informed consent document. Essentially, medical professionals use informed consent forms for more than just providing information. The professionals use the form as a waiver of liability claims by the patient. Informed consent forms are also called liability waivers, risk waivers, medical release forms, release of liability forms, and other similar names. There is a reverse problem for doctors. The signing of an informed consent/risk waiver may protect the physician or healthcare provider that provides the treatment or procedure from a liability claim. Conversely, the physician or healthcare provider may be subject to a medical malpractice claim (for non-emergency treatments or procedures - if the patient suffers as a result of the treatment or procedure. The physician or healthcare provider may even be liable if the physician or healthcare provider does everything correctly - because the patient may argue he/she wouldn't have had the treatment or procedure if he/she had known of the possible dangers. A physician or healthcare provider may also be liable - if there is a signed informed consent - if the treatment or procedure provided is different than what was identified in the informed consent document. Even with an informed consent, doctors may also be liable for other reasons - such as mistakes that were clearly avoidable such as leaving a surgical instrument in a patient after the surgery is complete.

Common risks with drugs include the possible side effects, the dangers involved with taking the prescribed amounts, the dangers with taking amounts other than prescribed amounts, possible interactions with other drugs, and many other adverse consequences. - Research. Many doctors, universities, hospitals, agencies, and other entities conduct research on the effectiveness of various drugs and various treatments. The people who volunteer to participate in these clinical studies have the right to be informed of the possible risks and dangers. An informed consent may be required for many other types of reasons.

The law prohibits: Hospice providers (and hospice staff and agents for the hospice) from \"paying referral sources for the referral of patients to the hospice.\" \"A hospice salesperson, recruiter, agent, or employee who receives compensation or remuneration for hospice referrals or admissions from providing consultation on hospice services, hospice election, or informed consent to a patient, patient's family, or patient's representative.\" Certain authorized persons, such as a registered nurse or a medical social work can \"complete the election of hospice, informed consent, completed signatures, and counsel on the election of hospice with a patient, patient's family, or patient's representative.\" The new law also requires that that hospice give a patient or his/her representative a verbal and written notice of the patient's rights and responsibilities - in a language and manner the patient or representative can understand - before providing any care. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers should understand when an informed consent from a patient is required and the terms and explanations that must be set forth in the informed consent.
