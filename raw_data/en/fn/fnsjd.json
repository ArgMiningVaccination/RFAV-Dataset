[Grass Fed and Organic Beef Liver](https://www.hayesmeadow.com/index.php/product/beef-liver/) can provide many of the necessary vitamins and minerals we need to do that.

Quick, tasty, nutrient dense meal. It's naturally gluten-free, paleo, low-carb, and keto. Ingredients: - liver - milk - onions - bacon - butter - salt The trick is to smother it in sweet caramelized onions and crispy bacon.

Drain the strips of bacon on paper towels. Then cut them into 1/2 inch pieces and set aside. Reserve some tablespoons of the bacon grease in the skillet. Add two tablespoons of butter and the onion slices. Cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally until the onions are caramelized, about 25 minutes. Make sure to regulate the heat so that the butter remains hot but does not burn. Remove the onions to a dish, sprinkle with salt, and set aside. Now for the liver.

Serve topped with onions and bacon. And that's it. A tasty, nutrient dense meal in just 30 minutes. I cooked this last night. It was delicous and "}
