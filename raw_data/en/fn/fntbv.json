This upsurge in the number of female workers has increased the number of women living with double roles: as a worker outside the house and as a housewife. According to Triaryati [ [2](#B2)], this phenomenon not only creates more pressure to time management and energy spending, but also potentially increases stress and conflicts at home and workplace [ [3](#B3)]. One of the main potential risks for working mothers with infants is related to lactation behaviour. Not every working mother is able to breastfeed or pump breast milk at her workplace due to the lack of breastfeeding support and facilities at the workplace. In Indonesia, only 21.5% of outhouse working mothers get access to proper lactation facilities. It has been estimated that 7.5% of women workers have the privilege to have access to an adequate lactation program at their workplace [ [4](#B4)]. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among working mothers, especially factory workers in 2015, was only 19%, far behind national prevalence which was 32% [ [4](#B4)]. BENEFITS OF BREASTFEEDING Benefits for babies [5](#B5) [6](#B6) [7](#B7)]. WHO defines exclusive breastfeeding as a baby that only receives breastmilk without any other liquids, including water, formula milk, fruit juice, tea, honey, or any solid food except vitamins and medicines [ [5](#B5) [8](#B8)]. [9](#B9)]. Breastmilk also contains oligosaccharides that can stimulate the growth of healthy gut microbiota. Oligosaccharide components in breastmilk can help strengthen infant's immune system in their early life. Numerous studies have shown the benefit of breastmilk in protecting infants from infections, such as acute otitis media [ [10](#B10) [11](#B11)], [15](#B15) [16](#B16) [17](#B17)]. For long-term health, exclusive breastfeeding could reduce the risk of obesity in older children, adolescents, and even adults [ [18](#B18)]. Breastmilk also contains probiotics which support the maturation of immune system through gut associated lymphoid tissue [ [19](#B19) [20](#B20) [21](#B21)]. Exclusive breastfeeding could also decrease the risk to develop diabetes and help stabilize blood pressure and cholesterol level throughout a lifespan [ [22](#B22) [23](#B23) [24](#B24)]. Psychologically, breastfeeding strengthens the emotional relationship between mother and child [ [8](#B8)]. Benefits for mothers [25](#B25) [26](#B26) [27](#B27) [28](#B28)]. Exclusive breastfeeding decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease [ [29](#B29)]. It also improves the quality of life and mental health. Several studies have shown that lactation for less than 6 months and emotional distress during delivery increase the risk to develop post-natal depression [ [30](#B30) [31](#B31) [32](#B32)]. Breastfeeding is a natural contraception method as it prolongs the amenorrhea period and helps maintain prolactin concentration known as a lactation amenorrhoea method (LAM). The Bellagio and Kennedy consensus in 1988 and 1996, respectively, resulted in experts to recommend LAM as a family planning option to prevent pregnancy in the first 6 months after delivery. Its effectiveness could reach 98% by giving exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, resulting in amenorrhoea [ Studies have revealed that the breastfeeding rate decreases strongly when mothers return to work [ [35](#B35) [36](#B36) [37](#B37) [38](#B38)]. The main reasons are the distance between home and workplace, unavailability of lactation facilities at the workplace, and decreased milk production during working hours [ [35](#B35) [36](#B36) [37](#B37)]. [35](#B35)]. Data from Indonesia are better. According to the Ministry of Health, 62.5% of mothers continue to breastfeed after having returned to work. Data collected in a private company in Jakarta are similar (56.7%) [ [36](#B36)]. However, Basrowi et al. [ [4](#B4)] have found that 45% of working mothers in Indonesia have stopped to breastfeeding at their infant's third month of age because of return-to-work. Limited lactation facilities and support programs in workplace and inadequate knowledge about how to do breastmilk pumping and store breastmilk are the main reasons of discontinuation [ [36](#B36) [37](#B37) [38](#B38)]. The Indonesian's Breastfeeding Mother's a lactation counsellor at work, lactation facilities, and support by peers would be critical to help working mothers continue breastfeeding [ [39](#B39) [40](#B40) [41](#B41)]. Adequate lactation facilities and program at the workplace can improve lactation incidence by three-fold and increase exclusive breastfeeding rates by six times (odds ratio, 5.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.78-19.79; p<0.050) [ [4](#B4)]. However, managers and employers consider that breast pumping during working hours might hamper productivity and affect working performance [ [42](#B42)]. However, no research on this topic has been performed. BREASTFEEDING FRIENDLY POLICY AT WORKPLACE [43](#B43)]. The Government Regulation on Exclusive Breastfeeding in 2012 obliges every citizen, including employers, to promote success of exclusive breastfeeding. Every workplace is mandatory to support dedicated lactation room in the workplace with standardized facilities ( [Table 1](#T1)). In 2013, the Ministry of Health issued a technical guideline about the presence of a lactation room at the workplace [ [44](#B44) [45](#B45)]. However, this regulation was not supported with a standard labour regulation at the workplace. Occupational health and safety management systems such as the Guideline for the implementation of Occupational Health and Safety Zone 18001 in 2007 or the Guidelines on occupational safety and health (OSH) management systems International Labour Organization (ILO)-OSH in 2001 did not include any clausal on the availability of lactation facilities and program at the workplace. Government regulation on occupational health and safety has a section on the prohibition of employment termination during maternity leave as well as a suggestion clausal of lactation facility at workplace. However, these articles do not include a clear guideline on promotion, education, or counselling aspects of breastfeeding and lactation [ [46](#B46)]. Therefore, the joined regulation between three ministers failed to improve exclusive breastfeeding rate among female workers in Indonesia due to the lack of a standardized guideline on lactation promotion at workplace. [47](#B47) [48](#B48)]. Lactation promotion programs at the workplace have been applied in many countries. However, very limited to no studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of workplace-based lactation intervention programs on exclusive breastfeeding rate among female workers and the relationship of such programs with working performance and productivity. According to Cochrane Reviews in 2007 and 2012, no randomized controlled trial has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a workplace lactation intervention program [ [49](#B49)]. SUPPORT FOR FEMALE WORKERS AMONG COUNTRIES [56](#B56)]. [Table 2](#T2)). Taiwan urges companies to provide maternity leave for 8 months. In addition, Taiwan asks industries to implement breastfeeding and lactation friendly policy by protecting mothers so that they have flexible breastfeeding break time. Companies are obliged to provide dedicated lactation room. However, companies do not have obligations to provide breast pump device. Workers should bring the pump by themselves [ [57](#B57)]. Hong Kong also supports workers to continue breastfeeding after returning to work. Workers who plan to pump breastmilk during working hours should discuss this with their supervisor to set the schedule. Their supervisor should support them by providing a comfortable environment, such as giving permission for having breastfeeding breaks (e.g., two times within 8-working hour, each for 30 minutes break) until their child reaches the age of one year, providing a dedicated space for lactation with a comfortable chair, electric pumping, and storage facilities for breastmilk. Every worker should support their colleagues to breastfeed as it is proven to increase lactation practice among working mothers [ [58](#B58)]. [59](#B59)]. The fifteen Save the Children's State of the World's Mothers Report in 2014 stated that three Scandinavian countries (Finland, Sweden, and Norway) were the top ranked among 178 countries in Mother's Index assessment for the wellbeing of mothers and children in which maternity protection for working women was part of the report [ [60](#B60)]. Partnerships among government, health association, and non-government organization are found to have common objectives to support and protect breastfeeding in all aspects. In Norway, due to the Norwegian Association of Breastfeeding, \"Ammehjelpen\", government policy has gradually increased the length of maternal leave to be one year with 80% pay or 46 weeks with full pay. Labour market regulations in Norway also entitle women to take necessary break if they breastfeed or to shorten their working day by one hour [ [61](#B61)]. In Finland, the government regulation entitles all pregnant mothers, be it working or non-working mothers, to use maternity healthcare clinics for free on regular basis [ [62](#B62)]. The Swedish legislation on parental leave and maternal protection is very comprehensive, with a large collection of acts and regulations. Most importantly, it provides parental leave (maternity, paternity, and child-care leave) with a total combined duration of 480 calendar days (almost 69 weeks or >17 months) for both parents until the child is 18 months old. Female employees are also entitled to nursing breaks without specific duration of times. This means breastfeeding breaks during working hours can be taken as long as the female employee continues to breastfeed [ [60](#B60)]. BREASTFEEDING AND WORKING MOTHERS' PRODUCTIVITY [40](#B40)] found that 51.1% of female workers assumed that taking break for breast pumping two times during working hours could lower their work efficiency. Breastfeeding at the workplace could actually improve productivity and decrease days of absenteeism since infants are healthier than children receiving formula milk "}
