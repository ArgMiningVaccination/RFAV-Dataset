Hi! I'm Dr. Sandra Hanna (aka Doc Hanna) Mom of two amazing boys, Holistic Chiropractor, Acupuncturist and Global Wellness Educator. I absolutely love spending my time being a Mom to my boys and a Natural Medicine Doctor to my clients and patients! Over the past two decades of my private practice I have seen thousands of men & women like you suffering from always being tired and having pain all throughout your body at the end of your work day. Whether you work inside the home or at a corporate job, we women often put themselves last on our own to do lists. We give and give and give to our families and our jobs yet run out of \"juice\" when it comes to our own physical, mental and emotional needs. To help my loved ones and clients feel better gives me such fulfillment in life. "}
