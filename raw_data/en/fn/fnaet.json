As Healthcare Providers taking care of our most vulnerable population, you have the opportunity to be amongst the first to become vaccinated aga inst the deadly COVID -19 virus and those vaccinations are taking place as we speak. Our correctional staff will also be offered the vaccination in advance of the general population. It is our hope that this will occur sooner rat her than later, but many logistical factors will impact the speed of the vaccine rollout for groups that follow 1A (Healthcare). As of this writing, we have had over 85.2 Million cases of COVID -19 with more than 1.85 Million deaths worldwide. In the U.S., there have been over 20.7 Million persons infected and 352,000 people that have lost their lives qualifying as the deadliest single event to affect our nation in over a century. In Illinois, there has been more than 982,000 cases with over 18,000 deaths in just nine months. Within IDOC alone, we have had 3,495 total staff positives, 8,578 total offender positives with the death of one staff person and 70 offenders. Beyond death, the suffering of COVID -19 \"long haulers \" with protracted disease courses has led to debilitation and suffering. It is clear that because of the unique nature of prisons and other congregant living facilities, those under our care are at a significant risk for infection and death particularly given the high -risk health population we s erve. Because of this, CDC and the ACIP have identified healthcare workers at the highest risk level and have therefore been designated as a priority group to receive the COVID -19 vaccine. Though this vaccination is not currently mandatory, it is our since re hope that all our healthcare providers and ultimately our correctional staff and offender population will become vaccinated. Getting vaccinated will not only protect the health of yourselves and family but those under your care that do not have the priv ilege to isolate and care for themselves. Asymptomatic persons infected with COVID -19 are believed to be a significant source of the spread of the disease. With your help as healthcare providers and correctional staff within IDOC, you have the opportunity to create a safer environment for those under your care. Many healthcare workers around the world have already received the first dose of the vaccine and will be completing the 2 nd dose shortly. The side effect profile is similar to that of other vaccines. Both Moderna and Pfizer have an exceptional safety profile and the efficacy is at 95% for both products based on peer reviewed, randomized double blind studies. The overwhelming majority of vaccine recipients complain only of injection site soreness, simi lar to other vaccines. It is also important to realize that though mRNA vaccines are a newer technique, the science and technology has been studied and perfected for decades and there has never been a more important time in our nation and the world 's hist ory to attempt a wide scale vaccination of our entire population to put an end to a deadly pandemic that has brought so much harm to us all. How and where will I receive the Covid -19 Vaccination? Please be aware that the Illinois Department of Public Healt h has tasked our local health departments with providing the COVID -19 vaccination to our employees. Your Warden and Health Care Administrators will provide you with information as to where and when you may be able to receive your vaccination from the healt h department that serves your facility. Some vaccinations may be onsite at your prison facility while others will be at an offsite pod designated by IDPH. All vaccinations will be tracked by the provider who will also schedule the 2nd dose of the shot. Our community is only as strong as each participant. Our offender population is likely to follow our lead. It is our hope that each of you will take advantage of this groundbreaking intervention that has the potential to mitigate the spread of this deadly vir us. The Office of Health Services would like to thank our dedicated healthcare and frontline workers for all that you have done to care for our offenders, including our most vulnerable. You are the heroes of this global pandemic and we sincerely thank you for your service. If you have questions regarding the vaccine, the Office of Health Service has attached several fact sheets about both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.
