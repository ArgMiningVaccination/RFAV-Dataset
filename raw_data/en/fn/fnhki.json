Unfortunately, media sources do not always provide balanced and complete information about vaccines.8- 10 The first part of this report presents examples of recent media coverage about vaccination, describing how the controversies took place and what were the concerns raised by the media . Three cases are discus sed: the controversies about the pertussis vaccine, the Measles -Mumps -Rubella (MMR) vaccine and the link with autism, and the HPV vaccine. Then, diffe rent tools are presented to help public health practitioners develop communications about vaccines. Pertussis vaccine and the resurgence of the anti -vaccination movement 25 The pertussis vaccine controversy that started in the mid -1970s is often considered to be the match that lit the resurgent fire of active anti -vaccination o pposition in modern days.11,12 The controversy started in the United Kingdom (UK) after the publication of a report from the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children in London, alleging that 36 children suffered serious neurological conditions following the Diphtheria -Tetanus -Pertussis (DTP) immunization.13 This report garnered much media attention and triggered waves of public concerns.14 The Association of Parents o f Vaccine Damaged Children was founded in the UK in 1974 , and played a key role in drawing attention to this purported safety problem with the whole -cell pertussis vaccine.15 By 1977, childhood pertussis vaccination coverage in the UK had declined from 77% to 33%. Three major epidemics of pertussis followed soon thereafter, with over 100,000 cases and the deaths of at least 36 children.11 Despite reassurance about the vaccine's safety by the UK Joint Commission on Vaccination and Immunization, based on a large study that had looked at every child hospitalized in the U K with neurological diseases,16 great o pposition to the vaccine continued. Attempts to reassure the public continued, but by the mid -1980s the controversy had swept through most of Europe, Japan, the United States of America (USA), the Soviet Union and Australia.17 In 1975 in Japan, after the deaths of two children who had just received Dip htheria -Pertussis -Tetanus (DPT) vaccine, the Ministry of Health and Welfare suspended the use of the whole -cell pertussis vaccine for infants. This was followed by major outbreaks of pertussis.18,19 Angst about the safety of whole -cell pertussis vaccine spurred on the development of less reactogenic acellular pertussis vaccines.20-22 In the USA, the anti -vaccine controversy began with the Emmy -winning 1982 documentary entitled 'DTP: Vaccination Roulette' that alleged the pertussis component was causing severe brain damage, seizures and mental retardation. As in the UK, concerne d and angry parents formed victim advocacy groups, such as the National Vaccine Information Center, which is still active today.23 Several lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers were instigated, resulting in increased vaccine prices and a drop in the number of companies producing vaccines.12 In response, the US Congress, in 1988, passed the Na tional Childhood Vaccine Injury bill to protect manufacturers from lawsuits by establishing and maintaining an accessible and efficient no -fault alternative program to the traditional tort system for individuals found to be injured by certain vaccines. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a passive surveillance system where suspected side effects of vaccines could be reported by parents and health professionals, was also created by this Act.24 5 The Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre The MMR vaccine and autism controversy started with a study by the former Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published in The Lancet in 1998. In this study, Wakefield claimed that the MMR vaccine could cause autism. This article was heavily reported by the British media, especially by the tabloids, giving rise to a public debate on vaccine safety.26 MMR controversy and the effect of balanced information 25 Andrew Wakefield is a former British surgeon who first attracted attention when he published a paper proposing a link between the measles virus and Crohn's disease in 199327 and two years later, in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet , between the measles vaccine s and Crohn's disease.28 Subsequent research failed to confirm these two hypotheses.29 While he was still conducting research on Crohn's disease, Wakefield was approached by the parent of an autistic child, who was seeking help for bowel problems. Wakefield turned his attention to researching possible connections between the MMR vaccine and autism.30 In 1998, Wakefield published, with 12 colleague s, a paper about 12 autistic children in The Lancet31 (retracted). In this paper, the authors claimed that they had 'identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers'31 (retracted). At the ti me of his MMR research study, Wakefield was a senior lecturer and honorary consultant in experimental gastroenterology at the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine. Although the paper stated that no causal connection had been proven, before it was publish ed, Wakefield made statements at a press conference and in a video news release issued by the hospital, calling for a suspension of the triple MMR vaccine until more research could be done.32 This was immediately controversial, leading to widespread publicity and a drop in vaccination rates in the UK. This was the beginning of the MMR vaccination scare that swept throughout the world.33 Following Wakefield's claim, multiple epidemiological studies were undertaken; all found no link between MMR vaccination and autism.34-38 In February 2004, after a four - month investigation, reporter Brian Deer wrote in The Sunday Times of London that, prior to submitting his paper to The Lancet , Wakefield had received \u00a355,000 from legal firms see king evidence to use against vaccine manufacturers, that several of the parents quoted as saying that MMR had damaged their children were also litigants , and that Wakefield had not informed colleagues or medical authorities of the conflict of interest.39 In March 2004, immediately following the news of the conflict -of-interest allegations, 10 of Wakefield's 12 co -authors retracted.40 In 2007, Wakefield and two of his co -authors were charged by the General Med ical Council (GMC) - which is responsible for licensing doctors and supervising medical ethics in the UK - of serious professional misconduct. On January 28, 2010, the GMC panel delivered its decision on the facts of the case: Wakefield was found to have a cted 'dishonestly and irresponsibly' and to have acted with 'callous disregard' for the children involved in his study, conducting unnecessary and invasive tests.41 Wakefield lost the right to practise medicine in the UK. Soon afterward, The Lancet took the very uncommon step of retroactively retra cting his article.42 Media have played a crucial role in conveying the MMR controversy. For Boyce, all the \"ingredients\" were there to create a controversy, especially the fact that news needs to be \"newsworthy.\" For instance, the public disagreement betwee n Professor Arie Zuckerman (the dean of the hospital's medical school) and Andrew Wakefield at the press conference served to fuel media interest in the story.43 Boyce noted that, of over 285 stories published in UK media from February 1 to September 15, 2002, 40% included the word controversy/controversial at least once.43 This controversy was also led by an emphasis on vaccine risk rather th an on disease risk: out of 262 stories, 59% presented risks from the MMR vaccine, whereas only 13% contained information on the risks of measles.43 Some authors also suggest that this controversy may have been triggered by the journalistic norm of presenting \"balanced\" information. To fulfill this norm, some journalists try tryin g to present all viewpoints as equal. As Larson mentioned, \"Media attempts to balance coverage by provision of equal opportunity to all viewpoints exacerbate the challenges to public 6 The Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre confidence in vaccines by allowing outlier views and small extremist opinions the same media space as views validated through a rigorous process of peer review by the scientific community.\"44 Boyce noted that, out of 285 stories around the MMR controversy, 48% presented balanced information (which means pro - and anti -MMR vaccine information), 32% presented anti -MMR vaccine information only, and 20% presented pro -MMR vaccine inf ormation only.43 However, Boyce highlighted that balanced stories were actu ally weighted more heavily on the anti -MMR side.43 This may explain why balanced information has been shown to increase parents' uncertainty about vaccination.45 In contrast, the findings of a content analysis of traditional media coverage in Canada of the measles outbreak that occurred at Disneyland in 2015 showed that the coverage was largely positive toward vaccination.46 Almost all articles used medical sources to reinforce their message, namely to encourage people to make sure their immunizations were up to date and to reinforce the importance of vaccination. Articles often included quotes from doctors, epidemiologists, experts, health ministers and so on in order to support their arguments.46 They were making an evident effort to explain the symptoms of measles, how t he disease can spread, and how it can be easily transmitted, to reinforce the importance of vaccination. The terms used to qualify measles were \"highly contagious illness,\" \"most infectious disease\" (repeated several times, including in headlines), \"dread ful illnesses\" or \"devastating.\" On the other hand, vaccination was presented as the only way to prevent risk and contain the outbreak with sentences such as \"The MMR vaccine reversed the death toll of measles in just a few years.\" It \"has saved the lives of millions of people,\" it is the \"right\" to protect your children, it \"has eliminated formerly common childhood diseases,\" and it is \"incredibly safe.\" Vaccination was presented by the former federal health minister, Rona Ambrose, as a \"medicine miracle\"; the vaccine is \"the best way to prevent disease and its complication\"; and there is \"no link to autism.\" During the outbreak, media discourses in Canada were heavily pro -vaccine.46 The \"anti -vaxxers\" were generally describ ed as ignorant, scared, selfish or dangerous.46 However, there was no evaluation on the impact of this positive discourse in mass media on public understanding and acceptance of MMR vaccination in Canada. Studies in other c ontexts have suggested that the MMR -autism controversy has led to a decline in MMR vaccine uptake and subsequently to the resurgence of measles in areas with sustained negative media coverage.9 HPV Vaccine Controversies The human papillomavirus (HPV) was introduced in Canada in February 2007 and was recommended for female s aged 9 -26 years.47 Several content analyses have been conducted on the traditional media coverage of HPV and HPV vaccine in the United States,6,48 -52 in Europe,2,53 in Australia,54 and in Canada.10,55 -57 Several themes were recurrent among all these studies and are presented in Table 1. Content analysi s of media coverage has shown that the HPV vaccine has always been subject to controversies. In Denmark, a strong controversy occurred after the distribution of a documentary presenting interviews with families and vaccinated girls with medically unexplained symptoms: \"The Vaccinated Girls - Sick and Betrayed.\" This controversy has led to a serious drop in HPV vaccination uptake, from around 79% (for the 2000 birth cohort) to 17% (for the 2003 birth cohort).59 Table 1 - HPV and HPV Vaccine Media Coverage Themes Quotes References Safety and security HPV vaccine is poorly understood by science Question s about the length of protection Long term effects Side effects are not reported \"Our Girls Are Not Guinea Pigs .\" MacLeans's (August 2007).58 \"However, it's not known how long its protection will last or if women will have to receive booster shots later in life.\" The Globe and Mail (June 2006).10 \"Lead author, McGill University epidemiologist Abby Lippman, warned that the long -term effects of the Gardasil vaccine are not kn own.\" The National Post (November 2007).10 \"...really bad reactions have been reported, including seizures, paralysis \u2014and worst of all, three deaths ...\" Maclean's (August 2007).55 Abdelmutti and Hoffman -Goetz: 2009 Perez 2016 Vivion, Dub\u00e9 and Gagnon: 201 6 Promiscuity and change in sexuality Idea that the vaccine could encourage sexual behaviour.

Casciotti, Smith and Klassen: 2014 Ethical issues HPV vaccine inequitably distributed (girls only) Consent forms are not clearly informing girls \"...the current push for young girls to be immunized largely ignores the group of women most affected [by cervical cancer]: immigrants, refugees, Aboriginals, the disabled, poor and those living in remote regions ...\" Maclean's (August 2007).55 Abdelmutti and Hoffman -Goetz: Klassen: 2014 Vivion, Dub\u00e9 and Gagnon: 2016 9 The Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre Even if the number of articles that were positive towards the HPV vaccine did increase over time compared to negative articles, controversies could still spark easily,58 as shown by recent examples in Ontario and Quebec. In February 2015, the Toronto Star has published a n article entitled \"A wonder drug's dark side,\" questioning HPV vaccine safety;60 a request for a moratorium on the public HPV vaccination prog ram was published in Le Devoir in 2015.61 In summary, these examples have shown how vaccines could be presented negatively or positively by tradi tional media, depending on the circumstances and the risk context. Media coverage can also have an impact on vaccine acceptance, as negative media coverage may lead to a decrease in vaccine confidence and an increase in perceived vaccine risk.9,17 Also, even if the content is supporting vaccination, the media might present inaccurate information or biased information that may need to be rectified by health officials.55 However, controversies and misinformation could not be addressed by simply providing accurate information. As stated by Nyhan and collaborators: \"Pro -vaccine messages do no t always work as intended. The effectiveness of those messages may vary depending on existing parental attitudes toward vaccines. For some parents, they may actually increase misperceptions or reduce vaccination intention.\"62 For instance, one study shows a variation in vaccine uptake between different groups that were exposed to the same media coverage.7 During a 2003 polio outbreak in Israel , an association was observed between media exposure in favour of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and vaccination uptake. This association was mostly among Jews and individuals of higher socio -economic status.7 This aspect indicates the co mplexity of communication as a \"one size fits all\" message cannot be applied. Media attention to vaccination can be the result of different factors. To attract readers, specific types of media, such as tabloids, often go for stories covering sensational issues with highly emotive content and are less likely to cover more sober, scientific issues.63 For instance, these sensational issues can include concerns about safety, reported cases of diseases despite the existence of a vaccine, reports of Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI), or claims by anti-vaccination groups. The introduction of new vaccines can also create signifi cant media attention. The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has listed the different conditions that may draw media and public attention to vaccines.64 What draws media/public attention to a story?64 Emotion or fear Disaster or other high -profile event Drama with personal aspects (e.g. thalidomide) Controversy or conflict (e.g., minister versus industry) Unknown or uncertain cause Exposes malpractice and negligence Many people affected Unexpected (measles vaccine and autism) Polarity of views Location (close to own country or hospital) Discussion (miracle drug or poison, stereotypes to fall back on) Celebrity link \u2014 heroes and heroines Children or pregnant women involved Credible/believable rumour or media story They like The dramatic Accuracy and simplicity Statistics with explanation, if possible Context (part of a wider picture) Comments or explanation from the highest authority possible Controversial issues To investigate both sides of a story A timely response They will ask WHO is affected/is responsible? WHAT has happened? What is being done? WHERE has it happened? WHEN did it happen? WHY did it happen? 10 The Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre How to address vaccine controversies in traditional media Before developing tools, it is important to have a complete understanding of the vaccine -related events, as this will lead to the appropriate communication action. In addition, not all events will have the same impact on public acceptance of the vaccination program. For instance, the recall of a vaccine in another country that is not used in Canada is likely to have low impact, whereas a serious vaccine reaction duri ng a mass campaign in Canada is likely to have a high impact. A good understanding of the vaccine -related events and potential impacts is needed in order to develop a communication response. Figure 1 illustrates different communication actions by assess ing the potential impact on vaccination programs by the type of vaccine -related event. Figure 1 - Types of Vaccine -Related Events64 11 The Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre Developing a vaccination communication plan Media communication needs planning; therefore it is essential to develop an appropriate media communication plan . For example, the WHO has developed a communication plan template to help identify major topics that a communication plan should include.64 Figure 2 - Communication Plan Template64 Begin with a clear picture of what you want to accomplish and why you want to accomplish it. Set realisti c, measurable goals that support the program and the organization. Working through the following steps will help you create a communications plan. 1. Background: Define the problem or opportunity. Appropriate objectives cannot be set without a clear understa nding of the problem. The background is a situation analysis that explains the context of the communications initiative being undertaken. 2. Goals : The goals are generally to inform, persuade, motivate or achieve mutual understanding. 3. Objectives: The o bjectives should be focused on the audience and be measurable. Include two to three statements that will support the achievement of your goals, for example: Informational (awareness) Motivational (action -oriented). 4. Target audience: Identify specific comm on-interest groups to whom the communications messages will be directed. Prioritize audiences in order of importance. It is helpful to develop around three key messages for each target audience, each with two supporting facts. These messages should be kept simple, short, and concise. 5. Choose messages: Pinpoint what you want the audience to hear and retain. Design the key information that should be communicated. Think of general conceptual messages. What do they need to hear, about what, and what do you want them to do? It is helpful to develop around three key messages for each target audience, each with two supporting facts. These messages should be kept simple, short, and concise. 6. Develop strategies: The strategy describes how the objective is to be achie ved. A strategy is a plan of action that provides guidelines and themes for the overall effort. Communications tools that can be used to implement strategies include news releases, brochures, radio announcements, special events and media interviews. Make s ure the chosen communication tools are appropriate for each audience. 7. Coordinate time frame: Develop a timetable that shows the start and completion time of each strategy. 8. Budget: How much will it cost to implement the communications plan? 9. Evaluation: Build in evaluation criteria \u2014 these should be realistic, credible and specific. The most widely practised form of evaluating communications plans is the compilation of press clippings, and radio and television coverage so as to measure the response to the \"call to action.\" While all sections of the communication plan are essential for a successful public health communication, we will concentrate on how to develop messages. 12 The Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre Developing the messages Messages should be developed by taking different aspects into consideration. First, vaccine information can be very complex, so it is important to simplify complex information. The communication plan needs to be tailored to the audience and the information needs to be simple to understand. For example : Avoid medical jargon or complex technical or scientific data. Instead, present information in layman's terms (e.g ., \"upper arm muscle\" rather than \"deltoid\"). Use active language. Make every sentence active . Be positive. Talk about what you can do, not what you cannot. Keep it short. Stick to one key message, one memorable sentence that is 10 -15 seconds long. Be specific. Address a particular challenge and a specific audience. A well -chosen design of printed material may speak louder than words. Use compelling photographs, an unusual size format, or some other creative feature, but do not assume that a publication needs to be glossy. A simple presentation may be more effective. If you invest a great de al of resources in researching and writing a publication, be sure to also invest sufficient resources to ensure that it is appropriately designed and widely distributed.64 Second, it could be difficult to communicate complex ideas regarding vaccines, such as explaining that there is less risk in pursuing the course of action A rather than the course of action B ; the audience may hear and understand only part of your message.64 When a vacc ine crisis arises, the audience may become fearful and generate anger, frustration, fear, outrage or concern. These emotions should be taken into consideration when the message is delivered.64 How to address a myth As mentioned before, myths about vaccination, such as the link between MMR vaccine and autism, still persist despite the study being retracted. Cook and Lewandowsky indicate that debunking a myth could actually reinforce the myth since once people receive misinformation it is quite difficult to remove its influence.65 Cook and Lewandowsky have identified different risks in debunking myths, called \"backfire effects\", and how to address those risks when communicating with the public. The Familiarity Backfire Effect: To debunk a myth, we need to mention it. However, th is could reinforce the myth.65 What to do: Not mentioning the myth is sometimes not a practical option. In this case, the emphasis of the debunking should be on the facts. The often -seen technique of headlining the debunking with the myth in big, bold letters is the last thing to do. Instead, com municate your core fact in the headline. The debunking should begin with an emphasis on the facts, not the myth. The goal is to increase people's familiarity with the facts.65 The Overkill Backfire Effect: Giving to o much information or argumen t can make the information difficult to process. The \"Overkill Backfire Effect\" occurs because processing many arguments takes more effort than just considering a few.65 What to do: The solution is to keep the content lean, mean and easy to r ead. Making the content easy to process means using every tool available. Use simple language, short sentences, subheadings and paragraphs. Avoid dramatic language and derogatory comments that alienate people. Stick to the facts.65 13 The Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre The Worldview Backfire Effect: The third and arguably most potent backfire effect occurs with topics that tie in with people's worldviews and sense of cultural identity. Several cognitive processes can cause people to unconsciously process information in a biased way. For those who are strongly fixed in their views, being confronted with counter - arguments can cause their views to be strengthened.65 What to do: The \"Worldview Backfire Effect\" is strongest among those already fixed in their view s. There is a greater chance of correcting misinformation among those not as firmly decided about hot -button issues. This suggests that outreaches should be directed towards the undecided majority rather than the unswayable minority.65 Second, messages can be presented in ways that reduce typical psychological resistance. For example, when worldview -threatening messages are coupled with so -called self - affirmation, people become more balanced in considering pro and con information.65 Filling the gap with an alternative explanation When a myth is debunked, a gap is created in the person's mind. To be effective, the debunking must fill that gap.65 What to do : One gap that may require filling is explaining why the myth is wrong. Another alternative narrative might be to explain why the misinformer promoted the myth. Arousing suspicion of the source of misinformation has been shown to further reduce the influence of misinformation. Another key element to an effective rebutta l is using an explicit warning (\"watch out, you might be misled\") before mentioning the myth. Graphics are also an important part of the debunker's toolbox and are significantly more effective than text in reducing misconceptions.65 Communicate Best communication practices in interaction with journalists Interactions with journalists can be stressful. In the context of press releases, briefing, or press conferences leading to an interview on peak -hour television or radio news, different tips an d tools can be useful.64,66 The tips below are based on W HO's \"do's and don'ts \" for communicating with journalists.64,66 Do's of verbal communication64,66 Do scenario pla nning: identify important stakeholders; anticipate questions and concerns; prepare messages; test messages; anticipate follow -up questions, and rehearse responses. Listen to, acknowledge, mirror and respect the fears, anxieties and uncertainties of others. Remain calm and in control, even in the face of public fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Prepare three key messages that are simple. Emphasize high safety instead of low risk (framing); emphasize the high level of safety of the vaccine rather than the low pr obability of AEFIs. Underline scientific consensus with regards to vaccine safety and efficacy. Emphasize the social benefit of vaccines. Tell the truth: Be honest during any discussion. 14 The Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre Don't s of verbal communication64,66 Don't repeat the anti -vaccine argument: stick to your facts and repeat your key message instead of repeating any anti -vaccine argument. Avoid humour. Do not question deniers' motivation; avoid raising questions about the personal motivation of vocal vaccine deniers. Avoid attacking the credibility of those with higher perceived credibility; join hands, as appropriate, with old adversaries; seek, engage and make extensive use of support from credible third parties. Verbal communication can be prepared by anticipating questions that will be asked. In a crisi s context, WHO has identified questions that journalists always ask (figure 9). 67 Journalists can ask difficult questions, but being prepared can help to keep the discussion focused on the key public health messages. In addition, journalists tend to use different strategies during interviews or press conferences. Being aware of these strategies can help you be better prepared when communicating with journalists. Based on the WHO document, seven types of questions are presented in Table 2. Figure 3 - Common Journalists Questions67 Why did this happen? What was the cause? Did you have any forewarning that this might happen? Why wasn't this prevented from happening? What else can go wrong? If you are not sure of the cause, what is your best gue ss? Who caused this to happen? Who is to blame? Could this have been avoided? Do you think those involved handled the situation well enough? When did your response to this begin? When were you notified that something had happened? Who is conducting the inv estigation? What are you going to do after the investigation? What have you found out so far? What is your personal opinion? What are you telling your own family? Are all those involved in agreement? Are people overreacting? Has anyone made mistakes? How c ertain are you that mistakes have not been made Have you told us everything you know? What are you not telling us? What effects will this have on the people involved? What precautionary measures were taken? Do you accept responsibility for what happened? Has this ever happened before? Can this happen elsewhere? What is the worst case scenario? What lessons were learned? What can be done to prevent this from happening again? What would you like to say to those who have been harmed and to their families? Are people out of danger? Are people safe? Will there be an inconvenience to employees or to the public? When will we find out more? What steps need to be taken to avoid a similar event? Have these steps already been taken? If not, why not? Table 2 - Strategies used by journalists during interviews and press conferences64 Type of question Example of question How to respond Speculation What could happen if...? How do you think this happened? Can you suggest how...? I wouldn't want to speculate on that. The facts are.... It is important that we deal with the facts as we know them, and they are...

Don't answer questions they did not ask you. 16 The Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre Different techniques can be used to answer difficult questions. For example, \"blocking\" i s a technique that consists of diverting the dialogue away from an area that you want to avoid for example by stating: \"That is an interesting q uestion, but the real issue is...\"64 One of the most popular techniques used to answer difficult questions is called \"bridging\": making a link between an area you want to avoid and an area that you c an choose.64 Finally, it is important to correct what is wrong, being assertive and n ot aggressive, staying cool, take your time, be reasonable, and, finally stick to the questions that you want to answer.64 Conclusion Media plays an important role in framing public perception on vaccination. Positive or negative coverage of vaccination can have an impact on vaccination acceptance and uptake. This is why it is necessary for public health authorities to communicate appropriately with the media in order to maintain confidence in vaccination programs. As shown in this report, only bringing facts is not sufficient; the way that information is conveyed is as important as the facts that are communicated. As noted by WHO, the way a person speaks and presents the evidence plays an important role. Being a good speaker can be learned by using different techniques.66 This repor t presents some tools to help improve communication with the public on vaccination.
