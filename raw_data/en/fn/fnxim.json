Natural floral botanics rebalance and harmonise parched skin in this rejuvenating body oil Discover the ultimate in Ayurvedic oral hygiene with antibacterial copper cleansing At Urban Veda, we're inspired by age old traditional herbal remedies, mixed with a twist of modernity, to create products which help pollution proof skin, leaving it less vulnerable to dehydration, dullness and stress. All our products are made with Ayurvedic herbs, flowers and fruits combined with clinically proven actives and antioxidants to help maintain skin's natural state of balance and homeostasis. Together, we plant a tree. Since 2021, for every online order you place online, we plant one mangrove tree. We chose mangroves because they make excellent climate change mitigators: they grow and reproduce quickly, are carbon-hungry plants, and their roots help to stabilise vulnerable coastal areas from soil erosion, tropical cyclones and tidal surges as well as slowing salination (salt-logged soils due to rising sea levels which affect agricultural productivity). Lastly, their planting provides jobs for local communities in Madagascar. In 2021, we calculated our workforce's entire carbon footprint. Based on analysing environmental metrics such as where we live, how we commute and travel, our diets, and any air travel, we were able to collate a total tonnage of emissions we produce each year. We offset those emissions, while also increasing that total by +20% to make us a Carbon Negative Workforce: extracting more CO2 from the atmosphere every year than we emit. In addition, we now offset all order deliveries coming from transport too. These don't make us a Carbon Neutral business - yet - but we've taken the first few steps to getting there. There are over half a billion plants on this planet and many of these are concentrated in India, a global centre for biodiversity. With some of the rarest still being discovered or studied to this day, the need to preserve and advocate for biodiversity and plant knowledge is part of who we are. As a brand rooted in Ayurveda, an ancient practise stemming from Indian herbalism, it's why you'll find botanical blends in every product. Beauty is more than skin deep, and so are we. Naturally, we are Vegan and Cruelty Free. We plant trees in India and East Africa, and we donate a share of profits each month to Ocean Generation to protect the seas. Balance skin and senses with adaptogenic Shatavari, sacred Sandalwood and Lavender to calm and condition delicate skin. Our botanical body oil is enriched with Apricot, Sesame and Calendula to help weary souls unwind and relax with the wooded aromatherapy of an Ayurvedic spa. Use in conjunction with regular practise of Abhyanga (botanical oil massage) and give yourself a mindful massage by starting at your extremities, warming oil between palms, and apply using long, rhythmic, circular strokes along your limbs moving towards your heart to stimulate limber movement and help relieve joint stiffness. \"My skin is really sensitive and this cleanser is perfect - ordered my 3rd bottle! Doesn't dry out your skin but have had zero outbreaks since using in along with the moisturiser.
