Ochsner oncology support groups and classes provide a safe environment in which individuals living with or recovering from cancer, along with caregivers and survivors, can develop emotional coping skills. These groups also help participants cultivate calmness, strength and well-being during a tumultuous time. Our team is committed to providing patients and caregivers with emotional support during the cancer journey, and each member is well-versed in a variety of stress-relieving techniques to ease the psychological impacts of diagnosis and treatment. Our passion for teaching fosters a cancer support community within each class, offering an authentic experience for those facing cancer and for cancer survivors. During these gatherings, patients and families have opportunities to join other individuals facing similar circumstances in a group setting. Together, participants can engage in healing exercises, which can help decrease anxiety, pain and tension. Participants can choose from several options, including [meditation](https://blog.ochsner.org/articles/mindful-meditation-for-cancer-patients), [music therapy](https://www.ochsner.org/services/music-therapy-program), Tai chi and [yoga](https://www.ochsner.org/support-groups-and-classes/healing-yoga). Our support services program connects patients and provides a space to interact and support one another under the guidance of a group leader. This setting allows you to talk about how your diagnosis affects your day-to-day life and get practical advice from other cancer patients. The group setting can help you not feel alone and work through some of the feelings you or your family members are having through your journey. "}
