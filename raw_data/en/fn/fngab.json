Starzl Transplantation Institute. This in cludes evaluation of prim ary recipient disease, resected native organs, and re sected allografts. Evaluation of post-transplant biopsies for rejection and other causes of graft dysfunction comprise the ma in daily workload. This Division also evaluates biopsies of potential donor organs and handles all native liver biopsy specimens. The Division conducts six separate weekly clin icopathologic conferences to ensure quality control of biopsy results and to keep an open channel of communication between the clinical physicians and transplantation pathologists. In addition, there are two intradivisional quality assurance slide review conferen ces per week, to ensure agreement among the pathologists in grading rejection and to discuss interesting and/or difficult cases. Categorization of Specimens and Structure of \"Signout\" Specimens that come to the Division for review fa ll into five categories. They include \"Bigs,\" of which the majority are diseased native or gans removed at the time of transplantation; \"Quicks,\" mainly biopsies such as surveillance ga strointestinal biopsies; native liver biopsies; skin biopsies for GVHD; biopsies to ev aluate for PTLD, etc.; mainly mon itor rejection; and \"Consults\" wh ich consist of outside slides submitted for review. The Division also hand les a portion of medical kidney biopsies and performs frozen sections by clinical request on a 24/7 basis. The priority ranking the specimens receive, the st ructure of signout and reporting of the results are designed to best serve the transplant patients and c linical physicians involve d in their care. \"Stat\" specimens receive the highest priority. These biopsies are submitted to Pathology before 9:00 AM and permanent H&E slides are ready for review by 3:00-3:30 PM the same day. \"Quicks\" and \"Consults\" are next in priority, and have a one day or less turnaround whenever possible. \"Bigs\" receive the next highest pr iority, and are signed out as expeditiously as possible. Native kidney biopsy results are transm itted to physicians in a provisional manner and signed out as special stud ies become available. The staff service responsibilitie s are divided as follows: One st aff pathologist takes weekly responsibility (Monday through Friday) for Stats a nd Quicks and handles all frozen sections between 7:30 AM and 5:00 PM. A second staff pat hologist is on \"Big\" service, which runs from Monday through the following Sunday. This pathol ogist covers all Consults in the Division (except for consults that are specifically addre ssed to an individual pathologist), Big specimens and Native kidney specimens from Monday through Friday and covers Frozen sections from 5:01 PM to 7:29 AM the following morning. This pathologist also covers all specimens on the weekend, regardless of type, and is on call for frozen sections throughout the weekend. Holidays are treated like a weekend, in that the pathologist on \"Bigs\" covers all casework and has call responsibility. Page 4 Resident Responsibilities The level of resident responsibility depends upon th ree factors: the level of training, competence, and the desire to assume responsibility. PGY-1 level residents are generally responsible for all \"big\" cases, including gross evaluation, organization, and review of the slides and finally, signout with the pathologists. The gross proc essing of cases can usually be accomplished by mid-morning or early afternoon. It has been the e xperience of junior reside nts that attempting to sit in on all signouts of \"Bigs\", \"Quicks\", and \"Sta ts\" can be a bit overwhelming in light of the short (usually 3 weeks) rotation schedule. The purpose of the rotation is to give you hands on experience with grossing transplant specimens, and with interpreting both native and allograft- based pathology. You are not expected to workup every case that comes through during this time, and your particular schedule will be worked out with the staff at the beginning of the rotation. When more than one resident is on rotation, it is the residents' responsibility to divide the workload between them. Residents >PGY-1 ma y want to assume more responsibility by reviewing \"quicks\" and \"consults\" to enhance learning opportunities. A satisfactory division of labor in the past has been for the PGY-1 to a ssume responsibilities for \"bigs\"and >PGY-1 to take \"quicks\" and \"consults.\" The cas es are then shared at signout tim e. Unfortunately, because of the urgency of Stat specimens, it is often not possi ble for the residents to review the cases before the official signout. The patholog ist and resident review the cases together on a daily basis, and the preliminary results are reco rded daily in the \"Stat Book,\" immediately outside the signout room. A recent change has been to deliver th e \"quicks\" at 9:00-9:30 AM. Depending upon the signout time, this may give the resident an oppor tunity to review these cases upon delivery. The \"big\" specimens offer excellent learning opportun ities in inflammatory and neoplastic liver disease and cardiovascular pathology. Most re nal disease tends to be endstage and native kidneys are often not resected at the time of transplant, in contra st to other organs. \"Consult\" cases offer excellent review of late posttransp lant liver, kidney, and he art pathology, and review of native liver disease. The resident will be provided with desk space in Transplantation Pathology, and should remain \"on-site\" during the rotation. If the resident will be away from the Division, it is his/her responsibility to notify the pathologist or secretary of this. Th is minimizes misplaced slides, reports, requisitions, etc. All s lides, typed gross reports with requisitions, special stains, etc. will be delivered to Transp lantation Pathology. These should go into the common signout basket and are not delivered to individual mailboxes. It will be the resident's responsibility to organize the cases for which she/he has \"taken charge.\" Since the Department has moved to a \"Centers of Excellence\" format, material from the Transplant Division has been submitted to the De partmental website in accordance with their requirements. This material may be accessed at: http://aplis.upmc.edu/intranet s/COE/xplant/indexXplant.htm . As part of this initiative, we are required to te st the residents at the e nd of their rotations. The standardized test questions are found online at the above web page. In addition, we give a written and slide test at the end of the ro tation. This is not used to grade th e resident, it is used as a form of feedback for the resident to identi fy particular streng ths and weaknesses. Page 5 Learning Resources The Division keeps glass slide study sets of liver, kidney, heart, in testine and pancreas transplantation, as well as special topic slide boxes for resident review. These cases may be photographed, but otherwise they ar e not to leave the Division. The cases are maintained by Ms. Jill March (E-736 MUH, 647-9509) and may be signed out while the resident is on this rotation. We also encourage residents to attend our divisional research conferences and to discuss their research interests and projects with our staff. Transplantation Pathology on the Wo rld-Wide Web and Telepathology We have put great effort into producing an info rmative and up-to-date transplant pathology site on the World-Wide Web. This is designed to be a working resource for the practicing pathologist who must deal with transplant-related material. We urge you to take advantage of this site while you are with us. This will be nefit you long after you leave the residency program, since you will be able to access it at any tim e and from any site. The address is http://tpis.upmc.edu . The grading schemas that appear throughout this handout have been copied from our web pages. You should check the website directly for the most recent versions of these schemas. There is much additional information on line that has not been reproduced for this handout. Remember that this material is copyrighted and cannot be copied for commercial use. You are welcome to use it in lectures and presenta tions, and we hope that you would give credit to us for this material. Your comments and suggestions fo r improvements to this site are welcome. For the past several years, we have been suppor ting pathologists at Medi terranean Institute for Transplantation and Advanced Specialized Therapies (ISMETT) in Palermo, Italy through telepathology. More than 300 cases, most involving transplant pathology, have been consulted so far. Centers in Kyushu, Japan and Jerusalem, Isra el are now connecting to the system to share cases. The telepathology system was created to meet the specific requirements of transplant pathology, which requires coverage 24 hours day, 7 day a week for frozen sections and organ transplant specific data elements. There are advantages to such a transplantation telepathology system including, increased confidence in the pr imary diagnosis, access to an expert knowledge base, and access to experience in similar difficult situations. This particul ar telepathology system is easily adaptable as a core structure for a transplantation telepa thology consortium. The Division has initiated the start-up of such a consortium, which would be ideal for sharing interesting cases and information, dissemina ting useful information, conducting continuing education and coordinating multi-center trials evaluating the efficacy of immunosuppressive and anti-viral drugs where histopathology is used as an endpoint. If you are interested in learning more about this aspect of our practice, you may speak to any of the staff and we would be happy to demonstrate the current system. This handout itself contains copies of a numbe r of published papers. We have not obtained copyrights for these, and this handout is strict ly for your private use as a member of our Department. We wish you the best of luck in your training with us a nd in your career as a pathologist. You should always f eel free to consult with us or to just stop by to say \"Hello.\" Page 6Weekly Schedule The following is a partial weekly work schedule.

The transplantation of organs, cells, and tissues has burgeoned during the last quarter century, with the development of multiple newspecialty elds. However, the basic principles that made this possiblewere established over a three-decade period, beginning during World WarII and ending in 1974. At the historical consensus conference held atUCLA in March 1999, 11 early workers in the basic science or clinicalpractice of transplantation (or both) reached agreement on the mostsignicant contributions of this era that ultimately made transplantationthe robust clinical discipline it is today. These discoveries and achieve-ments are summarized here in six tables and annotated with references. The symposium making up this issue of the Journal was held at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and announced by the Department of Surgery hosts as \"a unique and historic meet-ing at which pioneers of transplantation from around the worldwill present and discuss landmarks in the advancement of trans-plantation biology.\" The participants (in alphabetical order) were:Leslie B. Brent (London), Roy Y. Calne (Cambridge, UK), JeanDausset (Paris), Robert A. Good (St. Petersburg, FL), Joseph E.Murray (Boston), Norman E. Shumway (Palo Alto), Robert S.Schwartz (Boston), Thomas E. Starzl (Pittsburgh), Paul I. Ter-asaki (Los Angeles), E. Donnall Thomas (Seattle), Jon J. vanRood (Leiden). Each of these 11 pioneers provided for publication their reflec-tions about their own unique contributions. The ultimate objec- tive, however, was to reach a consensus by the group on what werethe most critical historical discoveries that made transplantation aform of clinical therapy. Carl G. Groth (Stockholm) was invited tobe the Chairman for these consensus deliberations and to preparethe executive summary. Historical landmark status was restricted to contributions made at least a quarter of a century ago. By this time it had beenestablished that rejection of organ allografts could be preventedor reversed with immunosuppressive drugs and that variable do-nor-specic immunologic tolerance of the graft subsequently de-veloped in many patients. Long-term survival of human recipientsof organ and bone marrow allografts had been repeatedly ob-tained, ensuring continuation of such clinical efforts. A largenumber of HLA antigens had been discovered, allowing efforts attissue matching to proceed. The scientic articles annotating thisprogress are listed in six tables under the following headings:transplantation immunology, bone marrow transplantation, renaltransplantation, liver transplantation, heart transplantation, andtissue matching. The material presented in these tables, includingthe citations, originated from the participants of the symposium. It should be noted that transplantation could not have pro- ceeded without contemporaneous advances in general and tho-racic surgery, medicine, and anesthesia, such as open-heart sur-gery, renal dialysis, antibiotics, and intensive care technology. The Correspondence to: C.G. Groth, M.D., Ph.D. Page 9cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures introduced during the 1950s were particularly influential because they mandated redef-inition of death in terms of irreversible brain damage rather thanthe cessation of heartbeat and respiration. While salvaging count-less victims of cardiac or pulmonary arrest, the new methods alsoresulted in brain-dead corpses on physiologic life support. In 1966, at a symposium on medical ethics in London, G.P.J. Alexandre described the criteria of brain death that had been usedin Belgium and France for discontinuing mechanical ventilation of\"heart-beating cadavers.\" It became possible thereby to removekidneys and other organs from cadaver donors with an intactcirculation. The concept was further elaborated in a Harvard-based ad hoc committee report in 1968 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The impact on transplantation of cadaver organs was immediate and lasting. Transplantation Immunology The modern age of transplantation immunology (Table 1) [1-8] began with three seminal observations. First, rejection is a host-versus-graft (HVG) immune reaction. Second, a similar immunereaction [graft-versus-host (GVH)] may occur in reverse and leadto lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Third, it is possibleunder well dened experimental conditions to avert rejection aswell as GVHD and to induce tolerance of alloantigens, which isstrongly associated with the persistence in the recipient of donorleukocyte chimerism. The next step was the recognition that organ allografts are inherently tolerogenic, a property without which their transplan-tation with long survival in the recipient would not be possible(Table 1). The tolerance induced by organs usually is manifestedonly under an umbrella of immunosuppression, but it is not aprerequisite in some animal models, particularly if the allograft isthe leukocyte-rich liver (see also Table 4). The discoveries listed in Table 1 were made piecemeal over a period of 25 years, obscuring the fact that all three of the funda-mental phenomena studied by early workers (i.e., HVG, GVH,and acquired tolerance) were involved, but to different degrees, inthe \"acceptance\" of organ allografts and the tolerance induced byallogeneic bone marrow following recipient cytoablation. In 1992the mechanistic linkage of engraftment after these two kinds oftransplantation was established with the discovery of donor leu-kocyte microchimerism in long-surviving human organ recipients. The clonal selection theory proposed in 1949 by Burnet and Fenner marked the beginning of a new wave in immunology, fromwhich transplantation is often viewed as a mere stream. Instead,transplantation is a mighty tributary. It fostered research into themechanisms of the destructive antigraft immune response and thecontrol of this response. From these efforts, directly or indirectly,came the discovery of the function of the lymphocyte (1959-1961)and the role of the thymus in the ontogeny of the immune system(1961); delineation (1958-1963) of the human major histocom-patibility complex (MHC); distinction of the T and B lymphocytesubsets (1967-1968); and mainly by study of antiviral immuneresponses, demonstration of the MHC-restricted nature of theadaptive immune response (1968-1974). Bone Marrow Transplantation Bone marrow transplantation (Table 2) [9-22] had its roots in radiobiology and hematology, and it was influenced by clinicalstudies of certain inherited immune deciency diseases. Early inthese efforts it was learned that engraftment of histoincompatiblebone marrow can cause lethal GVHD in a recipient renderedimmunologically defenseless by cytoablation, a complication alsopredicted in recipients with immune deciency disease. Conse-quently, the preclinical and clinical development of bone marrowtransplantation was delayed until reliable methods of HLA typingand matching became available. The rst completely successful bone marrow transplantations were in children with immune deciency diseases whose familydonors were selected with relatively primitive rst-generation tis-sue-matching techniques. Because of their T cell deciency, theserecipients did not require the cytoablation and postgrafting im-munosuppression needed with other indications for bone marrowtransplantation. With the use of methotrexate as an immunosup-pressant in cytoablated recipients, bone marrow transplantationsubsequently was applied with steadily improving results in thosewith an array of benign and malignant hematolymphopoietic dis-Table 1.

Kidney Transplantation Three factors made the kidney a pathnder organ in transplanta- tion (Table 3) [8, 23-47]. One was the development of dialysis forthe treatment of acute, and ultimately chronic, renal failure. Thesecond was the fact that the kidney is a paired organ, ensuring asupply of surgically removed \"free kidneys\" and, increasingly after1953, physiologically ideal live donor kidneys. Third, its technicalsimplicity and the ease with which allograft function could bemonitored made kidney transplantation ideal for laboratory andclinical investigation.By 1974 kidney transplantation had already gone through the four eras shown in Table 3 dened by: no immunosuppression,immunosuppression with total body irradiation (TBI), the rst useof drugs to prevent rejection (azathioprine) or reverse it (pred-nisone), and the introduction of adjunct anti-lymphocyte antibodytherapy. Each major improvement in immunosuppression up to1974 and subsequently permitted goals in kidney transplantationto be reached that were not attainable before. Thus the transition from no therapy to TBI corresponded with the step from identical to fraternal twin transplantation. Thechange to azathioprine-based treatment established kidney trans-plantation as a clinical service from 1963 onward, especially usingkidneys from living related donors. Cadaver kidney transplanta-tion burgeoned with the acceptance of brain death during the lateTable 2. Bone marrow transplantation.

By 1974 renal transplantation hadbecome a government-nanced component of health care in mostWestern countries. Liver Transplantation After a failed trial in 1963, liver transplantation was successfully performed in humans in July 1967 (Table 4) [48-60]. Hepaticreplacement was initially viewed as too difcult to be technicallyfeasible, particularly in terminally ill patients for whom articialorgan support comparable to renal dialysis was not available.Instead, challenges generated by its surgical difculty and physi-ologic complexity made liver transplantation the co-leader after1963 (with the kidney) or the leader in the development of broadlyapplicable advances of surgical technique, immunosuppression,and means of multiple organ procurement and preservation. Despite a high mortality rate during the rst year after liver transplantation, nearly two dozen recipients from this early erahave been stable for 20 to more than 29 years using immunosup-pression with azathioprine, prednisone, and antilymphocyte the liver's unusual tolerogenicity (Ta-bles 1, 4) is that most of these patients have been able todiscontinue immunosuppressive therapy without rejecting theirgrafts. The ripple effects of liver transplantation included discovery of the rst hepatotrophic factors (beginning with insulin) that areinvolved in hepatic growth control and regeneration. More thantwo dozen liver-based inborn errors of metabolism have beencorrected by liver transplantation, with clarication of diseasemechanisms in some. Heart Transplantation The landmarks of heart transplantation are summarized in Table 5 [61-69]. Studies of heart transplantation were carried out atStanford University in dogs and subhuman primates from the late1950s to 1967. The results justied the decision by this group toproceed clinically, as announced by interview in the November 20,1967, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. On December 3, heart replacement was carried out in Cape Townfollowing an extended visit by the South African team leader toStanford and other American transplant centers. The rst SouthAfrican recipient died from infection after 18 days, but the secondpatient (January 2, 1968) lived several years. On January 5, 1968,Table 4. Liver transplantation.

These liver recipients and patients cured of mesoderm-based inborn errors by bone marrow transplantation were the rstexamples of effective genetic engineering.1971 60838 World J. Surg. Vol. 24, No. 7, July 2000 Page 13the Stanford program recorded its inaugural human case, which was successful. Graft survival after heart transplantation using triple-drug im- munosuppression (azathioprine, prednisone, ALG) was of cadaver kidney transplantation. As withkidney and liver transplantation, many of the pioneer cardiacrecipients enjoyed an excellent quality of life, ensuring promptacceptance and widespread application of all these operationswhen better immunosuppression became available. Tissue Matching The ABO blood groups, the compatibility of which was later found to be a requirement for transfusion and for bone marrowand organ transplantation, were discovered in 1901 [70]. Similarly,it was necessary to develop methods to type human tissue antigensand then to determine which were compatible or incompatiblewith those of the donor (Table 6) [70-94]. This was made possiblewith the discovery in transfused patients, and in women who hadbeen pregnant, of leukoagglutinating and lymphocytotoxic anti-bodies that recognized alloantigens. The introduction of computer-assisted search systems allowed delineation of families of antibodies that reacted with individualalloantigens and also made feasible the grouping of alloantigensinto the two closely associated series that are now called HLA-Aand HLA-B. The demonstration of crossover of the A and Bantigens established HLA as a closely linked supergene. After1964 use of the microcytotoxicity test greatly facilitated the stan-dardization of HLA typing and the search for HLA antigens. Themethod was adapted for donor-recipient crossmatching and sub-sequently for the detection of pretransplant sensitization to HLAalloantigens. HLA matching has been a stringent requirement for bonemarrow transplantation (Table 2). For organ transplantation, thelymphocytotoxic crossmatch has been of crucial importance. Al-though there is clear evidence that the HLA system contains thedominant histocompatibility antigens, it has not been possible toidentify which mismatches would result in failure. Nonetheless,HLA-identical sibling kidney allografts provide the highest graftsurvival rates. These are approached by survival rates of zeroHLA-mismatched cadaver kidneys, justifying kidney sharing. Quarter Century after 1974 The advent of cyclosporine two decades ago was a watershed for both bone marrow [95] and organ [96] transplantation. When thenew drug was substituted for azathioprine, allograft survival andthe quality of recipient life improved dramatically. In particular,the transplantation of cadaver organs was upgraded from a fre-quently feasible but unpredictable service to a reliable one. Theresults of organ transplantation were further enhanced after an-other decade with the introduction of tacrolimus [97]. Otherpromising drugs and monoclonal antibody preparations have beenintroduced more recently or are in various stages of preclinical orclinical evaluation. However, the therapeutic principles have re-mained essentially the same as were originally developed withazathioprine, prednisone, and ALG. With more potent immunosuppressive agents, the eld of trans- plantation has expanded continuously over the last 25 years.Heart-lung and lung transplantations were extensions of the heartprocedure. Although survival of a lung recipient for 10 monthshad been accomplished as early as 1969 [98], the rst examples ofsurvival exceeding 1 year were not reported for heart-lung trans-plantation until 1982 [99] and for lung transplantation until 1987[100]. Efforts at transplantation of abdominal organs expandedfrom the liver-only to the liver combined with small bowel [101]Table 5. Heart transplantation.

Tacrolimus played a crucial role in making the ab-dominal procedures involving intestine clinically applicable. Although pancreas transplantation was offered at rst only to diabetic patients who also were undergoing kidney transplantationfor diabetes-associated end-stage renal disease [104], pancreastransplantation alone has been performed more recently in non-uremic diabetics [105]. The alternative appealing approach oftransplanting the isolated islets of Langerhans only was attemptedduring the 1970s but did not result in success (dened as insulinindependence) until 1990 in a patient with postpancreatectomydiabetes [106] and 1991 in a patient with type I diabetes [107].Success with this procedure still is achieved only in occasionalcases.

Rene J Duquesnoy, Ph.D., Professor of Pathology and Surgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Introduction During the past quarter-century, transplant immuno biology has established itself as a scientific discipline to study the mechanisms by which a reci pient rejects or accepts a transplant from a genetically different donor. In the early history of transplantation, five separate disciplines of investigators approached the problem of graft rejection. They are the surgeons, the tumor specialists, the Mendelian geneticists, the biologist s and finally the immunologists. Each had their own agenda and a lack in communication preven ted the recognition and application of conceptional advances in the other disciplines. Neve rtheless, most laws of transplant immunity had already been defined during the first two decade s of the twentieth century. During the late 1960s, largely because of the work of Sir Peter Medawar, transplant immunobiology became established as a multidisciplinary science. This historical overview deals with progress made in the different disciplines before that time. Part 1 summarizes events before World War II and Part 2 deals with milestones from the 1940s through the 1960s. Much of the information have been extracted from seven historical reviews by noted investigators who offer additional perspectives. These references are listed at the end of this article. The Transplant Surgeons For several milennia, the replacement of di seased or injured organs with healthy ones has stimulated the imagination of humankind. In the mythological world, chimeric gods and heros have been transplanted with heads and other organs mostly from different species (these are examples of xenotransplants). In the early biblic al times the prophet Ezekiel refers to cardiac transplantation: \"A new heart also I will give you, and a new sp irit will be put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh\". The New Testament mentions transplant cases lik e Jesus of Nazareth restoring a high priest servant's ear cut off by Simon Peter's sword. Lat er on Saint Peter replanted the breasts of Saint Agatha pulled off during torture and Saint Mark replaced an a soldier's hand amputated during battle. These are examples of autotransplants. In the fifth century BC, the legendary Chines e physician Pien Ch'iao exchanged the hearts between a man with a strong spirit but a weak w ill and a many with the opposite personality to cure the unbalanced equilibrium of the two men's energies. A famous example of a cadaveric allograft is described in Jacopo da Varagine's Leggenda Aura in 348 CE. In the \"miracle of the black leg\", the twin brothers Saints Cosmas and Damian succesfully replaced the gangrenous leg of the Roman deacon Justinian with a leg from a recently buried Ethiopian Moor. While it seems unlikely, that proper surgical techniques were available to perform these transplants, the practice of skin grafting has b een known for many centuries. During the second century BC, the Indian surgeon Sushruta pioneered the skin grafting procedure for rhinoplasty, i.e. plastic surgery whereby the patient's own skin is used to do re construction of the nose. In Page 19those days, the cutting noses was a common practice to punish criminal offenders and of course, we should not discount the fights with knives and swords. During the Renaissance, the Gaspare Tagliacozzi, a famous surgeon and anatomist from Bologna, Italy, used a flap from the upper arm to do reconstructive surgery on a person who had lost his nose. While autografts were generally successful, virtually all allografts failed. The practice of donation consent did not exist, since sl aves were used as skin donors, and often they suffered serious (infectious) complications. Such cases of the \"sympathetic nose\" were criticized by Voltaire and other writers. In his play Hudibras , Samuel Butler states \"When the date of Nock was out, off dropt the sympathetic Snout\" . Taglicozzi was well aware of the limitations of t he allograft procedure. In 1596, in his treatise \" De Curtorum Chirurgia per Insitionem\", he concluded that \"The singular character of the individual en tirely dissuades us from attempting this work on another person. For such is the force and power of individuality, that if any one should believe that he could achieve even the least part of the operation, we consider him plainly superstitious and badly grounded in physical science\". He seemed to have recognized the concept that individual differences were responsible for these allograft failures. Almost nothing was know n about genetics until Mendel did his pioneering studies 250 years later. Other early transplant-related activities dealt with the grafting of teeth; this was done on humans already in the 17th century. Around 1800, the renowned English surgeon John Hunter, reported successful transplants of human teeth into the highly vascularized comb of a cock (a xenograft). He also grafted a cock's spur into its comb and also a cock testes into a hen ( \"without altering the disposition of the hen\") . Hunter concluded that \"Transplantation is founded on a disposition in all living substances to unite when brought into contact with each other\". This view seems compatible with the modern concept about the relation between microchimerism and allograft acceptance. In 1804, G. Baronio in Milan, reported succ essful skin transplants between sheep and other animals of the same and from different species. Other investigators were much less successful with such allografts and xenografts. In Paris, Paul Bert, a pupil of Claude Bernard, described in his 1863 thesis \"De la Greffe Animale\", many kinds of allogeneic and xenogeneic skin transplants. He could not duplicate Baronio's resu lts. In parabiosis experiments, Bert established a cross circulation between rats by using belladonna injections ( \"la Thiers (1 874) for covering granulating surfaces with small pieces of epidermis lead to therapeutically ac ceptable skin grafting procedures. There were no indications of long-term graft survival. Successf ul allogeneic skin transplants have been reported. One case involves Sir Winston Churchill, who during the Sudanese war in 1898, was asked to donate a piece of skin for an injured fellow officer. The doctor, a 'great raw-boned' Irishman, spoke to Churchill: \"Oi'll have to take it of you, Ye've heeard of a man being flayed aloive? Well this is it what it feels loike.\" Page 20(This is quite a unique approach for obtaining informed donor consent!). And Churchill wrote: \" A piece of skin and some flesh about the size of a shilling from the inside of my arm. This precious fragment was grafted to my friend's wound. It remains there to this day and did him lasting good in many ways. I for my part keep the scar as a souvenir.\" Evidently, an example of a long-term success of a skin allograft! Corneal transplant procedures were developed during the 19th century. In 1837, the Irishman Samuel Bigger performed a successful transplant of a full-thickness cornea into the blind eye of a pet gazelle. Continuing improvement in the gr afting procedure and increasing success rates in experimental animals led to the first successful human corneal transplant in 1906. Corneal transplantation became a standard procedure in ophthalmology prac tice, its success was in marked contrast to the high failure rate of skin grafts. Because of the advances in suturing techniques towards the end of the 19th century, surgeons began to transplant organs, especially kidneys between dogs. Several reports claimed success and long-term graft survival. In Lyon, the French surgeon Jaboulay tested pig and goat kidney transplants in humans. Alexis Carrell perfected the vascular anastomosis technique and this led to all kinds of experimental transplants includi ng the grafting of a dog's head onto the neck of another dog. All these allogeneic and xenogeneic tran splants were invariably unsuccessful as was the first human cadaveric kidney transplant performed in 1933 by the Ukranian surgeon Voronoy. Although nobody understood the reasons for the hi gh failure rate, the contention was that the major problems had been solved and that little work remained to perfect transplantation. C.C. Guthrie, who worked with Carrell, noted that \"...The outlook is by no means hopeless and th e principles of immunity, which yield such brilliant results in many other fields, would seem to be worthy of being tested in this case\". Indeed, the field of immunology had undergone a dramatic expansion during the past few decades as illustrated by the following examples: Pasteur: vaccination against cholera, anthrax and Landsteiner: autoimmune disease Metchnikoff: phagocytic theory of host resistance It should be noted that most immunological concepts in those days pertained to humoral immunity and nothing was known about cellular immunity and lymphocyte function. Page 21During the first quarter of the 20th century, a relatively few number of studies were reported on the immune basis of skin graft failures. Under wood (1914) suggested that an \"anaphylactic hypersensitivity\" was responsible for allograft rejection. With repeat skin transplants on children, Holman (1924) reported that a \"second set\" of tr ansplants from the same donor \"did not take but disappeared simultaneously with the first group of isografts\". Davis (1917) and Shawan (1919) suggested that blood groups might play a determining role in allograft success or failure. The Tumor Specialists Most of the information about the immune basis of allogeneic transplant failures would come from the studies of the tumor specialists. Stimulat ed by the rapid advances in vaccination against microbial agents, the tumor researchers attemp ted similar approaches for the treatment of cancer. However, preventive immunization or serum therapy of naturally occurring tumors was generally unsuccessful. This led to the development of transplantable tumor lines in experimental animals. In 1912, Georg Sch\u00f6ne's book: \" Heteroplastische und Homoplastische Transplantation\" summarized the experimental work reported in about 500 publications during the first decade. He coined the term: \"Transplantationsimmunit\u00e4t\" and formulated the following rules: Heteroplastic (xenogeneic) transplants invariably fail Homoplastic (allogeneic) transplants usually fail Autografts are almost always successful There is an initial take of a first allogr aft which is then followed by rejection Second grafts undergo accelerated rejection if recipient has previously rejected a graft from the same donor or, if recipient has been preimmunized with material from tumor donor Graft success is more likely when donor and recipient have a closer \"blood relationship\" As Silverstein points out in his 1989 book \" A History of Immunology\" , the \"laws of transplantation\" were substantially defined already in 1912. On the other hand, Leslie Brent concludes in his recent book \"A History of Transplantation Immunology\" that this credit to Sch\u00f6ne is not wholly justified. A subsequent review published in 1916 by Tyzzer on \"Tumor Immunity\" confirmed Sch\u00f6ne's findings . Tyzzer further pointed out that Presensitization for second set rejection requires living cells Cytotoxic antibodies cannot be found The delayed reaction is difficult to ex plain except that an 'immune body' has been produced Lymphocytes predominate at rejection site: t he reaction is not merely exudative but is proliferative as well There is no tissue specificity, but rather a ra cial specificity with respect to the genetic origin of the antigens In 1929, Woglom's book \"Immunity to Transplantable Tumors\" represents a review of 600 reports published since Sch\u00f6ne's book. His additional conclusions include All living tissues can immunize for accelerated rejection Whole blood but not washed erythrocytes c an immunize, activity in leukocytes Transplantation immunity is systemic, but certain sites (brain) are exempt Newborns from sensitized mothers are not immune to tumors Passive transfer of tumor immunity cannot be done with serum While considerable evidence had accumulated for an immune basis of tumor allograft rejection, only humoral mechanisms were considered. However, serum antibodies were never effective in Page 22controlling in vivo tumor growth. In those days, t he concept of cellular (i.e. lymphocyte-mediated) immunity was not recognized although Da Fano (1 910) reported that rejecting tumor allografts contained large numbers of lymphocytes rather than polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These findings are similar to those of Tyzzer who also not ed that the lymphoid response was infiltrative and proliferative. Murphy and Rous (1912) described the histologi cal predominance of lymphocytes in fowl sarcoma rejection model. Injection of sarcoma cells in chicken (as well as duck and pigeon) embryos resulted in uninhibited growth during the ea rly days of gestation. Thereafter, the tumors were rejected and this coincided with the appearance of lymphocytes. Tumor rejection occured also after transfer of adult lymphocytes into t he embryo. These data indicated for the first time a relation between the ontogeny of the immune response and transplant rejection. Further studies by Murphy have shown that lymphopenia inhibits tumor rejection and that X-irradiation causes lymphopenia and depresses antibody formation. Unfortunately, the functional role of the lymphocyte remained a mystery until the late 1950s. It should be noted that other investigators did not ascribe to the immune basis of tumor allograft rejection. In his 1930 Book \"Transplantation and Individuality\", the prominent biologist Leo Loeb recognized the genetic basis of individual differenc es and transplantation incompatibility. Rather than considering immune mechanisms, he argued th at rejection resulted because the graft could not make the connections necessary to the survival in the new environment of the recipient. His concepts were based on Ehrlich's \"athrepsia\" theo ry which considers nutritional needs of tissues and cells The Mendelian Geneticists In 1903, the Danish geneticist Jensen first demonstra ted with a breeding stock of albino mice that genetic differences control rejection of trans plantable tumors. Loeb (1908) and Tyzzer (1909) reported similar findings with inbred \"Japanese waltzing mice\". Clarence C Little (1916) used inbred mouse strains by brother-siste r mating and concluded in 1924 that \"...The genetics of tissue transplantation is likely to become in the not distant future of far greater importance\". In 1929 he founded the Jackson Memorial Laboratory at Bar Harbor, Maine and George D Snell was hired in 1935. As the editor of the book \"T he Biology of the Laboratory Mouse\" , Snell was inspired by Little's chapter \"The Genetics of Tumo r Transplantation\" to pursue a research carreer in mouse genetics which lead him to the discovery of the H (or histocompatibility ) locus that controls tumor graft rejection. During the late thirties, the Englishman Peter A Gorer performed serological studies with sera from rabbits immunized with mouse red blood cells which led to the discovery of antigen II expressed by certain mouse strains. Grafting of albino mouse sarcoma cells induced the development of anti-antigen II antibodies by the tumor-resistant Auguti and Black mice. All tumor- susceptible cross-bred mice expressed antigen II and specific antibodies killed tumor cells in vitro. In 1946, Gorer visited Snell and H and II were combined as H-2, \" a Major Histocompatibility Gene\" and nine alleles were identified. Thes e investigators developed a highly productive research collaboration which established the major strains of inbred laboratory mice and more than twenty so-called congenic-resistant mouse lines that differ only at H-2, most of them are still being used in immunology research. Progress in Transplantation Immunology during the Nineteen-Thirties Page 23The nineteen-thirties was a period of decline of transplantation immunology-related research. The surgeons concluded that, except for corneal grafting, all attempts at skin and organ transplants will fail due to rejection. Immunosuppression by X- irradiation turned out not to be practical, and the immunity hypothesis of rejection was largely discarded. The tumor researchers had lost faith in the approach of treating cancer via vaccination or transplantation. The geneticists shifted their interest towards \"pure\" genetics by breeding inbred strains of mice and by studying gene polymorphisms. And then came World War II (article to be continued in part 2).

The app lication of skin homografts (a old term for allograft) was known for its high failure rate due to rejection. The 'War Wounds Committee' of the British Medical Council assigned a young, Oxford -educated zoologist named Peter Medawar to investigate the problem of homograft rejection and how to circumvent it. Medawar worked first in a clinical setting with Thomas Gibson at the Burn Unit at Glasgow Infirmary. In 1943, they published a detailed report \"The Fate of Skin Homografts in Man\" on a single burn victim with multiple 'pinch grafts' of skin. Their comprehensive analysis of serial biopsies led to the following conclusions: l Autografts succeed, but allografts fail after an initial take 2 \"Second-set\" grafts undergo accelerated rejection. 3 The breakdown of foreign skin epithe lium is not due to \"a local reaction\" (a term used by Loeb) on the part of lymphocytes or other mesenchyme cells. 4 The destruction of the foreign epi dermis is brought about by a mechanism of active immunization This report shows the Medawar's awareness of the immunity hypotheses of Sch\u00f6ne, Holman, Woglom, and others to explain graft rejection. He returned to Oxford University to study the homograft rejection in laboratory animals and to prove that this was an immunologic phenomenon. A series of carefully designed and st ringently controlled experiments with a rabbit skin graft model were described in two reports to the War Wounds Committee published in the Journal of Anatomy in 1944 and 1945. Medawar concluded that the mechanism by whic h foreign skin is eliminated belongs to the category of actively acquired immune reactions . His early insight into the mechanism of transplant rejection is reflec ted by statements such as \"The accelerated regression of second-set homografts argues for the existence of a systemic immune state \". \"The inflammation has in all likelihood the character of a local anaphylaxis\" (he implicates humoral immune responses), but \"yet, the reaction is atypical; for the lymphocyte ta kes the place of the polymorph in the \"classical picture \". He postulated that the graft-infiltrating cells are \" directly concerned in the manufacture of antibodies\" , and that \"The homograft reaction is governed by the operation of at least 7 antigens freely combined\". In those days, the immunologi cal community was almost solely focused on the humoral immune response, alt hough some investigators, notably Merrill Chase (and Landsteiner) had obtained evidence that cutaneous hypersensitivity to picryl chloride and tuberculin could be transferred by lym phoid cells and not by antibodies. Cellular Immune Basis of Transplant Immunity Medawar recognized the significance of donor l eukocytes in inducing transplant immunity and accelerated rejection of skin grafts. Burnet and Fenner pointed out in 1949, the analogy between transplantation immunity and delay ed-type hypersensitivity, a immune response type exemplified by the tuberculin reaction. Both phenomena showed the absence of detectable antibodies, and the systemic nature of the s ensitization process induced by intradermal immunization with leukocytes. A few years later, Mitchison (1954) showed that passive transfer of lymphoid cells from sensitized donors induced immunity to tr ansplanted allogeneic tumors. Soon afterwards, Billingham, Sprent and Medawar conducted simila r studies on the adoptive transfer (a term Page 25coined by Medawar) with lymph node cells in a skin allograft model and their findings firmly established a cellular basis of transplant immunity. The functional role of lymphocytes remained a mystery until at least ten years later. Mo st investigators considered the lymphocyte an unimportant cell which with its paucity of cytoplasm, could not have any significant functional activity. Apart form the non-immunologic functi ons considered by some investigators, others thought that lymphocytes were hematopoietic stem cells. Chas e and others interpreted their findings that lymphocytes were involved with ant ibody formation although t he actual production of antibodies was never established. Gowans provided the first major step towards the understanding of lymphocytes. He demonstrated with radiolabeled thoracic duct cells, that lymphocytes recirculate from blood to lymph by crossing the endothelial walls of spec ialized blood vessels known as post-capillary venules. Medawar had begun to focus his efforts on the concept that lymphocytes were \"immunologically competent \" cells. Paul Terasaki then a post-doctoral fellow with Medawar, demonstrated that injection of sm all lymphocytes into newly hat ched chicks induced graft-versus- host (GVH) reactions. Morton Simonsen in Copenhagen has been credited as the discover of GVH disease caused by inoculation of adult lymphoid cells in the chick embryo and manifested by severe hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly and soon death. The powerful GVH effects of allogeneic lymphocytes were also noted by B illingham and Brent in neonatal mice who developed \"runt disease \" and in other experimental models such as \"parabiosis intoxication\" in parabiotically attached animals , \" secondary disease \" in irradiated mice injected with allogeneic bone marrow cells (Trentin) and \" F1 hybrid disease \" in F1 hybrids given par ental lymphocytes (Gowans). Although it was generally believed that time that lymphocytes participated in the allograft response as carriers \"cell-bound\" antibody, several investigators began to elucidate the functional roles of these cells in transplant immunity. During the late fifties, Govaerts in Belgium demonstrated that lymphocytes taken from dogs wi th rejected kidney allografts had a specific cytotoxic effect on renal cells from the donor. Rosenau and Moon showed a similar in vitro cytotoxic effect of sensitized mouse lymphocyt es and it required a close contact with the allogeneic targets. Wilson in Philadelphia introduced the \"singl e-hit\" mechanism of cytotoxicity and in quantitative inhibition assays with a 6- mercaptopurine derivative, he showed that the cytotoxic effect of sensitized lymphocyt es required RNA-dependent protein synthesis. During the sixties, Ginsburg in Israel applied time-lapse cinematography to show the movements of large lymphoblasts (called lysocytes) from one ta rget to another on a cultured cell monolayer. Shortly afterwards. Brunner and Cerrottini in Switzerland developed the classical cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) assay that has been used in so many studies to increase our understanding of cytotoxic lymphocytes. For example, this assay was used in 1974 by Zinkernagel and Doherty to elucidate the role of the major histocompatibilit y complex (MHC) restricted nature of T lymphocyte cytotoxicity against virus-infected cells. The Mixed Lymphocyte Culture (MLC) assay became another important tool for studying lymphocytes. Bain, Vas and Lowenstein in Montr eal reported in 1963 the transformation of large immature basophilic cells from lymphocytes cult ured together from two unrelated individuals. Such cells can synthesize DNA and undergo mitosis. These investigators coined the term Mixed Leukocyte Reaction (MLR) and they suggested that this reaction might be related to homograft immunity and that this test seems useful as an indicator of compatibility between siblings. Around the same time, Bach an Hirschhorn in New York developed the one-way MLC assay whereby recipient cells were studied for their response to mitomycin C-treated cells from the donor. These responses were measured after sev en days by microscopic examination of fixed smears for blast cell transformation and mitosis. Bach provided first evidence for the role of histocompatibility antigens and he suggested that the MLC might be a useful typing test for transplantation. This led to an active research endeavor that resulted in the definition of the so- called lymphocyte defined histocompatibility antigens during the seventies. For many years, MLC has been used as a critical test to deter mine donor-recipient compatibility in bone marrow transplantation. Hayry and Def endi found that mouse lymphocytes generated from the MLR were cytotoxic to stimulator cells and Solladay and Bach reported the same phenomenon with human lymphocytes. The MLR was now considered as representing an in vitro alloactivation model of Page 26the allograft response and the CML as an in vitro model of an effector mechanism of cellular transplant immunity. During the early sixties, independent studies by JFAP Miller in London and Robert A. Good in Minneapolis established the significance of the thymus gland in cellular immunity. Neonatal thymectomy of mice caused a severe imm unodeficiency characterized by lymphopenia, a wasting syndrome and early death. Bruce Glick at the Universi ty of Wisconsin made the serendipitous discovery that early removal of the bursa Fabricius, a cloacal organ in the chicken, led to an antibody deficiency state and low levels of serum gamma globulins. These findings provided the basis to differentiate between thymus (or T)-dependent and bursa (or B)-dependent lymphocytes. Henry Claman at the University of Co lorado provided crucial evidence that antibody formation required the interaction between B and T cells. These different types of lymphocytes could soon be distinguished through the expression of cell surface markers like immunoglobulins on B cells and theta markers on T cells (Reif and Allen; Raff). Furthermore, Harvey Cantor and Ed Boyse in New York identified three genetic loci Ly-1, Ly-2 and Ly-3 that could differentiate and helper (CD4) T lymphocytes. The \"Passenger Leukocyte\" concept represent ed another important step towards a better understanding of the allograft response. Snell noted already in 1957 fr om data obtained by Stork in 1953, that donor leukocytes may play a role in the induction of transplant immunity, because donor organs transplanted from cortisone treated ra ts had longer survivals and that such organs had reduced numbers of leukocytes. Ten years later, Steinmuller reported a series of seminal experiments whereby he first induced neonatal toler ance in mice with allogeneic hybrid spleen cells and transplanted skin from tolerant animals to syngeneic recipients. As expected, such transplants survived indefinitely but they sensitized the recipient s to skin from the spleen cell donors. Steinmuller concluded that allogeneic leukoc ytes from the tolerizing inoculum had migrated to the skin of the tolerant mice in su fficient numbers to induce an allograft response in syngeneic recipients. He hypothesized that a \"leukocyte containment\" and raised the question whether the immunizing ability of ski n grafts is dependent on leukocytes. The term \"passenger leukocyte\" was coined later by Elkins and Gu ttmann who in an elegant series of experiments showed that local GVH reactions could be induced by syngeneic spleen cells inoculated under the capsules of transplanted kidneys in F1 hybrid rats. Transplantation Tolerance Although it had become clear many years ago that the rejection problem presented a formidable barrier to successful transplantation, investi gators began to wonder whether the immune system be rendered unresponsive to the transplant. Some early studies had shown the feasibility of immunological tolerance. Felton (1926) r eported that high doses of pneumococcal polysaccharide can induce unresponsiveness upon re challenge with this antigen. Landsteiner and Chase (1937) found that per os administration rather than percutaneous application of chemicals evoked unresponsiveness rather than delay ed-type hypersensitivity. First evidence for transplant tolerance was however , obtained by embryologists. During the first few decades of the twentieth century, many experimental embryologists conducted tissue differentiation studies on trans planted xenogeneic grafts in avian or amphibian embryos. These grafts were often quite successful in these hosts, but these studies never addressed any immunological implications. A notable exception is the work by Rous and Murphy who around 1912, studied the growth of rat sarcoma cells in the chorioallantoic membranes of chick embryos. These tumor cells grew quite well during the incubation period of the eggs but were rejected around the time of hatching and this was accompanied by the appearance of lymphoid cells around the graft. These data indicated for the first time a relation between the ontogeny of the immune response and graft rejection The discovery of neonatal transplant tolerance has been credited to Ray Owen, a geneticist at the University of Wisconsin who studied the inheritance of red bl ood cell antigens in cattle. He reported in 1945 that dizygotic twins had mixtures of their own cells and their twin partner cells. Page 27Thirty years earlier, Lillie had observed that bovine dizygotic twins develop a fusion of their placenta during embryonic life. This results in a common intrauterine circulation and the passage of sex hormones from the male embryo to the fe male twin impairs the sexual development in the female twin and the result if a sterile so-call ed \"free-martin\". Owen recognized that the common intrauterine circulation also leads to an exc hange of hematopoietic stem cells during embryonic life and the establishment of the ch imeric state of red cells. Mor eover, these calves did not have isoantibodies to their twin partners. A few years later, Burnet and Fenner acknowledged in their influential book \" The Production of Antibodies\" the importance of Owen's findings and they proposed their famous \"self-nonself\" hypothesis for immune development. Burnet had c oncluded that chick embryos and fetal animals are incapable of antibody production and that t he development of immunocompetence is a slow process in young animals. He postula ted that during embryonic development, \"a process of self- recognition takes place\" and \" no antibody response should develop against the foreign cell antigen when the animal takes on independent existence \". Owen's red cell chimeric model in the dizygotic cattle twins seemed similar to t he phenomenon induced by inoculation of foreign embryonic cells in the chick embryo and Burnet hypothesized a \"tolerance acquired by fetal exposure to 'nonself' constituents\" . Interestingly, two Russian scientists Lopashov and Stroyeva published independently in 1950 a paper (in Russian) reflecting similar concepts about the embryonic development of the imm une response to transplants. Medawar predicted that an exchange of skin grafts between dizygotic ca lves could verify Burnet's hypothesis and together with his post-doctoral fe llow Rupert Billingham, he performed a series of grafting experiments that provided direct support for the concept of neonatally acquired transplant tolerance. Moreover, subsequent experiments by Billingham and Leslie Brent, then a doctoral student with Medawar, demonstrated in 1953 that neonatally acquired transplant tolerance could be achieved in mice by inoculation of embryos or intravenous injection of newborn mice with allogeneic cells. Thus, \" the exposure of animals to antigens before the development of the faculty of immune response should lead to to lerance rather than to heightened resistance\". It should be noted that the concept of neonatal tolerance was still solely based on antibody production, because the knowledge of cellular immunity was virtually nonexistent. At the same time, Milan Hasek in Prague demonstrat ed that parabiosis of different strain chick embryos induced a immune hyporesponsive state to each other's red cells. Under prevailing Soviet scientific ideologies pr omoted by Lysenko and Michurin, the early publications from Hasek's laboratory (in Czech and Russian journals) explained these findings that the exchange of blood elements between chick embryos of different breeds reflected a \" vegetative hybridization\" , a condition in which the parabionts were expected to display some of the characteristics of their partners. Later publications reflected a departure fr om Soviet-dominated ideologies towards immunological interpretations and Hasek and many coworkers (including T. Hraba, J. Sterzl, J. Klein, P. Ivanyi and P. Demant) have made numerous fundamental c ontributions to transplant immunology. Besides neonatally induced tolerance, some inve stigators began to note that transplant unresponsiveness could be induced in young animals provided certain experimental conditions reflected the so-called \"null\" or \"neutral\" period concept proposed in 1956 by Billingham, Brent and Medawar. According to this concept, the immunol ogical development of a young animal is such that exposure of antigen will neither induce immunity nor tolerance. This concept was prompted by findings that intraperitoneal inoculati on of allogeneic tissues to newborn mice led to tolerance in a few and that many mice became neither immune nor tolerant. While the administration of cortisone seemed to promote tolerance, it became also apparent from data from Billingham and Brent and from Robert Good's laborator y, that the intravenous injection of adult spleen cells into newborn mice can produce long-term tolerance depending on the donor-recipient strain combination and the cell dose and timing. Few studies on blood transfusions of newborn infants had shown however, that human neonates have already a highly developed immune system and Medawar concluded that neonatally induced tolerance had no clinical applicability. Page 28The concept of acquired tolerance had nevert heless, become deeply imbedded in the minds of transplant immunologists. Tolerance could be induced to spec ific histocompatibility antigens and tolerance maintenance required the continuous presence of the tolerogenic antigen as had been first demonstrated in Ray Owen's chimeric cattle model. Silvers and others repor ted that lymphoid cells from tolerant mice could not induce GV H reactions in donor mice and they lacked donor reactivity in MLR cultures. These findings supported the clonal deletion concept as a tolerance mechanism and Byron Waksman's studies linked the thymus gland with the events leading to the induction of tolerance to protein antigens such as bovine gamma globulin. Moreover, several experimental models showed the feasibility of tolerance induction in adult animals and other mechanisms were proposed such as \"blocking\" antibodies (Hellstrom) and \"suppressor cells\" (Gershon) and transplant to apply the phenomenon of antibody-mediated \"immunologic enhancement\" of the growth of transplantable tumors in allogeneic hosts immunized with lyophilized preparations of tumor cells (Snell, Kaliss). These newly emerging concepts created a wave of investigations of many experimental models fo r prolonging graft survival and to define the factors responsible for these phenomena. Although these studies generated often contradictory observations that were difficult to interpret, they provided the basis of modern research efforts to unravel the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms of the immune response. Immunosuppression. The success of clinical transplantation depends on the control of graft rejection by immunosuppressive agents. Until the 1950s, immunosuppression in organ transplantation consisted primarily of whole-body X-irradiation. Since the beginning of the century, it was well- known that irradiation inhi bited antibody responses and caused leukopenia and Dempster and co-workers in London reported in 1950 that irradi ation inhibited skin allograft rejection and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. After the atomic bombing during worldwar II, an upsurge in radiation biology research led to an under standing of radiation-i nduced tissue damage and that administration of bone marrow cells provided a pr otection through the \"generation of new areas of hematopoiesis\" (Lorenz and Uphoff). These findings were import ant in the development of bone marrow transplantation protocols (pioneered by Donnall Thomas in Seattle) to treat leukemia patients. During the fifties, several surgeon teams in Bo ston (Merrill, Murray, Hume), France (Kuss, Hamburger) and elsewhere began to transplant kidney between related individuals. Total body irradiation protocols combined later on with bone marrow infusions, produced unsatisfactory results and virtually every case failed. A 1960 edi torial in the British Medical Journal concluded that \" true homografts of the kidney may be expected to fail...for immunological reasons\" . Fortunately, basic immunologists discovered a number of drugs with immunosuppressive properties. For instance, Baker reported in 1952 the immunosuppressive effects of nitrogen mustard, but this agent was too toxic. Most pr omising results were obtained with an anti-mitotic agent 6-mercaptopurine synthesized by Elion and Hitc hings. This drug interferes with nucleic synthesis and which had been tested to treat canc er. Schwartz and Dameshek discovered in 1959 that 6-mercaptopurine suppressed the antibody responses of rabbits to bovine serum albumin and prolonged skin allograft survival. Several investigators began to study 6- mercaptopurine in various experimental transplant models, but this drug turned out too toxic for clinical use. During his studies in Boston, the English transplant surgeon Roy Calne identified an imidazole derivative of 6-mercaptopuri ne (BW 57-322) which was an effective immunosuppressive drug without major adverse side effects. Also called Imuran (or Azathioprine), it became widely used as the prim ary anti-rejection drug in organ transplantation until the application of cyclospori ne during the early 1980ties. Azathioprine could however, not be used the sole immunosuppressive agent in transplant recipients. While additional treatments incl uded actinomycin D, azaserine and low radiation doses, the application of corticosteroid horm ones produced the best results. Billingham showed in 1951 that daily administration of cortisone acet ate to rabbits prolonged skin allograft survival. Thomas Starzl made the seminal observation in 1963 that large doses of prednisone can reverse rejection episodes and stabilize kidney graft f unction. Moreover, the combined use of Page 29azathioprine and prednisone became established procedures to manage transplant recipients until the eighties when the cyclosporine era began. Another method of immunosuppression is the us e of anti-lymphocyte antibodies raised against lymphocytes from another species. Many investigators including Metchnikoff, Flexner and Funck had already demonstrated during the early part of the century, that sera from immunized xenogeneic hosts had cytotoxic effects on leukocytes and lymphoid tissues. During the late nineteen thirties, Chew and co-workers as we ll as Cruickshank studied the effects of anti- lymphocyte sera raised in rabbits. These data provided the basis of the investigations two decades later, by Byron Waksman in Boston and Michael Woodruff in Edinburgh, that anti- lymphocyte serum prolonged skin allograft survival in rats. These findings were confirmed in large animal models and Starzl reported in 1968 a fa vorable effect of anti-lymphocyte globulin on human kidney transplant outcome. While the immunogenicity of anti-lymphocyte and anti- thymocyte globulin limits its long-term use in a clinical setting, these agents have been successfully been used to treat rejecti on episodes of transplant patients. Histocompatibility Testing Karl Landsteiner is the discoverer of the ABO red blood cell antigen system. In 1901, he published a paper on the serological reactions between sera and erythrocytes from normal individuals and he recognized two types of natur ally occurring agglutinating antibodies: anti-A and anti-B. Many tissues express ABO antigens that will react with these hemagglutinins and ABO incompatibility has been avoided in organ transplantation The Major Histocompatibility Complex controls pot ent transplantation anti gens that elicit the rejection process. The earliest studies on the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complex (H-2 is the mouse equivalent) were done by red blood cell serologists in the 1950s. Jean Dausset in Paris recognized the immunological origin of the agglutination of white blood cells by sera from transfused patients. He identified in 1953 the firs t leukocyte specificity Ma c, which is now called HLA-A2. Rose Payne at Stanford reported in 1958 the appearance of similar leukoagglutinating antibodies in multiparous women. Independently , Jon van Rood (Leiden, The Netherlands) made similar observations and he used computer pr ograms for leukocyte antigen grouping from clusters of leukoagglutinating antibodies. Since Bernard Amos had shown in 1953 that mouse H-2 antigens can be detected by leukoagglutinins, human leukocyte antigens were su spected to play a role in transplantation. Clinically, van Loghem (Amsterdam) showed in 1956, that such antibodies were associated with nonhemolytic transfusion reactions. In 1962, Felix Rapaport reported t he accelerated rejection of skin grafts with leukocyte antigen mismatches. During the early 1960s, a growing group of invest igators attempted to define leukocyte antigen groups with serological techniques such as leukoagglutination and complement fixation on platelets. While these assays were lacking reproducibility, another problem was the extreme complexity of the genetics of leukocyte antigens. A turning point in the history of leukocyte typing was the intensive international collaboration that began as the First Workshop and Conference on Histocompatibility organized by Bernard Amos (Durham, NC) in 1964. This was a laboratory bench study whereby the participant s compared the reactivity of their sera with various techniques. The results were so discordant that they could not be published. The Second Workshop held the following year in Leiden, yielded more coherent results and several serological specificities emerged clearly. The concept was forwarded that all of them belonged to a single, complex antigenic system analogous to the H-2 system of the mous e. Paul Terasaki and John McClelland at UCLA introduced the complement-dependent microlymphocytoxicity technique which has remained the standard serologica l test for HLA typing. The Third Workshop organized by Ruggero Ceppelini (Torino, Italy) in 1967, clearly established the HLA system and two segregant series of specificities (now ca lled HLA-A and HLA-B) were recognized. The success of this international collaboration has a ssured the continuation of the histocompatibility workshops (Los Angeles,1970; France, Angeles, 1980; 1984; New York, 1987; Yokohama, 1991, and St Malo/Paris, 1996). After each workshop, a nomenclature committee has incorporated salient findings towards the Page 30definition of HLA polymorphisms including the identif ication of additional class I loci such as HLA- C (Thorsby, 1970), and the class II loci HLA-DR (1977) and a few years later HLA-DQ (formerly called MB) and HLA-DP (formerly SB). The latter comprise the HLA-D region which was first recognized as the MLC locus by Amos and Yunis in 1970 as a genetic system responsible for T- cell activation in the mixed leukocyte culture. The influence of HLA matching on kidney transplant outcome was first indicted by the higher success rates of kidney transplants from HLA-identical sibling donors. During the late sixties, Terasaki, and co-workers presented early data i ndicating the potential beneficial effects of HLA matching on cadaveric kidney transplant surviv al, although these findings were based on typing information with a limited set of rather crude anti-HLA antisera. Furthermore, van Rood's group, Batchelor and Joysey, and other investigators also found that matching for HLA improves kidney and skin graft survivals. In those days, serological typing had many problems of reproducibility and lack of reagents. The conflicting presentations by Terasa ki's group at the Third International Congress of the Transplantation Society in The Hague in 1970 produced considerable controversies about the significance of histoc ompatibility matching in kidney transplantation. Many well-matched kidney transplants failed ear ly and conversely, badly matched kidneys did often enough function quite well. Other investigators had noted that same experience and it was not really surprising that m any transplant surgeons chose to ignore tissue typing results. Of course, all these controversies arose when HLA matching was limited to an incomplete set of HLA-A and HLA-B antigens; there was no typing fo r HLA-DR and the available serological tests had a rather low level of reproducibility. Because of improved serological procedures and especially, the application of DNA-based techni ques, HLA compatibility can now be much better defined and there remains no doubt that HLA ma tching correlates with less rejection and prolonged kidney transplant survival. Histocompatibility testing for organ transplantati on requires usually a crossmatch test between recipient serum and donor cells. Starzl and co-workers reported in 1965 the first case of a patient with complement -dependent anti-donor antibodies. This patient rejected almost immediately a kidney transplant from th is donor and the tissue pathology suggested a Shwartzmann reaction-like mechanism. Kissmeyer-Nielsen in Copenhagen reported a similar case of what he termed a hyperacute rejction. This experience established the crossmatch test as a major test in histocompatibilty testing. The Panel-Reactive Antibody (PRA) test was first reported by Terasaki in 1971 to identify presensitized patients at higher immunological risk of rejecting their transplant. Conclusion. During the fifties and sixties, transplantation immunology began to emerge as a distinct scientific discipline. Six transplantation symposia we re held during 1954-1964 under sponsorship of the New York Academy of Sciences and participant s at these meetings included biologists, geneticists, immunologists, pathol ogists, surgeons and serologist s. Peter Medawar concluded that \"One of the distinguishing marks of moder n science is the disappearance of sectarian loyalties. Isolationism is over; we all depend upon and sustain each other\" . The \"Transplantation Society\" was established in 1967 and was its member ship reflected a diverse group of scientists, physicians and surgeons devoted to make transplant ation as an clinically effective therapeutic modality to treat patients with end-stage disease. The diversity was also characterized by the differences in scientific concepts and experiment al approaches as illustra ted by the statements by two noted experts in the transplantation field ten years later. Roy Calne had the opinion that \"Progress in transplantation would come less fr om basic immunologic research than from the search for better immunosuppressive drugs\" whereas Leslie Brent stated that \"The immunological solution of rejection might involve a ti me-scale of progress that is greater than self- interest and our natural urge for human advance demand\" . More than twenty years have gone by and, looking at all the accomplishments in the tr ansplantation field, we must conclude that both men were right.

Background. Standardization of renal allograft biopsy interpretation is necessary to guide therapy and to establish an objective end point for clinical trials. This manuscript describes a classification, Banff 97, developed by inves tigators using the Banff Schema and the Collaborative Clinical Trials in Transplantation (CCTT) modification for diagnosis of renal allograft pathology. Methods. Banff 97 grew from an internati onal consensus discussion begun at Banff and continued via the Internet. Th is schema developed from ( a) analysis of data using the Banff classification, ( b) publication of and experience with the CCTT modification, ( c) international conferences, and ( d) data from recent studies on impact of vasculitis on transplant outcome. Results. Semiquantitative lesion scoring conti nues to focus on tubulitis and arteritis but includes a minimum threshold for interstitial inflammation. Banff 97 defines \"types\" of acute/active rejection. Type I is tubulointerstitial rejection without arteritis. Type II is vascular rejection with intimal arteritis, and type III is se vere rejection with transm ural arterial changes. Biopsies with only mild inflammation are graded as \"borderline/suspicious for rejection.\" Chronic/sclerosing allograft changes are grad ed based on severity of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Antibody-mediated rejection, hyperacute or accelerated acute in presentation, is also categorized, as are other significant allograft findings. Conclusions. The Banff 97 working classification refines earlier schemas and represents input from two classifications most widely used in clin ical rejection trials and in clinical practice worldwide. Major changes include the following: rejection with vasculi tis is separated from tubulointerstitial rejection requires transmural ch anges in arteries; \"borderline\" rejection can only be interpreted in a clinical context; antibody-mediated rejection is further defined, and lesion scoring focuse s on most severely involved st ructures. Criteria for specimen adequacy have also been modified. Banff 97 repr esents a significant refinement of allograft assessment, develo ped via international consensus discussions. Page 2 of 20 Ovid: Racusen: Kidne y Int, Volume 55 (2).Februar y 1999.713-723 renal allograft biopsy inte rpretation and reporting is necessary to guide therapy in transplant patients a nd to establish an objective end point for clinical trials of new antirejection agents. The Banff Working Classification of Renal Allograft Pathology is an international schema recently deve loped to fill this need. The cla ssification, which originated in a meeting held in Banff, Canada on August 2 to 4, 1991, was published in 1993 [1], has been clinically validated in numerous studies [2-8], and is now widely used by center pathologists and in large international trials of immunosuppressive agents. Subsequent meetings have been held in Banff every two years to refine the classification. Fo r National Institutes of Health clinical trials, a modification of the Banff grading system, the Co llaborative Clinical Trials in Transplantation (CCTT) classification was developed; this cla ssification and a clinical validation study were published in late 1997 [9]. This article is the report of the March 7-12, 1997, Fourth Banff Conference on Allograft Pathology, a meeting at wh ich pathologists using the Banff schema and those using the CCTT modification met with clinical investigators to review new clinical and experimental observations on the pathology of the renal allograft, with an emphasis on mechanisms and diagnosis of rejection. METHODS Banff 97, the combined classification describe d here, is a product of an international consensus discussion begun at Banff and continue d via the Internet. This modified schema for renal allograft rejection was brought about through several major influences, including ( a) analysis of data from clinical trials using th e Banff classification and observation of actual practice in use of the classification worldwide, ( b) publication of and experience in the use of the CCTT modification [9], and ( c) international consensus discussi ons that took place at the Second, Third [10], and Fourth Banff Conferences and at in tervening meetings. In addition, data on prognosis and renal function from the Synt ex/Roche mycophenolate mofetil trials [11], data from the CCTT trials [9], and a recent study focused on va scular lesions in rejection [12] have demonstrated that vasculitis of any severity ha s significant implications for response to therapy, and graft function and outcome, and provide a major rationale for this 1997 revision (\"Banff 97\"). This combined classification focuses on histol ogic \"types\" rather than \"grades\" of rejection. Since there are significant changes in this re vised schema, there is strong incentive in many circumstances to retain the older classifications , but to incorporate Banff 97 when a new study is initiated. RESULTS Banff 97, presented in Table 1 , represents a significant m odification of the grading of acute/active rejection in Banff 93-95. Nonetheless, the new version retains the basic construct of the earlier schema, which includes the range of findings seen in allograft biopsies and also provides for semiquantitative grading of ch anges of both acute/active rejection and chronic/sclerosing allograft nephropathy. To clar ify the changes made, the categorization and grading of acute changes are discussed in the co ntext of the earlier sc hemas, Banff 3 55 (2).Februar y http://gatewa y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 40 Table 1. Banff 97 diagnostic categories for renal allograft biopsiesa The initial modification of the schema is a chan ge in definition of s pecimen ade quacy. To Page 4 of 20 Ovid: Racusen: Volume y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 41diagnose and categorize rejection, adequate cortex must be present in the material examined, and the change has been made to ensure mo re adequate cortical sampling. With the new emphasis on arteritis, a more generous minimal arterial sampling is also recommended. For Banff 97, an \"adequate\" specimen is now defined as a biopsy with 10 or more glomeruli and at least two arteries; the threshold for a minimal sample is seven glomeruli and one artery. It is also recommended that at least two separate cores cont aining cortex be obtained or that there be two separate areas of cortex in the same core. The recommendation for slide preparation is seven slides containing multiple sequential sections, th ree stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain, three with periodic acid-Sch iff (PAS) stain or silver stains , and one with a trichrome stain. The PAS stain and silver stains enhance the iden tification of glomerulitis and tubulitis and any destruction of tubular basement membranes. These stains also enhance the recognition of chronic features such as arteriolar hyaline, increase d mesangial matrix, double contours in glomerular capillaries, and thickened tubular basement membrane s. The trichrome stain is useful in defining interstitial fibrosis. It is recommended that histol ogic sections should be cut at 3 to 4 microns, as the current definitions of lesion grading are not a ppropriate either for 1 micron plastic sections or for \"routine\" thicker sections obtained at some institutions. Acute/active lesion scoring Semiquantitative lesion scoring provides the morphol ogic basis for the rejection classification. While the basic features used to diagnose rejecti on are tubulitis and arteritis, a minimal threshold for interstitial inflammation must be reached to diagnose rejection of the tubulointerstitial type. Glomerulitis, although not a specific criterion for re jection, may have implic ations for late graft function, and is also graded. Tubulitis and vasculi tis, as the cardinal features of rejection, will be considered first. The Banff 93-95 schema grades tubulitis (\"t\" score) based on the greatest number of infiltrating mononuclear cells in the tubular ep ithelium (that is, having breached the tubular basement membrane and lying bene ath or between tubular cells) per tubular cross section; if the tubule is sectioned longitudinally, results are e xpressed per 10 tubular cells (the average number of cells per cross-section). In the CCTT modifi cation, significant tubulitis is defined by number of tubules with tubulitis in 10 serial high- powered fields from the area with the most inflammatory infiltrate. Banff 97 retains a focus on most severely inflamed tubules to grade tubulitis and requires that the tubulitis be present in more than one focus in the biopsy (Table 2) . The most inflamed tubules should be sought in the most inflamed areas in the biopsy. Inflammatory tubular injury and/or breakdown of tubular basement membranes are included as significant histologic findings in Banff 93-95 and the CCTT modification, and are included in Banff 97 in the \"t3\" grade. Since tubulitis is seen routinely in atrophic tubules in native kidneys and cannot be interpreted as a specific response to alloantigen, tubulitis should not be graded in moderately-to-severely atrophic tubules, that is , tubules reduced in caliber by 50% or more. Page 5 of 20 Ovid: Racusen: Kidne y Int, Volume tubulitis (\"t\") scorea Arteritis is likewise a defining feature tion diagnosis in the allograft. Both Banff 93- 95 and the CCTT formulations distinguish intimal arteritis, carefully defined as lymphocytic infiltration beneath the endotheliu m, from arteritis with inflamma tion in the media and/or with fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall. Parenchymal necrosis and/or interstitial hemorrhage were recognized as possible manifestations of severe arteritis by both classifications. Banff 93-95 vasculitis (\"v\") intimal arteritis, with defined as mild-to-moderate in at least one artery, v2 as moderate-to-severe in more than one artery, and v3 as severe in many arterial cross-sections and/or with transmural arteritis, fibrinoid change, and necrosis. However, because there is the potential for significant sampling error in defining vasculitis, it was agreed that the focus of grading should be on the most severely involved vessel (analogous to tubulitis scoring). A score of v3, or severe vasculitis (v3), is now reserved for those cases with transmural arteritis and/or arterial fibrinoid change and smooth mu scle necrosis with accompanying lymphocytic inflammation in the vessel (Table 3) . In reporting vasculitis, the total number of arteries and the total number involved by vasculitis should be record ed. If there is inters titial hemorrhage and/or infarction, an asterisk should the \"v\" score. Interstitial hemorrhage and/or infarction alone (that is, v0*), while raising the specter of rejection with vascular involvement not sampled by the biopsy, is no longer considered adequate to presumptively score v3. Table 3. Quantitative criteria for intimal arteritis (\"v\") While not itself a signal criterion for reject ion, a background of inters titial inflammation is required to diagnose rejection of the tubul ointerstitial type. Because minimal (and even significant) mononuclear inflammation is present in many protocol biopsies from asymptomatic patients, at least 10% of cortex must be inflamed as a threshold for grading of interstitial inflammation. Severe inflammation (i3) is define d when greater than 50% of the cortex is inflamed (Table 4) . Areas that cannot be meaningfully graded for assessment of interstitial infiltrates are fibrotic areas, the immediate subcapsular cortex, and the adventitia around large veins and lymphatics. The infiltrate in classic ce llular rejection consists of T lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages. If there are more than 5 to 10% eosinophils, neutrophils, or plasma cells in the infiltrate, an asterisk is added to the \"i \" score, and other differential diagnoses should be considered, for example, hypersensitivity reaction or infection, as discussed later here. Moreover, the quality of the infiltrate must be analyzed in the context of clinical information. For example, tapering and withdrawal of immunosuppression may be followed by rejection infiltrates with a substantial com ponent of plasma cells.

Quantitative criteria for mononuclear cell interstitial inflammation (\"i\") scores Glomerulitis is graded in both the CCTT and Banff classifications, although it is not used as a criterion for rejection since its significance ha s been and remains controversial. The Banff schema grades glomerulitis, defined by mononuc lear cell infiltrate and endothelial cell enlargement, by the percentage of glomeruli i nvolved and whether the process is segmental or global within involved glomeruli. In the CCTT, glom erulitis may be \"severe.\" The grading of glomerulitis in Banff 97 is shown in Table 5 , with g1 defined as glomerulitis in less than 25% of glomeruli and g3 as glomerulitis that is mostly global and in more than 75% of glomeruli. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes in glomerul ar capillaries are not a feature of transplant glomerulitis, but may be seen in antibody-m ediated rejection or in early thrombotic microangiopathy. Table 5. Quantitative criteria for early allograft score The Banff in the Banff 93-95 sche ma was divided into three grades: I, mild, characterized by moderate tubulitis; II, moderate, further divided into IIa with marked tubulitis and no vasculitis and IIb with mild-to-moderate intimal arteritis; intimal arteritis or transmural arteritis or intramural necrosis. In Banff classification, recent focal infarction and interstitial hemorrhage without obvious cause could be regarded as grade III rejection. In the CCTT modification, acute/active rejection was divided into three types: I, with significant tubulitis; II, with arterial or arteriolar endothelialitis; and III, with arterial fibrinoid necrosis transmural inflammation. The Banff 97 classification of acute/active rejection-related changes is shown in Table 6 , and is compared with rejection categories from Banff 93-95 and the CCTT modification. In view of the recent studies that provide evidence that vasculitis per se has implications for response to therapy and/or graft survival [9, 11, 12] , Banff 97 focuses on types of rejection. Type I is tubulointerstitial rejection without arteritis, further divided into type IA with focal moderate tubulitis and IB with severe tubulitis. Type II, vascular rejection, is characterized by intimal arteritis, further divided into IIA if the intimal arteritis is mild-to-modera te, and IIB if severe. Type III, severe rejection, is with transmural arteritis with or without fibrinoid and smooth muscle necrosis. Those cases with onl y mild tubulitis and/or with onl y mild focal interstitial inflammation remain in a Page 7 of 20 Ovid: Racusen: Kidne y Int, Volume http://gatewa y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 44\"borderline\" category. Table 6. Overview of acute rejection As in the previous working classifications, an tibody-mediated rejection is also included, but now recognizing two forms, immediate (hyperacute) and delayed (accelerated acute). Except in classic hyperacute rejection occurring immediately post-transplant, antibody-mediated rejection should be confirmed by repeat cross-match, as discussed below. Antibody-mediated rejection can occur as an isolated rejection response or combined with cell-mediated rejection as an antibody-mediated component. The morphology of cl assic \"pure\" antibody-mediated rejection may be quite distinctive. In other cases, th e antibody-mediated component is superimposed on cell mediated vascular changes (Discussion) . Lesion scoring: Chronic/sclerosing Chronic/sclerosing changes develop in renal a llograft with renal ischemia, hypertension, drug effects, infection, increased ureteral pressu re, and nonimmune inflammatory processes, in addition to a subset due to chronic or recurring immune reaction to the graft [13]. Chronic changes may be seen in glomeruli, interstitiu m, tubules, and vessels, although not necessarily simultaneously or to the same degree. Because sa mpling error is less of a problem in sampling of tubules and interstitium, these features are the basis of the grading of sever ity of chronic allograft nephropathy. The grading of chronic interstitial fi brosis and tubular atr ophy and/or loss remains unchanged from Banff 93-95, with quantitation base d on the percentage of cortical parenchyma involved (Tables 7 and 8) . Table 7. Quantitative criteria for interstitial fibrosis (\"ci\") Page 8 of 20 Ovid: 55 (2).Februar y 1999.713-723 6/9/2002 http://gatewa y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 45 Table 8. Quantitative criteria for tubular atrophy (\"ct\") The grading of chronic glomerular changes related to rejection, previously defined by mesangial matrix increase and basement memb rane thickening, has now been refined. The presence of \"double contours\" in capillary loops , created by mesangial interposition, is the most specific change of chronic transplant glomerulopathy [14], whereas mesangial matrix increase is a potentially important but less specific finding. Th erefore, the two are now graded separately. Severity of chronic glomerulopathy is now graded by the extent of \"double contours\" in the most severely affected glomerulus. The total numbe r of glomeruli and the total number of non- specifically sclerotic glomeruli must be recorded (Table 9) . An increase in mesangial matrix is graded by the percentage of nonsclerotic glomer uli with at least mode rate mesangial matrix increase. Moderate mesangial matrix increase, in turn, is defined by expansion of the matrix in the mesangial interspace between adjacent glomer ular capillaries to exceed the width of two mesangial cells in at least two lobules. Grading of mesangial matrix increase (\"mm\" score) is shown in Table 10 . Transplant glomerulopathy often also includes mesangiolysis and progressive sclerosing changes; the latter may be difficult to distingui sh from membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis or, in some cases, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Table 9. Quantitative criteria for allograft glomerulopathy (\"cg\") Page 9 of 20 Ovid: y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page criteria mesangial matrix increase (\"mm\")a Vascular changes potentially enable identificati on of kidneys with chronic/sclerosing changes due to chronic rejection. Specific chronic vascular changes that suggest that vascular changes are due to \"chronic rejection\" are disruptions of the elastica, be st seen on special stains, and inflammatory cells in the fibrotic intima. Proliferation of myofibroblasts in the expanded intima and formation of a second \"neointima\" are also useful features [15, 16] . Fibrointimal thickening in vessels without these features is a significant finding, especially if it is of new onset and is graded, but it is not regarded as specific fo r \"chronic rejection.\" Recognizing that vascular changes may be focal, chronic vascular changes ar e graded based on the extent of occlusion of the most severely affected vessel (Table 11) . Table 11. Quantitative criteria for vascular fibrous intimal thickening (\"cv\") Finally, arteriolar hyaline change, particularly if nodular and documented to be of new onset, may be an important manifestation of cyclosporine or FK506 toxicity [17], as discussed later here, and has a separate lesion scoring in the schema. The scoring of this lesion remains unchanged from Banff 93-95 (Table 12) . Arteriolitis is a lesion that is currently of uncertain significance; if present, it is designated by an as terisk added to the \"arteriolar hyalinosis\" (\"ah\") score. Table 12. Quantitative criteria for arteriolar hyaline thickening (\"ah\") Because it is often impossible to define the precise cause or causes of chronic allograft damage, the term plies allo geneic mechanisms of in jury, unless there are s pecific features to incriminate Page 10 of 20 Ovid: Racusen: http://gatewa y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 47such a rejection process. However, recognition of those cases that do represent \"chronic/recurrent rejection\" may be important, as there are preliminary data suggesting that therapy may be efficacious in these cases [18]. In chronic/sclerosing allograft nephropathy, grades 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe), as men tioned earlier here, may be modified by \"a\" (no changes strongly suggestive of chronic rejecti on in glomeruli and/or vessels present) or \"b\" (changes strongly suggestive of chronic rejection present (Table 1) . If convincing diagnostic features are present, a diagnosis of \"c hronic/recurrent rejection\" can be made. The Banff 97 combined working classification The Banff 97 combined classification of re nal allograft pathology includes acute/active rejection, chronic/sclerosing a llograft nephropathy, and other morphologic findings, including de novo and recurrent diseases, toxic changes, and infection (Tables 1 and 13) . Major changes from the previous Banff schema are summarized in Table 14 . Table 13. Other non-rejection diagnoses in renal allograft biopsies Page 11 of 20 Ovid: Racusen: Kidne Volume 55 (2).Februar y 1999.713-723 6/9/2002 http://gatewa y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 48 Banff 93, 95a DISCUSSION [Context Link] The Banff 97 Working Classification represents input from the two classifications most widely used in large clinical rejecti on trials and in clinical practice worldwide to diagnose acute rejection. This new international classification follows earlier classifications that took the approach of semiquantitative grading of rejecti on lesions to provide an acute rejection index. Finkelstein et al published such a classi fication in 1976, in the pre-cyclosporine era [19]. arteritis; intimal arteritis and separately. Mild re jection had interstitial inflammation; moderate and severe rejection were characterized by vasculitis. Banfi et al published a similar classification in the same era [20], recognizing an irreversible form of rejection with large artery changes and infarction. In 1983, Matas et al proposed a schema with eight grades, the first four defined by minimal-to-severe tubulointerstitia l nephritis, categories 5 through 7 defined by minimal-to-moderate vasculitis, and category 8 reserv ed for cases with severe vascular rejection with fibrinoid necrosis [21]. These grades showed a general correlation with survival, although numbers in some of the categories were too small to draw firm conclusions. Several studies have concluded that the presence of vasculitis in a renal allograft biopsy is associated with poorer response to therapy and/ or outcome. For example, Visscher et al found that in cases with steroid-resistant rejecti on, the response to OKT3 was lower in those with vascular injury changes) [22]. Vasculitis (intimal arteritis \u00b1 fibrinoid necrosis) has also been reported to impact negatively on allograft survival [23]. In a pediatric series, all of those with vasculitis (mostl y severe ) lost their allo graft [2]. While a deleterious Page 12 of 20 Ovid: Racusen: Kidne y Int, Volume y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 49impact of vasculitis on rejection outcome has not been a uniform finding [19], three very recent studies, summarized briefly later here, reach a c onclusion similar to these earlier studies, and have led to the Banff 97 categorization of acute/active rejection changes as \"types\" (tubulointerstitial or vascular) ra ther \"grades\" of rejection. The Roche mycophenolate mofetil study [11] included 87 biopsies scored blinded to clinical history or outcome using the Banff criteria. The highest tubulitis and vasculitis scores in the biopsy/biopsies obtained post-transplant from each case, as defined by the Banff 93-95 grading system, were recorded. The finding of vasculitis of any grade was significantly correlated with allograft loss. Outcome, defined by graft survival , was independent of re jection therapy cohort. In a study of the modified Banff grading system used in the CCTT [9], in which type I rejection is defined by tubulointerstitial inflammation, type II by intimal arteritis, and type III by arterial necrosis or transmural inflammation, ther e was a significant correlation of these patterns with severity of clinical rejec tion. Clinically severe rejection was defined in these protocols as a rejection episode that was steroid resistant, tr eated with ATG, OKT3, or FK506, or was of early onset, occurring within 10 days of transplantati on. The odds ratio for severe rejection was 6.2 for Type I and 37.9 for Type II. Since this classi fication does not provide semiquantitative grading of severity of individual inflammatory changes, no correlations with seve rity of inflammatory changes were defined, except that extent of tubulitis or interstitial infiltrate did not correlate with severity. In a more recent study, Nickeleit et al analyzed the prognostic significance of vascular lesions in rejection [12]. They found that rejection with endarteritis was significantly less responsive to steroid therapy than rejection without endarteriti s. One-year graft failure was also somewhat higher in the group with arteritis (28%) than without (21%), although the difference was not significant. Conversely, severity of interst itial inflammation and tubulitis (defined by CCTT criteria) did not correlate with response to therapy or outcome. The threshold for rejection diagnosis is an important component of any diagnostic grading system. It is clear that some inflammatory changes are to be expected in any allograft, but do not necessarily signal rejection. Exa mination of protocol biopsies in asymptomatic patients has revealed that, in some cases, significant interstitial inflammation may be present [24, 25] . This observation led to a de-emphasis of interstitial inflammation in establishing a diagnosis of rejection in both the Banff and CCTT classifi cations. Similarly, mild tubulitis, defined in the Banff schema as no more than four inflammatory cells in the most inflamed tubule, has been documented in biopsies from well-f unctioning allografts as well and is, therefore, not included as a criterion for rejection. Rush et al established a protocol in which th ey biopsied asymptomatic patients at intervals post-transplant [26]. Using Banff criteria, they found that approximately one-third of these patients had \"subclinical rejection,\" that is, i2t2 with a less than 10% change in serum creatinine. Patients randomized to early protocol biopsies and treatment of this \"subclinical rejection\" had a significantly lower creatinine at 24 months than those patients randomized to the control arm [27]. This finding suggests that the threshold of i2t2 for the diagnosis of rejection is likely appropriate, even in those cases with no change in serum creatinine, since untreated chronic graft injury may result. The significance of \"borderline\" rejection [mild tubulitis (t1) only, or focal tubulitis with only mild interstitial inflammation (i1)] has been difficult to define. If mild tubulitis, as defined by the Banff criteria, was included as a criterion for re jection in the stud y by Rush et al, over 50% of Page 13 of 20 Ovid: Racusen: Kidne y Int, Volume gi Page 50the patients would have subclinical rejecti on, likely leading to unnecessary increase in immunosuppressive therapy. A few studies have l ooked at this \"borderline\" cohort. In some series, patients with borderline rejection usuall y responded to antirejection therapy; however, the finding of borderline changes with mild tubulitis does not always correlate with clinical rejection as defined by response to therapy [28-30]. In some centers, biopsies are obtained after treatment is initiated so that inflammatory changes may have diminished in individuals that did indeed have a significant rejection episode; in this circumstan ce, i1t2 lesions may, in fact, have clinical significance as an indicator of rejection. It is cl ear that these mild inflammatory changes can only be adequately interpreted in a clinical contex t; borderline changes in biopsies obtained in the context of decreased function may require therapy, whereas bor derline changes in protocol biopsies performed on patients with stable graft function may not [30]. Possible diagnoses for this category include the following: suspicious for acute rejection, borderline for acute rejection, borderline inflammatory changes only, possible (e arly) acute rejection, probable (early) acute rejection. The final designation may depend on cente r experience, therapy, time after transplant, and other clinical and morphological features, including other signs of inflammatory cell activation or tissue injury. The criteria for rejection diagnosis in the CCTT modification included tubulitis plus two of the following three criteria: interstitial edema, activated lymphocytes (or blasts), or tubular injury. However, on evaluation of the individual pathologi c criteria for rejection, removal of these three additional criteria resulted in reclassification of only two cases, one that responded to antirejection therapy and one that did not [9]. Moreover, in those centers in which biopsy is frequently performed after steroid bolus thera py, edema and activated lymphocytes are much diminished within one to two days. These addi tional criteria, however, may occasionally be useful when combined with other morphologic fi ndings and in clinical context in those cases with borderline changes [31]. Type I and type II rejection are both thought to be manifestations of cell-mediated rejection. However, type II may be seen in and type III is strongly suggestive of an antibody-mediated component to the rejection process. Other pat hologic features suggesting an antibody-mediated component have been identified in cases in which antidonor antibody has been identified [32, 33] . These features include widespread endothelial in jury with more severe vasculitis (frequently accompanied by fibrinoid changes in the vessel walls), glomerular and small vessel thromboses, infarctions, glomerulitis, marginating cells, and especially polymorphonuclear leukocytes, in peritubular capillaries. When these features are prominent, the biopsy findings should be graded according to the Banff criteria, and the possibilit y of an antibody-mediated rejection component should be indicated as well. The presence of antibody-mediated rejection should be confirmed by a repeat donor-specific cross-match. Banff 97 also includes grading of chronic/sclero sing change in renal allograft biopsies. This remains an important component, as most allograf ts are now lost to often slowly evolving and clinically indolent sclerosis in the allograft. Recognizing that the tubulointerstitial changes are most accurately sampled and have the strongest co rrelation with outcome in native as well as allograft kidneys [34], the grading of severity of chronic rejection continues to focus on interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and loss. However, identification of distinctive vascular changes may enable the diagnosis of chronic reject ion, which in turn may be amenable to therapy [18]. The other major grading system that focuse s on chronic changes is the Chronic Allograft Damage Index (CADI), which provides semiquantit ative assessment of a number of chronic and inflammatory features that have been validated as clinically relevant predictors of allograft outcome [35]. The CADI and the Banff schema have been adjusted to provide equivalent information. Page 14 of 20 Ovid: Racusen: Kidne y Int, Volume http://gatewa y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 51It must be emphasized that although rejection- related changes are a focus of the Banff 97 schema, there are a number of other disease proce sses that may involve the allograft and must be considered in the differential diagnosis (Table 13) . Those processes that produce inflammatory changes in the allograft must be differen tiated from acute rejection. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) in the interstitium and especially in tubular lumina may signal acute bacterial infection, although they may be seen in cases in which there is significant ischemic injury and infarction (which may in turn be rejection related). If PMNL are confined to peritubular and glomerular capillaries, the possi bility of severe acute endothelial injury and possible antibody-mediated rejection must be c onsidered. While numerous eosinophils may be a feature of the inflammatory response to alloantigen, the possibility of a hypersensitivity reaction must be in the differential as well. Viral infections must always be considered, as inflammatory infiltrates in this setting are typically mononuclear, and significant tubulitis ma y be seen. The specimen should be examined carefully for evidence of viral cytopathic features such as megalic cells, nuclear smudging, or cytoplasmic inclusions. If the clin ical or pathological index of suspicion is high, immunohistology or in situ hybridization can be used to enhance identification of viral agents. Cytomegalovirus [36], polyoma (BK) virus [37], and adenovirus [38] may all infect the allograft. Colvin believes that relatively severe tubular ce ll injury with relatively mild inflammation should suggest the possibility of a viral infection [39]. Infection may, of course, coexist with rejection, making diagnosis and therapy problematic. Plasma cells may likewise be a component of the rejection response, but may also signal infection. If the plasma cells are part of an aggr essive infiltrate, that is expanding and displacing normal structures, and especially if the cells are atypical, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) must be ruled out. The separati on of renal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated PTLD from severe acute rejection at biopsy remain s very important, as th e appropriate treatment is reduction of immunosuppression for PTLD, but a ggressive anti-T-cell therapy for severe rejection. Potential di fferential features have been identified [40]. PTLD typically shows expansile nodular irregular foci of serpiginous necrosis. PTLD lesions may be focal or diffuse, and the latt er may result in extensive involvement of the pericalyceal adipose tissue and nerves. The inf iltrates in PTLD generally show the entire spectrum of lymphocyte differentiation, in cluding immunoblasts, plasma cells, large cleaved/noncleaved cells, and small round lymphoc ytes. Cells with marked nuclear atypia are usually present and help in the differential diagnosis from rejection. Some biopsies have a monotonous appearance, and such patients may be hi stologically and clinically indistinguishable from intermediate-to-high grade lymphomas in nonimmunocompromised patients. Although they are not as readily found as in severe rejection, PTLD cells can also be associated with tubulitis. Of course, rejection and PTLD can coexist in a biopsy [41], making accurate diagnosis especially difficult. In most cases, and especially w ith limited biopsy material, the final diagnosis must await the results of immunophenotyping, and EBV in situ hybridization. With rare exceptions, PTLD lesions are B-cell preponderant and EBV positive, whereas rejection is associated with a primarily T-cell infiltrate, which is EBV negative. CD20 (B-cell marker) and CD3 (T-cell marker) a reliable way of phenotyping infiltrates in formalin-fixed material. The most sensitive t echnique for demonstrating EBV in routinely processed tissue is in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded small RNA [42]. In lesions with significant numbers of plasma cells, staining fo r kappa and lambda light chains is a convenient way of identifying lesions that are clearly clonal. If sufficient fresh tissue is available, immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and oncogene studies should also be performed, as molecular findin gs have also been related to ultimate prognosis [43].Page 15 of 20 Ovid: Racusen: Kidne http://gatewa y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 52Toxic effects of cyclosporine and of tacrolimus also remain important differential considerations. Toxic effects of cyclosporine have been studied for some time, but tacrolimus is a relatively new agent, and its toxicity profile is still being defined. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus share a closely related mechanism of action, which is paralleled by an overlap in the toxicity profile of these two drugs. The pathology of tacrolimus nephrotoxic ity appears to be similar to cyclosporine toxicity [44-47], although it has been much less completely studied. Tubular vacuolization is the most common finding in bi opsies performed during clinical episodes of tacrolimus nephrotoxicity; tubular vacuoles may be seen in proximal as well as distal tubules, and although these are often isometric, focal coalescence into larger vacuoles is also present. As with cyclosporine, tacrolimus therapy may also be associated with microvascular toxicity characterized by damage to the glomerular capillaries and renal arterioles. Arteriolar damage mediated by tacrolimus sometimes results in an acute arteriolopathy characterized by endothelial swelling, mucoid intimal thicke ning, eosinophilic in the media, and focal medial necrosis. Scattered thrombi may be seen in ca pillary loops or afferent arterioles. Prolonged tacrolimus therapy results comprised of fibrin, IgM, C3, and C1q, which may be difficult to distinguish from those due to aging, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. As with CsA, arteriolar myocyte vacuolization can be seen; this lesion is a nonspecific manifestation of vessel spasm and shoul d be ascribed to tacrolimus toxicity only after exclusion of other causes of vessel inju ry. Druginduced vasospasm and the hyalinization of the arterioles may lead to ischemic injury acce ntuated in the medullary rays and probably also the medullary inner stripe [48], leading to striped or diffuse interstitial fibrosis. Significant tubulointerstitial inflammation or va sculitis may also be components of recurrent or de novo renal disease in the allograft. These differe ntial considerations must be considered at any time post-transplant and become more like ly as time post-transplant increases. A good pretransplant clinical history can be invalu able in considering differential diagnoses. Finally, future advances in analysis of renal allograft biopsies can al ready be predicted, and the classification and grading of acute/active reje ction will continue to evolve. The of specific morphologic findings-including glomerul itis, arteriolitis, and infiltrates with unusual cellular features-for acute and chronic allograf t function and outcome will continue to be investigated. Emphasis in biopsy assessment will shift from diagnosis to prediction of later allograft function and outcome, potentially en abling early intervention. Indeed, two recent studies have shown that chronic histologic cha nges detected in early protocol biopsies and graded using the 93-95 Banff schema we re predictive of long-term outcome [49, 50] . Clinical utility of renal allograft biopsies, for both diagnos is and prediction of outcome, will be enhanced by application of immunostaining and molecular studi es. Identification of effector cells such as NK cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and of monocyte/macrophages may enhance diagnosis and/or predict later dys function. Molecular studies show promise in refining the diagnosis of acute/active rejection [51], although much more needs to be done to establish validity in cases with borderline features and to disseminate th e technology. It will be important to establish which molecular markers correlate with interstitial infiltrates and which correlate with invasive inflammation (tubulitis, intimal arteritis). Also, more precise definition of histologic and molecular features of indolent graft injury a nd sclerosis should enable better understanding of pathogenesis of progressive damage and enable appropriate therapy. There is clearly much work to be done in optimizing the assessment of the rena l allograft by the pathologist as we move into the 21st century. Many of these issues will r eceive focused attention at the Fifth Banff Conference on Allograft Pathology in 1999 and in other international forums, which have become lo gical venues for such consensus in the global medical communit y.

TransplantationT OVERVIEW ROLE OF DONOR KIDNEY BIOPSIES IN RENAL TRANSPLANTATION PARMJEET RANDHAWA1 Division of Transplantation Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 Recent years have seen an increasing use of marginal donors to expand the organ pool available for renal trans- plantation ( 1-5). Donors considered in the marginal category include those with age .55 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, acute tubular necrosis, disseminated intravascularcoagulation, prolonged cold ischemia time, and non-heart-beating donors. Patient and graft outcome obtained withsuch suboptimal donors has been comparable to that ob-tained with ideal donors in some studies ( 6,7), but signifi- cantly worse in others ( 2,8-10 ). These variable results pre- sumably reflect the use of organs with different degrees offunctional reserve. It has been estimated that donor factorscan account for 35-64% of the variation in recipient serumcreatinine and creatinine clearance after transplantation(11,12). Hence, it stands to reason that demonstration of satisfactory donor kidney function before accepting an organfor transplantation would improve both short- and long-termgraft function. Donor assessment should begin with a review of clinical data, but in cases of traumatic death adequate prior medicalrecords are not always available. Some centers have used anarbitrary age cut off to exclude donors with senile arterion-ephrosclerosis. However, this is not entirely a satisfactoryapproach, because of individual variability in the rate atwhich kidney tissue ages. Thus, the percentage of scleroticglomeruli in human kidneys varies between 0.2-16.7% at age55 years and 1.5-23.0% at age 75 years ( 13). Data from a study conducted at the University of Pittsburgh indicatedthat 17/30 (57%) donors aged 60-75 years had 0-10% glo-meruli sclerotic: clearly a decision to reject these donorsbased on age alone would have been inappropriate ( 3). Con- versely, mild histologic abnormalities can be present inyounger individuals much more commonly than is generallyappreciated. Arteriolar hyalinosis has been reported in 25- to34-year-old subjects, and considered to be a marker for earlyonset atherosclerotic disease ( 14). Laboratory evaluation of donor renal function is important, and should include urine examination as well as blood chem-istry. It should be kept in mind that mild proteinuria canoccur secondary to glomerular or tubular ischemia reflectingagonal changes occurring before death. Acceptable cut offvalues for proteinuria used by different centers range be- tween 0.5-3.0 g/24 hr ( 15,16). Blood urea and serum creat- inine are readily available parameters for the assessment ofrenal function, but can rise significantly due to conditionssuch as renal hypoperfusion and acute tubular necrosis,which do not per se contraindicate transplantation. Creati-nine clearance has also been used for screening of donors,and is superior to serum creatinine in that it is not affectedby donor age, muscle mass, or obesity, However, clear-cutguidelines on the use of creatinine clearance as a criterion fordonor selection have not yet been developed. Some authorshave suggested a donor creatinine clearance measurement.60-70 ml/min for accepting marginal organs for single kid- ney transplantation ( 15,17). In contrast, others investigators have recommended double kidney transplantation when thedonor creatinine clearance is less than 90-100 ml/min ( 18). Allograft function cannot be simply predicted by evaluating the donor creatinine clearance, because of multiple post-transplant variables such as acute tubular necrosis, antibodyor cell-mediated rejection, and calcineurin inhibitor nephro-toxicity. Another occurrence of com-pensatory renal parenchymal hypertrophy, when the donornephron mass is insufficient to meet the metabolic needs ofthe recipient. Compensatory changes have been shown toresult in an approximately 20% rise in estimated creatinineclearance in the allograft kidney within 4-6 months of trans-plantation ( 16). The remainder of this review will focus on the role that a pretransplant biopsy can play in helping to define the struc-tural integrity and functional reserve of a donor kidney un-der consideration of transplantation. A biopsy should be con-sidered mandatory when the donor in question is in themarginal category. At Pittsburgh, we have set an arbitrarycut-off age of 55 years, beyond which all donors are biopsiedto evaluate the severity of senile arterionephrosclerosis. Astrong case can be made to include a pretransplantation orpostperfusion biopsy in the routine work up of all donors,irrespective of age and clinical setting. This would providebaseline anatomic data with which future biopsies can becompared. such as capillary thrombosis,arteriolosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosiscan be recorded, so that the occurrence of the same lesions inposttransplantation biopsies is not misconstrued as C 903.1 Presbyterian University Hospital, Transplantation Pathology, 200 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. 1361 Page 58nephropathy. Lack of knowledge about the extent of preex- isting changes in a donor kidney complicates the interpreta-tion of posttransplant biopsies. Biopsy techniques vary from institution to institution. I prefer a generous wedge biopsy about 1-cm long and 0.5-cmdeep. This suggested size ensures that at least half the cor-tical depth is available for evaluation, and minimizes erro-neous conclusions due to superficial subcapsular scarringsecondary to senile arteriosclerosis. Some centers prefer thatboth a wedge and a needle biopsy be performed to provideassurance that the deep cortex has been adequately sampled.A needle biopsy alone may not permit reliable assessment ofthe extent of glomerulosclerosis due to limited sampling. Onestudy has suggested that sample adequacy be defined by thepresence of a minimum of 25 glomeruli ( 19). This contention was based on the observation that a statistically significantrelationship between percent glomerulosclerosis and graftloss was observed only if biopsies with more than 25 glomer-uli were analyzed. In another study, the relationship be-tween percent glomerulosclerosis and graft function wasfound to hold irrespective of the number of glomeruli presentat biopsy ( 2). However, in that study this relationship was lost on multivariate analysis if a correction was made fordonor age. This led the authors to state that if the donor ageis known, data on glomerulosclerosis do not add any addi-tional vital information. However, as pointed out earlier,age-associated changes in the human kidney are extremelyvariable and can not be predicted without a biopsy. Addition-ally, a biopsy can detect the presence of previously undocu-mented chronic diseases such as hypertensive or diabeticnephropathy, and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. Urgent histological processing of donor biopsies is needed, when the decision to use the donor kidney is contingent onthe morphologic findings. Because prolonged cold ischemiacan adversely affect long-term graft function, the biopsiesneed to be interpreted as soon as possible. Rapid processingprotocols can allow permanent sections to be available forreading within 2 hr. Consistently providing this level of ser-vice, however, necessitates that both a histotechnologist andan anatomic pathologist to be on call round the clock. As analternative, a frozen section service with only a pathologistbeing on continuous call can be offered. Frozen section mor-phology is adequate to recognize sclerotic glomeruli, ad-vanced interstitial fibrosis, and arteriosclerosis. However,freezing artifacts to interstitial widening, which canbe confused with fibrosis, if one does not insist on demon-strating a definite collagenous matrix. Retraction of tubularepithelium from the basement membranes makes it difficultto recognize tubular atrophy. Frozen sections are also notreliable for assessment of mesangial cellularity, glomerularcapillary wall thickening, and diabetic lesions such as smallcapsular drop lesions or early Kimmelstein-Wilson nodules.Gross thrombosis can be recognized at frozen section, butsmall fibrin thrombi in the capillaries are more difficult toevaluate. Interpretation of a kidney biopsy from a donor with senile arterionephrosclerosis or other chronic renal disease calls fora semiquantitative evaluation of the degree of glomeruloscle-rosis, arteriosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis present. Theuse of Banff criteria for grading chronic allograft nephropa-thy is suggested to ensure center to center uniformity in thisassessment ( 20). If most of the glomeruli are patent, andthere is only mild arteriosclerosis and interstitial fibrosispresent, the donor kidney is suitable for use. However, theextent of acceptable chronic changes within the donor kidneyhas not yet been rigorously defined. A widely accepted em-piric rule is that kidneys with more than 20% sclerotic glo-meruli not be used ( 8). At Pittsburgh, surgeons are also hesitant to use any kidney with more than mild interstitialfibrosis (more than 25% of cortical area affected) or than 25% luminal occlusion). interstitial, and vascular lesions in any given biopsy arefrequently proportional to each other, even though this in-terrelationship is somewhat imperfect ( 21). Hence, we have taken the approach that moderate or severe changes in any ofthe major anatomic compartments in a donor kidney shouldcontraindicate transplantation. Recently, it has been shownthat the maximal planar area of the nonsclerotic glomeruli isalso a predictor of long-term graft function ( 22). Several investigators have studied interobserver variabil- ity in grading morphologic changes in donor biopsies.Pokorna et al. reported moderate to good reproducibility withcalculated weighted kappa scores of 0.66 for arterio-lar hyalinosis ( 2). Wang et al. addressed this issue by (1) comparing histological changes in paired baseline biopsiesfrom the same donor, and (2) comparing baseline donor biop-sies with sequential posttransplant biopsies from the samerecipient ( 19). Using linear regression analysis, the precision of estimating percent glomerulosclerosis in paired biopsieswas good only if analysis was restricted to biopsies with morethan 14 glomeruli (r 50.83 for paired biopsies and r 50.56 for sequential biopsies). The kstatistic for arteriolar hyalinosis in grading arteriolar hyalinosis biopsies and 20-30% of sequential biopsies.Sund et al. reported poor and arteriolar hyalinosis in sequential kappa scores of 0.046 and 0.122,respectively ( 22). These disappointing results presumably reflect variation in the distribution and severity of vascularlesions in this patient population. The lesions were morepronounced in the pretransplant biopsy compared to theposttransplant biopsy. It was suggested that this differenceresulted from a propensity of vascular lesions to affect deepervessels, which are more likely to be sampled when a biopsygun is pointed directly at the surface of a donor kidney. Insupport of their contention, the authors pointed out that thecortico-medullary junction was indeed more often sampled inbiopsies obtained before transplantation. Several studies have validated the clinical utility of donor biopsies by formal statistical analysis. Seron et al. examinedpostperfusion biopsies, and showed a measured score obtained clearance measurementperformed 3 months later ( 23). Lehtonen et al. found the chronic allograft damage index in a donor biopsy to predictlong-term graft function ( 24). Gaber et al. showed that post- perfusion biopsies with .20% glomerulosclerosis (n 58) were associated with an 88% incidence of delayed graft function(7/8 grafts), 38% graft loss (3/8 grafts), and a mean serumcreatinine of 2.6 60.1 mg/dl at 6 months ( 8). Based on thisTRANSPLANTATION 1362 Vol. 71, No. 10 Page 59data, it was suggested that kidneys with .20% glomerulo- sclerosis not be used for transplantation. However, this con- clusion was derived from a study group of only eight patientswith an unusually high percent glomerulosclerosis (mean3966%). The control group of patients used for comparison had significantly lower glomerulosclerosis (8 61%). Pokorna et al. described a 3-year graft of 74.7% in 67 patientswith 20.0-47.6% glomerulosclerosis, but 11% of these recip-ients had primary non-graft function, and a mean 1-yearglomerular filtration rate of 41.4 ml/min ( 2). Several studies have demonstrated a relationship between donor arterioscle-rosis and posttransplant function ( 25-27 ). Hyaline changes correlate with 1year serum creatinine ( 28) and rate of The reason why interstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, arteriolar arteriosclerosis have the critical parameter in different studies isprobably the result of patient selection and methodologicalconsiderations. For example, in one study where donor glo-merulosclerosis, but not interstitial fibrosis, was found topredict with .55% and ,55% intersti- tial fibrosis were compared with regards to the incidence ofsatisfactory graft function defined simply as a patient beingalive without maintenance dialysis ( 19). In a second study, interstitial fibrosis was found to be predictive, if biopsiesshowing no interstitial fibrosis were compared with thoseshowing any level of interstitial fibrosis, and graft functionwas assessed by calculated creatinine clearance ( 3). Failure to detect the effect of interstitial fibrosis in some studies mayalso partly reflect the patchy nature of this lesion, which inturn, may be due to the patchy nature of arteriosclerosis andarteriolar hyalinosis in the kidney. In contrast to the literature discussed above, one can also find studies that fail to find any correlation between donorbiopsy findings and posttransplantation graft function ( 7,22, 29-32 ). This is surprising given the intuitively expected re- lationship between anatomic architecture and physiologicalfunction in the kidney. Closer analysis of many of thesestudies reveals methodological problems such as (1) smallnumbers of patients, (2) insufficient histological detail forcritical evaluation, (3) studies limited to biopsies with onlymild histological changes, (4) lack of correction for variablessuch as prolonged cold ischemia or acute rejection, and (5)use of only crude patient or graft survival rates in evaluatingoutcome ( 1,7). In some clinical settings, the expected effect of donor histology can probably be overshadowed by other con-founding clinical variables. Thus, many surgeons prefer togive kidneys from older donors to older recipients, who havea weaker immune system. This may result in lower rejectionand reasonable graft survival, despite changes of senile ar-terionephrosclerosis in the donor organ. One study has sug-gested that improvements in medical care have now reducedthe importance of donor age as a critical factor in renaltransplantation ( 33). The preceding discussion has focused primarily on donor biopsies performed for old age, hypertension, or donor diabe-tes mellitus. Clinical concern about pretransplant ischemicinjury is another relatively common reason for requesting adonor biopsy. Predisposing factors for such injury include ahistory of donor hypotension, use of pressors during donormedical management, prolonged cold/warm ischemia time, anon-heart-beating donor, and chronic parenchymal or vascu-lar disease in the donor. Acute tubular necrosis, the histolog-ical counterpart of ischemic injury, is difficult to evaluate onfrozen section, except in cases with frank coagulative necro-sis or infarction. Even with ideal permanent section morphol-ogy, correlations between clinical renal dysfunction and his-tological acute tubular necrosis are imperfect. Solez et al.could not demonstrate any correlation between histologicalseverity of acute tubular necrosis and duration of oliguricacute renal failure in the native (nontransplanted) kidney(34,35). Lehtonen et al. found that chronic changes in the donor biopsy did not correlate with immediate posttrans-plant graft function ( 24). A similar lack of correlation has been observed with donor vascular disease ( 27). However, others have reported that histological scoring for acute tubu-lar necrosis ( 2,26,36) or apoptosis ( 37) predicts delayed graft function. There is evidence that prolonged cold ischemia anddelayed graft function predisposes to vascular rejection inkidneys derived from older donors ( 35). Whether delayed graft function adversely affects long-term graft survival in-dependently of rejection is controversial ( 36). Donor biopsies performed in the setting of disseminated intravascular coagulation need to be evaluated for the extentof microvascular injury. Organs with diffuse and extensiveglomerular thrombosis should be discarded. However, thepresence of scattered capillary thrombi present in a minorityof glomeruli not necessarily contraindicate transplanta-tion. When the donor serum creatinine is normal or margin-ally elevated, successful transplantation has been reported.Isolated fibrin thrombi can apparently be dissolved by anintact fibrinolytic system ( 31,37), although this may result in a transient microangiopathic hemolytic anemia in a few in-stances ( 38). Mate kidneys recipients from the same coagu- lopathic donor can have different graft outcomes due to vari-ations in pre- and posttransplant factors ( 39). Occasionally, pretransplant or postperfusion biopsies show changes consistent with glomerulonephritis, and allow theglomerular disease in the allograft kidney to be traced backto the organ donor. The risk of this scenario is probably thehighest for IgA nephropathy, a disease with high prevalencein some geographic regions. Based on isolated case reports inthe literature, it would appear that mild glomerular changesin a donor biopsy can probably be ignored. Thus, it has beendocumented that modest donor-derived IgA deposits do notcause significant graft dysfunction, and can spontaneouslyresolve with time ( 40,41). Similar observations have to donor disease has been shown not to progress in theposttransplantation period ( 31). The final indication for a donor kidney biopsy is the pres- ence of a grossly visible nodule noticed during harvesting ofthe organ. When histological examination shows a benigncyst, leiomyoma or angiomyolipoma, it is safe to proceed withtransplantation. However, finding a small epithelial neo-plasm can generate dilemmas that may be difficult to resolve,particularly when a high grade carcinoma is not demon-strated. The distinction between a so-called renal adenomaand a small low grade renal cell carcinoma is arbitrary, andtraditionally based on the size of the lesion, although it isnow increasingly recognized that lesions of any size can me-tastasize. If the donor lesion is small (less than 0.5 cm) and RANDHAWA May 27, 2001 1363 Page 60completely excised, the risk of residual or recurrent carci- noma in the recipient is probably extremely small. Dr. IsraelPenn has reported six cases, where wide excision of the donornodule led to an uneventful course documented by up to 186months of posttransplantation follow up ( 45-48 ). The rare of posttransplant renal allograft carcinoma, de-spite the estimated 7-25% incidence (based on routine au-topsy data) of small renal cell neoplasms in donor kidneys,also suggests that the use of such kidneys might be reason-able, at least in the context of informed recipient consent.Nonetheless, this is a controversial issue, and some trans-plant centers may not accept organs with small epithelialneoplasms. In summary, a kidney biopsy is essential in the clinical work-up of marginal donors who are being evaluated forrenal transplantation. In fact, it should be the standard ofcare to obtain a baseline biopsy from all kidneys before im-plantation, irrespective of the donor's medical history. Such apractice can consistently document premature arterion-ephrosclerosis and other clinically unsuspected renal diseasein the donor. Lack of knowledge about the extent of preex-isting changes in a donor kidney complicates the diagnosis ofchronic allograft nephropathy and drug induced hyalinosis inposttransplant biopsies. While examining donor biopsies, aneffort should be made to grade the severity of glomeruloscle-rosis, interstitial fibrosis, arteriosclerosis, and arteriolar hy-alinosis present. Review of available evidence suggests thatdonor organs with ,20% glomerulosclerosis and mild inter- stitial fibrosis or arteriosclerosis give clinically acceptableresults. If the biopsy changes are more pronounced, the pros-pect of implanting a suboptimal organ with reduced graft lifehas to be weighed against the alternate option of continuingto support the patient by dialysis. Double kidney transplan-tation can also be considered in the latter situation ( 16). REFERENCES 1. Jacobbi LM, McBride VA, Etheredge EE, et al.

However, our current policy isto reduce immunosuppression in all cases. The aim ofthis study was to determine whether clinical follow-up in these patient categories shows any differencesin: (a) histologic viral load, (b) grade of tubulitis, and(c) graft function. Reduced viral load assessed within8 weeks was seen in 4/20 (20.0%) biopsies treated ini-tially by increased immunosuppression, compared biopsies treated with reduced immuno-suppression (p ==0.001, Fisher's exact test). Yet, >70% reversal (15.8%) and Improved tubulitis wasseen in 11/20 (55%) of biopsies treated with of benecial effect on serum creatininein 12/19 (63.1%) instances. In treated withany immunosuppression, the serum creati-nine remained stable in 1/5 (20%) and worsened in 4/5(80%) biopsies. These data demonstrate that in biop-sies with PVAN and tubulitis, reduced immunosup-pression is more effective in lowering viral load thansteroid therapy. Lack of parallelism between viral load,tubulitis grade, and serum creatinine illustrates a com-plex interplay of viral and alloimmune BK virus, histology, immunosuppression, interstitial nephritis, kidney, nephropathy, pathology,transplantation Received 13 March 2003, revised and accepted for publication 23 June 2003Introduction Polyomavirus nephropathy (PVAN) is an increasingly rec- ognized complication in kidney transplant recipients (1-5).The histology is characterized by viral inclusions, intersti-tial inflammation, and tubulitis. The signicance of tubulitisin these cases has been a subject of some debate. Mostclinicians accept it as a part of viral-induced parenchymalinjury, and reduce immunosuppression after a diagnosis ofPVAN. However, others contend that tubulitis is a manifes-tation of concurrent acute cellular rejection, and advocateincreased immunosuppression (6). In an attempt to clarifythis controversy, we performed a study to determine theeffect of changes in immunosuppression on: (a) histologicviral load, (b) grade of tubulitis, and (c) serum creatinine asa marker of graft function. The series presented includesour initial cases, who were briefly treated with steroids be-cause of certainty about concomitant acute rejection, andour subsequent cases treated by reduced immunosuppres-sion from the outset, despite the presence of concomitanttubulitis. Materials and Methods The diagnosis of PVAN was provisionally made by histologic documentation of polyomavirus inclusions in the tubular epithelium accompanied by vary-ing degrees of interstitial inflammation. The diagnosis was conrmed inall cases by immunohistochemistry or in-situ hybridization, as previously reported (2). Viral infection localized to the nuclei in the tubular epithe-lium. Both proximal and distal tubules were affected. The number of in-fected cells varied from 1 to 10 per tubular cross-section, with 1-70% ofthe sampled renal parenchyma showing evidence of viral cytopathic ef-fect. All biopsies were reviewed in detail by a pathologist and graded fortubulitis and interstitial inflammation using Banff 1997 criteria (7). Changesin these histologic parameters were assessed both as Banff scores, and,when the score was numerically unchanged, by a 'gestalt approach'. Theviral load, assessed by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and hybridization, was graded semi-quantitatively as grade 0, 1 +(less than 5 infected cells), 2 +(5-15 infected cells), or 3 +(>15 infected cells). Follow-up biopsies were recorded as complete viral clearance, improved,unchanged, or worse compared to the index specimen. In 12 biop-sies the tissue viral load was also determined using a publishedreal-time quantitative PCR assay (8). Clinical data were abstractedfrom the medical records. For each biopsy studied, we obtained abaseline creatinine (4 weeks prior to biopsy), a peak serum creati-nine, a post-therapy creatinine (2 weeks after therapy), and the most 1378 Page 63Polyomavirus Nephropathy recent serum creatinine, to assess the current graft status. Changes in immunosuppression in relation to each biopsy were individuallyanalyzed. If these changes led to >70% reversal of the rise in serum creatinine, the biopsy was classi ed as 'complete response '. Graft dysfunction episodes with 30 -70% reversal quali ed for 'partial re- sponse ',<30% ', in creatinine >30% as 'worse '. A Banff score of t designated as 'com- plete response 'with regard to tubulitis. This study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol# 000622). Results The 66 biopsies studied here were obtained from 31 pa- tients with polyoma virus allograft nephropathy. Therewere 12 females and 19 males, with a mean age of 47 \u00b1 13 years (range 21 -72, median 50) years. The native kidney diseases that led to transplantation were diabetes mellitus(9/31, The timeof of viral nephropathy was 11 \u00b16.8 months (range 2-32, median 11) months after transplantation. The mean and median baseline serum creatinine prior to the diagnosisof PVAN was 2.0 \u00b11m g/dL and 2.6 mg/dL, respectively. At the time viral nephropathy was diagnosed, the meanand median serum creatinine were 2.6 \u00b11m g/dL and 2.6 patients (35.5%) lost theirgrafts, ve underwent allograft nephrectomy, and one was re-transplanted. Chronic allograft nephropathy was the pri-mary cause of graft loss in all cases. However, persistentviral DNA and antigens indicative of ongoing viral nephropa-thy were also demonstrable in ve patients. One patient showed no viral DNA or antigens in the tissue, but viruriacould be detected by PCR. The probability of graft sur-vival 1 year after diagnosis was 53.8%. Excluding patientswhose grafts had failed, the most recent serum creatinine,measured 95.4 \u00b1102 weeks after the diagnosis of PVAN, was 3.6 \u00b11.5 mg/dL. Tables 1 and 2 summarize data on clinico-pathologic corre-lations presented in 3 categories, depending on whetherthe diagnosis of PVAN led to an initial increase, decrease, orno change in overall immunosuppression. Table 1 focuseson 45 biopsies, each of which was followed by a repeatbiopsy obtained within 8 weeks. In this group, 20 biopsieswere treated with increased immunosuppression, 19 biop-sies with decreased immunosuppression, and 6 biopsieswith no change in immunosuppression. Table 2 presents ananalysis of 21 biopsies with regard to long-term changes inviral load, tubulitis, and serum creatinine. In this group, 11biopsies were treated with increased immunosuppression,and 10 biopsies with decreased immunosuppression.

PVAN biopsies treated with initial transient increase in immunosuppression The increased immunosuppression in these cases was temporary, and was prompted by the presence of tubu-litis, which is conventionally regarded as a marker of acutecellular rejection in the allograft kidney. In an attempt toseparate the short-term consequences of steroid therapyand the subsequent long-term effects of reduced immuno-suppression (after steroid therapy had failed), data wereseparately analyzed for follow-up biopsies performed <8 weeks (Table 1, n =20) and >8 weeks (Table 2, n =11) after the rst diagnosis of PVAN. In biopsies performed within 8 weeks of diagnosis(Table 1), serum creatinine showed a complete therapeuticresponse in 3/19 episodes of renal dysfunction, apartial 4/19 episodes, and no patients. The response 'category in- cluded one patient in whom creatinine remained stable,and 11 patients in whom the serum creatinine worsened af-ter initial therapy. Changes in viral load generally paralleledthe trends in serum creatinine. Thus, a decreased viral load(partial response) was seen in 1/20 (5%), and clearance ofvirus (complete response) in an additional group of 3/20(15%) samples. The percentage of biopsies showing viralclearance or decreased viral load was signi cantly lower in patients treated with an initial increase in immunosuppres-sion, compared with patients whose immunosuppressionwas reduced at the outset (20% vs. 83.3%, p =0.004, Fisher 's exact test). Partial or complete resolution of tubu- litis was observed in a higher proportion of cases treatedwith an initial increase in immunosuppression, comparedto biopsies where immunosuppression was reduced at theoutset 26.3%). However, an associated improve-ment in serum (complete or partial response)was seen in only 7/19 (36.8%) biopsies, and it was of atransient nature. In biopsies performed beyond 8 weeks of initial diagnosis, after reduction of immunosuppression (Table 2), serum cre-atinine showed a complete therapeutic response in 3/10(30.0%) episodes of renal dysfunction, partial response in2/10 (20%) episodes, and deterioration in the remaining5/10 (50.0%) episodes. As a rule, the viral load was sub-stantially improved. Thus, decreased viral load occurredin 2/11 (18.2%), and complete clearance of virus in 8/11(72.8%) of samples. The latter group included all ve biop- sies with complete or partial creatinine response. Tubulitisshowed 3/11 (27.3%) and partialimprovement in 6/11 (54.5%). PVAN biopsies treated with no change in immunosuppression (Table 1, n =6) All of these biopsies were performed within 8 weeks of theinitial diagnosis of PVAN to assess the progression of viralnephropathy (Table 1). Serum creatinine was stable in 1/5(20.0%), and worse in 4/5 (80%) cases. No data were avail-able for one biopsy. The grade of tubulitis improved in 1/6(16.7%), and worsened in 5/6 (83.3%) load in 2/6 follow-upbiopsies, while 1/6 (16.7%) biopsies showed complete vi-ral clearance. The remaining 3/6 (50%) samples showedincreased viral cytopathic effect in the tubular epithelium. PVAN biopsies treated with decreased immunosuppression from the outset Serum creatinine measured within 8 weeks of biopsy showed: (a) complete therapeutic response in 1/19 (5.3%)episodes of renal dysfunction, (b) partial response in 3/19(15.8%) episodes, (c) stable values in 2/19 (10.5%), and (d)progressive rise in the remaining 13/19 (68.4%) episodes(Table 1, n =19). There was decreased viral load in 8/19 (42.1%) and complete clearance of virus in 7/19 (41.2%)samples. In biopsies performed >8 weeks after the index specimen (Table 2, n =10), serum creatinine showed: (a) complete therapeutic response in 0/9 (0%) episodes of renal dys- function, (b) partial response in 2/9 (22.2%) episodes, (c)stable values in 1/9 (11.1%), and (d) inthe viral loadwas 5/10 (50.0%) follow-up biopsies. The lackof improvement or worsening of tubulitis in half of the 1380 American Journal of Transplantation 2003; 3: 1378 -1382 Page 65Polyomavirus Nephropathy patients, despite reduction in viral load, suggests that re- duction of immunosuppression was complicated by thedevelopment of irreversible viral or alloimmune injury tothe graft. In 12 biopsies, we correlated changes in immunosuppres- sion with intra-tissue viral concentrations measured by real-time quantitative PCR. Four biopsies were treated by in-creased immunosuppression, and in 2 instances, this ledto increased viral load in a follow-up biopsy. The remaining2 follow-up biopsies showed no signi cant change in viral load, within the limits of assay precision. Seven biopsieswere treated with decreased immunosuppression, and 6of these showed decreased viral load, while the seventhbiopsy showed no signi cant change in tissue viral con- centration. One biopsy was not treated by any change inimmunosuppression, and in this case, a follow-up biopsyshowed increased viral load. Discussion PVAN is a complication of excessive immunosuppressionin kidney transplant patients. Most clinicians reduce thedose of immunosuppressive drugs after the diagnosis ismade, but some have advocated a brief course of steroidsif tubulitis is present. The purpose of this study was to de-termine the effect of changes in immunosuppression on:(a) histologic viral load, (b) grade of tubulitis, and (c) serumcreatinine as a marker of graft function. Clinical response asassessed by serum creatinine did not show statistically sig-nicant differences between the patients treated with an initial increase or decrease in immunosuppression. Thus,complete reversal of serum creatinine within 8 in immunosuppression, and in 1/19 (5.3%) ofbiopsies treated with decrease in immunosuppression(Table 1). However, the majority of biopsies treated withsteroids showed either no change (1/19 =5.3%), or ac- tual worsening (11 /19=57.9%) of Even when improvement in serum creatinine occurred followingsteroid therapy, it was of a transient nature. Biopsies treated with no change in immunosuppression showed a persistently high viral load in 3/6 (50.0%) of thecases (Table 1). Increased immunosuppression led to per-sistent or worsened viral cytopathic effect in 16/20 (80%)of biopsies within 8 weeks. In contrast, reduction of im-munosuppression led to viral clearance in 7/10 (70%) ofbiopsies after long-term follow-up (Table 2). These obser-vations form the basis of our current policy to reducethe immunosuppression, whenever a diagnosis of PVANis made. Nonetheless, the clinical course of individual pa-tients is variable, and reduction of viral load did not alwaystranslate into improved graft function, probably due to irre-versible chronic allograft nephropathy (9), and perhaps theconfounding effect of alloimmune injury. Long-term follow-up did not show any statistically signi cant differences be-tween patients who did or did not receive a brief initialcourse of steroid therapy (Table 2). It is also worth men-tioning that viral clearance was observed even in a few pa-tients getting no therapy or steroid therapy for presumedconcomitant rejection. A somewhat paradoxical observation made during this study is that partial or complete resolution of tubulitis wasobserved in 11/20 biopsies treated with initial increase inimmunosuppression (Table 1). This suggests that tubulitisin these biopsies was, at least partially, related to an asso-ciated component of alloimmune injury. In this context, it ispertinent to recall that Hirsch et al. have recently reported4 cases of PVAN with concurrent acute cellular rejection,which responded to steroid therapy (10). These patientshad been diagnosed relatively early during the course of astudy which mandated prospective monitoring of urine andblood for BKV infection. In contrast, Limaye and colleagueshave documented a patient with acute cellular rejection andBKV viremia, where the administration of steroids led to afall in serum creatinine, but a progressive increase in viralload, culminating in viral nephropathy (11). This variable re-sponse of PVAN to steroid therapy highlights our lack ofcomplete understanding of all the clinical variables that af-fect viral replication in the allograft kidney. We postulatethat host cellular and humoral immunity play an importantrole in determining ultimate clinical outcome in individualpatients. Further exploration of this notion would requirethe development of assays directed againstspeci c viral antigens.

Before transplantation has been per- formed, factors impacting on outcome include the donor (living vscadaver, age and HLA system) as well as the recipient (age, immunological reactivity, potential sensitization and duration of dialysis). These are the main factors that affect the outcome of thetransplant, particularly in the long-term. After trans- plantation a number of events may put graft function at risk: potential recurrence of the primary renaldisease in the allograft; ' de novo ' renal disease trig- gered by infections, drugs or autoimmunity; and non- specic progression promoters, such as diabetes, hypertension, proteinuria, nephrotoxic agents and/orviral infections. The two most frequent causes of chronic allograft dysfunction are (i) chronic rejection (often triggered by preceding acute rejection, delayedgraft function or poor compliance) and (ii) calcineurin- inhibitor nephrotoxicity (more likely to develop in kidneys of older donors or in marginal kidneys). Thedifferential diagnosis between these two entities isgenerally difcult, but some deposits) as well as thedemonstration of humoral antibodies are pointers suggesting rejection. Treatment of chronic graft dysfunction is difcult, whatever the cause, particu-larly in cases with advanced renal lesions. Therefore, early diagnosis is of paramount importance. In this regard, graft biopsy can be of great help. In spite ofmany problems and complications, not only short- term but also long-term results of renal transplanta- tion are improving progressively, as documented byCTS data showing that in Europe for transplantsperformed between 1982 and 1984 the mean graft half-life was 7 years, while for transplants performed between 1997 and 1999 it was 20 years.

Transplant Vol. 19 rights reserved Page nephropathy; chronic rejection; recurrent disease; renal transplantation Introduction Today, renal transplantation is the treatment of choicefor most patients with end-stage renal failure. Yet, in spite of the continuous progress in immunosuppres- sive and supportive therapy, a number of factors stillinterfere with the complete success of renal transplan- tation. Some factors, present at the time of transplanta- tion, concern the donor as well as the recipient, whileother complications originate after transplantation. In this review, particular attention will be paid to the main factors and events that impair graft function inthe long-term. Factors at the time of transplantation The donor Thesource of the donor can strongly affect the results of renal transplantation. The renal graft half-life is by far longer for living-donor than for cadaver trans- plants [1]. This nding cannot be attributed only toa better histocompatibility. In fact, the graft half-life of transplants between spouses who are obviously HLA-mismatched is more than one-third better thanthat of cadaver donor grafts [2]. The difference may be accounted for by a number of factors. First of all, the quality of the kidney of a living donor canbe carefully assessed, while that of a cadaver donor must be evaluated in a hurry and under difcult conditions. Second, brain death causes a hyperten-sive crisis and also an autonomic storm leading toprofound ischaemia and endothelial damage of periph- eral organs, even when blood pressure is normal [3]. Third, ischaemia-reperfusion injury is obviouslyless severe with living donation. Finally, brain death is associated with an upregulation of cytokines and chemokines that favour overexpression of HLA anti-gens by endothelial and tubular epithelial cells, thus, increasing the risk of acute [4] and chronic rejection [5]. The ageof the donor is also important. While in the recent past most donors were younger than 50 years, today the age of the donor is increasing progressively. The UNOS registry documented that the higher the age of the donor, the worse the long-term outcome of the graft [1]. Some investigators feel that the poorer results of kidneys of elderly donors are mainly caused by the age-dependent pro-gressive reduction of glomerular ltration rate and renal reserve. To overcome this problem it has been proposed to transplant both kidneys of borderlinecadaver donors into one single recipient. Alfrey et al. [6] reported good results with dual transplantationin 287 patients, i.e. a 5 year graft survival rate of69%. Surprisingly, however, in this series the meanage of the donor (58 years) was by no means veryadvanced and the mean creatinine clearance was borderline, at best (mean: 77 ml/min). It is well justi- ed to ask whether a similar result would not alsohave been seen by transplanting the two kidneys into two recipients. As a matter of fact, Bunnapradist et al. [7] reviewed the data of the US Renal Data System and reported that the 3 year graft survival of kidney grafts coming from donors above age 55 years was 70% for single transplants and 65% fordual transplants. On the other hand, Halloran et al. [8] did not nd a relation between the initialcreatinine clearance of an old donor and subsequentgraft survival. He hypothesized that the main prob-lem of old kidneys is replicative senescence rather than decreased renal function. Actually, a strong association has been found between specic markersof replicative senescence and the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy in biopsies of kidney trans- plants from older donors [9,10]. If so, the best wayof utilizing old kidneys could be to transplant them to old recipients. In this regard, the group of La Charite \u00b4in Berlin reported that in old recipients graft survival was similar for those transplanted with old kidneys and for those who were given kidney grafts based on HLA match, waiting timeand cold ischaemia time, irrespective of the age ofthe donor [11]. The role of HLA typing with modern immuno- suppression has been a matter of controversy. Whilethere is evidence that long-term survival is better for transplants with no antigen mismatch than for mis- matched transplants [12], lesser degrees of mismatchare of minor clinical relevance [13]. The analysis of more than 50 000 renal transplant recipients showed that the effect of donor age on patient survival wasgreater than that of HLA match [14]. The recipient Not only the age of the donor, but also the ageof the recipient is increasing in recent years. The UNOS data show that the results are worse for recipients above age 50 years. The main cause of graft failureis death with a functioning graft. As expected, the older the age, the higher the risk of death. On the other hand, the risk of graft failure caused by acuteor chronic rejection tends to decrease with age [1]. Since death is due mainly to cardiovascular disease and since malignancy is more frequent at advancedage, intensied cardiovascular investigation and searchfor malignancies are indicated and appropriate ther- apeutic measures should be taken before an elderly patient is considered suitable for transplantation. Itis also important to assess the patient's nutritional status and rehabilitation, since frail elderly patients are at particular risk of infectious complications. Onthe other hand, however, since the risk of rejection is less in elderly recipients [1], immunosuppressive therapy can be less aggressive. Particularly, steroid-free2938 C. Ponticelli Page 69immunosuppression is indicated in elderly recipients to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications [15],infection and diabetes. It would be of great utility to know the immune reactivity of the recipient in order to adjust immuno- suppression accordingly. Unfortunately, we still have no valid pre-transplant markers, but recent data have shed some light on this problem. Susal et al . [16] proposed to measure the immunological reactivity of the patient before transplantation by measuring serum CD30, which is expressed on CD4 \u00feand CD8 cells that secrete TH2-type cytokines. with CD30 levels < 100 U/ml had a signicantly better 5 year graft survival than patients with higher serumlevels. Rotondi et al . [17] and found signicantly higher pre-transplant blood levels in patients who had graft failure than in patients with good graftfunction. Uboldi de Capei et al. [18] reported that high interleukin (IL)-10 producers mismatched forclass I, but matched for class II HLA antigens andlow IL-4 producers (independent of HLA match) are protected from chronic rejection. Although it is still too early to tailor immunosuppression accordingto these parameters, there is hope that in the near future good markers of immune reactivity will permit us to nd the immunosuppressive regimen that is mostappropriate for the individual patient. In the past,patients who lost their rst transplant because of rejection were considered at high immunological risk. More recently, the UNOS data [1] showed thatthe graft half-life was similar for rst (10.6 years) and second transplants (9.4 years). Patients who lost their rst graft because of an accelerated rejectionmay still be considered 'strong responders', however. Patients who have developed high titres of panel- reactive anti-HLA antibodies (PRA) following preg- nancies, blood transfusions or transplants are atincreased risk of graft failure [19]. Moreover, most patients with very high titre PRA cannot be trans- planted because the crossmatch with a potential donoris likely to be positive. In the past, attempts to remove preformed anti-HLA antibodies with immunoadsorp- tion had some success [20]. More recently, Glotz et al. [21] reported good results by pre-treating 15 hypersen- sitized patients with a 3 month course of intravenous high-dose immunoglobulin before transplantation.Thirteen patients were actually desensitized and were transplanted immediately. One patient lost the graft because of thrombosis and another because of rejec-tion. All the other patients were alive with a function-ing kidney graft after > 1 year. Another potential approach is pre-treatment with the anti-CD20 mono- thePRA titres dose-dependently [22]. The duration of dialysis treatment is a problem that has been neglected so far. Strong evidence suggeststhat the results of pre-emptive transplantation, before dialysis is started, are far better [23,24]. Using a paired donor kidney analysis, Meier-Kriesche and Kaplan[23] demonstrated that the longer the time on dialysis,the worse the long-term outcome of renal transplanta-tion. This was true both for living and cadaver allo-grafts. The authors concluded that the time waiting on dialysis is the strongest modiable factor influ- encing transplant outcome. What to do before transplantation? From a theoretical point of view, transplantation ideally should be performed between HLA-identicalsubjects, the kidney should preferably come from a living young donor and the recipient should also be young, have no preformed anti-HLA antibodies andlow immunoreactivity and should receive the trans- plant before starting dialysis treatment. The real world is quite different: only a small minority of patientsreceive a well-matched kidney; in Europe, as of 2001, only 15% of patients receive a living donor transplant; donor and recipient age increases progressively; andthe duration of dialysis treatment while the patientis on the waiting list gets longer and longer. On the other hand, it would be unethical to refuse transplanta- tion to a patient only because of his/her old age, longduration of dialysis or hypersensitization, since even in elderly patients renal transplantation offers higher life expectancy [25] and better quality of life [26] thandoes dialysis. It is also not advisable to discard mar- ginal donors because of the persistent shortage of kidney grafts. In order not to penalize patients at risk and not to compromise the success of transplantation, it is advis- able to take some practical measures. Hypersensitized patients should be treated with intravenous immuno-globulins or rituximab and should be transplanted immediately after their PRA titres have decreased substantially. Patients with high immunological reac-tivity and those who lost a previous graft because of an early rejection should receive aggressive immuno- suppression. In contrast, frail patients, such as olderrecipients, those with long exposure to dialysis as well as HCV- and HBV-positive patients should receive less-aggressive immunosuppression, possibly alto-gether avoiding the use of corticosteroids. Finally, inpatients who receive a kidney from elderly or marginal donors the use of calcineurin inhibitors should be avoided or at least minimized, since these kidneys areparticularly vulnerable to the nephrotoxic effects of these agents. Post-transplant events Specic diseases Recurrence of primary disease may lead to graft fail- ure, particularly in the long-term. It is difcult to assess the risk of recurrence for the individual renal diseases, because duration of follow-up and indica- tion for biopsy are so heterogeneous in the availablereports. If one reviews the most recent large series [27-32], it appears that some diseases, such as immuno-Renal transplantation today 2939 Page 70globulin-A nephritis, membranous nephropathy and lupus nephritis, do not affect the 10 year graft survival even when they have recurred in the graft (Table 1), although over even longer periods recurrence of theserenal diseases may eventually contribute to graft failure. More dangerous is the recurrence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranoprolifera-tive glomerulonephritis, Henoch-Schoenlein purpuraand, particularly, haemolytic uraemic syndrome (Figure 1). In many cases the recurrence of these diseases leads to the loss of graft, although sporadiccases of response to plasmapheresis or immunoadsorp- tion have been reported [33-35]. 'De in patients on cyclosporin, tacrolimus, anti-mTORagents or OKT3. Only half of cases show the typi-cal picture of haemolytic uraemic syndrome. In the remaining patients, systemic signs and symptomsmay be absent and there is only a progressive decline of graft function [36]. In these patients, renal biopsy is indispensable for early diagnosis of thromboticmicroangiopathy. Prompt withdrawal of the offending drug leads to recovery in some patients. Plasmapheresis may also be helpful. In a large series [37], graft functionrecovered in 23 of 29 patients with post-transplant thrombotic microangiopathy. In all patients, calci- neurin inhibitors were stopped and plasmapheresis wasadministered for a mean of 8.5 days. Aggressive immunosuppression may reactivate polyoma BK virus , which is usually latent in the urinary tract. As a consequence, /C245-6% of transplant patients develop interstitial nephritis, which causes graft fail- ure in about half the cases. There are not specic symptoms or signs. The diagnosis should be suspectedin any patient with progressive graft dysfunction, particularly if treated with a combination of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil so-called 'decoy cells', may be used to monitor the patient, although the presence of decoy cells is sensitive but not very specic.Detection of virus DNA in plasma by polymerase chain reaction is more specic, but expensive. Once again, renal biopsy is of paramount importance.It shows interstitial nephritis with inclusion bodies Staining with mono- clonal antibodies against the simian virus can con- rm the diagnosis.

Cidofovir has also been used withsuccess in anecdotic observations [38]. Besides BK virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes viruses 1 and 2 and adenovirus may cause interstitial nephritis as well. Moreover, a number of drugs that are often used in renal transplant recipients, such asantibiotics, sulphonamides, allopurinol, diuretics andnon-steroidal diagnosis is difcult, since eosinophilia, fever and rash are generally absent because of the administration of corticosteroidsand immunosuppressive drugs. The diagnosis rests on renal biopsy. The transplanted kidney may also develop 'de novo' glomerulonephritis . The most frequent forms are membranous usually related to HBV infection [39] and membranoproliferative glomerulone-phritis in HCV carriers [40]. However, cases of ' ' idiopathic membranous nephropathy [41], acute glo- merulonephritis [42], [43] and minimal change nephropathy [44] have beendescribed as well. Although the pathogenesis of these cases is still obscure, one may speculate that the proinflammatory alloimmune response in a trans-planted subject modies anti-inflammatory mecha- nisms that protect from autoimmunity. Consequently, the immune responses to autoantigens may be sub-verted by alloimmunity, resulting in an autoimmune response. The potential development of chronic graft dysfunc- tion from calcineurin-inhibitor toxicity is well known.These drugs may cause persistent vasoconstriction and endothelial lesions (Figure 3) that eventually leadto interstitial brosis and tubular atrophy. Important contributors are activation of the renin-angiotensin system, increased synthesis of osteopontin and chemo-kines as well as diminished production of nitric oxide. All these factors may trigger excessive produc- tion of probrogenic transforming growth factor- b1) and/or directly cause tubulointerstitial damage [45].Factors increasing the risk of severe nephrotoxicity are the dose of the calcineurin inhibitor, the age of the patient and his or her renal function. 'Marginal'kidneys are more vulnerable to the nephrotoxicity of calcineurin inhibitors. To prevent the development of severe renal toxicity, the blood levels of cyclosporinand tacrolimus should be monitored regularly; the doses should be adjusted accordingly; particularly, the possibility of pharmacokinetic interferences shouldbe taken into account between of calcineurin inhibitors; and the simultaneous use of nephrotoxic agents should be avoided whenever possible. In patients with graftdysfunction, a renal biopsy should be performed to exclude or conrm a diagnosis of nephrotoxicity. It should be kept in mind that the lesions caused bycalcineurin inhibitors can be halted or even improved by reducing or stopping the drug in the due time [46]. In summary, specic diseases represent a frequent cause of graft failure. In a number of cases, an early Fig. 2. Polyoma BK virus nephritis. Interstitial nephritis with severe tubular damage.

Ban, Nephrology, IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore, Milan,Italy.)Renal transplantation today 2941 Page 72diagnosis and an appropriate treatment may allow the reversal of graft dysfunction. The diagnosis is often difcult. Renal biopsy is the most important tool to establish the diagnosis and should be per-formed in any case of graft deterioration of uncertain origin. Non-specic causes of graft dysfunction Up to 20-25% of renal transplant recipients develop overt 'de novo' diabetes [47,48]. These patients have an increased risk of cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease [49]. Moreover, patients with post-transplant diabetes may develop a diabeticnephropathy and graft dysfunction in the long-term [47,50]. Arterial hypertension is frequent in renal transplant patients. Opelz et al. [51] showed a strong association between the values of blood pressure and the risk ofchronic graft dysfunction. The inappropriate use of nephrotoxic agents may also expose to progressive may cause renal toxicity, which is usually dose-dependent. Patients showing an increase in serum creatinine should bealways asked about the use of potentially nephrotoxic drugs. The role of proteinuria in the progression of renal disease has been the subject of numerous experimental and clinical studies. Roodnat et al. [52] showed that both patient survival and graft survival (censoredby death) were signicantly lower in renal transplantrecipients with proteinuria than in non-proteinuric patients. CMV infection is a frequent complication in renal transplantation. More than 50% of seronegative [53]and/C2410% of seropositive transplant patients [54] may develop symptomatic CMV disease. Apart from the well-known consequences of CMV disease, the infec- tion can increase the risk of acute [55] and chronic rejection [56] through overproduction of mediators,cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. To prevent the deleterious impact of these factors on progression, fasting and postprandial glucoseshould be checked frequently and glucose intoleranceshould be treated as early as possible; arterial hyper- tension should be treated aggressively, trying to keep blood pressure levels within the normal range; nephro-toxic agents should not be used unless strictly necessary; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin-receptor blockers should be con-sidered in patients with proteinuria; and CMV infection should be prevented or treated with specic antiviral agents. Transplant glomerulopathy This still mysterious entity is characterized clinically by proteinuria and progressive graft dysfunction. Graft biopsy shows enlarged glomeruli, mesangiolysis and glomerular reduplication ofglomerular basement membranes is seen. Electron microscopy shows widening of the subendothelial Fig. 3. Cyclosporin-related arteriolopathy. Mucinoid thickening of the intima Dr G. Ban, Ospedale Maggiore, Milan, Italy.)2942 C. Ponticelli Page 73space (Figure 4). Transplant glomerulopathy is often classied as an expression of chronic rejection, but other investigators prefer to consider it as a separateentity. The prognosis is poor [57]. However, a few patients may maintain some degree of renal function even for years. There is no effective therapy. Post-transplant predictors of chronic rejection There is evidence that acute rejection can influence the long-term outcome of renal transplantation. Graft half-life is longer in patients who never experienced acute rejection [58]. However, the long-term impactof rejection on graft function is related more to itscharacteristics than to its occurrence. Long-term graft survival is better in patients who had only a single episode than in patients with two or more episodesof rejection [59,60]. Opelz [61] showed that when rejection is completely reversible, it does not affect 5 year graft survival. Sijpkens et al. [62] pointed out that the prognosis is worse for patients who had late rejection than for those who had early rejection: 10 year graft survival censored by death was 86% for patientswho developed rejection by the third post-transplantmonth and 45% for patients who had rejection after the third month. Long-term graft survival is usually excellent in patients with borderline or grade I rejec-tion, according to the Banff '97 classication [63], while the prognosis is worse for patients with grade II and very poor for patients with grade III rejection[64,65]. More recently, the Banff classication has been revised by adding the category 'humoral rejec- tion', dened by either the presence of deposits ofC4d (a split product of the C4 component of comple- ment) in peritubular capillaries and/or the presence of circulating donor-specic antibodies [66]. The histo-logical equivalents are the presence of neutrophils in the peritubular capillaries and glomeruli and brinoid necrosis of arteries. Thus, the impact of an acuterejection on the long-term outcome depends on the number of rejections, on the reversibility (complete or partial), on the time of onset (early or late), onthe histological outlook according to the Banffcriteria and on the development of humoral antibodies. The occurrence of delayed graft function (DGF) may require dialysis, may prolong hospitalizationand may expose to an increased risk of infection. Whether DGF per se affects long-term graft survival is still controversial. However, there is agreement that the combination of DGF with rejection has a deleterious effect on graft survival [67,68]. As a matter of fact, it is very difcult to identify acute rejec-tion in an oliguric patient. Moreover, the endothelial damage caused by reperfusion injury and by acute rejection may eventually result in the developmentof a chronic obliterative vasculopathy (Figure 5).Thus, efforts should be made to prevent or attenuate the damage caused by ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Reduction of the cold ischaemia time has beenadvocated by some investigators. However, two large studies [69,70] showed that, at least up to 30-36 h, cold ischaemia time does not signicantly affectgraft survival. Intracellular perfusion solutions are now extensively used after it has been demonstrated that they reduce the risk of DGF. Antioxidant andantiapoptotic agents proved to be effective in experi- Fig. 4. Transplant glomerulopathy.

Mihatsch, University of Basel, Switzerland.)Renal transplantation today 2943 Page 74mental models, but they are still not used widely in clinical practice. As the problem of ischaemia- reperfusion injury is becoming more and more impor- tant with the more frequent use of marginal donors,further studies are needed to overcome this potentialconsequence. An important cause of late graft failure is poor patient compliance . Its frequency is poorly known, as many patients are reluctant to admit non-adherence to therapy. A recent paper [71] reviewed the studies devoted to the problem of compliance. Cross-sectionalstudies based on a self-report questionnaire suggested poor compliance in 22% of transplant recipients. Cohort studies indicated that 36% of the cases ofgraft loss were preceded by episodes of non-adherence.Meta-analysis of these studies showed that the odds of graft failure increased seven-fold in non-adherent patients. Poor compliance is often related to thecomplexity of and disguration from treatment as well as to the social isolation of the patient. To improve the compliance of the patient, the treatment shouldbe simplied; the patient should be informed about the effects of the drugs and the consequences of a poor adherence; and the clinician should have a rmpartnership with the patient and should pay attention to their problems, by modifying therapy in case of disturbing side effects. Signicant improvements ingraft survival might be obtained by improving thecompliance of our patients. Chronic allograft nephropathy This term encompasses most causes of late dysfunc-tion and has been adopted to indicate a progressive and irreversible histological and functional deteriora- tion of the transplanted kidney. However, for theclinician it is of great importance to know the maincause of chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). In this regard there is much confusion, because in many cases a late renal biopsy shows non-specic featuresrendering a correct diagnosis almost impossible. The transplant community seems to be divided into twoparties: those (including this writer) who feel that the main cause of late graft failure is chronic rejectionand those who feel that it is the chronic toxicity of calcineurin inhibitors. The term chronic rejection should be applied only to cases of CAN caused by a cellular or humoralalloimmune response. Unfortunately, it is not easy to recognize whether a CAN is caused by rejectionor by non-immunological causes, as in both cases the graft biopsy shows interstitial brosis, tubular atrophy and glomerular sclerosis. Some cases of laterejection, characterized by major inltration by mono- nuclear cells, are probably sustained by T-cell activa- tion, favoured by inadequate immunosuppressionor poor compliance. If promptly recognized, unfortu-nately unusual, such late rejections may benet from standard anti-rejection therapy plus reinforce- ment of maintenance therapy. However, most casesof chronic rejection are caused by humoral antibodies, either directed against HLA or minor antigens [72]. Besides the presence of de novo humoral antibodies, some histological features are considered to be specic for chronic humoral rejection, such as multilayering lamination of the basement arterial intimal brosis with and a bright linear staining of CD4 along over half ofperitubular capillaries [66]. Theoretically, plasmapher- Fig. 6. Severe obliterative transplant arteriopathy in an interlobular artery. (Courtesy of Dr G.

Ponticelli Page 75esis, intravenous immunoglobulins and/or rituximab might obtain some reduction of circulating antibodies,but it remains unclear whether these measures may actually benet the clinical outcome in patients with chronic humoral rejection. The problem is furthercomplicated by the fact that the nephron loss, caused by T cell-mediated or humoral rejection, can trigger a vicious circle perpetuating the progression throughnon-immunological factors, such as glomerular atherosclerosis. cell proliferation that may result ulti- mately in the development of transplant arteriosclerosis [74]. Finally, release of novel self-antigens causedby rejection might trigger an indirect recognition ofalloantigens by antigen-presenting cells of the reci- pient as demonstrated in lung transplantation [75]. This synergistic interplay of immunological and non-immunological events might explain why it is so difcult to manage chronic rejection. Also, in cases of CAN caused by calcineurin-inhibitor toxicity or by accelerated senescence , graft injury can trigger non-specic accelerating factors that con- tribute to progressive graft dysfunction. In a numberof patients, some improvement of renal function has been achieved by replacing calcineurin inhibitors with mycophenolate mofetil [76,77] or with sirolimus[78]. However, even with graft biopsy, it is not easyto exclude immunological activation in these cases of CAN. A number of patients are, therefore, exposed to the risk of late irreversible rejection after stoppingthe calcineurin inhibitor. It is also possible to speculate that the overexpression of chemokines and cytokines and a release of antigens from the damaged kidneycan favour an indirect recognition and T-cell sensitiza- tion that may trigger a late rejection even in cases of CAN originally triggered by non-immunologicalfactors. Conclusions Many factors and events can complicate the outcomeof renal transplantation and can eventually lead to progressive renal dysfunction and graft failure. Some of these factors are unmodiable a priori and forsome other complications we do not have any effec- tive therapy. A recent review of the American data concluded that, in spite of a marked decrease in acuterejection, there is a lack of improvement in long-term graft survival [79]. Should we conclude that progress in renal transplantation is limited, i.e. that we haveachieved better graft survival in the short-term withouthaving achieved any signicant impact in the long- term? This is not the impression of this writer. In Milan we reviewed our own results in patients treated withkidney transplantation. The review included patients transplanted between 1983 and 2000. Consequently, a number of patients were treated with too high dosesof cyclosporin and others could not prot from the use of newer immunosuppressive and supportive therapy.In spite of these drawbacks, the cumulative graft half-life was 20 years. If the data were censored bydeath, the pure graft half-life would have been 31 years [80]. At any rate, not only single-centre results, but also the cumulative European data clearly showthat there has been a progressive improvement of the graft half-life in spite of the older age of donors and recipients. The data of CTS reported a graft half-life of7 years for cadaver grafts transplanted between 1982 and 1984 vsa graft half-life of 19.5 years for graft transplanted between 1997 and 1998 [81]. In summary, many different factors and events may lead to chronic graft dysfunction. In the case of specic renal diseases or drug-related nephro-toxicity, prompt recognition and treatment of theunderlying cause may slow progression. Thus, an early diagnosis is of paramount importance and the use of renal biopsy in doubtful cases should beencouraged. Whatever the cause of graft dysfunction, non-specic accelerating factors, such as hyperten- sion, CMV infection, glucose intolerance, proteinuriaetc., should be treated early and aggressively. The differential diagnosis between chronic rejection and chronic drug toxicity is difcult, but some cluesmay help to identify the immunological nature of a CAN. In many cases an early biopsy is helpful, while a late biopsy is generally of no use. Today,although many unresolved problems persist, long-term graft survival is possible for many trans- plant recipients, if they are monitored regularly by experienced clinicians. It is likely that in the nearfuture the results will even be improved further by the introduction of newer immunosuppressive agents with a better therapeutic index. Conflict of interest statement .

In general, th e incid ence of CR increa ses with time after Page 97transplantation and eventually affects a majority of solid organ allografts, except for liver allografts. By 5 years after transplantation, CR a ffects only about 5% of liver recipients, but up to 80% of lung allograft recipients (Table 1) and 30%-40% of heart, kidney, and pancreas allograft recipients. Table 1. Estimates of the Incidence of Chronic Rejection in Various Solid Organ Allografts Allograft Approximate Incidence of OA at 5 Years after Transplantation References Heart 25%-60% (116, 523-526) (obliterative br onchiolitis in lung) (47, 113, 114, 116, 524, 527) Kidney 40%-50% (chronic allo graft nephropathy) (450, 528) Isolated lung 28/45% (single/double l ung) to 80% (35, 113, 226, 304, 305, 529) Liver 4%-6% in adults 8%-12% in children (41, 46, 530) Pancreas alone 30%-70%*(late graft loss), (531, 532) Pancreas and kidney 20%-40%* (337, 339, 531) * Estimates based on graft survival rates after 1 year, with the assumption that most late graft failures are due to CR. Some interesting curiosities emerge when more than 1 organ from the same donor is transplanted into a single recipient. For example, the incidence of CR is about 40% in isolated cardiac allografts, but falls to 10%-20% when a heart is combined with the lungs in a composite graft. This \"composite effect\" is most predictable and signifi cant when other organ(s) are combined with a liver allograft.[1-3] Etiology and Risk Factors Alloimmune immunologic injury was suspected as th e major reason for the chronic deterioration of kidney allografts when it was first observed nearly 50 years ago[4-5] -- hence the designation CR. The premise that CR is primarily immunol ogically mediated is best supported by the observation that isografts rarely suffer this comp lication, and if they do, it is much delayed and less severe in comparison to allografts.[6-9] The effect of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matching on long-term heart, lung, and kidney allograft survival is also cited as proof of an immune etiology for CR. [10-22] With complete 6-antigen matches, immunologic causes of allograft failure are minimized.[23,24)] Any degree of mismatching usually results in a progressive attr ition of graft function over time,[10-17,25] which is in large part related to CR. However, some studies have shown that the actual impact of imperfect matching on long-term allograft survival has been less than expected. [10,11,13,17,26-30] The importance of immunologic injury in the devel opment of CR is also indirectly supported by many clinical studies, in which severe or persistent AR[25,31-46] or inadequate immunosuppression[43,46-48] increases the incidence of CR. Chronic rejection is also more common after transplantation across a variety of donor-reci pient matching characteristics, such as racial Page 98barrier (eg, Caucasian donors into non-Caucasian recipients)[11,12,14,17,49]; sex mismatching (male donor to female recipient and vice versa)[37,50]; and prior viral infections (CMV-positive donor to CMV-negative recipient).[51-58] Chronic rejection is also more common after the use of immune- activating drugs, such as alpha-IFN.[59-61] Although the immunologic factors listed above are generally considered to be most important, nonimmunologic factors -- such as magnification of immunologic reactivity, various aspects of the repair response, and disruption of structural integr ity -- also contribute to the development of CR. Included under nonimmunologic factors are older donor age,[25,46,62] inadequate functional capacity of the donor organ to meet the metabolic demands of the recipient,[63] prolonged cold ischemia,[41,64,65] donor atherosclerosis,[66-68] and conventional risk factors for atherosclerosis in the recipient.[62,69-71] Immune Mechanisms in Ch ronic Allograft Rejection Since CR often begins during severe or persistent AR episodes, it is important to briefly review those aspects of AR that predispose to the development of CR. Subsequently, immunologic mechanisms involved in CR are discussed. Setting the Stage for Chronic Rejection: Acute Rejection and Direct Allorecognition Implantation of any solid organ allograft results in a characteristic cycle of heightened immune activation,[27,72-74] followed by evolution toward a more stable relationship when immunosuppression can be considerably lowered. This prototypic series of events is attributable to the donor hematolymphoid cells[75] that emigrate from the allograft into recipient lymphoid tissues, simultaneously with an influx of recipient cells into the allograft.[76-79] Direct interaction between donor and recipient cells at these sites causes bidirectional stimulation of both donor and recipient T cells. At these sites, dendritic cells[75,79] engage and stimulate allogeneic T-cell (ie, donor dendritic cellsdirectly stimulating recipient T cells).[80-82] Several lines of evidence support the cont ention that AR is dominated by direct allorecognition[80,83] (reviewed in Shirwan[84]). These include: (1) the hi gh precursor frequency of T cells recognizing allogeneic ma jor histocompatibility complex (M HC) molecules directly; (2) marked amelioration or absence of AR, but persi stence of CR in allografts depleted of donor antigen-presenting cells (APC) prio r to transplantation; (3) enhancem ent of AR by pretreatment of donors with agents that increase the number of do nor APCs; and (4) ability of T-cell lines specific for direct recognition of allogeneic MHC molecules to induce AR in immunocompromised hosts.[84] The high precursor frequency and strength of the reaction explain the brisk polyclonal activation of T cells, secretion of cytokines and chemokines, and subsequent upregulation of various costimulatory and adhesion molecules on surrounding tissues. This is followed by maturation of cytotoxic T cells; expansion and maturation of B cells; and recruitment of macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils and other effector cell s, all of which have the potential to damage the organ. [85-88] The robust nature of the direct presentation pathway explains the frequency of clinical symptoms and the potential for rapid allograft failure with AR. Direct allostimulation has been associated with a pr edominance of TH1 activation, reflected in F-alpha, GM-CSF, IL-3) and the severity of this reac tion in the allograft is the mainstay of patient management during the first several months after transplantation. Fortunately, the direct allostimulation pathway is highly sensitive to increased immunosuppression, and AR is controllable in a majority of patients. [80-82] Page 99The severity of AR is influenced by many factor s, including but not limited to age, sex, race, and general overall health of the recipient. In general, younger, healthier, female, and black recipients show higher responsiveness to donor organs. Responsiveness is also influenced by prior exposure to the same or similar alloantigens vi a blood transfusions, previous transplants, or pregnancy. Clinically, the severity of AR is gauged by a combination of symptoms and histopathologic findings in an allograft biopsy. The hallmark histopathologic feature of severe AR, which is predictive of graft failure and a higher incidence of CR, is arterial inflammation or necrosis. Some histopathologic gr ading systems, which are less reliable, also include indirect evidence of rejection-related ischemia, such as interstitial hemorrhage or ischemic necrosis. Ischemic infarction is the final common path of organ damage in AR. Ongoing Immunologic Injury: The Transition to Chronic Rejection and Indirect Allorecognition Once the donor hematolymphoid cells are destroyed or die out, there is an evolution of the donor- recipient immunologic interface to one that is less violent, but not necessarily less capable of immunologic injury. This coincides with a transition from direct to indirect alloantigen presentation. The latter refers to the uptake of donor allopeptides by recipient APCs, followed by MHC- restricted presentation of peptides to recipient T cells.[82,83,93-95] Increased transcripts for granzyme B, the presence of such as IFN-gamma, [96] and chemokines, suggest that strong TH1 activation during AR might explain the evolution to CR, because activated recipient macrophages play an important role. Activated macrophages have been strongly implicat ed in virtually all aspects of CR: indirect allopresentation, tissue injury, upregulation of adhesion molecules, alterations in blood flow, and release of fibrogenic growth factors.[9,97-108] Evidence supporting the shift to the indirect pat hway during CR is less compelling than that supporting the role of direct presentation in AR, but strong enough to seriously consider as an important immunologic mechanism,[82,83,93-95] as reviewed in Shirwan.[84] Factors in support of the indirect pathway include: (1) ongoing immunologic injury in the allo graft, despite disappearance of donor APCs[3]; (2) influx of activated recipient macrophages[3]; (3) c) the important role of alloantibodies in CR, mediated by B cells servi ng as APCs for CD4+ T cells generating these antibodies; (4) susceptibility of allografts to CR that have been depleted of donor APCs prior to transplantation; and (5) the high incidence of CD4+ T-cell responses to donor MHC allopeptides via indirect recognition in patients with CR.[93,94] Indeed, allografts that manifest persistent AR[83,94] and those that evolve toward CR[83,93,94] show evidence of increased indirect alloantigen presentation and diminish ed direct presentation.[80] The indirect alloresponse is oligoclonal and init ially involves only a few dominant antigen peptides on donor MHC class II DR determinants.[82,83,93,94] However, indirect presentation can be associated with \"epitope spreading\" to new det erminants on donor MHC and tissue-specific antigens or \"autoantigens.\"[82,83,93,94,109-111] More importantly, the indirect pathway is less sensitive to immunosuppressive blockade by cyclosporin A, wh ich explains the comparatively poor response of CR to increased immunosuppression (see sect ion on Treatment of Chronic Rejection). Shortly after the discovery of TH1 (inflammatory CD4+ T cells) and TH2 (helper CD4+ T cells), it was thought that TH1 predominant responses we re associated with AR, whereas TH2 profiles were more typical of allograft acceptance or tole rance. However, more recent evidence suggests that this explanation was overly simplistic.[89-92] TH2 predominance has also been associated with the indirect pathway of allopeptide pres entation and production of alloantibodies,[89-92] cytokines and growth factors typically seen in CR.[84] Evidence supporting this contention includes the presence of CD4+ TH2 cells in chronically rejecti ng organs, the critical role of TH2-type cytokines in the regulation of effector mechanisms of CR, and the inability of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent AR, but not CR.[84] Page 100How Immunologic Injury Leads to the Common Manifestations of Chronic Rejection in Different Organs The immunologic injury discussed above disrupts normal allograft structure and function. It also triggers repair responses that lead to the common hi stopathologic features of CR in all destruction of organ-associated lymphoid tissues and lymphatic vessels.Although all of these changes occu r to some extent in mo st allografts with CR, 1 or more of these features usually predominate in particular organs (Table 2). For example, the primary manifestation of CR in heart and kidney a llografts is OA (see sections on Manifestations of Chronic Rejection). In lung allografts, destructi on of the small bronchio les, termed \"obliterative bronchiolitis\" (OB), is the major manifestation of CR,[35,112-116] and vascular disease is generally considered to be of secondary importance.[35,112-114,116] In liver allografts, both bile duct loss and OA (see sections on Manifestations of Chronic Rejection) contribute to allograft failure.[117-121] Table 2. Principal Manifestation of Chronic Rejection in the VariousVascularized Allografts Common Features of Chronic Rejection Allograft Vascular disease Interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, and conduits Atrophy/destruction of organ-associated lymphoid tissues and lymphatic vessels Heart +++ OA + Not applicable + Kidney +++ OA Glomerular ++ well studied mucosal 101system Paul[111] recently summarized the various hypothese s used to explain the pathogenic mechanisms leading from immunologic tissue injury to the development of CR in kidney allografts. These hypotheses can be extrapolated to extra-kidney allografts and are useful in conceptualizing potential therapeutic interventions. Fundamental to al l of these hypotheses is acceptance of the premise that CR develops as a pathogenic \"respo nse to injury,\" similar to atherosclerosis.[97,122,123] The basic algorithm is as follows: Severe or persistent immunologic injury -> of normal structure -> repair response-> parenchymal fibrosis, OA and other manifestations of CR Immunological tissue injury in the nontransplant se tting is a common event. However, the injury is usually mild and transient, and organ structure and function return to normal after the insult is eliminated. In allografts, rejection-related immunol ogic injury is often severe and/or persistent and eventually results in progressive arterial narrowing a nd interstitial fibrosis in those allografts that develop CR. Any hypothesis used to completely ex plain the pathogenesis of CR must therefore account for both the severity and/or persistence of the immunologic injury and the propensity to develop fibrosis and vascular disease. The Immunolymphatic Theory of Chronic Rejection The immunolymphatic theory of CR contends that freedom from CR requires robust tolerance; and since tolerance is a biologic function of the immune system, the presence of the donor immune system (hematopoietic chimerism) is required.[3] An important component of the donor immune system is the population of APCs that re side within the allograft and recipient lymphoid tissues.[3,124] These cells help maintain tolerance to the organ[3] and enable the organ to respond to environmental challenges.[3] Destruction of these cells by severe and/or persistent immunologic injury has several consequences. This not on ly eliminates the possibility for robu st tolerance, but also disrupts the egress of lymphatic cells and flui d that normally accumulate in t he interstitium of the allograft. This compromises the normal response to environmental challenges, such as infection. It also predisposes to the development of OA and inters titial fibrosis, cytokine and growth factor-rich fluid stagnates in the allograft. Thus, normal physiology (ie, production and reabsorption of lymph), is transformed in to a driving force of tissue pathology. The Cytokine Excess Theory of Chronic Rejection . The cytokine excess theory suggests that CR develops because of excessive scar formation in the allograft in response to the tissue injury. [111] Evidence supporting this contention incl udes the correlation between high intragraft TGF-beta production and increased risk of late graft failure.[96,102,125-131] Although most studies have focused on TGF-beta because of its role in fibr ogenesis, more mediators will become the focus of study as their role in organ repair reactions becomes clarified. The Loss of Supporting Architecture Theory of Chronic Rejection . The loss of supporting architecture theory[111] is based on the concept that repair processes such as tubular regeneration after injury are dependent on the 3-dimensional stromal framework, including the basement membrane. Destruction of the su pporting architecture by severe injury compromises repair responses. Parenchymal cells that would norma lly migrate and divide to repair a defect might undergo apoptosis. The net effect is a tendency of the allograft to develop excessive scarring in response to injury instead of regeneration to the normal architectural baseline. Page 102The Premature Senescence Theory of Chronic Rejection. The premature senescence theory[111,132] suggests that the excessive fibrosis of CR may be the result of accelerated aging of allograft parenchymal and endothelial cells. This accelerated aging may occur as a consequence of exposure to multiple stressors, such as or gan harvesting, implantation, and rejection episodes, which subject these cell populations to ischemia, oxidative damage, and increased demand for cell division. Over time, the parenchymal and endothelial cells reach their Hayflick limit[133,134] and, similar to normal aged organs, the allograft displays a propensity to heal by fibrosis after injury. All of the above hypotheses suggest valid mech anisms for linking tissue injury and abnormalities of the repair response to the development of CR. Common to all however, is a central theme of tissue injury and repair. Thus, whatever mechanisms are ultimately responsible for the development of CR, it seems clea r that limiting the severity and/ or persistence of immunologic injury will be the most effective way of dimi nishing the impact of CR on long-term allograft survival.[111] Common Features of Chronic Rejection Graft Vascular Disease or Obliterative Arteriopathy Obliterative arteriopathy, also referred to as gra ft vascular disease, is the most widely recognized manifestation of CR. It is a progressive narrowing of muscular allograft arteries due to fibrointimal hyperplasia and mural remodeling.[3,135-138] In some respects, it is similar to atherosclerosis (AS), which is endemic in the general population, but most evidence suggests that OA and AS are distinct disorders. Identifying distinguishing features and avoiding confusion between these conditions necessitate precise te rminology. \"Obliterative arteriopathy\" will be used throughout this review to refer to the artery disease associated with CR in all allografts . \"Atherosclerosis\" will be used to refer to the common endemic disease. In some allografts, overlap between OA and AS is considerable, so distinguishing between the 2 disorders using various clinical, radiologic, and even histopathologic techniques can be quite difficult.[70,139,140] This is particularly true for heart allogr afts, which are normally prone to AS. It is less of a problem in atheroresistant organs such as the liver. A further complicating issue is the increased susceptibility of allograft recipient s to AS compared with the general population, because of a higher incidence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, which are side effects of immunosuppressive medications. In general, the distribution of OA lesions in allografts is one of the key features used to distinguish it from AS. AS preferentially affects the lar ge extracorporeal arteries, such as the epicardial portions of the coronary arteries. [116,141-143] OA more often and medium-size intraorgan has been our experience, however, that OA lesions are not as diffuse as one might expect from a review of the literature.[116,141-145] Even though the arterial tree is more diffuse ly involved, OA lesions in both large and smaller arteries are often patchy in distribution, and it has also been our impression that they often begin and evolve more quickly near branch points. [142] Involvement of the allograft by either OA or AS is usually established by angiographi c and various other imaging studies (see sections on Manifestations of Chronic Rejection).[44,136,146-148] Models Used to Study Obliterative Arteriopathy . Except for kidney allografts, the association between immunologic injury and the development of arterial disease is difficult to study in human tissue biopsies. Therefore, animal models are exte nsively used to isolate and study the various aspects of OA. One popular model exploits t he weak immunologic barrier between LEW and F- 344 rats, where only minor histocompatibility barriers are crossed.[98,149-154] Another model employs Page 103transient treatment with various forms of imm unosuppression, the most popular being a short course of cyclosporine or anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies.[155,156] The general approach in these models is to allow a nonlethal level of AR to occur, which subsequently evolves into CR. In these models and in human tissue samples, it is relatively clear that the allogeneic arterial endothelium is injured during AR, primarily by antidonor antibodies and/or T cells and macrophages, which can directly invade the arterial intima.[100,149,151-153,155-157] This injury disrupts intimal homeostasis and triggers a stereotypic repair response [122,123,158] that eventually narrows the lumen of affected arteries.[64,139,142,145] Because OA is so strongly correlated with arterial intimal inflammation, it is tempting to conclude that this is the predominant or only pathway leading from immunologic injury to OA.[97,142,155,159-161] However, arterial inflammation is not always observed,[3,162] and fibrointimal hyperplasia can progress without it.[162-166] When arterial inflammation is not seen, it is thought that antibody alone initiates the damage or that the stereotypic vascular repair response can proceed without continued immunologic injury.[163,166] Even though OA can occur without intimal inflammation, most investigators would agree that cellular immunity importantly contributes to its development. The preferential localization of leukocytes in the adventitia and intima suggest s that these are the most important antigenic targets or sites of damage. [97,142,145,155,159,160,167] The adventitia is rich in lymphatics and donor dendritic cells, making it a site of both periph eral sensitization and a conduit for emigrating leukocytes in AR.[3,97,142,155,167,168] When rejection is mild, the inflammation is usually limited to the adventitia.[3] However, adventitial injury alone can also trigger an intimal repair response.[3,137,169] When rejection is severe, or when the recipient harbors antidonor antibodies, mononuclear and/or neutrophilic endotheliitis is usually also present. [97,98,139,143,149-152,170,171] Immunophenotypic analyses have shown that the arte rial inflammation consists primarily of an admixture of T cells and macrophages.[70,97,142,159,161,172] In some studies, CD8+ T cells are the most common,[159,172] a subset of which show perforin pathway.[159,161] CD4- and CD8- double negative and gamma-delta-positive T cells have been cultured in vitro from affected vessels.[173] The presence of occasional dendritic cells signals ongoing antigenic presentation.[97] Macrophages, however, often become the predominant inflammatory cell population, which may be related to the increased deposition of ground substance and lipid trapping, both of which stimulate phagocytosis.[70,97,142,161,172,174-176] The macrophages permeate the adventitia, media, and intima, and proliferate within the artery.[142] Foam cell transformation is more common in early lesions and most often seen in liver allografts. [70,120,142,143,145,174-177] Substitution of immune deficient and/or knockout mice as recipients into CR models has further clarified the nature of the immunologic injury by isolating the contribution of humoral and cellular components.[162,165] The development of OA in combined immune-deficient mice treated with repeated injections of exogenous antidonor antibodies[162] nicely illustrates the importance of alloantibodies. Other models also clearly show a role for antibody-mediated damage.[178,179] However, OA also develops in B-cell knockout mi ce that presumably are incapable of an antibody response,[162,165] showing an important contribution by cellular immunity. Thus, both cellular and humoral immunity contribute to the arterial injury. Histopathologic Studies of Acute Arterial Injury . The evolution from acute arterial injury to OA can be precisely followed by detailed histopathologic studies.[123,142,143,180] Common early intimal findings include endothelial activation, which hi stologically manifests as hypertrophy or a \"hobnail\" appearance with eosinophilic transformation of the cytoplasm.[3,142,155,157] This correlates with functional activation,[156,157] including upregulation of class II MHC and adhesion molecules.[3,99,142,181-184] Endothelial damage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, including direct antibody and complement-mediated or CTL Fas-mediated apoptosis,[161] the result of which is a Page 104loss of barrier function and the influx of clotting proteins (including fibrin), platelets, blood cells, and lipids. Edema and increased deposition of intercellular matrix and lipid[174] and a local turnover of cells[3,161] are seen in all 3 layers but are especially common in the intima. Taken all together, these processes result in disruption of intimal homeostasis and trigger the stereotypic repair response, typically seen in the arteries of a ll types of allografts. The response includes recruitment of medial myocytes, infiltration of macrophages,[97,98,139,143,149-152,170] ev entually cause lumenal narrowing and predispose to thrombosis. In the media, early changes include edema and de generation or frank necrosis of individual myocytes.[3,167] Later, the media can become thinned,[142,185] presumably as a result of intimal migration of medial myocytes in response to inju ry. More importantly, the arteries affected by intimal thickening begin to dilate in an attemp t to compensate for the lumenal narrowing. Eventually, even this compensatory mechanism fail s. Compensatory failure could be related to replacement of the media by foam cells and/or fibrobl asts or adventitial fibrosis, so that the artery is no longer a flexible muscular conduit, but a ri gid tube formed by a mixture of fibroblasts and foam cells. Changes in the adventitia of arteries have rece ived far less attention than they deserve. Early after transplantation, the adventitia is a primary si te of sensitization, whic h results in inflammation and edema.[3,168] The adventitial inflammation often persists during the transition to CR,[3,97,142] which is followed by the development of adventitial fibrosis[3,186] in fully developed lesions. These adventitial abnormalities likely contribute to the ultimate failure of the artery to dilate in compensation for the intimal thickening. The Arterial Repair Response . At some stage in its development, the stereotypic arterial repair response proceeds independently of the arterial injury,[163,164,166] and it is the repair response that is the final common pathway for the development of OA and organ dysfunction. This has led to a natural preoccupation with understanding t he molecular mechanisms of myofibroblast proliferation,[187] with the aim of finding key points of possible therapeutic intervention. A number of investigators have utilized the isolated aort ic allograft model, introduced by Hayry.[32] Although this model does not address the organ parenchyma,[166,168,188-191] it offers a quick way of screening agents that might be of potential therapeutic benefit. Multiple and redundant signaling molecules initiate and/or promote smooth muscle cell proliferation and fibrogenesis,[32,98,130,187,192-195] similar to the situation observed with AS in the general population.[196-199] Included are growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines.[9,32,98-101,130,187,192- 195,200-203] For example, it has been shown that platelet-derived growth factor A and B,[192,193,204] fibroblast growth factor,[192,194,205] insulin-like growth factor-1[187] and interleukin (IL)-1[187] can be released by myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells into the arterial intima, stimulating smooth muscle cells to migrate to the site of injury and proliferate. Macrophages are also an important source of molecules causing damage and initiating the repair response and fibrogenesis.[9,96,98-101,153,154,200,206] This helps explain the inhibition of OA by an essential fatty acid-deficient diet, whic h interferes with leukocyte chemotaxis.[98] Transforming growth factor beta-1 might also importantly contribute to fibrosis.[102,130,192,195,202] As well, IL-6 has been linked to the glomerular proliferative lesions in chronic kidney allograft rejection.[99] The reader is referred to several excellent reviews for a more detailed account of this complex area.[32,34,187,192,196-198,206-208] Patchy Inflammation, Fibrosis, and Parenchymal Atrophy The inflammation associated with CR consists predominantly of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells. The infiltrates are often organiz ed into nodular aggregates, replete with recipient Page 105APCs and germinal centers.[3,97,124,209] Most studies of CR have shown primarily CD4+ with fewer CD8+ T cells[3,96,209-212] and compared with AR, in CR there are usually more recipient macrophages and B cells.[181,212,213] Donor interstitial hematolymphoid cells are invariably destroyed in chronically rejecting allografts.[3] Anatomic arrangement and immunohistochemical studies are supportive of ongoing indirect alloantigen presentation. The development of patchy fibrosis and associ ated parenchymal atrophy is often the first manifestation of CR,[142] an observation that has been used to predict the later development of CR in renal[214] and lung allografts.[147,215] The fibrosis usually develops in areas of ongoing immunologic damage and is associated with t he deposition of tenascin and other matrix components,[102,216] endothelin,[217] and activation of interstitial myofibroblasts.[102] Larger scars representing healed infarcts and fibrosis in waters hed regions supplied by the terminal circulation suggest that ischemia also contributes to fibrogenesis.[142] Destruction of Epithelial-lined Conduits Epithelial cell-lined conduits used for exchange of substances with the environment (eg, bronchioles, bile ducts, pancreatic ducts, r enal tubular epithelium) are particularly prone to damage during CR. There are several possible n onexclusionary explanations for this observation: (1) the presence of a basement membrane, whic h could potentially play a role in migration, positioning, and costimulation of T cells[218]; (2) an immunologically active antigenic profile that is significantly different from other parenchymal cells, including expression of class I and II MHC and various adhesion and costimulatory molecules[218,219]; (3) the presence of nearby APCs and lymphatics that facilitate the functional role of these conduits in processing environmental antigen for local presentation and traffic to the regional lymph nodes[218]; (4) the ability of the epithelial cells to produce proinflammatory and fibrogenic cytokines; and (5) a deficient arterial blood supply. Basement membranes contain matrix components important to the migration, positioning, and costimulation of T cells.[218] In lung allografts, staining for type IV collagen revealed early focal bronchiolar basement membrane damage, manife sted by thickening and subsequent splitting and duplication, which later led to OB.[215] Epithelial cell \"immunogenicity\" is also enhanced by unique antigenic profiles[218] and their ability to upregulate immunologically active adhesion and costimulatory molecules. When activated, biliary epithelial and bronchiolar epithelial cells can also produce a variety of proinflammatory and fibr ogenic and TGF-beta.[128,218-225] This enables the epithelial cells to dynamically participate in immune reactions, including rejection and response to foreign antigens, and to repair reactions. For example, El-Gamel and associates [128] showed that increased expression of TGF-beta during injury is a risk factor for the development of OB. Kallio and colleagues[107] showed that nitric oxide production by bronchial epithelial cells has at least a partial protective role in OB by either directly or indirectly i nhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation and modulation of the immune response towards TH-2 cytokines. The epithelial-lined conduits also transport envir onmental antigens, are intermixed with APCs, and are surrounded by a rich lymphatic plexus which drains to the regional lymph nodes. Exposure to environmental or microbial anti gens can cause local immune activation. In an allograft, this triggers upregulation of forei gn MHC, adhesion, and various other i mmunologically active molecules, thereby potentiating rejection reactions. The inflammatory response to either the environmental or alloantigen(s) can compromise the structural integrity of the conduit and the surrounding microvasculature and lymphatic drain age. This, in turn, can inhibit efficient antigen clearing and cause ischemic damage, leading to a vicious cycle alternating between a persistent and inadequate immune response to environmental antigens and allogeneic injury. This concept is illustrated by the rapid decline of lung transplant recipientswithout OB who acqu ire a pulmonary infection. [226] Page 106A separate arterial circulation primarily supplies allograft bile ducts and bronchioles.[117,118,227] Obliteration of these arteries by CR, or failure to reanastomose the vessels at the time of transplantation, can cause ischemic injury to the conduits.[117,118,227] Thus, in lung and liver allografts, both direct immunologic injury and ischem ia contribute to the destruction of epithelial conduits[57,219] and bile ducts[40,48,117,119,121,228-232] during CR. Disruption of Lymphatics and Organ-Associated Lymphoid Tissues Hematolymphoid cells constantly travel into, transiently occupy, and then leave the interstitium of all vascularized organs. These cells are prim arily derived from progenitors that migrate hematogenously from the bone marrow and consist of mature T and B cells, macrophages, hematopoietic stem cells, and dendritic cells. Matu ration of local precursors can also contribute to this pool. In concert, they monitor the microenvironment and communicate with regional lymph nodes via the circulation and lymphatics. Organs such as the lung and intestine have a large specialized compartment of organ or mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), commensurate with their task of directly dealing with antigens from the external environment. By contrast, the liver is richly endowed with a lar ge macrophage population, consistent with its role as a filter of various opsonized material and ot her physiologic debris. Although not as extensive or well known, the kidney, [233] heart,[234,235] and pancreas also have considerable intraorgan immune networks. Complete revascularization of an allograft result s in the reestablishment of connections between the intraorgan immune network of the donor and the immune system of the recipient. Consequently, recipient immune cells circulate through donor organ-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT, BALT, portal lymphoid tissue)[1,236-239] and regional donor lymph nodes.[240] Conversely, donor immune cells migrate into recipient spleen and lymph nodes.[76,78,79] Early after transplantation, this results in an \"in vivo mix ed cell response,\" which typically manifests as AR.[236-240] Transplantation disrupts the effer ent lymphatics, which results in organ edema and contributes to the reimplantation response. In the absence of additional insults, the lymphatic channels reconnect within 2 to 3 weeks.[241,242] However, damage from AR again disrupts the lymphatic microvasculature and causes increased producti on of lymph fluid. These cause the graft to swell,[241,243-246] and cytokine and growth factor-rich fluid stagnates within the allograft and lymph nodes, predisposing to the development of fi brosis and exaggerated repair responses. Repeated rejection-related damage eventually result s in atrophy, fibrosis, and depletion of the lymphatic undoubtedly adequate processi ng of infectious and other environmental antigens from chronically rejecting allografts and contributes to their functional decline.[47,54,57,248-251] The Contribution of Nonimmune Injury to the Development of Chronic Rejection A variety of nonimmunologic factors, such as older donor age, long cold ischemic time, preservation injury, delayed graft function, recipient hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, can potentially contribute to the development of CR. Ho wever, these factors are generally considered to be of secondary importance. The prevalence of AS in elderly donors and the propensity of older organs to heal by fibrosis are likely expl ainations for the association between older donor age and CR. Factors such as hypertension, hyperlip idemia, and diabetes mellitus, all of which are side effects of immunosuppressive therapy, contri bute to the development of vascular disease, and therefore have the potential to accelerate OA. The stress of donor organ harvesting, Page 107including donor brain death,[252] long cold ischemia times with subsequent preservation injury, and delayed graft function can stress the allograft. All together these manipulations increase allograft immunogenicity by stimulating cytokine and chemokine production and activating dendritic cells,[253,254] resulting in magnification of the immune response and damage. Another important contributor to CR in kidney allografts is \"functional overload,\" or an insufficient number of glomeruli or renal mass to satisfy the metabolic demands of the recipient (eg, small or diseased donor into a large recipient). This leads to progressive glomerular injury in the remnant glomeruli characterized by glomerular hyperf iltration, hypertrophy, and subsequent systemic hypertension. Hyperfiltration-med iated renal damage in allografts appears to become a problem when creatinine clearance is less than 60 mL/min. [255] In addition, ischemia and rejection combine to decrease the number of nephrons leading to hypertension and glomerulosclerosis and contribute to the downward spiral of injury and inadequate functional capacity.[63] Manifestations of Chronic Rejection in the Heart Allograft OA is the major manifestation of CR in cardiac allografts. In some studies, OA has been seen more frequently in patients with AR [256,257] and in those who develop antidonor HLA antibodies.[257] Some investigators suggest that early-onset (< 2 years) OA has a stronger association with AR than late-onset (> 3 years) OA,[256] in which there are multip le contributing factors. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) also has the potentia l to contribute to OA in heart allografts[51,258-260] by augmenting vascular growth factor production, al tering the alloimmune response directly, or changing the expression of cytokines and cell adhesion molecules.[260] OA is also associated with direct arterial inflammation and/or necrotizing arteritis in tissue sections,[139,159,261] but the correlation between the development of OA and prio r AR episodes is not as clear-cut in heart allografts as it is in other va scularized allografts. One source of the problem is distinguishing OA from AS in heart allograft recipients, who have many risk factors for coronary artery disease. Since AS is endemic in the general adult population, it is frequently transmitted from the donor to the recipient.[66-68] This explains the higher incidence of vascular abnormalities seen early after transplantation with use of older donors. [67,135,262,263] Thus, both OA and AS contribute to the arterial disease seen in allografts after cardiac transplantation.[68,263-266] In an individual patient or lesion, however, it is often difficult to determine the relative contribution of OA or AS, since the 2 disease processes can show overlapping features . In addition, atheromas are frequently inflamed with donor hematolymphoid cells, providing a stro ng immunogenic stimulus at this site that could trigger vascular rejection. Conversely, McManus and colleagues [174,176,267] showed that OA lesions can imbibe lipids, suggesting that an \"atherogenic\" environment may accelerate OA. Despite the overlap between OA and AS, preexisting donor AS does not necessarily place the recipient at increased risk for the development of OA. [67,268] This suggests that at least some of the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for OA ar e different from those involved in AS.[135] The influence of OA on AS and vice versa may explain some of the more recent apparent inconsistencies in the distribution of OA noted by investigators using intravascular ultrasound. [269] Clearly, more detailed investigation into the association between OA and AS is needed. Coronary angiography is the standard method for surveillance of heart allograft vasculopathy (both OA and AS), although it underestimates the incidence and severity of disease.[50,136,265,270-272] Gao and associates[273] originally classified the angiographic abnormalities in heart allograft recipients into 3 categories: (1) type A, characteri zed by discrete or tubular stenoses; (2) type B, characterized by diffuse concentric narrowi ng; and (3) type C, characterized by narrowed irregular vessels with occluded branches. This cl assification has proved useful for distinguishing the relative contribution of OA and AS to arterial pathology in cardiac allografts.[135] Page 108Type A lesions of the primary epicardial coronary vessels with less frequent secondary branch involvement are the most common type of lesion(s) encountered in AS in the general population. Thus, Type A lesions can be detected in heart allo grafts shortly after transplantation, which is consistent with transmission of donor disease. However, evolution of type A lesions to include narrowing of secondary and tertiary branches deve lops more frequently in heart allografts than in native hearts. Type B and C lesions involving primary, secondary, and tertiary branches are much more common in allograft coronary arteries than in native hearts.[273] Total vessel occlusion is seen predominantly in the proximal or middle vess el segments of arteries with AS, whereas distal involvement can be seen in up to one half of patients with OA. Failure to develop collateral vessels is also more common in allograft recipients with OA. Based on the above angiographic observations, Gao and associates[273] concluded that coronary artery disease in heart transplant recipients represents a mixture of typical AS and unique transplant-related progressive distal OA that occurs without collateral vessel development. Several other investigators have drawn the same conclusion using the more recently developed intravascular ultrasound. [68,136,263-266,270] This technique offers some advantages over angiography in terms of sensitivity[136,262,270,272,274] and the ability to more precisely characterize changes in coronary vessel shape and wall thickness[275] and vascular remodeling.[136,270] This technique also enables one to follow the changes over time and study the reaction of the vessel wall to injury. Nevertheless, the conclusions are the same . Lesions frequently detected early after transplantation are segmental and eccentric intimal thickening and lumenal narrowing, primarily involving the epicardial coronary arteries and t heir primary branches, and reflect donor AS in the general population. Over time, more distal, diffuse, noncalcific and concentric intimal intracoronary acetylcholine and quantitative angiography can be used to study endothelial cell dysfunction, which is frequently det ected in allograft coronary arteries beginning early after transplantation.[277,278] A close association between endothelial dysfunction and intima abnormalities can be documented in some[277] but not all studies, presumably because of the episodic nature of the immune injury.[264] Another abnormality is impaired responsiveness of epicardial arteries to flow.[278] 2D echocardiography and dobutamine methods of monitoring heart allograft vasculopathy with reasonably comparable but less sensitive results when compared to angiography and IVUS. [270,279] Cardiac dysfunction associated with CR is largely due to ischemic damage to the heart, which can manifest as ventricular dysrhythmias, conges tive heart failure or myocardial classic symptoms of myocardial ischemia, such as angina pectoris, are thought not to be reliable indicators in the denervated allograft heart,[281] symptoms of myocardial infarction in 25 heart transplant recipients[280] included chest pain pain (n=3), weakness (n=16), dyspnea (n=11) and palpitations (n=8). Three episodes were clinically silent, detected only as new electrocardiographic changes during routine follow-up, and 2 patients had old Q-waves. Of the 8 patients hospitalized with symptoms, only 7 had typical Q- wave changes on electrocardiography; 5 had no nspecific ST-segment changes and 2 had no documented changes. Serial creatine phosphokinase levels were obtained in 13 patients, and values were elevated in 8. Other manifestations of CR and myocardial ischemia include cardiac enlargement with ventricular dilatation, pericarditis.[282] Endomyocardial biopsy is not a reliable method of establishing the diagnosis of chronic cardiac allograft rejection, because the biopsies do not sh ow characteristic changes that can be reliably associated with CR alone,[135,141,283-288] except in rare cases.[289] Intimal thickening typical of OA usually does not affect the small penetrating intr acardiac arterioles present in endomyocardial biopsies.[186] In contrast to kidney allografts,[214] collagen density in biopsy specimens does not Page 109appear to predictably increase with time in patients who develop CR.[290] This is because fibrosis can develop from repeated biopsy sampling of the ri ght ventricle, even in the absence of CR. There is, however, some evidence that nodular s ubendocardial lymphocytic aggregates, or Quilty lesions,[283] may be associated with CR. Quilty lesi ons are present in 4%-25% of human endomyocardial allograft biopsies and are detecte d on at least 1 occasion in 58%-78% of patients.[286,287,291,292] Although Quilty lesions are not the equivalent of therapy-requiring AR, some clinical studies show an associati on with AR in the underlying myocardium[287,293-296] or with OA.[288] Patients in the Stanford series with Quilty le sions who underwent transpl antation in the early 1980s had the highest incidence of graft vasculopathy,[297] but more recently the incidence of OA has significantly decreased in these patients.[297] This perplexing observation might be explained by the fact that these patient s had the most potential for impr ovement, particularly with the addition of new immunosuppressive regimens. For example, tacrolimus has significantly lessened the incidence of Quilty lesions in our heart transplant recipients[298] and significantly increased the half-life of kidney allografts, [299] presumably by lessening CR. Even though a causal association of Quilty lesions with OA is unlikely, Quilty lesions might not be innocuous histopathologic curiosities. Their organized lymphoid structure[3,135] and presence in animal models with persistent alloactivation and developing OA[3] suggest that they may represent indolent ongoing immunologic damage via indirect allorecognition. Kemnitz and associates[295] speculated that Quilty lesions may even represent a form of vascular rejection, since the heart develops embryologically from primitive vessels. As in native hearts with AS, coronary artery bypass grafting,[300] angioplasty,[301] laser revascularization and/or stenting[302] have been used in an attempt to restore distal arterial flow in heart allografts affected either with OA or AS, or both. The lesions most amenable to treatment with these procedures are those preferentially invo lving the proximal portions of the artery with a segmental distribution and sparing of the distal po rtions. Procedural success rates are similar to those in native hearts with similar lesions. Manifestations of Chronic Rejection in the Lung Allograft The term \"bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome\" (BOS) is used to connote lung allograft deterioration secondary to progressive airway disease for which there is no other cause.[303] It is widely presumed, but unproved, that this is the princi pal manifestation of CR in lung allografts.[303] BOS appears to equally affect all lung transplant recipi ents, including single, bilateral, and heart-lung transplantation patients.[304,305] Although specific symptoms are lacking, patients typically experience worsening respiratory debilitation. The characteristic phy siologic hallmark of BOS is airflo w limitation, as evidenced by progressive decline in the forced expiratory volu me in 1 second, to values less than 80% of posttransplantation baseline. [303,306,307] The baseline value is defined as the average of the 2 previous highest consecutive m easurements being obtained 3 to 6 weeks apart. In some patients, the baseline value will rise over time, especially in the first 6 to 9 months.[303] The highest baseline value achieved is used for all subsequent measurements. The term obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is the pr incipal histopathologic manifestation of CR in lung allografts, which refers to the findings of inflammation and fibrosis occurring predominantly in the walls and contiguous tissues of membranous and respiratory bronchioles, with resultant narrowing of their lumens. [308]It is generally assumed that OB and BOS are synonymous. However, BOS does not necessarily require histologic confirmation[303];the clinical and functional aspects of this syndrome are not always consiste nt with the typical pathology, often because of sampling problems related to small transbronchial biopsies. Therefore, a staging and Page 110classification system was devised that allows fo r diagnosis of BOS even in the absence of biopsy confirmation of OB.[303] Compared to CR in other vascularized allografts, CR is a particularly pervasive problem in lung transplantation, developing in about 15% of survivors per year,[305] and is the most significant obstacle to long-term, morbidity-free survival.[307] Once discovered, BOS tends to progress over time.[307] Risk factors for the development of OBand CR include severe AR, [226] late-onset pneumonia.[226]In one study, p-glycoprotein and metallothionein expression by inflammatory cells was suggested as a marker of aggressive or persistent cases of AR leading to OB.[309] Donor and recipient characteristics such as sex, age, underlying disease, type of transplant, and graft ischemic time does not appear to affect BOS onset, progression, or prognosis.[226] Once developed, the prognosis of BOS is degraded in the face of superimposed AR and lung infection.[226] Although serial pulmonary function tests are the standard method used to screen lung allograft recipients for the development of BOS, repeated high-resolution computed tomographic examination is another relatively sensitive and specific, noninvasive method of monitoring the development of OB and BOS. [308,310] Chest radiographs usually show nonspecific parenchymal abnormalities consisting of nodular, nodular, co nfluent nodular, or diffuse alveolar opacities, which are also present in other infectious and noninfectious complications. The presence of central bronchiectasis may also be a distinctive radiographic finding in this group of patients. [311] The use of transbronchial biopsies is encour aged to establish the diagnosis of OB and CR in support of a clinical diagnosis of BOS. In one study, 38% of transbronchial biopsies from BOS patients were diagnostic of OB; another 29% showed chronic inflammation and fibrosis, suspicious for CR.[115] Inadequate sampling by the bronchosco pist was the major reason for a negative biopsy.[115] In another study, the sensitivity and sp ecificity of one transbronchial biopsy procedure with an average procurement of 7.6 tissue fragments was 17.1% and 94.5%, respectively. [312] The predictive value of a positive proc edure for the presence of disease was 65.5% and that of a negative procedure fo r the absence of disease was 65.2%.[312] Although false- positive diagnoses of OB on transbronchial biop sies are uncommon, OB can be associated with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumoniasyndrome[313] accompanying viral pneumonitis, and chronic inflammation and fibrosis with AR and infection.[115] Thus, although the sensitivity of transbronchial biopsy and the predictive value ar e low, attempts should be made to support a clinical diagnosis of BOS through biopsy.[312] Usual treatment for BOS has been to increase the maintenance immuno suppression regimen or augment immunosuppression by adding other agents or by switching to entirely new ones.[304] Most of these strategies have been effective in ac hieving some reduction in the rate of decline in graft function, although true cure of BOS has been rare. Retransplantation is the most aggressive therapeutic strategy for OB, but for a number of l ogistic reasons, such as significant adhesions between the allograft and parietal pleura, it is applic able only to a tiny minority of lung transplant recipients with OB.[304] Manifestations of Chronic Rejection in the Kidney Allograft Chronic rejection in kidney allografts is characterized by an indolent and variable loss of function, which mostly occurs in combinati on with proteinuria and hypertension. [111] Since many of the pathophysiologic and immunologic features of CR were first recognized in kidney allografts,[5,185,314,315] the study of CR is probably most comprehensive in this organ. In kidney allografts, CR is also known as chronic allogr aft nephropathy (CAN), a term which acknowledges the important contribution of nonimmunologic factor s such as hypertension, hyperfiltration injury and other insults, to the progressive decline of renal structure and func tion that plagues many Page 111long-surviving kidney allografts with CR. Paul[111] has recently written a comprehensive and authoritative review of CAN.[111] As in other organs, risk factors for CAN ar e divided into immunologic and nonimmunologic, although the latter assumes a greater importance in kidney allografts because they are frequent causes of disease in native kidneys. I mmunologic factors are repeated AR episodes,[25,45,316,317] vascular rejection episodes,[45,316] rejections that occur late after transplantation,[45] MHC mismatching,[25,317] donor and recipient gender differences,[65] and recipient race.[12] Nonimmunologic factors that augment the immunologic injury or contribute to the architectural or vascular pathology of CR include advanced donor age,[25,316,317] delayed graft function,[316] donor source (living-related and living-unrelated cold the gene-deleted allele has been associated, when in homozygosity, with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and with an accelerated progression of organ damage in a variety of kidney diseases. The DD genotype is associated in pediatric kidney graft re cipients with a shorter long-term kidney graft survival and suggests a possible role of this genotype as a cofactor in the progression of nonimmunologic injuries leading to chronic kidney allograft failure.[321] The histopathology of CR in the kidn ey is not thought to be specific,[322] because similar histopathologic changes can be seen in other di sorders such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. However, transplant glomerulopathy and multilayering of the peritubular capillaries are highly charac teristic features of CAN. [111] Even though the histopathologic findings are not specific, biopsy findings can provide important information for patient management. Besides establishing the cause of dysfunction, early protocol biopsies contribute important prognostic information.[323] For example, poorer long-term function can be predicted using 6-month protocol biopsy specimens immunostained for collagen III: increased percent areas occupied by type III collagen correlates with decreased GFR. [214] In addition, early-protocol biopsies of stable, well-functioning kidney allografts reveal a high prevalence of clinically unsuspected acute and chronic pathology, including rejection,[324] which is predictive of long-term allograft outcome.[325,326] Larger glomeruli at baseline, measured by a simple point-counting technique, are an early predictor of risk for late allograft dysfunction an d may help to identify a subpopulation of patients in whom treatment to prevent or ameliorate glomerular enlargement and/or hypertension may be efficacious.[318] Currently, the most effective option to prevent chr onic allograft nephropathy is to avoid graft injury from both immune and nonimmune mechanisms.[111] Once the functional decline is linked to irreversible structural damage, such as fibrosis and/or glomerulosclerosis, little can be done to reverse the trend. Manifestations of Chronic Reject ion in the Small Bowel Allograft Transplantation of the immunologically difficult small bowel has only recently been clinically achieved to any significant extent,[327-329] largely because of ineffective control of AR, which was made routinely possible by the use of tacrolimus immunosuppression.[330] Thus, study of CR changes in small bowel allografts has heavily relied on experimental animal models.[1,239,331-333] However, a recent study of CR in small bowel allo grafts at the University of Pittsburgh showed that CR was associated with an incr eased number and severity of AR episodes, as seen in other types of allografts. The composit e effect is also seen when the small bowel is simultaneously transplanted with the liver, in which case t he incidence of CR decreases substantially. Typical clinical findings that support the di agnosis of CR include persistent diarrhea with nonhealing ulcers, repeated bouts of AR, and eit her noncompliance with immunosuppressive medications or deliberate withdrawal of immunosuppression because of life-threatening infection.[38] Endoscopic and radiographic studies used to support the diagnosis of CR include Page 112focal loss of mucosal folds, focal ulcers and mural thickening, and pruning of the mesenteric arterial arcades.[334] Histopathologic features and of donor mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. [1,38,239,331-333,335,336] As with other types of allografts, the biopsy diagn osis of CR in small-bowel allograft recipients is difficult. The vessels affected by OA, primarily the distal branches of the mesenteric arteries and the larger arteries of the serosa and muscularis propria, are not routinely sampled. Therefore, one is forced to rely on surrogate findings, including focal, nonhealing ulcers; a distinctive combination of loss of crypts, and epithelial regeneration and crypt epithelial apoptosis; mucosal and villous architecture with fibrosis. [38] Manifestations of Chronic Rejection in the Pancreas Allograft Pancreas transplantation is used to treat type I diabetes mellitus, but the operation is largely restricted to diabetic patients who also suffer from renal failure and who are in need of simultaneous kidney transplantation. [337-340] This is because of an unfavorable risk:benefit ratio associated with isolated pancrea s transplantation and long-term immunosuppression vs the ability to control blood glucose with exogenous insulin therapy.[337,338] Potential benefits to the patient increase substantially for those in need of both kidney and pancreas transplantation.[340] The most obvious advantage is an improved quality of life, but there is emerging evidence of a slow beneficial effect on diabetic complications, which reduces long-term morbidity and mortality compared with kidney transplantation alone in diabetics.[337,338,340] Currently, insulin independence rates for combined kidney-pancreas transplantation is 60 % at 5 years; and late graft failures are largely attributable to CR.[337-339] As in other organs, CR in pancreas allografts often begins during AR. The simultaneous kidney allograft from the same donor is thought to prov ide a reliable surrogate marker of immune activity in the pancreas.[341] Therefore, acute pancreas allograft rejection is often indirectly monitored via kidney allograft function and kidney allograft bi opsies. Other parameters us ed for the diagnosis of pancreas allograft rejection include: decrease in urinary insulin and serum anodal as specific protein. Cytologic evaluation of pancreatic juice and urine have also been used in the diagnosis of pancreas allograft rejection. In bladder-drained pancreas allografts, urinary amylase has been used as a measure of pancreas exocrine function. [341] Lastly, blood glucose monitoring is only a crude indicator of pancreatic function, and because rejection does not primarily target the islets, elevated blood glucose is a late finding. Therefore, loss of insulin function is a late finding and not generally useful for early recognition of injury. In our experience, pancreas allografts are the least well monitored of all solid organ allografts. Consequently, subclinical rejection-related pancr eatic allograft injury is not uncommon and, therefore, CR is a significant problem. Recently, however, direct biopsy monitoring of the pancreas allograft has received greater acceptance and can be used to diagnose AR, CR, recurrent type I diabetes mellitus, and a host of ot her pancreatic complications that occur after pancreas transplantation. [143,342-345] As in other organs, chronic pancreas allograft rejection primarily manifests as mild patchy inflammation, progressive fibrosis and loss of acinar parenchyma, obliterative arteriopathy, and focal ductal destruction. [143,342-345] Further research is needed to determine the rate and impact of recurrent autoimmune diabetes on islet destruction. Fortunately, islet injury is a late finding in chr onic pancreas allograft rejection and occurs mostly as a result of dense fibrosis of the surroundi ng tissue and islet atrophy, rather than direct immunologic injury to the islets. Isolated inflammation of islets, or so-called isletitis, is rarely, if ever, seen independently of pancreas allograft rejecti on. When present, isletitis is usually seen in association with inflammation of the surrounding ac inar structures typical of higher grades of Page 113AR.[342] In other studies, isletitis oc curs in up of grafts,[344] and 36% of grafts with isletitis also had selective loss of beta cells from the islets, indicative of recurrent type I diabetes mellitus.[344] Loss of islet function can also occur as a reversible side effect of both tacrolimus and cyclosporine and with recurrent diabetes mellitus.[346] Reversible drug-induced structural damage includes cytoplasmic swelling, vacuolization, apoptosis, abnormal immunostaining for insulin, and marked decrease or absence of dense-core secretory granules in beta cells, which can result in dysfunction of beta cells .[346] A ratio of insulin:glucagon cells of less than 1.0 appears to be specific for recurrent diabetes. In the absence of isletitis, this is a reasonable method for detecting recurrent disease at an early stage.[347] The obvious treatment for e nd-stage CR of the pancreas is a return to exogenous insulin therapy. The Special Case of Liver Allografts Chronic liver allograft rejection is uncommon. Over the past 2 decades, the incidence at 5 years after transplantation has steadily declined from about 15%-20% to current projections of 3%- 5%. [135,348] This decline has been attributed to the unique immunologic properties of the liver allograft, better recognition and control of acute and the early phases of CR, and the remarkable regenerative capab ilities of the liver.[27,119,330,349-356] Nevertheless, CR is still an important cause of late liver allograft dysfunction and failure,[348,357-361] and from a practical perspective, proper recognition of CR is essential for long-term patient management because clinicians frequently lower or discontinue immunosuppression in long-term survivors.[362-365] Chronic liver allograft rejection usually begins within several months after transplantation and allograft failure typically occurs within the first year after transplantation. [40,41,46,119,348,366-368] In contrast to other vascularized allografts, the inci dence of CR in the liver usually decreases with time after transplantation,[40,46,367] except for in a small group of patients with late-onset CR.[46] As in all other organs, \"immunologic\" factors are the most important contributors to the development of CR in the liver allograft. Among th ese, the number and severity of AR episodes are the most significant,[41,46] regardless of the immunosuppres sive regimen. In cyclosporine- treated cohorts, late-onset AR episodes,[37,119,369,370] younger recipient age,[119,356] male-to-female sex mismatch, a primary diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis or biliary disease,[356] baseline immunosuppression,[37,353,354] and non-caucasian recipient race[49,119] have all been associated with an increased risk of developing CR. The association between liver allograft surv ival and MHC/HLA matching is controversial.[26,371-373] Some studies show that mismatching at the MHC class II locus increases the incidence of AR[26,372,374] and allograft failure from AR.[26] Other studies show no effect of DR mismatching on graft survival,[371,373] while still another study showed a beneficial effect of class II mismatching on nonrejection-related causes of graft failure.[372] It has been hypothesized that MHC matching appears to play a dualistic role in liver transplant ation: mismatching increases the incidence of AR, but MHC matching might contribute to a greater susceptibility to recurrent inflammatory liver disease.[372,373] The effect of CMV infection on CR is also controversial.[37,54,119,367,374,375] In a large tacrolimus-treated cohort, many of the matching factors described above were not significant risk factors for CR, but the influence of the num ber and severity of AR episodes remained.[376] A nonalloantigen-dependent or nonimmunologic risk fact or that contributes to the development of CR in the liver is donor age > 40 years,[376] which is also a well-described risk factor in kidney and heart allografts.[132,377,378] Older donor organs have also been found to have a higher incidence of AR.[374]A clinical diagnosis of CR should be suspected in a patient with a history of AR who develops progressive cholestasis and an increase in canalicular enzymes that is unresponsive to antirejection treatment.[379] This usually occurs as the end-stage of unresolved AR or after multiple Page 114episodes of AR, particularly within the first year after transplantation.[41,46,117,119,121,228-231,352,366,379-382] CR can also appear indolently without preceding clinically recognized episodes of AR,[41,46,117,119,121,228-231,352,366,379-382] but this presentation is relatively uncommon and may simply reflect inadequate monitoring.[348] In fact, late-onset CR (more t han 1 year after transplantation) is typically seen in inadequately immunosuppressed patient s, either as a result of noncompliance or because of infectious or neoplastic toxicity of overimmunosuppression .[46] Unresolved or indolent rejection may become apparent only as a persistent elevation of liver injury tests. If clinical symptoms are present, t hey usually resemble those of AR until allograft dysfunction becomes severe enough to cause jaundice or appearance of and finally loss of he patic synthetic function, which can manifest as coagulopathy and malnutrition, are other late findings presaging allograft failure.[379] Standard liver injury test abnormalities in a pat ient with CR in general show a progressive cholestatic pattern that manifests as preferentia l elevation of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase.[359,379,383] The early transition from AR to CR may be marked by persistent elevation of aspartate aminotransferase,[380] which, along with total b ilirubin, is associated with graft failure from CR.[41,46,384] A similar pattern of liver injury test elevations and histopathologic changes can be seen with obstructive cholangiopathy and arterial narrowing or thrombosis.[359] Cholangiography and/or angiography may be required in some cases to distinguish between CR and biliary obstruction.[384] Selective hepatic angiography showing pruning of the intrahepatic arteries with poor peripheral filling and segmental narrowing can also be used to support the diagnosis of CR. [40,146,379,385] The final diagnosis of CR should be based on a combination of the clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and histopathologic findings.[348] In a biopsy specimen, the minimal diagnostic criteria for CR are: (1) the presence of bile duct atrophy or pyknosis, affecting a majority of the bile ducts, with or without bile duct loss; (2) convincing foam cell OA; or (3) bile duct loss affecting greater than 50% of the portal tracts.[348,383] Cases with either isolated bile duct loss or foam cell arteriopathy alone may occur, but usually both features are found together.[117,120,121,380] Unfortunately, arteries with pathognomonic changes are rarely present in needl e biopsy specimens, and therefore, what has been observed about OA in the liver has come from examination of failed allografts removed at the time of retransplantation. Therefore, in biop sy specimens, considerable significance is placed on damage and loss of small bile ducts. However, a similar pattern of duct injury and ductopenia can be seen as a result of nonrejection-rela ted complications, such as obstructive cholangiopathy, hepatic artery stricturing or thrombosis, adverse drug reactions, and CMV infection. [383,384] In cases of CR identified by bile duct injury or loss alone, other nonrejection- related causes of ductal injury and loss (which histopathologically appear similar to CR), such as adverse drug reaction, hepatic ar tery or biliary tr act obstruction or stricturing, should be reasonably excluded. Since the early state of CR in the liver is reve rsible, much emphasis has been placed on precisely defining its histopathologic features.[348] Within the portal tracts, CR manifests as damage and loss of small bile ducts and small branches of the hepatic artery. Bile duct damage is due to a combination of direct immunologic injury and indirect ischemic damage resulting from OA, small artery and arteriolar loss and destructio n of the peribiliary capillary plexus. [117,386] Early histopathologic changes in the bile ducts that presage their disappearance include eosinophilic transformation of the biliary epit helial cytoplasm, hyperchromasia resemb ling cytologic dysplasia, and ducts biliary epithelial cells.[349,352,384,387] Late bile duct and arterial damage is gauged by the extent of loss of thes e structures, which is based on quantitative morphometry. Inflammation during CR in liver allografts is usually mild and consists of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. [96,181,388] Despite a paucity of portal inflammation, intraepithelial lymphocytes are located adjacent to degenerating biliary epithelial cells,[40,48,117,119,121,228-232] which Page 115show uneven spacing of individual epithelial cell s, eosinophilic transforma tion of the cytoplasm, and ducts only partially lined by bile duct cells.[135] The portal infiltrate is T-cell predominant in CR and contains both CD4 and CD8 subsets,[96,181,388] with the latter predominating in epithelium.[388] Increased gamma-IFN, IL-2, and granzyme B transcripts[96] have also been detected, the last of which strongly suggests that a cytolytic effector pathway of injury is involved. The damaged ducts can also show inappropri ate expression of the major ABO blood group antigens.[389] In a normal liver, Crawford and colleagues[390] defined a portal tract as \"a focus within the parenchyma containing connective tissue (by Mass on's trichrome stain) and at least 2 lumenal structures embedded in the connective tissue mesenchyme, each with a continuous connective tissue circumference.\" Using this definition, 93 +/- 6% and 91 +/- 7 % of portal tracts in needle biopsies contain bile ducts and hepat ic artery branches, respectively.[380,390] Bile duct loss is considered present when < 80% of the portal tracts contain bile ducts; arterial loss is considered present when < 77 % of the portal trac ts contain hepatic artery branches.[348] Since CR can result in loss of both t he bile duct and hepatic artery branches,[117,380] strictly applying the above definition, which requires 2 of 3 normal portal profiles (bile duct, hepatic artery and portal vein), will not be possible in some CR cases. [348] When both bile duct and arterial loss are seen, recognition and counting of the porta l tracts ultimately depends on the subjective interpretation of the pathologist.[348] Recognition of portal tracts in such cases should be based primarily on the location (cholestasis in CR is cent rilobular), shape, and inte rnal structure of the connective tissue mesenchyme. If both bile ducts and arteries are destroyed, determination of bile duct and arterial loss should be based on a count of the total number of portal tracts with and without bile ducts and arteries, and a comparis on with expected values from normal livers.[348] As in other organs, OA is a manifestation of CR in liver allografts, but it is rarely seen in needle biopsies because medium-sized perihilar muscular arteries are most commonly and severely affected, and these arteries are not routinely sampled in a peripheral needle core biopsy. Instead, examination of failed allograft hepatectomy specimens obtained at various times after transplantation have shown that ear ly CR is marked by the accumulation of subintimal, medial, and adventitial foamy macrophages, AR-related arteritis. The foamy macrophages accumulate over time and can be accompanied by the proliferation of donor-derived subintimal myofibroblasts, similar to OA in other solid organ allografts. The early phase of CR in the terminal hepatic venules and surrounding perivenular parenchyma is characterized hepatoc ytes, or so-called transitional hepatitis, may occur during evolution to the late stages of CR.[380,391] At this stage, it may be difficult to distinguish between hepatitis and rejection. Late CR is characterized by severe (bridging) perivenular fibrosis with at least focal cent ral-to-central or central-to-portal bridging and occasional obliteration of terminal hepatic venules.[356,376,380,382] Other common findings in late CR include perivenular ballooning and dropout, foam cell clusters.Bile duct loss in more than 50% of the portal tracts, severe (bridging) perivenular fibrosis, and small arterial loss have all been associated with a greater incidence of eventual graft failure from CR.[119,352,356,376] However, it is important to remember that bile duct loss is potentially reversib le. This was first recognized when patients with clinical and histopathologic features of established CR markedly improved, either with or without augmented immunosuppression.[119,349,352,356,384,387] In several of these cases, serial biopsies chronicled an apparent regrowth of b ile ducts even when initial bile duct loss exceeded 50%, and serum bilirubin levels were greater than 10 mg/dL.[119,349,352,356,384,387] Sampling errors and/or functional adaptation to ductopenia could t heoretically account for these observations, but the more likely explanation is that the liver under goes architecturally intact repair. The important Page 116practical implication is that the biopsy findings do not absolutely define a point of no return; they provide information and the likelihood of reversal, which should be combined with a complete clinicopathologic evaluation prior to the decision to continue medical therapy or proceed with retransplantation.[348]The quantitative analysis of both bile duct and arterial loss raises issues of sampling problems.[348] It has been suggested that examination of a minimum of 20 portal tracts is needed to ascertain the diagnosis of CR in liver allografts,[351,367] but recent studies showed the median number of portal tracts in a standard liver allograft biopsy was 9 - 11[356,380,383] and CR could be correctly and reliably rendered on these samples. Smaller biopsies with fewer than 10 portal tracts should be interpreted with greater caution.[348] The most significant potential error is a false-positive diagnosis of CR or categorization of a case in the advanced stages when there is still potential for recovery. Potent ial sampling errors can be mini mized by obtaining 1 large or multiple biopsies. The more portal tracts samp led, the more likely the specimen is to be representative of the entire organ. A point that cannot be overemphasized is establishing a close correlation between the biopsy findings and the clinical profile.[348]An unresolved question is whether there is a form of late-onset CR that resembles chronic viral or autoimmune hepatitis (without evidence of infection with known hepatitis viruses or the presence of autoantibodies) that leads to cirrhosis.[348] This concern was initially ra ised by Kemnitz and colleagues.[392,393] Recent recognition of this syndrome at several large c enters has brought the issue to the forefront for discussion.Hubscher,[394] who coined the term idiopathic post -transplant hepatitis (IPTH), showed that more than 40% of 12-mont h protocol liver biopsies from recipients at Birmingham, United Kingdom, showed an unexplained chronic hepatitis. By definition, the histopathologic changes of typical AR or CR were not present. The patients with IPTH were more likely to have autoimmune disorders (autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis) or seronegative fulminant hepatic failure than they were to have their original diseases. Fortunately, only a small proportion of cases progressed to cirr hosis, but the long-term outlook for the others is uncertain. [394] Whether IPTH represents a form of recurrent autoimmune disease, infection by an unknown virus, an adverse drug reaction, an unre cognized form of rejection, or a combination of 1 or more of these factors, is uncertain.[348] Further study is needed in this area.There are 2 fascinating aspects of chro nic liver allograft rejection: its reversibility,[119,352] which has already been discussed; and an appreciably lower incidence compared with other types of allografts (Table 1,[30]). Experimental animal studies have also show n that a liver allograft is spontaneously accepted without immunosuppression in some small animal species[395,396] and is the best composite organ in that it can completely prot ect other organs from the same donor from CR.[3] Resistance of liver allografts to AR and CR and the ability to induce tolerance are well known. Hypotheses used to explain this observation can be broadly separated into 2 general categories, based on whether emphasis is placed on the parenchyma or nonparenchymal cells in the liver. [135,397] One argument in favor of parenchymal cells is the release of soluble donor MHC class I antigen from hepatocytes.[398] This hypothesis, however, is not tenable because recent studies show that murine liver allografts are routinely accepted between strains of mice that show no difference between the class I loci, but are mismatched for class II loci.[399] In addition, fully allogeneic liver allografts from class I or II MHC-deficient mice, which do not shed soluble MHC antigens, [399,400] are also accepted. Additional evidence refuting this hypothesis is that other organs also secrete soluble MHC antigens,[401] but they are routinely rejected and infusion of exogenous soluble MHC usually leads to only slight prolongation of allograft survival. Another potential explanation for the importance of the parenchyma relies on the concept that allogeneic hepatocytes provide only 1 0f 2 signals needed for allogeneic lymphocyte activation. [402] Lack of important costimulatory molecules is thought to result in the induction of anergy in the responding lymphocyte populations.[402] However, when transgenic mice that aberrantly express the allogeneic MHC class I molecule H-2Kb (Kb) in the liver (using a metallothionein promoter[403]), are crossed with a strain that develops CD8+ T cells specific for the Kb molecule, lymphocyte- mediated autoimmune liver damage can be induced under certain conditions. Interestingly, most of the CD8+ cells responsive to Kb were elimi nated by the intense intrahepatic activation, but some of the liver continued to show chronic low-grade inflammation. [403] However, great care had Page 117to be taken to assure that alloantigen expression was limited to the liver.[403] Interpretation of these complicated experiments is difficult, but it appears that the liver may be able to effect an activation-induced partial clonal deletion of allogeneic lymphocytes,[403] as originally proposed by Kamada.[396] Deletion of activated cytolytic T cell s may be a special property of the liver,[403-405] because alloantigen expression on other nonhematolym phoid cells such as pancreatic islets does not lead to anergy,[406] but to immunologic ignorance,[407] which is an important difference. It has been our contention that so called \"hepatic to lerogenecity\" is, in large part, a result of hematolymphoid cells within the liver and subsequent microchimerism.[27,74,408] The donor hematolymphoid cells are thought to provide 2 impor tant functions. First, they stimulate intense via engraftment and/or survival of donor hematopoietic stem cells contained within the liver.[409-411] The possibility of activation- induced death of donor-reactive lymphocytes has been recognized for quite some time.[72,412] Recent studies show that it occurs both within the allograft and in recipient lymphoid tissues.[413-422] Irradiation of the donor liver[416] or a short course of methylprednisolone breaks spont aneous acceptance of the liver allograft and reduces survival of subsequent donor strain skin grafts.[416] Similar observations have been made in the miniature swine model, in which corticosteroid therapy was able to block tolerance induction (see section on Nonchimeric Tolerance). Unfortunately, in humans, activation-induced apo ptosis or deletion is apparently not able to induce tolerance in the majority of liver allogra ft or other solid organ allograft recipients. Even if partial clonal deletion and graft adaptation enabl e reduced immunosuppression during the first several months after transplantation, the recipi ent immune system still recognizes the allograft as foreign in most long-term survivors; consequently, the majority still require life-long immunosuppression to prevent CR.[362] The second function of the donor hematolymphoid ce lls is to sustain the presence of multilineage donor hematolymphoid cells. Several groups have sh own that the continued presence of donor hematolymphoid cells in the recipient[27,408,423-428] is associated with improved long-term allograft survival, although the existence of a cause- and-effect relationship is controversial.[429-433] Treatment and Prevention of Chronic Rejection Treatment of established or \"end-stage\" CR is generally considered to be futile, because the major structural manifestations are irreversible . Therefore, attempts are made to prevent the disease entirely, or to identify patients in the early stages of CR before irreversible damage has occurred. Since CR evolves directly from damage during AR in many cases, the first point of interdiction is controlling the severity and duratio n of AR episodes. This is usually accomplished by adjusting baseline immunosuppression and augm entation with additional corticosteroids and monoclonal antibodies, if needed. The next point of potential therapeutic intervention is at the early stages of CR, when ongoing immunologic da mage to the allograft is obvious, but before irreversible damage has occurred. This strategy is most effective in liver allografts because of their marked regenerative capacity. The most popular approach at this time is a switch in baseline immunosuppression, or the addition of another no nsteroidal immunosuppressive drug (Table 3). Once irreversible damage has occurred, contin ued attempts at treatment with increased immunosuppression may have deleterious consequenc es, but attempts to restore arterial blood flow past localized arterial narrowing have been made in the heart allograft with OA (see section on Manifestations of Chronic Rejection in the Heart Allograft).

Selectivity in Page 120proteinuric kidney allograft recipients Prevention of CR is being attempted with the induction of tolerance or by pharmacologic intervention that either lessens the immunologic damage or limits the repair response. Currently, experimental tolerance-inducing clinical tr ials are being attempted at several sites,[434-437] but for the vast majority of nonhepatic vascularized allograft recipients, attempts to prevent CR are limited to controlling AR and the early stages of CR by baseline immunosuppression and drugs that limit repair responses. Limiting Graft Damage From Acute Rejection As discussed above, implantation of any solid organ allograft results in a characteristic cycle of heightened immune activation, brought about by t he initial engagement of the donor and recipient lymphoid systems[27,72-74] and followed by evolution toward a less violent interface. This appears to coincide with a transition from the direct to indi rect pathway of alloantigen presentation. In most allograft recipients this occurs within 6-12 mont hs after transplantation and consequently, at this time, clinicians can begin to slowly lower the immunosuppression on a trial-and-error basis with close monitoring of organ function. Usually, an attempt is made to lower and then discontinue corticosteroid therapy, followed by further redu ction in baseline immunosuppressive agent(s). By 5 years or more after transplantation, immunosu ppression can be completely withdrawn in about 15%-20% of liver allograft recipients. [438,439] Unfortunately, in other types of allograft recipients, immunosuppression cannot be lowered and AR evolves directly into CR. It is uncertain why some allograft recipients evolve toward CR while others maintain a more stable relationship with the allograft. Many clinical studies show that a reduction in the incidence and severity of AR is associated with a lower frequency of CR.[31,45,64,307,324,338,339,369,440-445] This is usually achieved when a more potent baseline immunosuppressive drug such as tacrolimusis used, when 2 or more drugs are used for baseline immunosuppression, and/or when inducti on therapy with antilymphocytic monoclonal antibodies is used. [450] Tacrolimus has been one of the most effective drugs in achieving this goal in all organs.[31,329,330,354,444-449] The effectiveness of limiting the number and severity of AR episodes supports the contention that prevention of tiss ue injury during AR limits the subsequent repair responses that lead to CR.[111] Interestingly, the clinical approach to redu cing CR (eg, reducing AR by more powerful immunosuppressive agents and closer monitoring),[325,451] is conceptually at odds with recent studies showing that activation-induced clonal deletion via apoptosis may be required for tolerance induction.[418-420] The activation-induced clonal deletion or stripping could be thought of as a donor-specific biologic equivalent of the nons pecific T cell-depleting antibodies used in many tolerance-inducing protocols (see section on Induction of Allograft Tolerance). It has even been suggested that the mainstay immunosuppressive agents, cyclosporine and tacrolimus, both of which are calcineurin inhibitors, actually prevent tolerance induction by blocking this process. [418- 420] Regardless, the incongruity of current clinical and experimental approaches used to lessen the impact of CR on long-term survival needs to be aired and addressed. Pharmacologic Treatment of the Early Stages of CR Refractory or severe AR has become less co mmon in some allografts (ie, liver and heart allografts) because of a larger arsenal of more effective immunosuppressive agents, but it still occurs, and when it does, many of these patients are at high risk for the development of CR. The transition from severe and/or persistent AR to CR is marked by development of structural and/or functional decline that presages irreversible damage, which has been referred to as early CR. Page 121The most popular therapeutic approach in patient s with early CR is to increase or change baseline immunosuppression.[339,441,452-458] The goal is to limit or stop the ongoing immunologic injury and allow the graft to recover before completely irreversible damage has occurred. An additional advantage can be realized if the new immunosuppressive drug does not contribute to the development of allograft fibrosis.[459,460] Generally, patients with early CR are converted from cyclosporine to tacrolimus, or baseline immunosuppression (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) is lowered and another agent, such as mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine, is added. [339,441,452-458] In general, most but not all[461] treatment studies of early CR ca rried out in kidney, lung, heart, and pancreas allograft recipients show that the rate of functional and structural decline can be slowed, but significant functional and structural improvement is uncommon.[339,441,453-458] Liver allografts, however, are the exception; the structural and functional deterioration associated with CR can be completely reversed with a change in immunosuppression.[46,452,462,463] And occasionally, structural improvement has been reported to spontaneously occur.[41,119,352] The ability to reverse CR in liver allografts has been attributed to its unique immu nologic properties and to its almost limitless regenerative capacity, which enables the organ to more easily recover from injury without fibrosis. [41,46] Induction of Allograft Tolerance Achieving tolerance to the allograft without t he need for continuous immunosuppression is the \"holy grail\" of transplantation immunobiology and medicine. It eliminates the threat of both CR and toxicity from long-term immunosuppression. This goal has already been practically realized for a small percentage of fortunate liver allograft recipients,[27,408] some of whom have been completely withdrawn from immunosuppressi on for years without adverse consequences.[27,408,439] Unfortunately, this ideal outcome does not occur in the majority of liver allograft recipients. Immunosuppression can rarely be completely withdrawn from nonhepatic allograft recipients, although it can be significantly lowered,[438,439,464-466] but with the threat of CR. Consequently, CR could be viewed either pessimistically as an indol ent rejection reaction, or optimistically as incomplete tolerance. We prefer the latter viewpoint, since tolerance may not be an all-or-none phenomenon, but rather representative of various levels of unresponsiveness.[467] Chimeric Tolerance . Since the advent of transplantation i mmunobiology, tolerance achieved by hematopoietic chimerism has been widely recogni zed as the ideal and most robust form of tolerance (for recent comprehensive reviews see references 468-471). Owen[472] was the first to show that nonidentical twin cattle sharing a placental circulation develop chimeric immune systems, each composed of hematopoietic cells from both individuals.[472] Shortly thereafter, Medawar showed that these chimeric twins were tolerant to skin grafts from their twin siblings.[473,474] In the fetus or in immunodeficient recipients, engraftment of allogeneic hematopoietic cells can be achieved without immunosuppression,[472,475-477] because the recipient immune system is immature or defective and unable to reject the donor cells. In mature immunocompetent individuals, some type of recipient conditioning is required, typically irradiation and/or cyto reductive chemotherapy combined with T cell-depleting antibodies and/or conventional pharmacologic immunosuppression. The intent is to provide a \"clean slate\" [469] for the newly developing T-cell repertoire, to prevent rejection of the donor cells by mature reci pient T cells and facilitate long- term engraftment of the donor hematopoietic cells.[469] This is followed by infusion of donor bone marrow alone, or a combination infusion of donor and recipient bone marrow.[478-486] Two types of chimerism are achieved with these protocols[469]: full chimerism, in which the entire recipient hematolymphoid system is replaced by that of the donor; and mixed chimerism, in which a functionally integrated immune system is co mposed of various proportions of hematolymphoid Page 122cells from the donor and recipient. A third type called microchimerism is a recently described phenomenon, similar to mixed chimerism.[27,408,424] Microchimerism refers to trace populations of multilineage donor hematopoietic cells that persist in a fraction of stable, unconditioned, long-term vascularized allograft recipients treated only with conventional immunosuppressive regimens.[27,408,424] Although some investigators are quick to draw a clear distinction between microchimerism and mixed chimerism,[429,430,469] in our opinion, the only difference is the proportion of donor cells. The robust tolerance associated with mixed chimer ism is strictly dependent on the persistence of donor cells (chimerism).[487,488] It is primarily mediated by central deletion,[481,482,485] although peripheral mechanisms are also likely to contribute to the process,[489,490] similar to mechanisms of self tolerance.[491-494) Specifically, successful mixed chimeras show clonal deletion of self-reactive T cells[485,488,495) and consequently, lack donor responsivenes s in reaction (MLR), accept wi thout the mixed chimera approach to tolera nce induction, which is so successful in small experimental animals, has not gained widespread cl inical acceptance. The major drawback is the significant morbidity and mortality asso ciated with the recipient conditioning[485,498] needed to ensure engraftment of the donor hematopoietic cells. The subsequent threat of graft-versus-host disease is another serious consideration, particula rly when major MHC barriers are crossed, as is currently the practice in solid organ transplantation.[499,500] Efforts are being made, therefore, to modify the protocols in an effort to lessen t he associated morbidity without compromising donor stem-cell engraftment. These modifications include lo wer doses of irradiation, the use of facilitator cells to enhance engraftment of donor stem cells,[501,502] higher doses or repeated infusions of donor bone marrow,[486,498,503] and costimulatory molecule blockade.[469] The acid test for tolerance-inducing regimens is their efficacy in subhuman primates and clinical trials. Tolerance was induced in monkeys using a combination of total body irradiation, thymic irradiation, antithymocyte globulin, donor bone ma rrow transplantation, and a 4-week course of cyclosporine.[504] However, these studies showed that splenectomy may also be required in the initial conditioning regimen to induce B-ce ll tolerance and prevent the production of alloantibodies,[504] which are important in the development of CR. A multiple myeloma patient with renal failure was recently treated with simultaneous kidney-bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling.[505] The conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide, antithymocyte globulin, thymic irradiation, and, after transplantation, cyclosporine (given for 73 days). Mixed chimer ism was easily detectable until 105 days after transplantation, but thereafter was either nondetectable or fell into the microchimeric range. Nevertheless, the patient was able to be weaned from all immunosuppression with normal kidney allograft function 14 weeks after discontinuance of cyclosporine. [505] The long-term outcome in this patient is yet to be determined. Several centers are currently evaluating clinical protocols whereby vascularized organ allograft recipients are given an infusion of unfract ionated donor bone marrow at the time of transplantation. [434-437] In some protocols, additional donor bone marrow infusions are given several weks later.[434] In general, no specific conditioning therapy is used and the patients are treated with conventional immunosuppressive agents. The intent is to enhance donor hematopoietic stem-cell engraftment and possibly the ability of allostimulatory cells to deplete donor-reactive mature T cells via activation-in duced apoptosis. It is hoped that the bone marrow infusion will enhance engraftment of donor hemat opoietic stem cells, thereby increasing the number of donor hematolymphoid cells persisting lo ng term without harsh conditioning therapy. Although it is too early to critically evaluate the results, the treat ment protocol seems relatively safe and indeed enhances the number of patients becoming chimeric and the number of donor cells present, albeit modestly (~ 1% at 2 years). [434-437,506] A trend toward decreased donor-specific Page 123hypo- or unresponsiveness[434-437] and perhaps a lower incidence of CR[435,437] has also been observed. However, the long-term efficacy of this approach is yet to be determined. Nonchimeric Tolerance . There are numerous protocols to achieve tolerance in small experimental animals which apparently do not depend on hematopoietic chimerism.[507] In fact, almost every new immunosuppressive agent has been treated as tolerance-inducing, based on long-term allograft survival following preconditioning or a short course of treatment. Many of these studies suggest that the \"tolerogenic\" si gnal resides in the allograft parenchyma and stroma,[402,508,509] soluble donor MHC antigens,[510,511] or donor peptides,[510-513] and not in the donor hematopoietic cells. However, in these nonchim eric models, tolerance is usually nondeletional, more difficult to define, and less robust. It is therefore less likely to withstand the rigors of environmental and infectious exposures that are likely to occur in human allograft recipients.[469] Unfortunately, many investigat ors have spent years mistakenly studying tolerance models that actually were models of CR.[3] A series of recent investigations in in-bred miniature swine[514-520] showed that long-term kidney allograft acceptance (tolerance induction) can be achieved across class I MHC barriers with a short course of cyclosporine. However, if a heart is transplanted instead of the kidney, the heart allograft develops CR. [521] If a simultaneous kidney-heart allograft is conducted (composite effect), the tolerance returns and the heart allograft is resistant to CR.[521] In these studies, the induction of tolerance was dependent on at least 1 matched MHC locus between the donor and recipient, with complete class II matching appearing to be the most successful way of assuring robust long-term graft survival without spontaneous rejection episodes. [522] Tolerance was associated with a permanent change in the recipient immune system. If the accepted allograft was removed, the tolerant recipients accepted a second renal tran splant MHC matched to the original donor without additional immunosuppression. This observatio n was not dependent on graft adaptation, because retransplantation of the accepted allograft into na?ve recipients resulted in prompt rejection in most of the animals.[520] Methylprednisone, old age, and thymectomy[515] or thymic injury[516] interfered with the induction of stable tolerance in this model.[517] A series of studies to determine whether microchimerism was associated with tolerance in this model yielded inconclusive results.

Demetris, MD,* B. Eghtesad, MD, A. Marcos, MD, K. M. A . Nalesnik, MD,* MD,* P. MD, T. Cac ciarelli, MD, A. O. Shakil, MD,\u00a7 N. Murase, MD, J. J. Fung, MD, PhD, and T. E. Starzl, MD, P hD Rationale and Design: The accuracy of a prospective histopatho- logic diagnosis of rejection and recurrent hepatitis C (HCV) was de- termined in 48 \"immunosuppression minimization protocol\" between July 29,2001 and January 24, 2003. Prospective entry of all pertinent treat-ment, laboratory, and histopathology results into an electronic data-base enabled a retrospective analysis of the accuracy of histopatho-logic diagnoses and the pathophysiologic relationship between recur-rent HCV and rejection. Results: Time to first onset of acute rejection (AR) (mean, 107 days; median, 83 days; range, 7-329 days) overlapped with the time to firstonset of recurrent HCV (mean, 115 days; median, 123 days; range,22-315 days), making distinction between the two difficult. AR andchronic rejection (CR) with and without co-existent HCV showedoverlapping but significantly different liver injury test profiles. Onemajor and two minor errors occurred (positive predictive values forAR = 91%; recurrent HCV = 100%); all involved an overdiagnosis ofAR in the context of recurrent HCV. Retrospective analysis of themistakes showed that major errors can be avoided altogether and theimpact of unavoidable minor errors can be minimized by strict adher-ence to specific histopathologic criteria, close clinicopathologic cor - relation including examination of HCV RNA levels, and a conserva-tive approach to the use of additional immunosuppression. In addi-tion, histopathologic diagnoses of moderate and severe AR and CRwere associated with relatively low HCV RNA levels, whereas relativelyhigh HCV RNA levels were associated with a histopathologic diagnosisof hepatitis alone, particularly the cholestatic variant of HCV. Conclusions: Liver allograft biopsy interpretation can rapidly and accurately distinguish between recurrent HCV and AR/CR. In addi-tion, the histopathologic observations suggest that the immunemechanism responsible for HCV clearance overlap with those leadingto significant rejection.Key Words: liver allograft, recurrent hepatitis, acute and Banff schema, tolerance (Am J Surg Pathol 2004;28:658-669) Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced cirrhosis is the leading indication for liver transplantation throughout the world.32Unfortunately, reinfection is nearly universal and re- current disease occurs in a majority of recipients. HCV repli-cation can be detected in the RNA-positive recipients withindays after transplantation. 27Allograft dysfunction can occur as early as 1 week following transplantation in patients with high viral loads before transplantation,6but the majority of HCV- positive recipients usually first show signs of recurrent diseasebetween 2 and 3 months. 11,31 Distinguishing among recurrent viral hepatitis and AR and CR and other causes of allograft dysfunction is based pri-marily on liver biopsy evaluation. Guidelines to recognize in-dividual syndromes were proposed more than a decadeago, 13,16but experience has shown the distinction to be prob- lematic.1,19,25 Steatosis is an early nonspecific finding in recurrent HCV5; spotty hepatocyte necrosis, lobular disarray, and Kupffer's cell hypertrophy are more reliable features that spe-cifically point toward recurrent HCV as the cause of allograftinjury. 31,33Later in the course of recurrent HCV, predomi- nantly inflammation with variable low-grade bile duct damage signal the transi-tion from acute to chronic hepatitis. Chronic HCV is charac-terized by mononuclear portal inflammation that is frequentlyarranged into nodular aggregates and mild bile duct damagethat is neither as severe nor as widespread as is seen in acuterejection (AR) or chronic rejection (CR). 31Interface activity, including a type II ductular reaction, is also more common inhepatitis than in rejection. Retrospective analysis of case ma-terial to determine whether specific histopathologic criteria areuseful in distinguishing among recurrent HCV and othercauses of allograft dysfunction is fraught with pitfalls.From the Departments of *Pathology and Surgery, Divisions of Transplan- tation, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; Graduate School of Pub - lic Health, and \u00a7Department of Medicine, Division of Hepatology, Uni- versity of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.

Real-time entry of all pertinent treatment, laboratory, and his-topathology data into this software has enabled us to accom-plish our primary goal. This objective was to prospectively andrigorously test our ability to distinguish among recurrent HCV,rejection, and other various causes of liver allograft dysfunc-tion in HCV RNA-positive recipients enrolled in a recent \"im- munosuppression minimization protocol. \" 36A secondary goal was to retrospectively analyze errors and determine how theymight be avoided. The treatment protocol used in this patient population is based on the concept that alloantigen migration to the centrallymphoid tissues of the recipient early after transplantation isan important event that simultaneously triggers rejection andtolerogenic immune responses. 35-37Pretransplant immuno- depletion with anti-leukocyte antibodies is used to rein in theexpected early alloresponse into a manageable range. This iscombined with minimal posttransplantation monotherapy im-munosuppression in an attempt to facilitate activation-inducedapoptosis of donor-reactive lymphocytes. 36A final goal of this study was to determine whether histopathologic observationsin this unique patient population shed any insight into our con-ceptual understanding of HCV pathogenesis in the allograftedliver. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient Population and Pathology Workflow All primary liver allograft recipients with documented HCV infection (RNA positive by PCR) enrolled in the protocolbetween July 29, 2001 and January 24, 2003 were initially in-cluded in this study (n = 53). Five patients either died within 1week of transplantation or did not undergo any posttransplan-tation biopsies and were removed from the study. This left atotal of 48 patients for analyses. The remaining patients werefollowed until March 31, 2003. Rationale for the treatmentprotocol is reported by Starzl et al. 36 Briefly, all liver allograft recipients were treated imme- diately before transplantation reactive rab-bit anti-thymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin; Sangstat, 25) or Alemtuzumab (Campath 1H ; n = 22) and simultaneously with 1 t o 2 g methylprednisolone to concomi- tantly prevent cytokine reactions. 36One patient pretreatment. After transplantation patients weretreated with tacrolimus monotherapy with the goal of achiev-ing target trough levels of 10 ng/mL. Any additional immuno-suppression, such as steroids or other agents, was added onlytemporarily to control biopsy-proven rejection. Beginning at 4months after transplantation, patients that had been on tacroli-mus monotherapy for the preceding 60 days were consideredfor weaning. 36After obtaining a protocol biopsy that was re-jection-free, twice daily tacrolimus doses were consolidated toonce daily doses for a few weeks. In the continued absence ofrejection, baseline immunosuppressive therapy was furtherweaned by spacing doses to every other day and subsequentlyto longer intervals. 36During immunosuppression weaning, unacceptable elevations of liver injury tests were investigatedby liver allograft biopsies and other tests when appropriate.Mostly all biopsies were processed on a \"STAT \"basis with interpretation occurring on the same day the biopsy was ob-tained. Experienced transplant pathologists (A.J.D., M.A.N., P.R., initially reviewed all liver allograft biop-sies. Each biopsy was evaluated according to a protocol 15that listed 31 histologic findings for scoring (http://tpis.upmc.edu/tpis/schema/AlloLiver.html). Consultation among the pa-thologists in difficult cases was routine at the time of signout.All biopsies were reviewed a second time immediately beforea weekly clinicopathologic conference, when the free text di-agnosis assigned by the primary pathologist was convertedinto \"coded \"diagnosis(es) a single pathologist (A.J.D.) who re-reviewed the slides. 15The diagnoses were also ranked in perceived order of importance with the most important listedfirst and discussed during the conference. Since all difficultcases were also discussed among the pathologists at the time ofsignout, there was only one instance of a significant disagree-ment between the signout diagnosis and coded diagnosis,which did not impact the results of this study. Histopathologic Criteria for the Distinction Between Recurrent HCV and AR and CR andAssessment of Follow-up The criteria used to distinguish between AR and recur- rent HCV were based on those originally developed for HBV.13,16Specifically, mild AR was diagnosed when either of the following conditions was met: 1) portal inflammation withinflammatory bile duct damage perivenular hepatic venules, associated with hepa- tocyte necrosis and/or dropout. These criteria for mild AR re-quire more extensive tissue injury than listed for the Banff cri-teria 3in allografts not otherwise affected by a coexistent dis- ease. Slightly more extensive tissue injury than usually seen inallografts without coexistent disease was also required for adiagnosis of moderate and severe AR, but the Banff criteria didnot have to be adjusted. In general, a biopsy was considered adequate when it contained six or more portal tracts and four or more terminalhepatic venules. Early and late CR was diagnosed using theBanff criteria. 12Recurrent HCV was diagnosed when lobular or interface necro-inflammatory activity was more prevalentand prominent than bile duct inflammation and damage. Patient outcome was used to gauge the accuracy of the prospectively entered histopathologic diagnoses. AR treat-Am J Surg Pathol \u007fVolume 28, Number 5, May 2004 Hepatitis C in Liver Allografts \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 659 Page 141ment consisted of bolus steroid therapy. If unsuccessful, daily tacrolimus therapy was re-instituted and other agents wereadded. For the purpose of this study, the diagnosis of AR wasconsidered correct if peak liver injury test abnormalities at thetime of diagnosis showed a sustained improvement of at least50% during the first week after additional immunosuppressivetherapy. Liver injury tests eventually normalized with in-creased immunosuppression in all of the patients with ARalone. Return to daily tacrolimus therapy until whole blood lev- els registered at least 10 ng/mL was used to treat CR; this wassupplemented in some cases by simultaneous administration ofother agents. A diagnosis of early CR was considered correct ifthere was a sustained decrease of 50% or more in total serumbilirubin therapy during the 2 months following treatment.Liver injury test eventually returned to normal or near-normallevels in all of the patients with early CR alone. Recurrent hepatitis C was treated either by no change in immunosuppression therapy or weaning of immunosuppres-sion in patients more than 4 months after transplantation. Thiswas supplemented by interferon- /H9251(INTRON A or PEG- INTRON; Schering, Kenilworth, NJ) and/or ribavirin(REBETROL; Schering) in patients that agreed to treatmentand were able to tolerate the side effects. A diagnosis of recur-rent HCV was considered correct if there was either no wors-ening of liver injury tests for at least 2 weeks following thedecision not to augment immunosuppression and/or introduceanti-viral therapy. However, most patients specifically treatedfor HCV with decreased immunosuppression and anti-viraltherapy showed noticeable improvement. EDIT The EDIT software used to collect data for this study was designed and developed specifically for the Thomas E. StarzlTransplantation Institute at UPMC and described earlier ingreater detail. 15 Data Handling and Statistical Analysis Pertinent data from EDIT were first rendered anony- mous by stripping it of unique patient identifiers, according tothe exempt institutional review board-approved protocol(IRB#020177). The cohort was described using estimates ofcentral tendency (means, medians) and spread (standard devia-tion, range) for continuous data and frequencies and percent-ages for categorical data. Groups were compared using the /H9273 2 test for differences in proportions (categorical data) and theWilcoxon Rank Sum test (continuous data). To identify poten-tial predictors of AR and CR, Cox regression models were con-structed. Time-dependent covariates were used when appro-priate. For comparison of liver injury tests, only those labora-tory values that were obtained within 2 to 0 days prior tobiopsy were eligible. However, the time range for eligiblelaboratory results was increased from 14 to 0 days for biop-sies showing CR because of the slower changes in liver injurytests associated with this diagnosis. All analyses were per-formed using Statistical Analysis System (version 8.2).

Patient survivals at 1, 3, and 6 months and 1 year after transplantationwere 98%, 94%, 85%, and 90%, 83%, and 78%. Therewere eight deaths and nine graft failures. The causes of deathincluded liver allograft failure from primary dysfunction (n =3) complicated by myocardial infarction (n = 1), cerebral an-oxia (n = 1), or multiorgan failure (n = 1). Three patients diedwith functioning allografts from an intracranial bleed (n = 1),sepsis (n = 1), and a motor vehicle accident (n = 1). Two otherpatients died because of liver allograft failure secondary to re-current cholestatic HCV (n = 1) and a combination of hepaticartery thrombosis and recurrent HCV (n = 1). The causes ofgraft failure included patient death (with functioning graft; n =3), primary dysfunction without (n = 1) or with patient death(n = 3), and liver allograft failure from cholestatic hepatitis(n = 1) or a combination of hepatic artery thrombosis and re-current HCV (n = 1). None of the allografts failed primarilyfrom either AR or CR. Biopsy Timing and Diagnoses There were a total of 179 biopsies included in this study. The timing of the biopsies and the number of biopsies per pa- tient are shown in Table 3. In total, grade mild AR or greaterwas diagnosed on 45 of 179 (25%) biopsies from 23 of 48(48%) patients (Table 4). The mean and median time to firstonset of AR was 107 and 83 days, respectively, with a range of7 to 329 days. Early CR was diagnosed on 17 of 179 (9.5%)biopsies from 6 of 48 (12.5%) patients. The mean and mediantimes until the first onset of early CR were 302 and 300 days,respectively, with a range of 170 to 413 days. None of the pa-tients developed late CR. 8,12Acute and/or chronic hepatitis was diagnosed on 86 of 179 (48%) biopsies from 31 of 48(65%) patients. The mean and median times until the first onsetof recurrent HCV were 115 and 123 days, respectively, with arange of 22 to 315 days.Correlation of Histopathologic Diagnoses With Liver Injury Test Profile Correlation of the histopathologic diagnosis with the liver injury test profile is shown in Table 5. Patients with a primary diagnosis of AR alone showed significantly lower se-rum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and /H9253-glutamyl trans- peptidase (GGTP) levels than patients with a primary diagno-sis of AR and a secondary diagnosis of recurrent HCV. This islikely attributable to the more restrictive criteria used for a pri-mary diagnosis of AR in the context of recurrent HCV. Con-versely, however, there was no significant difference in theliver injury test profile in patients with a primary diagnosis ofrecurrent HCV alone versus those with a primary diagnosis ofrecurrent HCV and a secondary diagnosis of AR (Table 5).

This difference is attrib-utable to the more diffuse bile duct damage and senescenceseen in CR, 26which is not part of the histopathologic spectrum of HCV alone. Examples of Correct Identification and Treatment of Rejection andRecurrent Hepatitis Two predominant histopathologic patterns comprised an \"AR profile \"in the context of recurrent HCV: 1) portal inflam- mation with bile duct damage involving a majority of the portal tracts; and/or 2) perivenular mononuclear inflammation in-volving a majority of central veins. The latter finding was as-sociated with perivenular hepatocyte necrosis and dropoutwith or without portal inflammation. Early CR was recognizedby senescence changes involving a majority of the bile ducts. 26 A representative example of each AR profile and one for re-current HCV are described below. The clinical course of the first patient, a 54-year-old man, is represented graphically in Figure 1. A protocolpreweaning biopsy obtained 109 days after transplantationshowed recurrent HCV alone, characterized by mild portal in-flammation that was focally arranged into nodular aggregates,mild focal interface activity, and mild steatosis. No bile ductdamage or perivenular inflammation was seen and liver injurytests were minimally abnormal, so weaning from immunosup-pression began (Fig. 2A). Fifty days later (postoperative day206), elevated liver injury tests prompted a repeat biopsy thatshowed moderate to severe AR (Figs. 2B, C), characterized bymoderate portal inflammation with prominent bile duct dam-age involving virtually all of the bile ducts. The patient wasinitially treated with a pulse of corticosteroids. A follow-upbiopsy obtained 11 days later (day 217) showed partial resolu-tion of the portal inflammation, but senescence changes ap-peared in a majority of the bile ducts signaling the onset of FIGURE 1.

Note the dra-matic immunosuppression. A correct histopathologicdiagnosis (see Fig. 2) of rejection prompted return to dailytacrolimus therapy and treatment with corticosteroids, whicheventually resulted in resolution of liver injury tests abnormali-ties. Despite the low levels of HCV RNA, the PCR for HCV waspositive.TABLE 5.

Re-institution of daily tacrolimus and maintenance corticosteroid therapy eventually lowered themarkedly elevated liver injury test (total serum bilirubinpeaked >50 mg/dL) to near-normal levels without a concomi-tant increase in HCV RNA levels. The clinical course of the second patient, a 52-year-old woman, is represented graphically in Figure 3. A preweaningbiopsy obtained about 3.5 months after transplantation showedlow-grade perivenular inflammation, which was not treatedwith increased immunosuppression because of normal liver in-jury tests. There was minimal histopathologic evidence of re-current HCV at this time. Approximately 3.5 months after thestart of weaning, a sharp rise of AST and GGTP prompted theliver biopsy shown in Figure 4. Mild portal inflammation withminimal interface activity and mild focal bile duct damagecombined with prominent perivenular inflammation and hepa-tocyte dropout resulted in focal central-to-central bridging ne-crosis. A primary histopathologic diagnosis of mild acute cel-lular rejection prompted treatment with 2 pulses of corticoste-roids, followed by a single injection of Alemtuzumab. This ledto a prompt return of liver injury tests to normal levels, withouta significant rise in the HCV RNA levels. The clinical course of a 45-year-old man successfully recognized and treated as suffering from recurrent HCV aloneafter withdrawal from immunosuppression is shown in Figure5. This patient first had evidence of recurrent HCV in a biopsyobtained on day 150 after transplantation, manifest as primar-ily as spotty acidophilic necrosis of hepatocytes with minimalportal inflammation. This was followed by biopsies on days232, 296, and 388, all of which showed changes characteristicof recurrent chronic HCV including variable mononuclear por-tal inflammation, interface activity, lobular disarray, andspotty hepatocyte necrosis (Fig. 6). No significant bile duct FIGURE 3. Clinical course of a patient who developed AR after being weaned from immunosuppression. Approximately 5 months after transplantation (top panel) and several weeksafter a protocol biopsy that showed minimal focal perivenularinflammation, the immunosuppression was lowered (toppanel). Approximately 3 months after spaced dosing of tacro-limus and low whole blood levels of tacrolimus <5 ng/mL (toppanel), the patient developed elevations of the AST and GGTPto levels >600 IU/L (third panel from top). This prompted arepeat liver biopsy shown in Figure 4. Note the low levels ofHCV RNA during the course. FIGURE 2. Appearance of liver allograft biopsies from the pa- tient whose clinical course is shown in Figure 1. A: A protocolpreweaning liver biopsy obtained on day 109 showed mildchronic portal and spotty hepatocyte necrosis but without bileduct damage or portal or central venulitis. These findingsprompted a diagnosis of recurrent HCV alone. B and C: An-other biopsy was obtained after weaning of immunosuppres-sion on day 206 because of markedly increased liver injury test(see Fig. 1). Note the prominent mononuclear portal inflam-mation and prominent bile duct damage (arrows), which in-volved the majority of the ducts. Attention is drawn to the bileducts (C; arrows), which are shown at higher magnification onthe right side of (C). D: A follow-up biopsy obtained 11 dayslater (day 217) after treatment with increased immunosup-pression showed partial resolution of the portal inflammation,but a majority of the bile duct showed senescence-relatedchanges, prompting a diagnosis of early CR (arrows). An ex-ample of an affected bile duct (arrow) is shown at higher mag-nification in the right panel of D. A return to daily tacrolimusand maintenance corticosteroids eventually resulted in nearnormalization of the liver injury tests.Am J Surg Pathol \u007fVolume 28, Number 5, May 2004 Hepatitis C in Liver Allografts \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 663 Page 145damage or perivenular inflammation was seen in any of the biopsies. While being maintained on low levels of baseline im-munosuppression (Fig. 5), the patient experienced fluctuatingliver injury tests and HCV RNA levels over 6.5 months untiltreatment with a combination of interferon and ribavirincaused a dramatic lowering of the liver injury tests. Identification and Explanation of Errors We identified one major error and two minor errors in the pathology diagnoses. The major error occurred in a 36-year-old man who was subjected to an initial biopsy on day 39because of elevated AST levels. The biopsy showed changesconsistent with recurrent HCV alone, manifest as very mildchronic portal inflammation and spotty acidophilic necrosis ofhepatocytes without bile duct damage or venulitis. Weaning ofimmunosuppression resulted in an increase in liver injury tests(Fig. 7), which in turn, prompted a repeat biopsy on day 82. Itshowed markedly increased portal inflammation. Bile ductdamage was present but involved a minority of the portaltracts. There was also prominent lobular disarray, a type II duc-tular reaction, and hepatocyte necrosis. A mistaken primarydiagnosis of mild AR with a secondary diagnosis of recurrentHCV (Fig. 8) prompted re-institution of daily tacrolimustherapy and a short cycle of steroids. Treatment with more immunosuppression caused an im- mediate worsening of liver injury tests. Another follow-up bi-opsy obtained almost a week later (day 88) showed noticeablyless portal inflammation but centrilobular hepatocyte swellingand hepatocanalicular cholestasis appeared, indicators ofthe development of cholestatic hepatitis (Fig. 9). Recognitionof the mistake in this follow-up biopsy prompted a lowering ofimmunosuppression; the patient was also started on pegylatedinterferon and ribavirin. The anti-viral therapy resulted in dra-matic lowering of the liver injury tests and lower viral loads(Fig. 7). An additional follow-up biopsy obtained on day 100showed changes of recurrent HCV alone. FIGURE 5. Clinical course of a patient correctly recognized and treated as recurrent HCV alone. Note that weaning from im- munosuppression began approximately 4 months after trans-plantation (top panel) after a protocol biopsy (bottom panel)showed changes of recurrent HCV alone. Marked fluctuationof liver injury tests after weaning from immunosuppressionprompted several liver allograft biopsies, all of which showedchanges of recurrent HCV alone (see Fig. 6). Consequently, thepatient was treated with a combination of interferon and riba-virin (panel second from top), which eventually resulted in anormalization of liver injury test (middle panel). FIGURE 4. Liver biopsy from the patient whose clinical course is shown in Figure 3. It was obtained 8.5 months after trans-plantation and 3 months after weaning of immunosuppres-sion. The most striking changes were perivenular inflamma-tion, centrilobular hepatocyte dropout, and early perivenularfibrosis, which prompted a diagnosis of mild AR. A: Note thatthe inflammation is concentrated around the central veins(CV). B and C: Note the mild portal tract (PT) inflammationwith focal mild bile duct damage but prominent perivenularinflammation. D: Higher magnification of an involved centralvein showing the prominent perivenular inflammation consist-ing of lymphocytes and plasma cells. There is also red bloodcell congestion, hepatocyte dropout, and early perivenular fi-brosis.Demetris et al Am J Surg Pathol \u007fVolume 28, Number 5, May 2004 664 \u00a92004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Page 146A minor diagnostic error occurred approximately 10 months after transplantation and 6 months after weaning of immunosuppression. A secondary diagnosis of mild AR re-sulted in treatment with a single bolus of steroids, which in turnresulted in a slight worsening of liver injury tests. Follow-upbiopsies 1, 4, and 6 months later showed predominantly or onlyrecurrent HCV. Rejection activity, if present at all in any ofthese biopsies, was of indeterminate severity. The final minor error occurred during the interpretation of a protocol biopsy obtained 4 months after transplantation,just before beginning weaning of immunosuppression. A sec-ondary diagnosis of mild AR was ignored by the clinicians andweaning proceeded without any worsening of the near-normalliver injury tests. A total of 105 of the 179 (59%) biopsies were obtained more than 30 days after transplantation and therefore wereconsidered \"at risk \"for confusing AR with recurrent HCV. All errors were similar: AR was overdiagnosed in the context ofrecurrent HCV. The positive predictive values of rejection andhepatitis diagnoses were 91% and 100%, respectively. FIGURE 7. Clinical course of the patient whose liver allograft biopsy was misinterpreted as primarily AR, when in retrospect, the changes represented aggressive recurrent HCV. Weaningfrom immunosuppression (top panel) began several monthsafter transplantation because a preweaning biopsy obtainedon day 39 showed changes of recurrent HCV alone. By day 82,the liver injury tests as well as total serum bilirubin increaseddramatically (third panel from top). This prompted a repeatliver biopsy, shown in Figure 8, which was misinterpreted asshowing primarily AR with a secondary diagnosis of recurrentHCV. Return to daily tacrolimus therapy (top panel) and treat-ment with a pulse of corticosteroids (bottom panel) resulted ina further worsening of liver injury tests (third panel from top).A repeat biopsy 6 days later (Fig. 9; day 88) showed features ofcholestatic hepatitis, a diagnosis that led to a decrease in im-munosuppression and treatment with interferon and ribavirin.Eventually the anti-viral therapy led to a marked improvementin liver injury tests and a dramatic fall in HCV RNA levels (sec-ond panel from top). FIGURE 6. Liver allograft biopsies obtained from the patient whose clinical course is shown in Figure 5. A: The protocolpreweaning biopsy obtained approximately 4 months aftertransplantation showed mild mononuclear portal inflamma-tion, mild interface activity, and spotty acidophilic necrosis ofhepatocytes. There was no evidence of bile duct damage orperivenular inflammation. The inset in the lower left cornershows the portal tract marked by the arrow at higher magni-fication. B: A repeat biopsy obtained about 6 months afterweaning, during the peak of liver injury test abnormalities alsoshowed changes of recurrent HCV alone. Note the mild mono-nuclear portal inflammation arranged into a small nodular ag-gregates (*), intact bile ducts (arrows), and type II ductularreaction at the interface zone (brace). None of the biopsiesfrom the patient showed any changes of AR or CR.Am J Surg Pathol \u007fVolume 28, Number 5, May 2004 Hepatitis C in Liver Allografts \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 665 Page 147Retrospective Analysis of Errors and How They Might Be Avoided In our opinion, the most serious error occurred because of anxiety over the uncertainty about the impact of conflicting influences of the treatment protocol on the biologic and histo-pathologic manifestations of recurrent HCV and rejection. Itwas reasoned that depleting antibody pretreatment might raiseviral levels 11early after transplantation. Subsequent had the potential to \"re-arm \"the im- mune system that could cause either severe hepatitis or severerejection. 13,16In retrospect, the major mistake would have probably not occurred if we had strictly adhered to our originalhistopathologic criteria and ignored the low blood levels ofimmunosuppression. In addition, retrospective analysis of theclinical course of this patient showed that HCV RNA levelswere >50 million IU/mL at the time of the misinterpreted bi-opsy. Thereafter, an attempt was made to include routinemonitoring of HCV RNA levels in patient management, butvalues were routinely not available until recently during prepa-ration of this manuscript. Correlation of Histopathology Diagnosis With HCV RNA Levels Serial plasma HCV RNA levels according to the histo- pathologic diagnosis were plotted versus time after transplan-tation (Fig. 10). In general, HCV RNA levels were greatest during the first 6 months after transplantation, although theresults varied among patients and values fluctuated signifi-cantly over time in individual patients. Quantitative HCV RNA levels near the time of biopsy were available for 10 of 14 patients with histopathologic diag-noses of moderate or severe AR or early CR (Fig. 10). All ofthe episodes in these 10 recipients occurred more than 100days after transplantation, and all but one of these patients,who had titers of 11.8 million IU/mL, showed HCV RNA lev-els of <10 million IU/mL at the time of the rejection diagnosis.HCV RNA levels were not available near the time of the biop-sies in the 4 remaining patients, all of whom experienced mod-erate or severe AR or early CR less than 30 days after trans-plantation. The two patients who developed cholestatic HCVshowed HCV RNA levels of >50 million IU/mL at the time ofdiagnosis. There was a wide range of HCV levels (0 -30 mil- lion IU/mL) in recipients with a primary histopathologic diag-nosis of recurrent HCV (Fig. 10). Analysis of Risk Factors for the Development of Acute and Chronic Rejection Six of the 11 HCV-positive recipients simultaneously maintained on low immunosuppression and treated with a combination of interferon and ribavirin developed significantrejection, defined as moderate or severe AR or CR. The re-maining 5 of 11 patients treated with a combination of inter-feron and ribavirin, 2 other recipients treated with interferonalone, and a third patient treated with ribavirin alone did notdevelop significant rejection. FIGURE 9. Follow-up biopsy from the patient whose clinical course and previous liver allograft biopsy are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively. A and B: Treatment with increased im-munosuppression caused a dramatic decrease of the portalinflammation compared with the biopsy shown in Figure 8; italso caused marked hepatocyte swelling, hepatocanalicularcholestasis (left side of B), and a prominent ductular reaction atthe interface zone (right side of B), all of which are character-istic features of cholestatic hepatitis. HCV RNA levels measuredretrospectively from a sample obtained near the time of thisbiopsy were >50 million IU/mL (PT, portal tract). FIGURE 8. Liver allograft biopsy misinterpreted as showing primarily AR with a secondary diagnosis of recurrent HCV. Theclinical course of this patient is shown in Figure 7. A: Note theprominent portal tract (PT) inflammation. B: In this portaltract, there is mild to moderate mononuclear portal inflamma-tion and a ductular reaction at the interface zone, but minimalinflammatory bile duct damage (arrow). C: In contrast, otherportal tracts from the same biopsy showed easily identifiablelymphocytic infiltration and damage of the small bile ducts(arrows). The prevalence of inflammatory bile duct damagewas greater than is usually seen with HCV alone, but in retro-spect, did not involve a majority of the bile ducts.Demetris et al Am J Surg Pathol \u007fVolume 28, Number 5, May 2004 666 \u00a92004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Page 148Univariate models were first examined for predictors of AR and/or CR. Those parameters that reached a significance level of 0.10 were then used in multivariable models. Param-eters that were considered for these models included basic do-nor and recipient characteristics such as age, race, and gender.Other variables included were cold ischemia time, pretrans-plantation crossmatch, antibody pretreatment, and posttrans-plantation anti-viral therapy. Only moderate or severe AR wasused in the analysis for AR. Predictors of AR in this patient population include fe- male recipients ( P= 0.04; hazard ratio [HR] and pre- treatment with Thymoglobulin versus CamPath pretreatment(P= 0.05 HR = 8.0). Since older donor livers tended to develop CR sooner than younger donors, the CR model and the AR orCR model was adjusted for donor age. Treatment with inter-feron and ribavirin appeared to be a predictor of CR ( P= 0.03; hazard ratio = 12.6); AR was weakly predictive of CR ( P= 0.11; HR = 2.8), probably because of the small number of pa-tients that experienced CR. Predictors of either AR or CR in-cluded female recipients ( ( P= 0.09; HR 4.0). Indeed, 13 of 14 patients who developed moderate or severe AR or early CRreceived Thymoglobulin pretreatment and of these, 4 of 6 whowent on to develop early CR were also treated with anti-viral therapy for recurrent HCV. DISCUSSION In conventionally treated liver allograft recipients, AR usually occurs during the first month after transplantation; re-current HCV usually first appears more than 1 month aftertransplantation. Thus, timing alone can be used to determinethe cause of new onset liver allograft dysfunction. For patientsenrolled in this protocol, the mean time to first onset of AR was107 days, which significantly overlapped with first onset ofrecurrent HCV at 115 days. Consequently, distinguishing be-tween rejection and recurrent HCV could not be based solelyon time since transplantation and was especially troubling and particularly reliant on biopsy evaluation. The unusually longinterval until the first onset of AR 15,40is likely attributable to the protocol: pretransplantation immunodepletion followed byweaning of immunosuppression. Regardless, this study pro-spectively documents that interpretation of liver allograft bi-opsies can be used to quickly (6 -7 hours) and accurately dis- tinguish recurrent HCV from AR and CR, even under chal-lenging conditions. We found that the most problematic biopsies are a subset of those showing changes primarily of recurrent HCV. Thetroubling subset also shows bile duct damage or perivenularinflammation that is more prevalent than usually encounteredwith HCV alone, but still involving /H1134950% of bile ducts or central veins, respectively. In such cases, it is our opinion thatAR should be considered mild at most, and as a secondarydiagnosis. These patients should not be treated with additionalimmunosuppression. Instead, they should be closely followedand subjected to re-biopsy if liver injury tests continue to rise. Increased immunosuppression should be considered as a treatment option only when rejection is judged to be the pri-mary insult. This condition is met when obvious bile duct dam-age or perivenular inflammation and hepatocyte dropoutclearly involves most of the bile ducts or central veins, respec-tively. In our experience, AR-related findings should be obvi-ous for biopsies in which AR is the primary insult. Such biop-sies are usually graded as moderate or severe AR according tothe Banff schema (1997) and usually associated with higherliver tests than HCV alone or mild rejection alone, 15as con- firmed in this study. The above algorithm is recommended because liver al- lografts are very \"forgiving \"compared with other allografts: they can recover from most insults and repairwithout fibrosis. 15Conversely, unnecessary additional immu- significantly worsen hepatitis or even trig-ger fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, and such patients usuallysuffer significant and often permanent liver damage from se-vere recurrent HCV. Furthermore, all of the mistakes in thisseries and in most other reports 1,19,25were in the same direc- FIGURE 10. Correlation between quantitative HCV RNA levels and primary histopathologic diagnosis plotted against time after transplantation. The HCV RNA levels were obtainedwithin a window from 14 days before until 3 days after thecorresponding biopsy. Note that the highest levels of HCVRNA are detected during the first 6 months after transplanta-tion, and thereafter levels generally decrease. In addition, HCVRNA levels >10 million IU/mL are almost invariably associatedwith a histopathologic diagnosis of recurrent HCV alone, andvery high levels are seen in association with cholestatic hepa-titis. Conversely, moderate and severe AR, and especially earlyCR, almost invariably shows relatively low HCV RNA levels. Thepoint corresponding to the major mistake was not included inthis graph.Am J Surg Pathol \u007fVolume 28, Number 5, Hepatitis C in Liver Allografts \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 667 Page 149tion; too great an emphasis was placed on mild AR findings in the context of recurrent HCV. Although this study was carried out under a specific im- munosuppressive protocol, it is our opinion that histopatholog-ic findings and recommendations are generically applicable toother liver allograft recipients subjected to different ap-proaches to immunosuppression. This contention is supportedby the following observations: 1) the algorithm used in thisstudy to distinguish between viral hepatitis and rejection wasdeveloped long ago in patients under a different immunosup-pression protocol 13,16,31; 2) even with low immunosuppres- sion and the increased risk of rejection, we still overestimatedthe risk of AR; and 3) the same tendency to overdiagnose ARin the context of recurrent HCV occurs in liver allograft recipi-ents treated with different approaches to immunosuppression.This statement is particularly true if the histopathologic find-ings are not clear-cut. 1,19,25 Correlation of the biopsy findings with the clinical course, including an examination of serum HCV titers, serialliver injury tests in relation to immunosuppression, weeklymeetings to discuss and collate all of this information, and im-portantly, insistence by the clinicians that there be unequivocalhistopathologic evidence of significant rejection before givingany additional immunosuppression offered the best approachto optimal management. Real-time availability of graphicalrepresentations of the clinical course (ie, pertinent clinical,biochemical, and treatment data) made possible by the EDITsoftware greatly facilitated the entire process and reporting ofthe results. Serial HCV RNA levels provided information useful for the histopathologic interpretation, but caution is urged againstplacing too much emphasis on HCV levels alone. There is awide variation of HCV levels among patients, the values fluc-tuate significantly over time in individual patients, and there isconsiderable overlap in patients with different histopathologicdiagnoses, particularly early after transplantation. Neverthe-less, similar to other studies, the highest HCV RNA valueswere observed early after transplantation and during episodesof cholestatic HCV. 6,28,42In contrast, all but one of the patients with late onset (>60 days) moderate or severe AR or CRshowed HCV RNA levels <10 million IU/mL and mostshowed levels <2 million IU/mL. Thus, a diagnosis of moder-ate or severe AR or CR occurring more than 60 days aftertransplantation should be made with extreme caution in a pa-tient with HCV RNA levels of >10 million IU/mL. Similarresults were obtained by Gottschlich et al 19who showed that higher HCV RNA levels were more frequently associated withan unequivocal diagnosis of recurrent HCV. Relatively high HCV RNA levels during the first 6 months followed by a return to relatively low levels thereafteris most probably related to antibody pretreatment, disruptionby transplantation of the previously established equilibriumbetween the host and virus, and later weaning of immunosup-pression. 21,22,24,41The unusual responsiveness of HCV levels and liver injury tests to anti-viral therapy in the weaningpatients (unpublished observation) is likely attributable tolower overall immunosuppression, and in particular, the in-frequent and sparing use of pulse or recycle corticosteroidtherapy. 6,9,18,30,42Our hope is that HCV might be more easily controlled or eliminated after transplantation, but using thisprotocol in HCV-positive recipients requires very close patientmonitoring. We have already observed an increased incidenceof early CR, 15but there have been no graft failures from either AR or CR. In addition, most of the cases of early CR occurredearly in the protocol and have recovered to near-normal liverinjury tests with appropriate treatment. We are also aware thatassessment of efficacy for both rejection and HCV will requirelonger-term follow-up because \"re-arming \"the immune sys- tem after immunodepletion the potential to accelerate liverdamage from recurrent HCV. 7,32 The relatively low (<10 million IU/mL) HCV RNA els and a paucity of hepatitis histopathologic findings duringmoderate or severe AR and CR versus high HCV RNA levelsin cholestatic hepatitis and a complete absence of rejection-related histopathologic findings are interesting observations.Significant AR and CR in liver allografts have been associatedwith a strong liver damage. 10,21,22,41In contrast, cholestatic HCV has been associated with high H2-type intrahepatic microenvironment42and hepatic tolero- genesis.29Consequently, rejection and HCV clearance appear to be closely linked because all of the risk factors for signifi-cant rejection in this study (pretreatment with Thymoglobulinvs. CamPath, low-immunosuppression and anti-viral therapyincluding interferon) simultaneously enhanced viral clearance. It is tempting to speculate about the role that hepatic den- dritic cells might play in the outcome because of their ability toinitiate and perpetuate immune responses. HCV interacts withDC-SIGN, 17,39a receptor on dendritic cells that has the capac- ity to regulate their maturation and promote TH2-type diminish stimulatory capacity,4,23HCV may be particularly suited for co-survival of the virus as well as the liver recipient. Earlyimmunosuppression needed to prevent rejection enhancesHCV replication, which in turn helps to subvert the allo-response. Thus, the virus protects itself from clearance and theallograft from rejection. Conversely, while weaning of immu-nosuppression with addition of interferon may re-arm the im-mune system and promote HCV clearance, it also could in-crease the risk of rejection, and both rejection and the immuneresponse leading to HCV clearance can significantly damagethe liver. It seems, therefore, that the optimal approach for thetreatment of HCV-positive liver allograft recipients would et al Am J Surg Pathol \u007fVolume 28, Number 5, May 2004 668 \u00a92004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Page 150similar to hepatitis B.

Rene Rodriguez, MDa The ultimate goal of a heart transplant team is successful long-term outcome for the patient. One of the many critical duties necessary for success isaccurate and expeditious study of heart pathologyafter transplantation. Correctly assessing the endo-myocardial biopsy specimen to monitor for rejectionrequires intimate knowledge of the pathophysiologyof the rejection process as it affects the heart. Adetailed discussion of the biologic aspects of rejec-tion is beyond the scope of this article; therefore,this review will focus on diagnostic use of the 1990International Society for Heart and Lung Trans-plantation Working Formulation of Cardiac Allo-graft Pathology (ISHLT-WF90). 1 Two recent meetings that addressed the pathol- ogy of transplantation prompted this review. Therst meeting was the Sixth Banff Conference onAllograft Pathology, held in Banff, Canada, April22-23, 2001. 2The rst 5 meetings at Banff used an interdisciplinary approach to discussion and to im-proving the pathology schemas used to evaluatepathology of kidney 3-6and liver transplants.7Given the success of their work in other solid organtransplantations, the organizers of the Banff confer-ences invited a group of pathologists, cardiologists,cardiac surgeons, and other scientists to address thepathology of the human cardiac allograft at Banff.The goal of this work group was to exchange ideas and to share vast experience using the ISHLT-WF90. The second meeting that influenced thisreview was the \"Endpoints\" conference sponsoredby the American Society of Transplantation and theAmerican Society of Transplant Surgeons, held atthe Natcher Center of the National Institutes ofHealth in Bethesda, November 5-6, 2001. The goalat this conference was consensus on objective end-points that could be used as surrogate markers inclinical trials related to solid organ transplants. Forthe heart group at the conference, it was clear thatendomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standardfor diagnosis. However, the ISHLT-WF90 has somelimitations because it has not been revised criticallyin more than a decade. This article reviews theissues discussed in detail at the Banff meeting thatsupport the wisdom of rening the ISHLT-WF90, inlight of the knowledge acquired during the decadesince its implementation. I will refer to the combination of speakers and audience at the Banff meeting as \"the workinggroup\" (list of names and institutions provided as anappendix). After the rst session, a consensus wasreached that the ISHLT-WF has withstood the testof time and the intent of the clarication paper from1998 was understood. 8However, several topics re- quired further clarication or modication and thuswere chosen for further discussion as describedbelow. HUMORAL REJECTION In this review, the term humoral rejection (Figure 1) refers to the immunopathologic process of antibody-and complement-mediated graft dysfunction (TableI). 9-12A recent clinico-pathologic study expands the denition of humoral rejection by adding hemor-From Cardiovascular Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.

Also note the presence of complement around the myocytes in a patternfollowing that of IgG deposition.The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation Rodriguez 5 Volume 22, Number 1 Page 163in explanted hearts has not been well estab- lished.10-18The reported frequency of humoral re - jection ranges from 44% to 59%.13,15,16Despite these high percentages, the ISHLT-WF90 mentionsonly brie fly that a piece of tissue should be frozen for immuno fluorescence and an entry should be made to indicate whether there is humoral rejection,recording in ltrate. \" 1However, the ISHLT-WF90 does not indicate how many pieces of endomyocar-dia should be examined in this manner, whetherboth light microscopic and immuno fluorescence ndings must be present, how to interpret the pattern or intensity of humoral rejection, or how tointerpret the combined ndings of cell-mediated and humoral-mediated rejection. Humoral rejection has been referred to as \"vas- humoral \" 15or more recently \"cardiac vascular (microvascular) rejection. \"16,17It usually occurs within the rst month after transplantation and affects most notably the components of thecardiac capillary network. 15However, combined cel - lular in flammatory in ltration of the larger vessel walls and intimal proliferation, which results insevere luminal narrowing and eventually loss of thegraft, of the epicardial coronary arteries may notshow a prominent humoral rejection component. 18 Furthermore, when the humoral response is intense,there are subtle light microscopic ndings in the biopsy specimen. One is \"nding the combination of prominent endothelial cell swelling and/or vasculitison light microscopy and the deposition of immuno-globulin and complement by immuno fluores- cence. \" 15Interstitial edema occurs, but even under the best circumstances, freezing can create artifactsthat mimic edema, making accurate interpretationdifcult. Thus, evaluation of edema in small biopsy pieces is unreliable. Other methods for evaluating humoral rejec- tion that the literature recommends include iden-tication of (Ig)G, IgM, and complement C3 sections. 15Deposits of IgM, IgG, the myo - humoral - cation of the ISHLT-WF90, additional reagentsthat detect complement have been reported. 21,22 Recently, it was shown that the presence of brin may be part of the humoral rejection process.23 On the technical side, immunohistochemistry ofparaf to detect humoral rejec- tion IgG, IgM, etc.) is not reliable,because the xation process may precipitate many serum proteins in the tissue and give a false- positive rate /H1102290%. 24 Humoral rejection in the pediatric population can present with or without concomitant cellular rejec-tion, and the humoral component may persist aftertreatment. 25Such episodes of humoral rejection also are seen in the adult population, particularlywhen humoral rejection develops many months oreven years after transplantation. Patients who un-dergo second cardiac transplantations may experi-ence a similar phenomenon. In some studies, humoral rejection correlates well with the presence of anti-HLA antibodies in se-rum, 26,27perhaps suggesting that combined use of immuno fluorescence and serologic measurement of anti-HLA antibodies may be a more reliable way todiagnose humoral rejection and that diagnosis maynot be possible with 1 test alone. In one study, serumspecimens were obtained, on average, within 1.8days of biopsy and were analyzed for anti-HLAantibodies. 26The authors found good correlation between the presence of these antibodies and lineardeposits of immunoglobulins or complement com-ponents in the biopsy specimens. Nonetheless, evi-dence of antibodies in the circulation with speci city for non-HLA antigens on the graft is a possibilityand should support the diagnosis of humoral rejec-tion. At our institution, humoral rejection is usuallysuspected clinically when there is evidence of sub-optimal graft function and the endomyocardial bi-opsy specimen shows either no evidence of cellularrejection (i.e., Grade 0) or mild rejection (Grade 1).This combination of ndings should prompt the cardiologist to obtain tissue for immuno fluores- cence. Patients with prolonged warm or cold isch-emia experience poor survival of cardiac transplants. When biopsies obtained 1 to 3 weeks after trans-plantation are evaluated with immuno fluorescence, a diffuse capillary and deposition ofcomplement components C4d or C3d can be de-tected in the absence of IgM, IgG, and IgA. Approx-imately 80% of the biopsy specimens deposition light microscopy evidenceof peritransplant ischemic injury. only45% of or C3d deposition showed ischemic injury.Thus, changes are associated with comple-ment activation. 22Therefore, predominant comple - ment activation should not be the only criterionused to diagnose true humoral rejection, particularlyin the early post-transplant period.6Rodriguez The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation January 2003 Page 164Discussion of Humoral Rejection at Banff The working group agreed that humoral rejection is a real process that clinically affects a signi cant number of cardiac transplant patients (although nopercentage was agreed upon). The working groupalso agreed that there was no consensus (in theworking group or in the literature) about the inci-dence of clinically signi cant humoral rejection in the heart. The working group concurred that theISHLT-WF must strive to establish clear pathologiccriteria for humoral rejection in the heart. Theliterature on this topic is sparse, and no reproduc-ibility criteria exist among heart transplant centersas to what constitutes humoral rejection. Consensuswas reached that humoral rejection must be recog-nized early and unambiguously. The working groupalso agreed on the necessity of clear criteria, be- cause isolated markers are not fully reliable orspeci c for humoral rejection. The pathologic mark- ers of humoral rejection identi able in endomyocar- dial biopsy tissue suggested C3d, C4d, CD68/KP1(monocytes/macrophages), and usefulness ofbrinogen, brin, and HLA-DR. During the discus- sion about establishing these criteria, the workinggroup agreed on a need to show reproducible resultswith these markers in diagnosing humoral rejection.While discussing this issue, the working groupagreed that humoral rejection must be better de-ned because no standardized pathologic criteria exist. Table I summarizes suggested features. FIGURE 2 Cardiac allograft vasculopathy, light microscopy. A.

(Masson 's trichrome) ( /H1100340).The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation Rodriguez 7 Volume 22, Number 1 Page 165Clinical pathology studies may be useful (for cases in which ischemia -reperfusion injury is present con- comitantly with rejection). Identifying donor-spe- cic antibody should be another criterion used to support the diagnosis of humoral rejection. The working group also recognized that a sub-set of patients may predominantly experience vascularacute cell-mediated rejection, which smallarteries and arteriolar walls (not venules) arethe likely hallmark of these lesions. The incidenceand signi cance of these lesions is not known. The working group agreed that it is premature to speculate about the association between the vascularhumoral component and/or the predominantly vascu-lar acute cell mediated rejection seen in some biopsiesand the development of epicardial coronary arteryvasculopathy (Figure 2) in the cardiac allograft. ACUTE CELLULAR REJECTION Morphologically, acute cellular rejection is a mono-nuclear in flammatory response, predominantly lym- phocytic, directed against the cardiac allograft (Fig-ure 1). In severe cases, the granulocytes alsoparticipate in the rejection process. Characterizingsub-types of lymphocytes in cardiac biopsy tissue hasshown no reproducible correlation between the typeof cell that in ltrates the graft and the severity of rejection or the presence of humoral rejection.Although B cells also are found in these allografts,they do not correlate with the degree of rejection. 28 However, some studies report good correlation be-tween the presence of CD8 /H11001T-cells and rejection grade. 29The discrepancy in these studies may relate to the fact that the immune response to the allograftis a continuous process in flux, which is usually dissected in small \"time-lapsed \"views for pathologic study. Furthermore, if lymphocyte phenotypes arefurther sub-classi ed by the presence of naive cells (CD45RA) and memory cells (CD45RO), naivecells are more abundant in biopsy tissue during mildas opposed to moderate rejection. 30Immunohisto - chemical studies indicate that macrophages are thepredominant cell in ltrating some allografts. 31Al- though HLA molecules are a major anti-genic targetof lymphocytes in cellular rejection, 32HLA Class I and Class II antigens express readily in any in flam- matory condition, ranging from myocarditis to re-jection. Unlike the good correlation found in sero-logic studies of HLA mismatches between donorand recipient and subsequent development of rejec-tion, 32detection of HLA molecules in tissue sec - tions does not have a predictive value per se. Detecting cytokine expression in tissue shows that interleukin (IL)-2 is prominent in cases of severe rejection, whereas IL-6 or interferon-gamma areexpressed only mildly. 33Endothelial antigens are expressedin the microcirculation of the graft; expression isconned to areas where there is brin deposition, macrophages and neutrophils. 34In a recent study, several cytokines were localized by combining thedetection of mRNA using in situ hybridization andthe detection of the protein product using immuno-histochemistry in heart biopsies. 35In biopsies with rejection Grade 3A 3B, expression IL-5, and tumor necrosisfactor /H9251(TNF-/H9251) was weak and was detected in lymphocytes. In biopsy specimens with lower gradesof rejection, mRNA IL-2, IL-3, and IL-10 were detectedin biopsy specimens with expressed IL-6, IL-8, and IFN- /H9251.I n biopsy specimens with lesser grades of rejection,weaker expression of these cytokines was observed.The level of IL-12 expression was equal in all biopsies,and IL-4 was barely detected in any biopsy. Interleu-kin-3, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 were detected macrophages. Thus the authors concludedthat T-helper cell cytokine production and other intra-graft elements regulate cardiac allograft rejection. 35 Among the adhesion molecules, expression of inter-cellular molecule 1 33,36 -40and upcoming rejection, whereas vascular adhesion molecule 138,42is a some - what better marker in evaluating the effect of therapyin an acute episode of rejection. 38 Grading Acute Cellular Rejection Through the years, several methods have been pro-posed to assess the histologic grade of rejection.These now have historic interest and will not bereviewed here. The grades proposed in the ISHLT-WF90 1are based primarily on the amount of in flam- matory in ltrate and the presence of myocyte dam- age; the pattern of in flammatory in ltration plays a minor role. Discussion of Acute Cellular Rejection at Banff The working group agreed that in light of 10 years ofcumulative experience since its publication, revisit-8Rodriguez The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation January 2003 Page 166ing the ISHLT-WF was a necessary and worthy effort. However, there was strong consensus thatany changes in the formulation should re flect cur- rent pathologic practice and should not affect thegrading of historical samples. In other words, theissue was not one of changing current ISHLT grad-ing scales, but of more clearly de ning how expert cardiac pathologists currently interpret theISHLT-WF (Table II). Confusion has arisen from the use of the term myocyte damage and myocyte necrosis as a required feature in several grades of cellular rejection. Themost dif cult issue in interpreting endomyocardial biopsy specimens from human allografts has beenthe inability to obtain consensus about the de nition ofmyocyte damage , even among experienced pathol- ogists trained in and dedicated to cardiovascularpathology. The morphologic spectrum of myocyteinjury seen in the myocardium is wide. With lightmicroscopic examination, subtle changes are dif - cult to see by the occasional observer. Simplechanges in the myocytes, such as vacuolization,hydropic change, or whereas coagulation necrosis, myocytolysis, and nuclear py-knosis indicate more severe injury. Thus, the termdamage is ambiguous. Without clear coagulative ne- crosis or fragmentation of the sarcoplasm or typicalnuclear changes such as pyknosis in the myocytes,identifying damaged cells in paraf n sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin is a subjectivematter. Ultrastructural studies show myocyte damage is present. 45Myocyte degen - eration is easily distinguished from necrosis. Dam- age to endothelial cells, basal lamina, or othercomponents also is recognized easily. 46Myocyte necrosis as de ned by ultrastructural criteria is common in humoral rejection, whereas myocytedegeneration (with the potential for recovery) is more common in cellular rejection.47Some of the myocyte damage seen during rejection may actuallybe reversible; 45,48however, with light microscopy, some of the myocyte changes that represent sub-lethal damage are indistinguishable from actualearly necrosis. The working group suggested replacing terms damage and necrosis with the encompassing term injury and that this later term should be clearly dened in the text and illustrations of the ISHLT- WF, if it is revised. The term injury would encom- pass several types of myocardial alteration including1 or more of the following: myocyte encroachment,architectural distortion, and dropout, as well asreversible and irreversible cell injury. In addition,the working group con rmed that actual necrosis was rare and that architectural changes were thehallmarks used to de ne Grades 2 and greater. Myocyte necrosis vs myocyte injury was particularlysigni cant in pediatric biopsy specimens. The pathologic terms used on the grades listed in Table II should be clearly de ned in the text of any attempted modi cation of the ISHLT-WF90. By implication, it is worthwhile to point out that Grade2 cellular rejection should be retained. The workinggroup agreed to preserve Grade 2 because 1) it isstill used in transplant centers to make therapeuticdecisions; 2) it is part of many databases of prospec-tive information on the outcomes of transplantedpatients; 3) it is still used as a standard in someclinical trials. (This particular issue also was relevantat the \"Endpoints \"conference in November 2001, because Grade 2, or the transition from Grade 2 to Grade 3A, is an endpoint frequently used in clinicaltrials). In some transplant centers, Grade 2 is nolonger used as a discrete de ning point to make therapeutic decisions. The fact that observers canTABLE II Denition of acute cellular rejection at Banff Use the term injury to include 1 or more of the following: myocyte encroachment, architectural distortion and dropout, as well as reversible and irreversible cell injury. Substituting the term aggressive inltrates with dense inltrates may be more appropriate. In this context, the wording for the grades of cellular rejection would read Grade 0 \u2014no evidence of cellular rejection Grade 1A \u2014focal perivascular in ltrate without \u2014multifocal or diffuse sparse in ltrate without myocyte injury Grade 2 \u2014single focus of dense inltrate with myocyte injury Grade with injury 4 \u2014diffuse and extensive polymorphous in ltrate with myocyte injury ; may have hemorrhage, edema, and microvascular injuryThe Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation Rodriguez 9 Volume 22, Number 1 Page 167confuse Grade 2 rejection with Quilty type B lesions is a problem that the working grouprecognizes; however, practical solutions includeattention to histologic detail (vascularity, bro- sis); using many levels of sectioning; and usingimmunohistochemical stains that can, in mostinstances, allow the pathologist to distinguishbetween these two lesions. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR THE BIOPSY REPORT The ISHLT-WF90 suggests additional items be re- corded during interpretation of endomyocardial bi-opsy specimens. Inadequate Biopsy This term should be used when the specimen con-sists of/H113494 pieces 1, and when myocardia present in 1 or more of these pieces is /H1102150% of the piece. However, in some instances, valuable information(such as rejection) is present in the other (adequate)biopsy pieces, and although a diagnosis of rejectioncannot be rendered, the ndings can be documented in the report as part of the histologic description oras a note. Ischemic Damage The presence of ischemic damage should be docu-mented. Such foci may persist for several weeks,perhaps because of delayed in flammatory response secondary to immunosuppression. 49 Quilty Effect or Endocardial Lymphocytic Inltrates The ISHLT-WF90 describes this phenomenon andrecommends that its presence or absence be re-corded. But the ISHLT-WF90 does lesions,43are collections of T and B cells with histiocytes52,53seen in the endocardium of transplanted hearts. Plasma cells are present inabout 50% of these in ltrates. Occasional eosino- phils and neutrophils may be seen. 53Capillaries with red blood cells and sometimes prominent endothe-lial cells are seen within the in ltrate. They vary in size from 0.007 to 1.89 mm 2.43Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis ofthese in ltrates, including the use of cyclosporine, 52 concomitant infection with Epstein-Barr virus,54low local levels of cyclosporine in the areas of endocar-dium where Quilty effect in ltrates develop, 55and idiosyncratic responses to cyclosporine,50but none has been proven. However, Quilty effect does notoccur in the hearts of patients receiving cyclosporinetherapy for other organ transplants (i.e., liver, kid-ney). 56The Quilty lesion seems to be a phenomenon that occurs only in the endocardium of cardiacallografts. Quilty effect in ltrates may or may not be found concomitantly with cellular rejection in the myocar-dial interstitium. The size of the Quilty in ltrates varies greatly. Two morphologic patterns are recog-nized, Type A and Type B. Type A is con ned to the endocardium. Type B, also known as invasiveQuilty, is present \"if the Quilty effect encroaches into the myocardium from the endocardium. \" 1 Quilty Effect vs Moderate Rejection Some articles discuss the possible confusion ofQuilty Type B in ltrates with Grade 2 (focal mod- erate) rejection. 35This is a problem for pathologists because of the obvious implications for therapy.Quilty Type B in ltrates can extend deep into the subjacent myocardium. One may imagine how atangential section through the deeper (myocardial)end of a biopsy may show in flammatory in ltrates that look like rejection if only a few levels of sectionare examined. However if deeper sections are exam-ined, or better yet, if all the biopsy tissue is exam-ined, it would become obvious that the in flamma- tory in ltrate in the myocardium is connected to a Quilty type lesion in the endocardium, thus, repre-senting Quilty Type B in ltrate. This type of artifact has prompted some observers to question whetherGrade 2 cellular rejection exists. 57Furthermore, moderate rejection evolves from mild rejection as-sociated with graft dysfunction. 58Thus, the fact that another pathologic lesion can mimic Grade 2 shouldnever become the reason to deny the existence ofGrade 2 itself. A possible solution to this problem isto section and examine all the tissue available. Thus,a possible focus of Grade 2 rejection can easily betracked down through all the subsequent levels ofthat particular biopsy piece. In almost every in-stance, we can clearly establish whether the mono-nuclear in flammation in question is part of an endocardial Quilty Type B in ltrate that has pene- trated deep into the myocardium or is Grade 2rejection. Very rarely do we have inconclusive re-sults with this approach. Another solution to thisproblem is to stain the biopsy with antibodies toRANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cellexpressed and secreted). This is helpful in differen-tiating cellular rejection from Quilty B lesions be-cause the RANTES-positive cells are more abun-dant in rejection. 5910 Rodriguez The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation January 2003 Page 168Quilty Effect vs Lymphoid Neoplasms Lymphoid neoplasms occur in 4% to 13% of transplanted patients. A role for Epstein-Barr virusin the pathogenesis of post-transplant lymphoprolif-erative disorders has been most these neoplasms are monoclonal B-cell type,65and their clinical presen - tation involves the lymph nodes, the central nervoussystem, the systemic organs, or the transplantedorgan itself. 60T-cell lymphomas also occur,65,66but primary cardiac presentation of neoplasms common. 60Development of multiple myeloma is rare.67 Early Peri-operative Necrosis vs Ischemic Changes Early peri-operative necrosis may be caused byevents that affect the donor, such as catecholaminedischarge, pressor therapy given during acute care,severe donor trauma, re-implantation orearly post-operative damage. 49A biopsy specimen of the septum taken at the time of implantation isinformative, although changes can be subtle. TheISHLT-WF90 makes a distinction in allograft mon-itoring between ischemia, commonly seen up to 3weeks after transplantation and representing peri-operative injury, and late ischemia, which occursafter 3 months. Morphologic evidence shows myo-cyte necrosis, evensome karyorrhexis. necrosis in ltrate; myo- cyte vacuolization may be seen. Immunosuppressionmay delay healing. 49Although this type of necrosis can be silent clinically, if severe, these changes cancompromise the function of the graft in variousdegrees. Another possibility in hearts damaged dur-ing the peritransplant period is the development ofinterstitial brosis. 68The size of the actual myocar - dial piece also may in fluence perception of the amount of brosis present.69 Allograft Vasculopathy and Biopsy Specimens Although small arteries with vasculopa-thy may be seen in endomyocardial biopsy speci-mens, no consistent correlation exists with the ana-tomic or functional status of epicardial coronaryarteries. 70Despite this lack of correlation, the pres - ence of vasculopathy in the biopsy specimen shouldbe recorded in the nal report. Furthermore, the signi cance of \"vasculocentric \"inflammatory in l- trates seen in biopsy specimens and their possiblecorrelation with the development of vasculopathy must be studied. PERSPECTIVES FOR THE FUTURE New Technologies Modern pathology practice requires the use and application of a number of technological advancesfor everyday diagnostic work. Clearly, moleculardiagnostics are common practice in other sub-spe-cialties of pathology. The application of such tech-nology to diagnostic evaluation of endomyocardialbiopsy specimens should not be overlooked. Thepace of knowledge transfer from the research envi-ronment to the diagnostic environment has in-creased. Any classi cation of allograft rejection should set guidelines for the use of such technolog-ical advances. For example, careful understandingof the polymorphisms that modulate the interactionof chemokines and cytokines during rejection will beuseful to optimize individual patient immunosup-pressive therapy. However, discussion of speci c molecular markers is beyond the scope of thisreview. If necessary, a revised working formulationshould take this into account, and we should planahead to schedule updates at intervals of 2 to 5years. With regard to changes in the epicardial coronary arteries, molecular markers may be detected in thesmaller intramural arterioles that are commonlysampled in endomyocardial biopsies. Understandingand interpreting such changes should be performedin a uniform manner. We are in the midst of rapidadvances in genomics and proteomics, and theseadvances are being applied to patient care in re-search centers. We must strive to identify pathologicmarkers that predict the development of vasculopa-thy, whether or not they are present in the endo-myocardial biopsy specimen. Any modi ed or new working formulation to evaluate cardiac allograftpathology should address these issues in a way thatallows pathologists to provide useful information toclinicians. Databases of Pathologic Findings At Banff, the working group made a very importantsuggestion: reminding pathologists that the informa-tion a pathologist generates can seldom be retrievedfrom a report that contains only the ISHLT-WFrejection grade in the diagnosis. Because pathologypractice varies from place to place, it would beuseful if the Working Formulation provided guide-lines on how to generate a report easily translatedinto database terms. Otherwise, subtle pathologicThe Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation Rodriguez 11 Volume 22, Number 1 Page 169features eventually found to correlate with outcome may not be retrievable. The ISHLT should notdictate local practices, but should encourage pathol-ogists to make their important observations \"retriev- able\"by electronic queries. In summary, this review presents a synopsis of cardiac transplantation pathology, mainly from thestandpoint of clinical assessment and patient fol-low-up with endomyocardial biopsy specimen mon-itoring. The basic lesions characterized 2 decadesago are still the gold standard for de ning mild, moderate, and severe rejection. Revisiting theISHLT-WF from 1990 at Banff 2001 showed thatknowledge has evolved from this fundamental basein an organized manner. However, this workingformulation has not been formally revised in morethan 10 years and does not incorporate the experi-ence accumulated by pathologists around the world.Furthermore, the technology for studying patho-logic specimens has advanced tremendously in thepast decade. Many of these advances can be appliedto clinical specimens, and most others can andshould be used in research protocols. Using some ofthese technologies can establish more accurate di-agnosis and can guide therapy. Moreover, patho-logic ndings are used as surrogate end-points in assessing the effectiveness of therapy. Correlationand interpretation of genomic information fromdonors and recipients can bring to light interactionsbetween the donor and recipient that could not beaddressed before. Individualized therapy can beimproved. 71,72Targeting therapy to the cellular or humoral response may reduce or prevent progres-sion of vasculopathy. 73The great potential in apply - ing the best of our current technology depends onthe accuracy and the thoroughness of our pathologicevaluation of these biopsy specimens. Finally, the conclusions from this Banff cardiac working group represent observations of morethan 100,000 heart transplant biopsy specimensand thus are not anecdotal. The consensus con-clusions described above are on target. Should the ISHLT council call for a formal update of the1990 working formulation, the vision of the orga-nizers of the Sixth Banff Conference on AllograftPathology to sponsor a session on cardiac allo-graft pathology at the 2001 and the upcomingSeventh Banff Conference in 2003 should beacknowledged. The author thanks every member of the working group at Banff for their input during the sessions and also thanksDrs. William M. Baldwin III, Lorraine C. Racusen, Car-mela D. Tan, and James K. Kirklin for their for insightful comments during the writing of this manuscript. REFERENCES 1. Billingham ME, Cary NR, Hammond ME, et al.

[FRAMES] [NO FRAMES] Mallory, MDi Contributors Corris, Ramona Jonathan Waltz, Martin obliterans (BO) is a major cause of allograft dysfunction in lung and heart lung trans-plant recipients. 1,2Clinically, progressive airflow limitation develops because of small airway obstruc-tion. The disease has a variable course. Some pa-tients experience rapid loss of lung function andrespiratory failure. Others experience either slowprogression or intermittent loss of function withlong plateaus during which pulmonary function isstable. Histologic conrmation is difcult becausetransbronchial biopsy specimens often are not suf-ciently sensitive for diagnosis. Because BO is dif-cult to document histologically, in 1993 a committeesponsored by the International Society for Heartand Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) proposed aclinical description of BO, termed bronchiolitis ob- literans syndrome (BOS) and dened by pulmonary function changes rather than histology. Althoughthis system does not require histologic diagnosis, it does recognize it. 3 Transplant centers worldwide have adopted the BOS system as a descriptor of lung allograft dys-function. This allows centers to use a commonlanguage to compare program results. In the yearssince publication of the BOS system, transplantscientists have studied basic and clinical aspects oflung transplant BO. In this document, we updateand summarize new information obtained from thisresearch and incorporate, where appropriate, theresults into the BOS criteria. The document will include the following topics: (1) criteria for BOS, (2) BOS considerations inpediatric patients, (3) risk factors for BOS, (4)pathology of BO, (5) surrogate markers for BOS, (6)confounding factors in making a BOS diagnosis, and(7) assessment of response to treatment of BOS. CRITERIA FOR BOS Background When the original denition of BOS was formulated in 1993, the working group had several goals. Thegroup aimed to provide a classication system forairway disease after lung transplantation that didnot rely on histopathologic ndings, was sensitiveand specic, relied on diagnostic techniques avail-able to all lung transplant physicians, and wasrelatively simple to understand and apply.

For each lung transplant recipient, a stable post-transplant baseline FEV 1is de ned as BOS Stage 0. In patients who experience a decrease in FEV1, progressive stages of BOS, from 1 to 3, are de ned according to the magnitude of the decrease. Anadditional notation can re flect histologic ndings: \"a\"designates that no BO has been identi ed, or that no biopsy has been done; and \"b\"designates that BO has been identi ed. 3 Although the ISHLT classi cation system for BOS has gained universal acceptance, several limi-tations have been identi ed. First, the current grad- ing system \u2014which de nes BOS 1 as a /H1102220% de- crease in FEV 1from baseline \u2014was not sensitive enough to pick up early, small, but potentiallyimportant changes in pulmonary function. 4-6In addition, the mid-expiratory flow rate (FEF25-75) was not used for de ning air flow obstruction be- cause the wider intrasubject variability of this index,in particular in recipients of unilateral transplants, 7 and the very high values observed in some patientsearly after surgery were considered as potentiallimitations. Yet several reports in recipients ofbilateral and heart -lung grafts have shown that FEF 25-75is more sensitive than FEV1for early detection of air flow obstruction in BOS4-6(one study also included recipients of single lung trans-plants but results in these patients were not reportedspeci cally 8). These observations have led to a crit - ical re-examination of the BOS criteria, and formu-lation of the revised classi cation system as detailed in this document. Recommendations 1. De nition of BOS: We use the term bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome to connote graft deteriora- tion secondary to persistent air flow obstruction (however, note that not all patients in whomairflow obstruction develops have BOS \u2014see con- founding conditions discussed below). It is widely presumed, but unproved, that chronic rejectionoften contributes to functional deterioration.BOS does not necessarily require histologic con-rmation; in contrast, the term bronchiolitis ob- literans is used for a histologically De nition of equipment: Spirometric measure- ments must be made with equipment that con-forms to the American Thoracic Society stan-dards for spirometric testing. 93. De nition of baseline: The baseline value ,t o which subsequent measures are referred, is de- ned as the average of the 2 highest (not neces- sarily consecutive) measurements obtained atleast 3 weeks apart, such measurements beingmade without the use of an inhaled bronchodila-tor preceding the study. The baseline date is dened as the date of the rst measurement used to compute the baseline. The values used tocompute the baselines for FEV 1and for FEF25-75 may be obtained on different days. Becausespirometric values may increase with post-opera-tive time, the baseline should be recalculatedusing the highest values achieved. The de nition of baseline, and hence of BOS stages, is expectedto be more accurate as more functional tests areperformed. 4. De nition of confounding conditions: Patients are evaluated under this system only after evalu-ation of other conditions that may alter graftfunction and after treatment of these conditionsif found. Interpretation of changes in lung func-tion should take into account confounding con-ditions, which are discussed below. 5. De nition of variables: In the original staging system, a /H1135020% decrease in FEV 1from previous baseline was used to diagnosis BOS. Studies ofintrasubject variability of spirometry in lungtransplant recipients indicate that using a 10% to15% decrease in FEV 1may be more appropriate for early detection of BOS.5-7In addition, evi - dence suggests that FEF25-75deteriorates before FEV1in most bilateral and heart -lung transplant recipients with BOS.4-6Therefore, a potential- BOS stage (BOS 0-p), de ned by a 10% to 19% decrease in FEV1and/or by a /H1135025% decrease in FEF25-75from baseline is added to the original staging system. This potential-BOS stage alertsthe physician to the need for close functionalmonitoring and in-depth assessment, which mightinclude surrogate markers for BOS (see below). 6. De nition of BOS stages: For the purpose of staging, a signi cant decrease in FEV 1or FEF25-75will be determined by the average of 2 measurements made at least 3 weeks apart, with-out patient use of an inhaled bronchodilator.Patients having a single measurement of de-creased FEV 1or FEF25-75are not evaluated until a second measurement is obtained at least 3weeks after the initial data point. Because BOS ismeant to represent a persistent alteration in lungfunction, additional values of FEV 1or FEF25-75, which may be obtained during this 3-week period,298 Estenne et al. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation March 2002 Page 193should also show a signi cant decrease from baseline value. The date at which a patient enters the new BOS stage is the date of the rst of the 2 measurements used to con rm the stage. In case of a concomitant decrease in vital capacity(VC) and FEV 1, a restrictive ventilatory defect should be excluded before categorizing the pa-tient in a new BOS stage (see confounding con-ditions discussed below). 7. De nition of functional decline: Because a uni- versal table for converting the absolute value ofFEV 1and FEF25-75to\"percent predicted \"does not exist, a fractional decrease in FEV1and FEF25-75should be determined from absolute values. The fractional decrease in FEV1and FEF25-75shall be expressed as the percent of decrease from the previously established base-line, i.e., the highest previous baseline value isused for all subsequent calculations. 8. De nition of staging system: A proposed staging system is outlined in Table I. Within each of thestaging categories is an \"a\"and a \"b\"sub- category. These relate to histologic ndings of biopsy specimens. This staging system is intendedto describe the recipient 's current status. Al- though BOS is considered irreversible, a minorityof patients may show improvement in lung func-tion over time. When a patient experiences suchimprovement in BOS stage, the worst stage thatthe patient has ever achieved may be noted inparentheses, if desired for study purposes. There-fore, BOS 1(2) will indicate a patient currently inBOS 1 who has been in BOS 2 at some point inthe past. BOS CONSIDERATIONS IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS Background Approximately 2.5% of lung transplant candidates are/H1134917 years of age. In terms of the number oftransplants, number of patients on the waiting list, and number of active centers, pediatric lung trans-plantation lags behind adult lung transplantationand other pediatric solid-organ transplantation.Published reports indicate an incidence of BOsimilar to that of adults, 10-12except in children /H110213 years old, in whom it may be lower.10 Airway inspection is particularly important in children to assess for stenosis and/or malacia at theanastomotic site. In general, the BOS criteria can beused in children who can perform pulmonary func-tion tests reproducibly (usually at least 5 years ofage). However, in de ning functional decline, a decrease in percent predicted rather than a changein absolute value (see 7 above) should be used. Theuse of percent predicted values for FEV 1and FEF25-75should be a more accurate indicator in children because absolute values of lung functionshould increase with the child 's growth. In older children who can perform reproducible respiratorymaneuvers, the adult criteria with the use of pre-dicted values should be easily applied. Because ofthe dif culty in performing pulmonary function studies in some pediatric patients, surrogate mark- ers for BOS may assume more importance. Infantsand young children require lung function testing byother techniques, most commonly through the rapidcompression technique. The combined use of forcedexpiratory flow at functional residual capacity, nor- malized by the measured functional residual capac-ity, is a useful technique to separate anastomoticcomplications from peripheral air flow obstruction. Techniques for lung function testing in infants andyoung toddlers provide tools for performing seriallung function testing in lung transplant recipients ofthis age. 13,14Experience with such techniques is limited to 1 pediatric lung transplant center,15and further clinical research with newer techniques isclearly indicated.TABLE I Original and proposed classi cations of BOS Original classication Current proposition BOS 0 FEV180% or more of baseline BOS 0 FEV1/H1102290% of baseline and FEF25-75/H1102275% of baseline BOS 0-p FEV181% to 90% of baseline and/or FEF25-75/H1134975% of baseline BOS 1 FEV166% to 80% of baseline BOS 1 FEV166% to 80% of baseline BOS 2 FEV151% to 65% of baseline BOS 2 FEV151% to 65% of baseline BOS 3 FEV150% or less of baseline BOS 3 FEV150% or less of baseline BOS, 1 second.The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation Estenne et al. 299 Volume 21, Number 3 Page 194Recommendations 1. Pediatric patients suspected of having BO should undergo bronchoscopic examination of the air- ways and transbronchial biopsy when possible.On occasion in young patients or in those withobscuring clinical or large airway pathology, anopen lung biopsy to assess for histopathology mayfacilitate early therapeutic intervention. 2. In general, the criteria for BOS can be applied in children who can complete pulmonary functiontests satisfactorily. However, declines in functionshould be expressed in terms of percent predictedinstead of absolute values because of lung andairway growth. Newer techniques facilitate mea-surements in infants and have been used to assessfor BOS. RISK FACTORS FOR BOS Background Many factors have been reported as risk factors for BOS. However, quality of data is often a problembecause almost all existing information derives fromretrospective studies with no control groups andreflects the experience of single centers. Numbers are small and often dif cult to interpret. In some cases, risk factors seem to have been more impor-tant in the earlier years of lung transplantation, e.g.,cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This may re flect a change in the risk environment because of the useof prophylactic antimicrobial regimens, changingimmunosuppressive approaches, or the increasingexperience management teams. Alloimmunologic injury directed against endothe- lial and epithelial structures have been thought tomediate BOS, but non-alloimmunologic in flamma- tory conditions including viral infections or ischemicinjury may also play a role. Risk factors reported inthe literature will be designated as (1) probable riskfactors, (2) potential risk factors in need of furtheranalysis, and (3) hypothetic risk factors. Probable Risk Factors Acute rejection and lymphocytic bronchitis/bronchi-olitis belong to this category. Six separate publica-tions document the increased incidence of BOS inpatients with acute rejection episodes, especiallywhen multiple and/or long-lasting and/or high-gradeepisodes occur. 16-21Two additional publications document the role of late acute rejection in thedevelopment of BOS. 22,23Five publications report that lymphocytic bronchitis/bronchiolitis is a riskfactor for BOS, when infection has been excluded asa cause of an in flammatory airway process. 18,20,24 -26 Medication non-compliance is a known risk factor for rejection and graft loss after kidney, heart, andliver transplantation. 27-30Medication non-compli - ance also is perceived as a risk factor after lungtransplantation, although results supporting this have not been published. Cytomegalovirus is dif cult to interpret as a risk factor for 2 main reasons: the pattern of CMV haschanged with the widespread use of prophylacticstrategies directed against the virus and with varyingdenitions of infection, disease, and pneumonitis among institutions. Eight reports consider CMV arisk factor for BOS, 16,19,22,25,31 -34whereas 4 other studies reported no impact of the virus.18,20,21,35 Four other studies document a decreased risk ofCMV in the development BOS \u2014either decreased incidence or delay in onset \u2014after the use of CMV prophylaxis. 17,36 -38However, data pre- prophylaxis CMV pneumonitis wasmore prevalent strongly correlates pneumonitis as aBOS risk factor. Potential Risk Factors Potential risk factors are so designated because ofconflicting data, suggestive but not de nitive data, or differences in de nitions of the speci c risk factor between centers so that available data cannot beinterpreted. These factors include (1) organizingpneumonia; (2) bacterial, fungal, and non-CMVviral infection; (3) older donor age; (4) time; and (5) donor antigen-speci c reac- tivity. Two centers report that organizing pneumonia is a risk factor for BOS. One of these centers reportedthat it was a univariate risk factor for BOS. The dataare from small numbers and not complete enough todesignate it a probable risk. 18,19 A surprisingly small body of data has been pub- lished that report the impact of bacterial, fungal,and non-CMV viral infections. One center reportedbacterial and P carinii pneumonia as risks during theperiod before broad-spectrum prophylaxis in lungtransplantation. 17In a more recent report, bacterial or fungal pneumonia was not associated as anunivariate risk with an increased rate of BOS, butdid increase the acute rejection score in a multivar-iate model. 18A peak incidence of BOS onset in the respiratory virus season suggested to one set ofauthors that common respiratory viral infectionsmay trigger the complication. 39Treatment of respi -300 Estenne et al. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation March 2002 Page 195ratory syncytial and parain fluenza viruses decreased the incidence of BOS in one center.40 Donor age did not correlate with BOS in a large population in the United Kingdom; however, the ISHLT 2000 Registry identi ed donor age as a risk factor.19,41The Registry identi ed graft ischemic time as a second donor risk factor, a nding also differing from the ndings of the UK study. Persistent donor antigen-speci c reactivity has reportedly led to increased rates of BOS, and con- versely, donor-speci c hyporeactivity was reported as protective.42,43Preliminary experience from the Pittsburgh Transplant Group has shown that theinfusion of donor bone marrow in combination withlung transplantation increases donor cell chimerismand donor antigen-speci c hyporeactivity, and is associated with a lower incidence of BOS. 44 Hypothetic Risk Factors Hypothetic risk factors include factors supported bytheoretical considerations but having scanty clinicalevidence to date. These factors include (1) underly-ing disease, (2) genotype of the recipient for certaincytokine gene polymorphisms, (3) HLA-mismatch-ing, and (4) gastroesophageal re flux with aspiration. Two studies suggested that underlying diagnosis is a risk factor and that patients with pulmonaryhypertension may be more at risk of BOS; in a thirdstudy, this was not the case. 17,25,33The ISHLT 2000 Registry identi es emphysema patients as having the best survivals but does not identify freedomfrom BOS as the reason. 41 Data are emerging on the potential role for genotypic susceptibility to development of BOS.Cytokine gene polymorphisms of play a role. 45Available data are scant and conflicting.46 Data also con flict on HLA mismatching, with most series showing no association.17,18,20One insti - tution has documented an increased risk of BOSwith the development of anti-HLA Class I antibod-ies. 47Confusion in this area arises in part from the small number of transplantations performed in in-dividual centers and because no attempt at HLAmatching is made. Therefore, it is uncommon forany center to have more than a few HLA-matchedrecipients. In the largest study yet reported thatinvolves HLA matching, 3,549 lung transplantationswere reviewed using the United Network for OrganSharing (UNOS)/ISHLT Registry database. Only164 patients had 2 or fewer mismatches. No signif-icant association could be found between HLA mismatching and BOS development. 48 Case reports and small series have suggested an incremental risk from gastroesophageal re flux dis- ease with aspiration and from impaired mucociliaryclearance. 49-52 Several additional factors, including history of smoking or asthma in the donor, head injury ascause of death, airway ischemia, and diffuse alveolardamage (reperfusion injury), have been proposed asrisk factors for late organ dysfunction. However,convincing data to support the role of these factorsare lacking. 20,53 -56 A differential in the prevalence of BOS among unilateral, bilateral, and heart -lung grafts has not been documented. Recommendations 1. Many factors have been reported as potential risk factors for BOS, but proven causal relationshipsare dif cult to establish. 2. Based on available information, Table II summa- rizes the probable, potential, and hypothetic riskfactors. PATHOLOGY OF BO Background Bronchiolitis obliterans is a cicatricial process that affects the small airways of the allograft lung. Con-ceptually, BO is thought to result from chronic lungrejection, although not exclusively. It progressesthrough a sequence of lymphohistiocytic-mediatedTABLE II Risk factors for BOS Probable risk factors: Acute rejection Lymphocytic bronchitis/bronchiolitisCMV factors aspiration BOS, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome; CMV, cytomegalovirus.The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation Estenne et al. 301 Volume 21, Number 3 Page 196cytotoxicity directed at the respiratory epithelium. The initial process is a lymphocytic in ltrate of the sub-mucosa of the airways with migration of lym-phocytes through the basement membrane into theepithelium. 57At this site, epithelial cell necrosis occurs with denudation of mucosa. A secondarycascade of non-speci ci nflammatory cytokines other including neutrophils.The reaction stimulates migration of broblasts and myobroblasts into the exudate. Formation of an intraluminal bromyxoid granulation tissue polyp results. In some may dissolve the polyp. The diagnosticbrous scarring can be eccentric with formation of a brous plaque in the wall of the airway; concentric with the interposition of a \"donut \"of collagen tissue; or the granulation tissue may completelyobliterate the lumen of the airway, reducing the airpassages to stenotic cords of scar tissue ( \"vanishing airways disease \"). 58At the time of histologic diag - nosis, the airway injury may be temporally hetero-geneous with some airways showing only cellularinltrates, some displaying active broplasia, and others demonstrating inactive brosis. Bronchoscopy may exclude other causes of dete- riorating lung function, but diagnosing BO withtransbronchial biopsy specimens may be extremelydifcult. It requires multiple, large fragments, and even then, diagnostic lesions may be missed.Trichrome and elastic tissue stains may assist inrecognizing the damaged or obliterated airway.When the clinical diagnosis is unclear and trans-bronchial biopsy specimens have not offered anunequivocal answer, open lung biopsy may be nec-essary. The initial document describing BOS used an \"a\" sub-category to designate no pathologic evidence ofBO (or no pathologic material for evaluation) and a\"b\"sub-category to mean that pathologic evidence of BO was obtained. The usefulness of these desig-nations has not yet been validated. Recommendations 1. Histologic activity may not re flect the clinical activity monitored by pulmonary function tests. 2. The term bronchiolitis obliterans should be used only when histology demonstrates dense brous scar tissue affecting the small airways. 3. The presence of only lymphocytic sub-mucosal inltrate or intraluminal granulation tissue is not a diagnosis of BO.4. If the obliterative lesion is associated with a mononuclear in ltrate, it is de ned as active; brosis without in flammatory cells is de ned as inactive. 5. An \"a\"sub-category designates no pathologic evidence of BO (or no pathologic material for evaluation). A \"b\"sub-category means that pathologic evidence of BO has been obtained. SURROGATE MARKERS FOR BOS Background The diagnostic criteria for BOS are based on a decrease in lung function. Various indirect measuresor analyses have been undertaken to identify alter-native early markers of a decrease in graft perfor-mance. Perhaps these markers can provide a surro-gate means of predicting disease or of monitoringdisease activity, with the aim of enabling earlytherapy to block a relentless decrease in lung func-tion. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis A number of cross-sectional studies 59-64and 3 prospective studies7,60,64indicate an association be - tween BOS and BAL neutrophilia, and they indicatethat this alteration may actually precede the 20%decrease in FEV 1required for the spirometric diag - nosis of BOS.7,60,64In addition, a persistent increase in BAL neutrophilia is an independent predictor ofmortality after lung transplantation. 65Other prelim - inary studies implicate various BAL markers ormediators in the pathogenesis of BOS (e.g., IL-8,markers of oxidative factor-1). Althoughthese markers may provide useful concepts forexploring the mechanisms behind development ofchronic allograft rejection, they are not yet suf - ciently robust tests to contribute to the clinicaldiagnosis of BOS. Exhaled nitric oxide Exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) provides a potentiallyuseful tool in diagnosing acute and chronic allograftrejection in lung transplant recipients. Several lungtransplant centers have evaluated eNO and found itto be reproducible, repeatable, and re flective of NO levels in the lower airways. 66,67The source of eNO in allograft pathology remains to be identi ed, but potential sources include epithelial cells and in l- trating leukocytes;67-69eNO has a close link with BAL neutrophilia.67A cross-sectional study of 104 lung transplant recipients noted elevated eNO in302 Estenne et al. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation March 2002 Page 197lymphocytic bronchitis and BOS Stage 1 but not in BOS Stages 2 and 3.70Other studies have reported a variable association between increased eNO andBOS. 71,72 Air trapping shown on expiratory computerizedtomography scansImaging is a potentially simple and repeatablemeans of assessing BOS. High-resolution computer-ized tomography (CT) scanning is the most accurateimaging tool for diagnosing BOS. On inspiratoryscans, several abnormalities have been associatedwith BOS, including bronchial dilatation, bronchialwall thickening, and mosaic perfusion al-though these ndings lack sensitivity. 73-76In con - trast, the presence of air trapping on expiratory CTscans is an accurate indicator of the bronchiolarobliteration underlying BOS. 77-80In patients with BOS, the pulmonary lobules that have normal air-ways increase in density during the expiratory phase,whereas areas with diseased airways cannot emptyand remain radiolucent secondary to the obstructivebronchiolar in flammatory and brotic changes. In a recent prospective study that included 111 expira-tory CT scans in 38 heart -lung transplant recipients, the presence of air trapping /H1102232% had a 87.5% sensitivity and speci city for the diagnosis of BOS, and in some patients this preceded the spirometriccriteria for BOS. 79Conversely, having /H1102132% of air trapping had a high negative predictive value untilthe fth post-operative year. In another, smaller study, an air-trapping score provided a sensitivity of74% and a speci city of 67% for histopathologically proven OB. 80 Bronchial hyper-responsiveness.Bronchial hyper-responsiveness has been reportedin patients who have undergone lung transplanta-tion, although some studies have been negative forthisnding. 81-89In a recent longitudinal study that included 111 patients undergoing bilateral lungtransplantation, Stanbrook and Kesten 89reported that 30% of patients had a positive methacholinechallenge at 3 months after transplant and weresigni cantly more likely to have BOS; the mean time to development of BOS was 16.9 months. A retro-spective study of 94 lung transplant recipientsshowed that the presence of a bronchodilator re-sponse at low lung volume had a sensitivity of 51%,a speci city of 87%, and a positive predictive value of 81% for the diagnosis of BOS. 90This study also noted that the bronchodilator response may precedeBOS by months.Distribution of ventilation. Two recent prospective studies have shown thatindices of ventilation distribution (e.g., the alveolarplateau slope obtained for nitrogen or helium dur-ing single-breath washout) may detect BOS earlierthan do conventional pulmonary function tests. 6,7 Reynaud-Gaubert et al6considered a nitrogen slope /H110223% as abnormal, Estenne et al6consid - ered signi cant a 100% increase above baseline. Problems with and quality of data.In addition to the limitations that clinical trials inlung transplant recipients frequently encounter(small sample size, retrospective study, lack of ade-quate control group), 3 speci c limitations should be mentioned in the context of the surrogate markersfor BOS: 1. Many of the markers discussed above have been used and validated primarily in recipients of heart -lung and double-lung grafts, e.g., air trap- ping on expiratory CT and indices of ventilationdistribution. No clear effect on eNO caused bythe type of surgical procedure or the type ofdisease in the native lung has been demonstratedin transplant recipients who are stable or whohave BOS. This point deserves further study. 2. Speci city of the markers discussed here for the diagnosis of BOS is low, e.g., BAL neutrophiliamay be caused by infection, and eNO or indicesof ventilation distribution may increase in acuterejection or infection. 3. Thresholds indicating a signi cant alteration from the stable state, particularly for BAL neu-trophilia and eNO, have not been clearly estab-lished. These thresholds must be determined onthe basis of standardized baseline values 91using intrasubject coef cients of variation. Recommendations 1. BAL neutrophilia and elevated cytokine levels, eNO, air trapping on expiratory CT scans, bron-chial hyper-responsiveness, and measures of analtered distribution of ventilation have all beenidenti ed as early markers of BOS. However, none is speci c or sensitive enough to be used reliably for diagnosing BOS. 2. The presence of an abnormal level of a surrogate marker should alert the clinician to the potentialfor BOS onset.The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation Estenne et al. 303 Volume 21, Number 3 Page 198CONFOUNDING FACTORS IN DIAGNOSING BOS Background Lung function is exquisitely sensitive to complica- tions that affect the allograft, such as rejection,infection, and anastomotic complications. Thesecomplications often produce some degree of air flow obstruction and may lead to a pattern of functionaldeterioration, which is qualitatively similar to thatseen in BOS. In addition, several complications thataffect the native lung and disease progression in thenative lung may contribute to changing pulmonaryfunction. This section addresses (1) confoundingfactors in the graft that apply to all types of trans-plants, (2) confounding factors that affect the nativelung in single lung transplants, and (3) confoundingfactors that cause a restrictive ventilator defect. Factors that affect the graft. Infection and rejection: Symptoms characteristicof infection frequently herald the onset of BOS,and a community-acquired respiratory bacterial orviral infection may be documented. Similarly,some patients with recurrent or refractory acuterejection (including acute cellular rejection andlymphocytic bronchitis/bronchiolitis) progress toBOS. Therefore, the presence of infection oracute rejection, which may produce air flow ob- struction, 92does not exclude the diagnosis of BOS and may confound its early diagnosis. If the lungfunction change persists after appropriate treat-ment, the diagnosis of BOS can be made. Anastomotic complications: Complications at thesite may alterforced expiratory flows and volumes. Because these complications occur early after surgery, theyare generally recognized before the diagnosis ofBOS is suspected. Yet interpretation of functionalchanges in the presence of anastomotic complica-tions may be dif cult because it is not always easy to determine whether stenosis/malacia or the de-velopment of BOS is responsible for a decrease inlung function. The nal diagnosis is left to the discretion of the individual physician. Disease recurrence: Some primary diagnoses haverecurred in the lung graft. These include sarcoid-osis, 93-99Dis- ease recurrence may cause graft dysfunction, mayconfuse the diagnosis of BOS, or may coexist withBOS. In other cases, e.g., sarcoid, recurrent dis- ease may have little functional effect. In thecontext of recurrent disease, the diagnosis of BOSmust be made with caution unless histologic con-rmation is available. Aging: In long-term survivors, the physiologicaging process of the lung is expected to signi - cantly decrease both FEV 1and FEF25-75.H o w - ever, making rm recommendations as to how to account for this factor is not possible because therate of functional decline with age in an otherwisenormal graft remains unknown. Factors affecting the native lung. Native lung hyperin flation: Acute native lung hy- perin flation is a complication reported in patients with emphysema who receive single lung trans-plants. 100-104If acute native lung hyperin flation occurs early after surgery, it does not interferewith the diagnosis of BOS. However, inter medi- ate- and long-term, progressive hyperin flation of the emphysematous lung may be associated with graftdysfunction. 105Studies in stable recipients of single lung transplants for emphysema have shown that thetotal lung capacity of the graft is decreased to 66%to 79% of the predicted normal values. 106,107In a small sub-set of patients, hyperin flation of the native lung may worsen over time and lead to clinical andfunctional changes similar to those produced byBOS (e.g., dyspnea, worsening airways obstruction,hypoxemia, accentuated radiologic shift of the me-diastinum toward the graft, and V/Q mismatch). Inthis context, lung volume reduction or lobectomy ofthe native lung may improve lung function in se-lected individuals. 108-112The mechanisms underly - ing delayed native lung hyperin flation have not been precisely identi ed, and more importantly, no easy means exist to distinguish between this complicationand BOS. Moy et al 113suggested that measuring lung resistance during inspiration may be helpful inthis context, but further studies must validate the useof this variable. From a practical standpoint, if a patient with emphysema who has undergone singlelung transplantation has worsening air flow obstruc- tion without another speci c cause, the patient should be considered to have BOS. Disease progression in patients without emphy-sema: Disease progression in the native lung maycontribute partially to a change in overall lungfunction. However, because the native lung usu-ally makes only a minor contribution to maximalexpiratory flows and volumes, disease progression304 Estenne et al. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation March 2002 Page 199is not expected to be a frequent confounding factor for the diagnosis of BOS. Other complications: Several complications mayoccur in the native lung and affect approximately25% to 40% of the recipients. 114-117Infectious complications are more frequent, and recipientswho have emphysema seem to be at increasedrisk. However, complications affecting the nativelung are easy to identify and generally do not interfere with the diagnosis of BOS. Factors causing a restrictive ventilatory defect Several diseases may decrease static and dynamiclung volumes in recipients of lung transplants. Theseconditions include increased body mass index, 118 respiratory muscle weakness unrelated119or related to generalized neuromuscular disorders, pleural ef-fusion, rib fractures, chronic post-operative pain,and pulmonary edema. The functional impact isexpected to be a decrease in both VC and FEV 1. Therefore, in the presence of a decreased FEV1,a n unchanged FEV1/VC ratio should alert the clinician to exclude the above-mentioned conditions beforeconsidering the diagnosis of BOS. In the presence ofa concomitant decline in VC and FEV 1with an unchanged FEV1/VC ratio, the baseline for FEV1 and for FEF25-75may be reset to a lower value. Recommendations 1. Infection, acute rejection, disease recurrence, and anastomotic complications can confound thediagnosis of BOS. These diagnoses should beexcluded or treated before assigning a designa-tion of BOS. 2. Following single lung transplant for emphysema, native lung hyperin flation occasionally results in a functional and physiologic picture similar toBOS. In this setting, a precise diagnosis may beimpossible and each case should be judged on itsindividual characteristics. 3. A number of conditions can occur that cause decreases in both the VC and the FEV 1(e.g., an increase in body mass index, muscular weakness,pleural effusion, etc.) without a decrease in theFEV 1/VC ratio. Such comorbidities must be ex - cluded before assigning a diagnosis of BOS. ASSESSING BOS RESPONSE TO THERAPY Background Although the brous obliteration of the bronchioles seen in BO probably is irreversible, the histologic lesions are often heterogeneous, with some airwaysshowing in flammatory in ltrates potentially amenable to treatment. This probably explains why some pa-tients show functional stabilization or improvementwith treatment. Assessing response to therapy is dif - cult in individual patients because of the high variabil-ity of the disease response of an individual to anintervention. 9,120 -125This document proposes meth - ods of assessing populations and study purposes. Ret-rospective and non-randomized designs, small samplesize, absence of a control group, and relatively shortfollow-up have weakened published studies of treat-ment for BOS. Given the variable natural course ofBOS, an appropriate number of patients in random-ized studies with both a treated and a control arm ismandatory, and the method used to assess the re-sponse to therapy must be standardized. Designingmulticenter studies with a large number of patientsmay allow strati cation according to several factors that may affect response to therapy, e.g., BOS stage,association with acute rejection or lymphocytic bron-chiolitis, rate of functional decrease, association withinfection, time from transplantation to development ofBOS, etc. Recommendations 1. Assessing response to therapy should be based on the diagnostic criteria for BOS, i.e., FEV1. Abso - lute values of FEV1measured before and after the therapeutic intervention should be plotted overtime, and the slopes should be obtained by linearregression analysis. At least 3 measurements with anegative slope, obtained over 1 to 3 months, shouldbe used to compute the slope before treatment.This slope should be calculated using all the datapoints obtained in the 1 to 3 months before initia-tion of treatment; the rst point used should be the rst measurement below the BOS threshold. The slopes after treatment should include all data pointsobtained after initiation of treatment and for atleast a period of 6 months (see Appendix). Adecrease in the rate of functional decline afterinitiation of treatment may be coincidental (i.e., reflect the natural history of the disease) and may not re flect a therapeutic bene t. This underscores the dif culty in interpreting the response in individ- ual patients and emphasizes the need for controlgroups in prospective studies. 2. Stability may occur spontaneously after onset of BOS. This results in a flat FEV 1slope (instead of a negative slope), and assessment of therapeuticintervention is problematic. Because this courseof the disease occurs relatively frequently, pro-The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation Estenne et al. 305 Volume 21, Number 3 Page 200spective studies assessing intervention probably will require large numbers of patients and pro-longed study periods. 3. Comparisons of frequency of occurrence and progres- sion through BOS grades are appropriate end-pointsfor assessing therapy. In individuals, improvementin BOS grade is not expected or consistent with thecurrent understanding of this syndrome. FUTURE STUDIES The committee recognizes that although BOS is themost common complication leading to chronic graftdysfunction and death of lung transplant recipients, itremains poorly understood. However, the course ofdisease progression may be quite variable for individ-ual patients, suggesting a heterogeneous pathogenesis.Although lung function may decrease rapidly, leadingto respiratory failure and death in some patients, otherpatients may survive for years with either stable orslowly progressive loss of lung function. Therefore, werecommend use of this document to stimulate collec-tion of data and to underlie prospective studies thatwill lead to better understanding of and eventuallyprevention of this devastating complication. We sug-gest the following research priorities. Risk Factors 1. Collation of existing large data bases to better dene risk factors 2. Collaborative prospective collection of data in a centralized database to subsequently correlatewith development of BOS Criteria for BOS 1. Prospective collaborative studies to validate the usefulness of the new BOS 0-p stage, in particularin recipients of single lung transplants. 2. Prospective collaborative studies to evaluate sur- vival and quality of life after BOS onset at eachstage. 3. Prospective collaborative studies to de ne differ- ent courses of disease progression, risk factors fordisease progression, and time of onset. 4. Prospective collaborative studies to evaluate the relative impact on survival, quality of life, andexercise capacity in double vs single lung trans-plant recipients. Surrogate Markers 1. Prospective collaborative studies comparing sur- rogate markers with lung function and ability topredict future decreases in lung function.2. Prospective collaborative studies to establish nor- mative data and thresholds for signi cant change in markers such as BAL neutrophilia and eNO;prospective collaborative studies correlatingchanges in different surrogate markers.

Outline /g108Abstract /g108MATERIALS AND METHODS 4 /g108Table 4 5 Page 1 of 17 Ovid: Drachenber Volume y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 207Abstract Tissue samples for the diagnosis of pancreatic allograft rejection are now obtained routinely through the application of the percutaneous needle biopsy technique. The availability of biopsy material (89% adequate for diagnosis in our setting) presents a challenge for pathologists who are asked to provide a fast and accurate diagnosis of rejection and its severity, while at the same ti me being able to differentiate rejection from other causes of graft dysfunction . Methods . To differentiate rejection from othe r pathologic processes, 26 histologic features were assessed in 92 biopsies performe d for confirmation of clinical diagnosis of rejection and the results were compared wi th 31 protocol biopsies, 12 allograft pancreatectomies with non-rejection patholog y, and 30 native pancreas resections with various disease processes . Results . Based on these comparisons, a constellation of findings relating to the vascular, septal, and acinar inflammation was identified for the diagnosis of rejection. Application of these features led us to revise our scheme fo r grading rejection (ranging from 0-normal to V-severe rejection) to include the cate gories of \"inflammation of undetermined significance\" and \"minimal rejection.\" The scheme was used by five pathologist to grade 20 biopsies independently of any clinical data and the interobserver level of agreement was highly significant ([kappa]=0.83, P<0.0001). This grading scheme was applied blindly to all (183) biopsies from 77 patients with 6-52 mo nths of follow-up. The correlation of the highest degree of rejection on each patient and ultimate graft loss (0% for grades 0-I, 11.5% for grade II, 17.3% for grade III, 37.5% for grade IV, and 100% for grade V) was highly statistically significant ( P<0.002). The fraction of grafts lost due to pure immunologic causes increased proportionally to the grade of rejection (0, 50, 66, and 100% for grades II, III, IV, and V, respectively) . Conclusions . This study provides strong support for the proposed pancreas rejection grading scheme and confirms it s potential for practical use . The major cause of graft loss with pancreas transplants has been irreversible rejection (1). This finding is particularly true for pancreas after kidney (PAK *) and pancreas transplant alone (PTA) cases because the clinical diagnosis of re jection remains relatively nonspecific. When a simultaneous kidney transplant ( SPK) is performed in a uremic diabetic, the cotransplanted kidney is thought to provide a reliable indicator fo r rejection through serial determinations of the recipient's serum creatinine. Isolated pancre as rejection in combined kidney pancreas transplantation is not unusual, however (2). Parameters used for the diagnosis of pancreas rejection include decrease in urinary insulin and C peptide (3, lipase, (8, 9); and cytologic evaluation of pancreatic juice (10, 11) and urine (12, 13) . In bladder drained grafts, urinary amylase has been used as a measure of pancreas exocrine function (14-19). Other methods used for the diagnosis of pancreas rejection are 99 mTc DTPA scintigraphy (20) and uptake of indiumlabeled platelets (21). None of these modalities is suffic iently specific to be used with out the risk of occasional under- or overtreatment of rejection. The 1- year pancreas graft survival for SPK trans plants performed between 1992 and 1993 is Page 2 of 17 Ovid: Drachenber g1: Trans plantation, Volume http://gatewa y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 20881% (22). In contrast, the results of pancreas tran splants performed in patients who have had a prior successful kidney transplant (pancreas af ter kidney, PAK) or in patients who have never had uremia (PTA) lagged behind the results obtained in SPK cases, with a 1-year success rate of 61% for both PAK and PTA cases performed between 1992 and 1993 (22). The results of PAK and PTA collectively have continued to improve part icularly since the general availability of the newer immunosuppressive agents, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. The steady improvement in the success of PTA cases is in pa rt due to the restriction of cases to superior HLA match between the donor and recipient. This strategy markedly decreases the possibility that recipients will experience a rejection episode; however, most patients will undergo a prolonged waiting period before this degree of match can be achieved, even with the existing pancreas sharing scheme that emphasizes HLA match (22). In most cases a compromise is necessary if the transplant is ever to be accomplished. Despite better immunosuppression and HLA matching some patients will experience allograft dysfunction that must be diagnosed. The success of renal, hepatic, and cardiac transp lantation, has been dependent on the ability to differentiate nonimmunologic causes for graft dysfunction from rejection by reliance on a confirmatory biopsy (23). Biopsy material from transplanted pa ncreas grafts was obtained in the past during laparotomy (23, 24) or through cystoscopically gui ded transduodenal pancreatic biopsy (25-27). Our center has applied a method for routine ultrasound guided percutaneous pancreatic biopsy under local anesthesia (28, 29) . This approach has yielded tissue for histologic analysis in greater than 88% of attempts, w ith complications in fewer than 2% of cases (2, 30) . We have previously proposed a system for grading pancreas allograft rejection that differs from other schemes (31, 32) in that it includes the diagnosis of milder forms of rejection in the absence of arterial vascular rejection. Our original report (32) was based on our experience with the application of the percutaneous needle biops y technique on patients w ith graft dysfunction; subsequently protocol biopsies from patients with normal func tion were also available for evaluation, enabling us to test the specificity of the various morphological parameters. In this study we attempted to identify specific histologic feat ures of milder as well as more severe forms of rejection and devised a detailed system for thei r practical application in the diagnostic process. The differential diagnosis of rejection is also discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between July 2, 1992, and May 31, 1995, 129 bladder drained pancreatic transplants were performed at the University of Maryland Hospital. Of these 129 cases, 64 patients (44 SPK, 15 PAK, and 5 PTA) had 138 pancreatic biopsies, 123 (89%) of which were adequate for diagnosis (see criteria below). Biopsies were performed fro m 2 days to 48 months after transplantation (mean, 17.1 months) and originated from 43 males and 21 females. The ages ranged from 23 to 56 years (mean, 35 years). The number of biopsie s per patient ranged from 1 to 7 (mean, 1.3). The biopsies were obtained using an 18-gauge au tomated biopsy needle with a 17-mm specimen notch. The 123 biopsies were performed in two types of circumstances. Ninety-two biopsies were performed on 38 patients for confirmation of clini cal diagnosis of rejection. This constitutes the main study group and was designated the Rejecti on biopsy (bx) group. The clinical indications prompting biopsy required fulfillment of one of th e following criteria: (1) a twofold or greater increase in serum amylase (mean increase, 3.5-fo ld) or lipase (mean increase, 8.5-fold); (2) a sustained 40% or greater decrease in urinary am ylase (mean, 45%); 3) loss of glycemic control. Baseline laboratory values were calculated as th e means of all values obtained in the 4 weeks precedin g the e pisode of re jection. Twent y-eight simultaneous renal and pancreatic trans plant Page 3 of 17 Ovid: Drachenber g1: plantation, Volume in combined kidney-pa ncreas allograft recipients. In 24 of these instances, concurrent acute increase in serum creatinine and abnormal pancreatic function were observed. The first episode of minimal rejection (grade II) was treated with pulse steroids. Subsequent rejection episodes or mild, moderate, and severe rejection were treated with OKT3 i.p. The Protocol bx group consisted of 31 consecutive pr otocol pancreatic transplant biopsies. These biopsies were performed in the ab sence of any clinical sign of re jection as part of a randomized trial comparing tacrolimus and cyclosporin e based immunosuppression in simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplants (33). The Protocol bx group and two pancreatectomy c ontrol groups were used for comparison with the Rejection bx group. The Nonrejection tx pa ncreatectomy group consisted of 12 partial or complete transplant pancreatectomies for nonrej ection related problems and included 2 cases of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (P TLD), 4 cases of chronic pancreatitis (3 obstructive, 1 related to ethanol abuse), 2 of cytomegalovirus duodenopancreatitis, 2 cases of peripancreatic abscesses, and 2 cases of early graft thrombosis. The Native pancreatectomy group consisted of 30 control native pancreases with various diseases. This group included tissue from partial pancreatectomies for recent traumatic injury from 5 young males, 17 partial pancre atectomies in cases of chroni c pancreatitis (14 obstructive type, 3 calcifying type), 4 partial pancreatectomie s for acute pancreatitis, 2 autopsy pancreases in cases of cystic fibrosis, and 2 partial panc reatectomies for acute infectious pancreatitis. For the needle biopsies, three serial 4-\u00b5m-thick hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections from each case were examined. Biopsies with 2-3 mm2 or more of pancreatic acinar parenchyma present/biopsy surface were considered ad equate. From the pancreatectomies 4-\u00b5m-thick hematoxylin-and-eosin-sections from tw o blocks per case were examined. The presence of 26 histologic features was eval uated in the main study group and in the three control groups (Table 1) . The results in the various groups were compared with those of the Rejection bx group, using the Fisher's exact test. The results were corrected for the absence of specific structures (ducts , vessels, islets, and nerves) in the needle biopsies. Page 4 of 17 Ovid: Drachenber g1: Trans plantation, Volume 63 (11).June 15, y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 210 Table 1. Histologic featuresa For the evaluation of the histologic features, all cases were examined independently by two pathologists (C.B.D. and J.C.P.), who were blinded as to the clinical status of the patients. To test the reproducibility of the grading sche me, one hematoxylin and eosin section from 20 percutaneous pancreas biopsies we re evaluated independently by fi ve pathologists blinded to the clinical data. Three of them were transplant pathologists (L.C.R., C.B.D., and J.C.P.) whereas two had no previous experience with transplant ation pathology (R.J.C. and O.B.I.). The results were evaluated statistically by the [kappa] analysis for the measurement of interrater agreement. At the closing of this study (May 1996), the total number of patients with pancreas transplant biopsies for which at least 6 months of follo w-up was available amounted to 77. The grading scheme was applied blindly to the 183 biopsies fr om these patients, and the highest grade of rejection on each patient was correlated with the fate of the pancreatic graf t. The linear trend of decreasing graft survival was analyzed with the Pearson's chi square test. RESULTS Differentiation between rejection and other pathologic processes . As seen in Table 1 , the occurrence of septal inflammation, acinar in flammation, injury, and venous endothel iitis differs significantly between biopsies from patients with clinically suspected rejection (R ejection bx group), the Protocol bx group, and the Native pancreatectomies group. Arterial endotheliitis and arteritis are features that are associated almost exclusively with rejection, but occur far less frequently than the features above and for that reason they do not show statistical significance in the respective comparisons. The presence of ductal inflammation is not significantly different between the cases with presumed rejection and the native pancreas diseases or nonrejection pancreatectomies. Significant differences are noted, however, betw een the Protocol bx group and the Rejection bx group. Page 5 of 17 Ovid: Drachenber g1: Volume gi Page cell necrosis, ductal cell atypia, interstitial edema, and nerve and islet inflammation is not significantly different between biopsy samples from patients with clinical suspicion of rejecti on and samples from other pancreatic pathologic processes. Spotty or diffuse coagulation necrosis of the acinar parenchyma with associated enzymatic fat necrosis was seen in the cases of early graft th rombosis; no significant inflammatory infiltrates were observed in these cases. In contrast, en zymatic necrosis associated with prominent predominantly neutrophilic infiltrates was seen in acute pancreatitis. Dilated, angulated, and compressed ducts, ducta l epithelial calcification were notable for their rarity or virtual absence in the biopsies from the Rejection bx group. In contrast, these findings were commonly seen in the Native pancreatectomies group, yieldi ng highly significant statistical differences. From the above statistical analysis, a constellati on of histological features was identified, which was not seen in the diseases of the native pancreas or in the biopsies from patients w ith normal graft function (Table 1) . The concurrent finding of a minimum of these features in biopsies from patients with clinically presumed rejection was considered as s uggestive or diagnostic of rejection (see grading scheme, Table 2 ). Applying the same principle, a group of histological features remarkable for their absence in rejection but commonly seen in acute and chronic pancreatitis was identified and therefore considered useful for the differential diagnosis (Table 1) . Table 2. Grading scheme Histologic features used for grading . In the Rejection bx group, septal inflammation (Fig. 1 and 2) was the most commonly observed finding (85/92, 92%) (Table 3) .

Histologic features useful for grading of rejection (92 nonprotocol needle biopsies) In 73 of 92 (79%) of the biopsy samples, the inflammatory infiltrat es involved additional structures present in the tissue. Ductal inflamma tion and acinar inflammation were seen in 53 of 92 (64%) and 65 of 92 (71%) of the biopsy samples, respectively (Figs. 2B and 3) . Concurrent ductal inflammation and acinar inflammation occu rred in 49 of 92 (53%) biopsies. Acinar inflammation with unremarkable ducts was observed in 10 of 92 (11%) cases. Ductal inflammation in the context of septal inflammation and associated venous endotheliitis was seen in 5% of cases with no associated acinar involvement. Figure 3.

Eosinophils were identified in fibrous septa and ac ini in 82% of the biopsies with features of rejection. \"Activated\" appearing lymphocyte s (showing enlarged and convoluted nuclei, increased amounts of cytoplasm) were observed in 60 of 92 cases (65%). Venous endotheliitis consisting of dense perivenular infiltrates with li fting and swelling of endothelial cells was seen in 32 of 92 (35%) biopsies (Fig. 2A) . Acinar single cell injury in the form of necrosis (oncotic cell death) or drop-out (apoptosis) was observed in cases with significant inflammation (34/92, 37%, Fig. 3). Arterial endotheliitis, consisting of lif ting-up and damage of endothelial cells by lymphocytic or mixed inflammator y infiltrates was seen in 11 of 92 (12%) biopsies.

Acinar multicellular necrosis and extensive (nonenzymatic) confluent necrosis were seen in severe rejection (7/92, 8% biopsies, Fig. 4). Necrosis in association with mixed inflammatory infiltrates was most typical of severe acute rejection. Figure 4. Extensive inflammatory infiltrates associated with confluent necrosis. The rest of the histologic features evaluated we re not useful in the diagnosis and grading of rejection. Interstitial edema, when present, wa s usually associated with acinar inflammation (22/27 cases). Lack of edema, however, was seen in cases with significant acinar inflammation. Inflammation involving nerve branches was seen in 10 of 92 cases, and the degree of inflammation was proportional to the septal inflammation. In 10 biopsies, the acinar inflammation extended to involve the islets. Additional features observed inconsistently in the biopsies from patients with clinical suspicion of rejection are listed in Table 1 and include presence of plasma cells, neutrophils, ductal epithelial cell necrosis, and atypia. Correlation between grade of re jection and ultimate graft loss . After a mean follow-up (\u00b1SEM) of 19.3\u00b11.95 months (range, 6-52 months) the percentage of ultimate graft loss in 77 patients was 0% for patients with biopsies of gr ades 0-I, 11.5% for grade II, 17.3% for grade III, 37.5% for grade IV, and 100% for grade V (Table 4) . The linear trend for decreasing graft survival correlating with the histologic grade, was statistically significant ( P<0.002) by the Pearson's chisquare method. No difference in graft loss was found between grade II cases with or without venous endotheliitis. The percentage of graft loss due to pure immunological causes increased proportionally to the histological grade (0, 50, 66, and 100% for grades II, III, IV, and V, respectively). Table 5 lists the correlation of immediate clinical outcome with corresponding biopsy grade.

Correlation of immediate outcome with grade Correlation of findings in simult aneous pancreatic and renal biopsies . The findings in 22 of the 28 simultaneously biopsied pancreas and kidney transplants correlated with each other (both organs showed minimal rejection in 18 cases and mild rejection in 4 cases). The noncorrelative biopsies showed isolated pancreas rejection in four cases and isolated renal rejection in two cases. Correlation of number of rejection episodes with severity of rejection and ultimate graft survival . Patients with biopsies showing grades 0-III as highest degree had an average of 1.2 episodes of graft dysfunction (range, 1-2). Patients with one or more grade IV biopsies had an average of 2.1 rejection episodes (range, 1-7). Pa tients with one or more grade V biopsies had 3.4 rejection episodes (range, 3-5). Patients with failed grafts had 2.2 rejection episodes (range, 1-6), whereas patients with functioning graf ts had 1.9 rejection episodes (range, 1-5). Degree of interobserver agreement between pathologists . Overall high level of agreement was obtained b y all five patholo gists ([kappa]=0.83, P<0.0001 ). Similar [ka 11 of 17 Ovid: Drachenber g1: Trans plantation, Volume IV ([kappa]=0.79, P<0.0001). The reproducibility of grades 0 and V was close to perfect ([kappa]=0.90, P<0.0001, and [kappa]=0.94, P<0.0001, respectively), whereas substantial levels of agreement were obtained for grades II and III ([kappa]=0.66, P<0.0001, and [kappa]=0.72, P<0.0001). Excellent discr imination between of rejection versus nonrejection was achieved ([kappa]=0.96, P<0.0001), with only one discrepancy by one pathologist who diagnosed one case as grade II (minimal rejection) and the other four pathologists diagnosed it as grade I (inflammation of undetermined significance). DISCUSSION By retrospectively examining failed and functi oning pancreatic grafts, Nakhleh and Sutherland (30) identified histologic features associated with higher probability of graft failure and proposed a classification scheme for the grading of rejec tion. In this significant study, the authors indicated that to diagnose rejection vascular changes must be seen. In their classification the latter changes were indicated as arterial endotheliitis in mild rejection and vasculitis in severe rejection. From our experience with pancreas transplant needle biopsies, however, we developed the concept that a significant number of milder form s of rejection will be underdiagnosed if the presence of arterial changes is a condition fo r the diagnosis of rejection. In our study we attempted to characterize the features of both mild as well as advanced degrees of pancreas rejection by analyzing needle bi opsies from patients with and w ithout clinical evidence of rejection. We compared these features with the morphologic features seen in nontransplant related pancreas diseases and prospectively ev aluated their relevance in the graft outcome. In designing this scheme for histological grading of rejection, we took into account a sequence of events that has been described in unmodified transplant rejection in canine and rodent animal experimental models. The first significant cha nges in this context occur on days 2 to 3 and consist of septal inflammati on and perivascular infiltrates around veins and capillaries (34-36). Capillary-venous endotheliitis also starts to appe ar at that stage, although it can be somewhat more delayed in the presence of immunosuppression (35). Progressive involvement of the acinar parenchyma and arterial endotheliitis ensue in the following days (34-37). Our findings on needle biopsies support the concept that the most subtle evidence of rejection in human pancreas transplants consists of perivenul ar infiltrates (often associated with venous endotheliitis) and associated septal inflammatory infiltrates. The small vascular structures (venules) are the point of entry of lymphocytes into the affected tissues (38) and their endothelial cells can be the target of immune attack. Subsequently, the infiltrates involve other interlobular structures (ducts, nerves), as well as the acinar parenchyma and arterial branches, as is shown in the animal models (34, 36) . In accordance with this concept, we based the grading of allograft rejection on the progressive involvement of septal, acinar, and arterial vasc ular structures. This grading concept does not, however, imply a necessary or exclusive pat hophysiologic sequence in individual patients. Our study shows that acinar inflammation is a very sensitive feature of rejection. Thus, it occurs far more often in the context of susp ected rejection to a highly significant degree (P<0.0001). In particular, the identification of aci nar single cell injury secondary to immune attack is a specific feature of rejection ( P<0.0001), that can be compared with venous endotheliitis, arterial endotheliitis, and vascu litis. In this study, the diagnostic value of eosinophils was again confirmed, as we had prev iously shown for kidney allograft rejection (39). Although ductal inflammation shows a significant clinicopathological correlation and appears to be an inte gral com ponent of pancreas re jection (35, 40) (as is the case with he patic ducts and Page 12 of 17 Ovid: Drachenber g1: plantation, Volume kidney allograft rej ection, respectively), it is also often seen in chronic pancreatitis. Ductal inflammation by itself is therefore considered nonspecific if it is not associated with acinar inflammation, venous e ndotheliitis, eosinophils, or \"activated\" appearing lymphocytes. Taking into account the sampling variations and limitations inherent to small needle biopsies, as pancreatic biopsies typically are, we propose a grading scheme that uses a combination of the various useful histological parameters, to max imize the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of minimal rejection (grade II, Table 2 ). Previous studies have emphasized the specificity of endotheliitis (30, 31) -in particular arterial endotheliit is-for the diagnosis of rejection. Endotheliitis, however, was shown to be relate d to the degree of inflammation present (30) and therefore would be seen in general in more advanced stages of rejection. The absolute requirement for its identification for the diagnos is of rejection would lead to histological diagnosis of mostly the higher grades whereas the lower grades would be probably treated empirically according to the clinical findings. From our results we conclude that biopsies wi th grades II and III identify populations of patients with milder forms of cellular rejection that in the appropriate clinical context should be treated. All 31 biopsies diagnosed as minimal evid ence of rejection (grade II) corresponded to patients with acute allograft dysf unction and clinical suspicion for acute rejection (18 cases from this group had concurrent renal biopsies s howing mild rejection by the Banff criteria (41). The laboratory abnormalities reversed to baseline after antirejection tr eatment in 71% of the cases diagnosed as minimal rejection (Table 5) . In 19% of the cases there was persistent graft dysfunction, and despite antirejection treatment a higher degree of rejection was seen in a subsequent biopsy. All of our protocol biopsies fro m patients with normal graft function failed to show features of rejection, bei ng either totally normal (grade 0) or showing inflammation of undetermined significance (grade I). In the lower grades (0-II), due to the focality of the early rejection process, sampling may cause potential diagnostic problems. Two patients with normal biopsies (grade 0) had persistent transplant dysfunction and showed rejection in subsequent biopsies. In our initial grading scheme (32), we considered the presence of any degree of interstitial infiltrates as borderline changes (in an analogous manner to the borderline category in the Banff scheme for grading of kidney rejection) (41). With the possibility of evaluating protocol biopsies it became evident that this finding is nonspecific. In rare cases, however, sparse septal infiltrates preceded the development of rejection or occasi onally were noted in resolving treated rejection. Thus, we renamed the grade I as inflammation of undetermined significance. Recent papers have addressed the potentially ambiguous meaning of infl ammation in grafts, part icularly in patients without clinical evidence of organ dysfunction (42). The evaluation of multiple controls and the statis tical analysis described above led us to divide the grades in a slightly different fashion from th e original classification in search of increased specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of rejection. We introduced the \"minimal\" category, which is diagnosed by the observation of well de fined venous endotheliitis in the context of purely septal infiltrates. To incr ease the sensitivity of the system we also diagnose minimal rejection in the absence of venous endotheliitis but with the concurrent presence of the constellation of other fe atures described in Table 2 . Biopsies that fall short of fulfilling these criteria are classified as infla mmation of undetermined significance. The hi gher grades (III-V ) in this scheme corres pond to une quivocal allo graft re jection and Page 13 of 17 Ovid: Drachenber g1: Volume http://gatewa y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 219therefore pose no problem from a differentia l diagnostic point of view. Less pronounced acinar or septal inflammation not associated with definite vascular changes should, however, be differentiated from other conditions affecting the gr aft. The statistical analysis indicates that it should be possible in most cases to differentia te mild rejection from drainage related problems associated with chronic pancreatitis. The latter cases display fibrosis, acinar atrophy and ductal dilation and proliferation, as is the case with ch ronic pancreatitis in general. On the other hand, it may be impossible to differentiate only on a mo rphological basis cellular rejection from other conditions acutely affecting the graft. A high degree of caution should therefore be applied to all biopsy samples to rule out the viral cytopathic changes typical of cytomegalovirus pancreatitis, immunoblasts) that may suggest PTLD or any other feature indicative of a dise ase process different from a pure rejection reaction (43). The presence of peripancreatic abscesses or other similar conditions that affect the surgical bed may cause significant changes in the superf icial pancreatic tissue, which is the portion usually sampled with the percutaneous biopsy te chnique. These changes consist of significant mixed septal inflammatory infiltrates associated with early septal fibrosis and occasional acinar involvement. In a different clinical setting many of these features would be indicative of cellular rejection (43). The algorithm proposed here (Fig. 5) emphasizes the importance of first correctly diagnosing rejection before assigning the appropria te grade. Strict adherence to the proposed guidelines leads to highly reproducible resu lts that have clinical significance. Figure 5. Algorithm for the evaluation of pancreas allograft biopsies. Although our study deals mainly with diagnosis of acute rejection, it should be stressed that findings indicating chronic rejection (increased septal fibrosis, acinar parenchymal loss, and chronic transplant vasculopathy) have additiona l prognostic implications as previously described (44), and should be stated in the pathology report. We were not able to demonstrate evidence of primary isletitis or of recurrent diabetes mellitus (45). In summary, in addition to the well established c oncept that acute arterial vascular changes are diagnostic of advanced pancreas allograft rejection, we propose that early rejection starts in the connective tissue se pta often with associated venular inflammation. With the subse quent Page 14 of 17 Ovid: Drachenber http://gatewa y2.ovid.com/ovidweb.c gi Page 220infiltration by of inflammato ry cells, ducts and acinar parenchyma are affected. These early changes should be recogni zed and treated as clinically indicated. The progressive morphologic findings leading to our grading system are supported conceptually by experimental studies in animals and further conf irmed by the clinical outcome in this group of patients.

B ARTLETT2,5 Departments of Pathology, Surgery, Pharmacy Services, and Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21201 Background. Graft losses due to leaks, bleeding, thrombosis, infections, and early pancreatitis are grouped together under the category of technical fail-ure. Among these complications, massive vascularthrombosis continues to be the most important causeof early graft loss due to technical failure. Pathologi-cal evaluation of most allografts lost early in the post-transplantation period shows vascular thrombosiswith associated proportional parenchymal necrosis.The morphological findings in allografts that are con-sidered to be lost due to technical failure has not beensystematically addressed. In particular, the role ofacute rejection in early graft loss has not been wellstudied. Methods. Seventy-four consecutive pancreas graft pancreatectomies were studied histologically to eval-uate for thrombosis (recent versus organized), type ofvessel involved by thrombosis (arteries, veins, orboth), acute rejection grade, chronic rejection grade,endotheliitis, transplant arteritis, coagulation transplant relative proportions of alpha and beta islet cells,and immunoglobulin and complement deposition. Thehistological findings were correlated with donor andrecipient data as well as clinical presentation. Results. In 23 out of 39 grafts lost in the first 4 weeks posttransplantation, the only pathological changesfound were vascular thrombosis and bland ischemicparenchymal necrosis. In these cases, no underlyingvascular pathology or any other specific histologicalchange was identified. Most of these grafts (78%) werelost in less than 48 hr and all in the first 2 weeksposttransplantation. Massive vascular thrombosis oc-curring in an otherwise histologically normal pan-creas was the most common cause of graft loss in thefirst 4 weeks posttransplantation (59%). In most of theremaining cases (33%), although the clinical presenta-tion suggested technical failure, there was clear histo-logical evidence that the massive thrombosis resultedfrom vascular injury due to immune damage (acuteand hyperacute rejection). Increased incidence ofearly graft thrombosis was seen in grafts from older donors and longer cold ischemia times. After the firstmonth posttransplantation, graft pancreatectomiesrevealed a wider variety of pathological processes thatincluded severe acute rejection, combined acute andchronic rejection, chronic rejection, and infections.Acute and chronic vascular thrombosis in large andsmall vessels was commonly seen at all times post-transplantation; chronic, organized thrombosis wasstrongly associated with chronic rejection. Conclusions. (a) Early acute thrombosis occurring in a histologically normal pancreas defines a true tech-nical failure. This study showed that acute rejectionleading to massive thrombosis, which clinically simu-lates technical failure, results in a significant propor-tion of early graft losses. (b) Systematic histologicalevaluation of failed grafts is absolutely necessary forthe accurate classification of the cause of graft loss. (c)There is morphological evidence that chronically on-going thrombosis is an important, common, contribut-ing factor for late graft loss. INTRODUCTION Refinement of surgical techniques, potent immunosuppres- sive drugs, accurate diagnosis of rejection, better treatment of infections, and careful selection of donors and recipientshave all resulted in the widespread use of pancreas trans-plantation with improving long-term results ( 1-24 ). Whereas excellent rates of 1-year graft survival have been achieved in recent years for all types of technically successfulpancreas transplants (simultaneous pancreas kidney (SPK),pancreas transplant alone (PTA), pancreas after kidney(PAK)) ( 1,21), a significant obstacle in pancreas transplan- tation continues to be the high incidence of graft loss in theearly postimplantation period, due to a variety of surgicalcomplications ( 13,15,25-36 ). As reported by the Pancreas Transplant Registry/UNOS, the marked decrease in the re-jection rate has caused the relative risk of graft loss to behigher for technical failures than for rejection ( 5). Among the peritransplantation complications, thrombosis continues to be the leading cause of nonimmunological graft loss (5.8-16.4%) with higher rates seen in PAK and PTA cases withenteric drainage ( 5). The pancreas has intrinsically a low blood flow compared with other solid organs. Perioperative inflammation and edema ( 29), as well as microvascular and endothelial damage relating to donor factors and organ preservation, all contrib-ute to further compromise blood flow in the early posttrans-plant period ( 34), which leads to thrombosis.

Bartlett, M.D., Depart - ment of Surgery, 29 South Greene Street, Baltimore, MD 21201. 1784 Page 224ingly longer cold ischemia times have been associated with increased incidence of graft thrombosis ( 30,36). Abnormalities in coagulation factors have been found in association with increased risk of thrombosis ( 37,38), and anticoagulation has been proposed to prevent clotting ( 29, 39). This treatment, however, seems to be less important than better surgical technique and decreased pretransplan-tation graft damage in diminishing the risk of graft throm-bosis ( 13,15). Acute rejection is suspected to play a role in some patients with early graft thrombosis ( 5,32). HLA mismatches seem not to impact on the incidence of graft loss due to technicalfailures, however, HLA mismatch does have an overall neg-ative impact on graft survival ( 6,40,41). In this study, we performed a detailed, histological evalu- ation of all the pancreatectomies performed during the first 8years of the pancreas transplant program at the Universityof Maryland. The objective of this study was to correlate themorphological findings with the clinical course. Specifically,we attempted to (a) determine the morphological changesassociated with early graft thrombosis (up to 4 weeks); (b)evaluate the spectrum of morphological changes in pancrea-tectomies performed at later times, with emphasis on therelationship between graft loss and acute rejection, chronicrejection, and acute and chronic thrombosis; and (c) deter-mine the overall pattern of graft loss in relationship to post-transplant time and specific pathological processes (e.g., re-jection, infection, PTLD). MATERIALS AND METHODS Between April 1, 1991 and April 1, 1999, 301 pancreas transplants were performed at the University of Maryland Hospital (154 SPK, 114 PAK, 32 PTA). During the same time, 74 pancreas graft pancre-atectomies were performed in 69 patients (5 retransplants). In allbut two patients, the transplants were performed for insulin-depen-dent diabetes mellitus type I. Two patients had diabetes secondary tochronic pancreatitis. Five to fourteen routinely prepared hematoxy-lin and eosin stained sections from each case were reviewed by twopathologists, who were blinded to any clinical data. Available frozentissue from 10 organs that failed within 7 days posttransplantationwere evaluated by immunofluorescence studies for deposition of im-munoglobulins and complement (IgG, IgM, IgA, C3). Immunoperox-idase stains for and glucagon (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) wereperformed on 1 paraffin section from each of the 74 cases to deter-mine the proportion and distribution of alpha and beta cells. The histological parameters that were evaluated are thrombosis (recent and organized), type of vessel involved by thrombosis (arter-ies, veins, or both), acute rejection grade, chronic rejection grade,endotheliitis, transplant arteritis, coagulation necrosis, acute pan-creatitis, presence of infectious organisms, transplant (obliterative)arteriopathy, neoplasia, and proportion of alpha and beta islet cellson peroxidase stains. Data made available after the histological evaluation included pertinent clinical history, recipients' age and gender, dates of trans-plant and pancreatectomy, first serum amylase, and peak gender, serum lipase, cause of death, and HLA mismatchwere also recorded. The diagnosis of infectious pancreatitis was based on the morpho- logical pattern and the microbiology culture results. The diagnosis ofacute rejection, chronic rejection, and posttransplant lymphoprolif-erative disorder was based on the previously described criteria(42-44 ). The immunosuppression schemes were as follows: all patients received 10-14 days of induction therapy or OKT3 was initiated when the nasogastric tubewas discontinued (PAK, PTA) or when a dropping serum creatinineclearly indicated renal transplant function (SPK). Triple mainte-nance therapy consisted of either cyclosporine respectively; tapered to 200 ng/ml and 8-10 ng/ml, respectively.Rejection episodes were treated with 500 mg of intravenous methyl-prednisolone followed by a taper over 2 weeks. ATGAM (Upjohn) orOKT3 (Orthoclone, OrthoBiotech) were administered at standarddoses for 10-14 days according to clinical parameters. The firstepisode of minimal (grade II) or mild (grade III) rejection was treatedwith corticosteroids. Recurrent episodes of rejection and moderate orsevere rejection (grades IV and V) were treated with a combinationof corticosteroids and ATGAM or OKT3. Starting in 1998, all pancreas transplant patients received low doses of heparin for 5 days posttransplantation and then were placedon either ASA indefinitely (SPK) or Coumadin (PAK, PTA) for 3months. The morphological parameters were correlated with the patient and donor data and the time at graft loss and analyzed with the2-tailed Pearson's correlation test and ttest. Relative risks were calculated with the Cox regression analysis. RESULTS Demographic Data The 74 graft pancreatectomies (including 5 retransplants) were performed on 69 patients; 29 females and 40 males; 7 African-Americans and 62 Caucasians; ages 26-59 with amean of 28.5 years (SD 12.2 years). Time of graft pancreate-ctomy ranged from 1 hour posttransplantation to 81 months(mean of 6.4 months, SD 13.8 months). The pancreatectomiescorresponded to 39 SPK, 21 PAK, and 14 PTA; 34 grafts werebladder drained and 40 were enteric drained. The donors hada mean age of 27.9 (range 10-54, SD 1.49); these were 14African-Americans and 55 Caucasians; 25 females and 44males. The donors' weights ranged from 110 to 229 lb (mean149, SD 3.4); they had SD 164.4 and range 9-910, SD72.04, respectively). The mean cold ischemia time was 1137min (range 540-1950, SD 372 min). The degree of mismatchranged from 0-6 (mean 3.38, SD 1.74). The cause of deathwas traumatic/accidental in 67 cases and cerebrovascular in7 cases. Histological Findings Based on the histological findings the cases were classified in the following groups. Pure vascular thrombosis in an otherwise normal pan- creas. In 23 grafts, the only pathological thrombosis and bland ischemic parenchymal necro-sis. No underlying vascular pathology or any other specifichistological change was identified in these cases (Fig. 1). Themajority of these grafts (78%) were lost in less than 48 hrafter transplantation (n 518) and all 23 were lost in the first 2 weeks posttransplantation. Three of the 5 patients that required retransplantation lost both first and second grafts to this type of thrombosis.The other patients lost their first grafts to infection andDRACHENBERG ET AL. June 27, 2001 1785 Page 225rejection, respectively, and their second grafts to pure vascu- lar thrombosis. The time intervals between the first andsecond grafts were 11, 12, 24, 8, and 7 months, respectively. Hyperacute allograft rejection. Two pancreatectomy spec- imens, 12 hr posttransplantation, fibrinoid necrosis of arteries and veins, depositionof IgG and C3 in the wall of blood vessels (Fig. 2B). The first patient with hyperacute rejection was a 50-year- old woman that underwent a PAK transplant. Within min-utes of anastomosis, the graft became cyanotic, hemorrhagic,and had no blood flow. Repeat crossmatch and panel were negative. Additional serum) antikeratinocyte antibodies react-ing against 20% of a panel of samples. The second patient with hyperacute rejection was a 40- year-old woman with history of high panel-reactive antibod-ies; she underwent plasmapheresis before a PAK. Despite aninitially negative pretransplant crossmatch, within hours af-ter transplantation the graft was tender, swollen, hemor-rhagic, and lacked blood flow. The posttransplantation serumwas positive for anti-HLA antibodies. The cold ischemia time in these 2 patients was 1150 and 1740 min, with a mismatch 5 and 3 antigens, respectively.The donors' amylase and lipase were within normal limits. allograft rejection. The histological changes in 15 pancreatectomies resected between 1 week to 4 months post-transplantation (mean 5.1 weeks) consisted of endotheliitisand various degrees of necrotizing arteritis (acute rejectiongrade IV and V). Immunohistochemical studies in eight ofthese cases failed to show any significant immunoglobulin orcomplement deposition in the grafts. Seven patients in this group (46.6%) had a posttransplan- tation course complicated by systemic and/or peripancreaticinfections that required reduction of immunosuppression.Duodenal leaks were seen in five of these patients. Graftlosses due to a combination of infection and rejection oc-curred between 3-6 weeks posttransplantation. In additionto the features of rejection, for patients with peripancreaticinfection, the grafts showed increased fibrosis. Acute and chronic rejection. Cases with persistent (biopsy proven) acute allograft rejection showed early interstitialfibrosis and acinar loss consistent with chronic rejection ( 44), starting in the second month posttransplantation. Six graftsshowing these combined features of acute and chronic rejec-tion were lost at times ranging from 6 weeks to 20 months(mean 6.6 months). Three patients that lost their graftswithin 4 months posttransplantation due to acute rejectionsuperimposed on accelerated chronic rejection received lessthan optimal immunosuppression due to persistent duodeno-pancreatitis and were resected at1, 1, 2, 3, and 11 months, respectively (mean 3.6 months);these corresponded to 3 bacterial ( Enterobacter fungal glabrata), and 1 mixed infection FIGURE 1.

Fifteen graft pancreatectomies showed extensive interstitial fibrosis and acinar atrophy in a patternconsistent with chronic rejection (Fig. 4) and were lost at amean time of 28.6 months (range 4-81 months). These graftsdid not show any significant concurrent acute rejection. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Epstein- Barr related posttransplant lymphoproliferative five graft losses. Allograft pancreatecto-mies for PTLD were performed in four patients in the secondmonth posttransplantation and in one patient in month 12(mean 5 months). Incidence of Vascular Thrombosis and Relationship with Rejection Sixty-four grafts, out of the total of 74 (86.4%), displayed some degree of recent thrombosis; in 39 of these grafts, therecent thrombosis was extensive and was associated withfocal or diffuse ischemic (coagulative) or hemorrhagic necro-sis. Arteries and were affected in 44 grafts with recentthrombosis; venous thrombosis only was seen in 4 cases andarterial thrombosis only in 14 cases. There was no correlationbetween the time of graft loss and the type of vessel affectedby the thrombosis. Recent thrombosis was seen to some degree in all cases of early graft loss due to acute allograft rejection with vascularinvolvement (endotheliitis or arteritis) (Fig. 5A). Eight functioning pancreas allografts had to be resected between 10 and 36 months posttransplantation due to acute(recent) thrombosis occurring in larger arteries. In thesecases, the thrombosis always occurred in abnormal bloodvessels, either showing transplant arteriopathy or lesionsconsistent with healing vasculitis/endotheliitis (Fig. 5B). All cases with chronic rejection showed scattered vessels with thrombosis (acute and chronic in 13 cases and onlychronic (old, organized) in 2 cases); this typically involvedmedium size to small arteries and veins (Fig. 5C).Thrombosis was insignificant in the pancreatectomies per- formed for infectious processes. Immunohistochemical Stains for Insulin and Glucagon The viable components of pancreatectomies that showed no fibrosis or atrophy showed similar strength of staining andpattern of distribution for insulin and glucagon to the con-trols. Pancreatectomies with chronic rejection displayed frag-mented or hyperplastic islets; alpha and beta cells werepresent in all cases as previously described ( 45). We did not find selective loss of beta cells or evidence of insulitis in anyof the pancreatectomies. Statistical Correlations Between Histological Findings and Other Data Older donor age and longer cold ischemia time were asso- ciated with increased occurrence of early graft thrombosis(r50.240, p50.01, and r50.275, p50.02, respectively). Thrombosis overall occurred frequency ingrafts from older donors ( r50.253, p50.03). Higher donor amylase levels were associated with an in- creased overall incidence of acute rejection ( r50.323, P50.009); high donor amylase levels were also associated with higher histological grades of acute rejection (grades IVand V, r50.260, P50.03). The mean donor amylase corre- sponding to grafts that did not show acute rejection was 98U/L (SE 17.4), whereas the mean donor amylase correspond-ing to grafts that showed acute rejection was 216 U/L (SE38.3), P50.003. Higher peak lipase values in the first day posttransplan- tation were associated with increased incidence of acute al-lograft rejection occurring within the first month posttrans-plantation ( r50.377, P50.006). The presence of transplant arteriopathy (one of the histo- logical features of chronic rejection) was strongly associatedwith recent and organized thrombosis ( thrombosis was seen invariably in pancreate-ctomies with chronic rejection ( r50.378, P50.001). As ex- pected, progressive graft fibrosis increasing FIGURE 3. Necrotizing bacterial pancreatitis with abscess formation. The cavity of the abscess (asterisk) is lined by a wall composed of granulation tissue and acute and chronicinflammatory exudates (arrows). FIGURE 4. Chronic rejection is characterized by an increase in parenchymal fibrosis and concurrent atrophy of the acinarcomponent.DRACHENBERG ET AL. June 27, 2001 1787 Page 227grades of chronic rejection) and the presence of transplant arteriopathy were directly related to the time elapsed aftertransplantation ( r50.518, P50.000 and r50.699, P,0.0001, respectively). There were no significant differences in the donor and recipient data or type of transplant between the group ofpatients with simple (idiopathic) graft thrombosis occurringearly posttransplantation, the group of patients with acuteallograft rejection that lost their grafts within 6 monthsposttransplantation, and the group of patients with success-ful grafts at 12 months posttransplantation. With respect todrainage type, there was a trend suggesting an associationbetween enteric drainage and idiopathic, early thrombosis,but this did not reach statistical significance ( P50.057). No correlation could be found between the type of death in thedonor (traumatic versus cerebrovascular). The type of graft loss in relationship to time of pancreate- ctomy is summarized in Table 1. Early thrombosis occurringin histologically normal organs and thrombosis due to acute/hyperacute rejection caused 92% of graft losses in the firstmonth posttransplantation. Chronic rejection was the mostimportant cause of graft loss after the first 6 months post-transplantation. Table 2 summarizes donor and recipientdata for each histological group. DISCUSSION Graft losses due to leaks, bleeding, thrombosis, infections, and pancreatitis are grouped together under the category oftechnical failure. Among these complications, massive vascu-lar thrombosis continues to be the most important cause ofearly graft loss due to technical failure ( 5). Many factors have been implicated in the occurrence of early graft thrombosis,including old donor age, long cold ischemia time, and poorsurgical technique ( 15,23,29,33,34,36,45). The possibility of immunological factors involved in technical failures wasraised in the 1994-1998 summary report from the Interna-tional Pancreas Transplant Registry ( 5). The possibility of thrombosis occurring relatively late due to relatively earlyrejection arose from the fact that for PAK the risk for tech-nical failure was \"inexplicably high as the number of HLAmismatches increased,\" whereas apparent protection againsttechnical failure was seen with the use of tacrolimus andmycophenolate versus other less potent immunosuppres-sants ( 5). The morphological findings in allografts considered to be lost due to technical failure had not been systematicallyaddressed. On the other hand, pathological evaluation ofmost allograft pancreatectomies performed in the first weeksposttransplantation period do show a common feature, whichis the presence of some degree of vascular thrombosis withassociated proportional parenchymal necrosis. In this study,we sought to define additional histological features thatcould help to better understand the mechanisms of graftfailure requiring pancreatectomy. The main histological feature present in the majority of the grafts lost in the first month posttransplantation was exten-sive vascular thrombosis. In 59% of occurred in otherwise structurally normal pan-creas. Thrombosed pancreas with no underlying histopatho-logical abnormalities represent the group of true technicalfailures. FIGURE 5. (A) Early endotheliitis (arrows) associated with recent fibrin and platelet thrombi thrombosis with recanalization in vascular lumina embedded in fibrous tissue occupyingwhat used to be the original lumen. These changes are com-monly seen in pancreatectomies with chronic rejection.TRANSPLANTATION 1788 Vol. 71, No. 12 Page 228In contrast to the group showing early thrombosis in other- wise normal pancreas, in 33% of cases lost within 1 month posttransplantation, extensive vascular thrombosis occurredsuperimposed on immunological endothelial of endotheliitis or arteritis. Although theneed for pancreatectomy in these cases was determined by theoccurrence of massive vascular thrombosis, due to the presenceof definite acute allograft rejection, these cases cannot be con-sidered idiopathic in nature or true technical failures. The exactdetermination of the cause of graft loss is further complicatedby the fact that in more than half of these patients, the immu-nological graft loss resulted not from rejection refractory totreatment but from lowered antirejection prophylaxis becauseof serious infections affecting these patients. With the exception of rare cases of hyperacute allograft rejection, immune-type losses occurred more often after thesecond week posttransplantation. This contrasted with thetiming of graft pancreatectomy in idiopathic graft thrombosis(true technical failure) that occurred very early in the post-transplantation period, usually within 48 hr and alwayswithin the first 2 weeks. Hyperacute allograft rejection in pancreas transplantation is considered a rare occurrence ( 46). The morphological fea- tures in the two cases in this series correspond to the findingsdescribed in experimental hyperacute allograft rejection inthe pancreas. Hyperacute rejection in the pancreas is indis-tinguishable from hyperacute rejection affecting other organs(47), and it is characterized by necrosis of arteries and veins with secondary massive and immediate thrombosis and pa-renchymal necrosis. Thrombosis in pancreas allografts complicates not only the early posttransplantation period but may also occur at latertimes ( 33). In this study, we found a clear relationship between thrombosis and the presence of acute or chronic damage tovascular walls at all posttransplantation times; the vasculardamage occurs in the form of endotheliitis/arteritis in acuterejection and as transplant (obliterative) arteriopathy inchronic rejection. Other more subtle forms of endothelial dam-age, seen with high levels of cyclosporine, have been implicatedin the formation of thrombi in pancreas allografts in one study(33). In the case of early thrombosis, the lack of obvious histo- logical changes associated with the thrombosis does not ruleout ultrastructural or subtle functional damage in these or-gans, because older donor age and longer cold ischemia timeswere associated with increased risk for early thrombosis. Ourfindings confirm other studies that showed an associationbetween increasing donor age with long cold ischemia timeand technical failures ( 33,36,48-50 ). Increased risk for graft thrombosis with older donor age is probably related to pre-existing vasculopathy (i.e., atherosclerotic disease). This ideais supported by the fact that donors' cardiovascular disease isassociated with worst graft outcome ( 33). Previous studies have shown that increase in donor amylase levels have no significance for graft survival or immediate func-tion ( 47,51,52). In this study, we found that there was a statistical association between high donor amylase levels andacute rejection. Although at this time specific data are lacking,it may be speculated that increased exposure of cellular anti-gens secondary to cellular damage during procurement andpreservation could increase the risk of acute rejection. In this study, there was a strong statistical association be- tween organized (old) thrombosis and the presence of intersti-tial fibrosis and acinar loss (histological parameters that definechronic rejection). We believe that minor but repetitive episodesof vascular thrombosis contribute to graft sclerosis due tochronic ischemia. Judging by the histological appearance ofthese vessels, the process seems to be cyclic with initial throm-bosis occurring in blood vessels damaged by endotheliitis ortransplant arteriopathy followed by organization/recanalizationand further formation of clots in the now markedly narrowedblood vessels. This process, which is inherently chronic, tends to TABLE 1DRACHENBERG ET AL. June 27, 2001 1789 Page 229disproportionately affect medium and small sized arteries and veins. In contrast, abrupt graft dysfunction and thrombosisrequiring pancreatectomy that occurs in grafts with vesselsdamaged by transplant arteriopathy or ongoing endotheliitisaffects the main arteries. Thus, thrombosis is a common histo-logical finding associated with most forms of graft injury duringthe whole posttransplantation period. After the first month posttransplantation, graft pancrea- tectomies were performed as the result of a wider variety ofpathological processes that included severe acute rejection,combined acute and chronic rejection, chronic rejection, andinfections; the latter included bacterial, fungal, and EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorders. From the clinical per-spective, a similar pattern of graft loss has been reportedpreviously by Stratta ( 17,18). Summary (a) Massive vascular thrombosis is the most common cause of pancreas allograft loss. It can be present in completelynormal pancreas or can result from immunological damage toblood vessels. In the early posttransplantation period, both ofthese processes can clinically present as technical failures.Acute early thrombosis occurring in normal pancreas repre-sents the morphological definition of a true technical failure;this type of idiopathic thrombosis was never seen after 2weeks posttransplantation. (b) Systematic histological eval-uation of failed grafts is necessary for accurate classificationof the cause of graft loss. Minimum histological samplingshould include cross-sections of all large vessels and severalsections from the parenchyma to include an adequate num-ber of medium size and small vessels. (c) The consistentpresence of recent and organized thrombosis in pancreasallografts with chronic rejection underscores the importanceof acute and chronic thrombosis as a contributing factor forlate graft loss. Further studies are necessary to establish thepractical significance of these findings and to determine ifsome form of long-term anticoagulation therapy can be po-tentially useful to prolong pancreas allograft survival.

A SCHEMA FOR HISTOLOGIC GRADING OF SMALL INTESTINE Background. Histologic evaluation of small bowel allograft biopsies is important for the diagnosis of acute rejection. However, a standard histologic schema to grade the severity of intestinal acute rejec-tion is not currently available. The primary goal ofthis study was to develop a histologic grading systemfor the diagnosis of small bowel allograft acuterejection. Methods. We evaluated 3268 small bowel allograft biopsies obtained from adult patients who underwentsmall bowel transplantation at the University of Pitts-burgh Medical Center between 1990 and 1999. A histo-logic grading system was proposed and validated byretrospective correlation with clinical outcomes. Results. Among the 3268 biopsies, 180 acute rejection episodes were diagnosed (88 indeterminate, 74 mild,14 moderate, and 4 severe). All four histologically di-agnosed, severe acute rejection episodes resulted ingraft failure before resolution, despite aggressive im-munosuppressive therapy. Four of the 14 moderateacute rejection episodes were associated with unfa-vorable clinical outcomes. In contrast, the 74 mild and88 indeterminate acute rejection episodes were notassociated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Statis-tical analysis for trend revealed that grades indicatingmore severe acute rejection episodes were associatedwith a greater probability of unfavorable outcomes(P<0.01). In addition, there was good overall agree- ment among different pathologists regarding the diag-nosis of acute rejection using the proposed schema,suggesting that this system is practical. Conclusions. This study provides a reliable predic- tive schema for assessment of the severity of humansmall bowel acute rejection. Small bowel transplantation is being increasingly per- formed to treat patients with irreversible intestinal failure or short-bowel syndrome ( 1-7). Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is the major cause of intestinal graft failure after transplanta-tion ( 8). If not treated early, intestinal ACR can rapidly increase in severity and cause graft failure and death. In fact,despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, most pa-tients with histologically diagnosed severe acute rejectionexperience progression to graft loss or death. Therefore, ac-curate diagnosis and treatment of acute rejection are critical for posttransplant patient care. The diagnosis of intestinal ACR requires close correlation of clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic findings. The clinical symptoms of intestinal ACR include fever, nausea, vomiting,increased stomal output, abdominal pain, and distension. Insevere cases, acute rejection may manifest as septic shock,with metabolic acidosis, hypotension, and adult respiratorydistress syndrome, which likely results from loss of mucosalintegrity and bacterial translocation across the intestinalwall. The endoscopic appearances of intestinal ACR edema and cases mucosal vascular pattern, diminished peristalsis,and mucosal ulceration in more severe cases. The final diag-nosis depends on histologic analysis of endoscopy-guided mu-cosal biopsy specimens. The major histopathologic ofintestinal ACR were documented in previous studies ( 8,9) and include varying degrees of (1) infiltration by a mixed butprimarily mononuclear inflammatory population, includingblastic or activated by mucin andloss of cells); (3) increases in the number of cryptapoptotic bodies; and (4) distortion of villous and cryptarchitecture. The treatment options for intestinal ACR depend on its severity, which is assessed by histologic grading of the rejec-tion with clinical and endoscopic correlation. For example,whereas relatively mild acute rejection usually requires anincrease in basal immunosuppressive drug treatment withclose clinical observation, more aggressive immunosuppres-sive therapy should be initiated for moderate or severe epi-sodes of acute rejection. Therefore, accurate grading of acuterejection is extremely important for successful patient treat-ment. Histopathologic grading of acute rejection has not yetbeen addressed in detail, however, and no standard criteriaare available for assessment of the grade of intestinal ACR.The major goal of this study was to develop a reliable, prac-tical histologic grading system for pathologic evaluation ofhuman intestinal ACR. On the basis of results from animalintestinal transplantation studies ( 10-12 ) and clinical expe- rience in evaluating thousands of small bowel allograft biop-sies in our institution ( 8), we proposed a pathologic grading system for the diagnosis of intestinal ACR. This system wasused to retrospectively evaluate 3,268 small bowel allograftbiopsies from 52 adult patients who underwent intestinaltransplantation between 1990 and 1999 at the Thomas E.Starzl Transplant Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medi-cal Center. The histologic grades determined were then cor-related with clinical events, including immunosuppressivetherapy and graft and patient outcomes. Our results indicatethat the proposed grading system is accurate in the diagnosis 1Department of Pathology, Thomas E.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient Population During the 9-year period between May 1990 and June 1999, 52 adult patients (26 male and 26 female patients; age range, 19 -58 years) underwent orthotopic intestinal transplantation at the Uni- versity of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The patient demographic char-acteristics, types of procedures, and causes of intestinal failure aresummarized in Table 1. Baseline immunosuppressive therapy con-sisted of administration of tacrolimus and corticosteroids ( 1). Details of graft procurement, surgical procedures, tacrolimus-based immu-nosuppressive therapy, and patient treatment were reported previ-ously ( 1,2). Surveillance allograft endoscopy was generally per- formed once or twice per week for the first 3 months and as clinicallyindicated thereafter. Multiple random, endoscopy-guided biopsieswere routinely obtained from the small intestinal allograft (mostoften from the ileum) for histologic evaluation. Each biopsy specimenconsisted of one to five separate mucosal fragments (median ofthree). The relevant clinical features and course of each patient wereretrieved from our computerized database, and missing data wereobtained in reviews of patient flow sheets and medical records.Complete follow-up data were available through the completion ofthe study (June 30, 1999).Histologic Evaluations All pathologic specimens from the 55 intestinal allografts were reviewed, including 3268 small intestinal mucosal biopsies. The his-tologic specimens were routinely fixed in formalin and embedded inparaffin, from which 2 to 18 hematoxylin-eosin -stained sections were obtained, from two or more levels in the blocks. Samples wereobtained from deeper levels as indicated. For each specimen, themajor histologic features, including architectural distortion (villousblunting, as determined in the best-oriented sections), crypt epithe-lial injury (characterized by cytoplasmic basophilia, and hyperchromasia, decreased cell height, and deple-tion), inflammatory infiltration of the lamina propria and theconstituent cell types, presence assessed. In addition, the specimenswere carefully examined for viral infections, luminal organisms, andsubmucosal abnormalities. Apoptotic bodies within the crypt epithe-lium were identified and quantified. Apoptotic bodies were defined asrounded vacuoles containing fragments of karyorrhectic nuclear de-bris and cytoplasm and were distinguished from small isolated frag-ments of nuclear chromatin and intraepithelial neutrophils and eo-sinophils. These bodies were counted by scanning the specimen atmedium power, to identify areas of greatest concentration, and thentallying the total numbers in 10 consecutive crypts (regardless ofcrypt orientation), including more than one level if necessary. Slides from all biopsy specimens were reviewed at least twice by at least two pathologists. Histologic features relevant to acute rejectionwere compiled during the initial review; and a list of biopsy featuresof rejection was recorded by the second pathologist. Ambiguous ordifficult cases were further reviewed using a multihead microscopeby three or four pathologists. Attention was focused on changesrelated to rejection (see later discussion). Histologic Criteria for Grading of Acute Cellular Rejection The proposed histologic grading system for small bowel allograft biopsies is based on previous animal studies ( 10-12) and our clinical experience in the evaluation of thousands of small bowel allograftbiopsy specimens ( 8). The histologic criteria for grading intestinal ACR are summarized (Table 2). Indeterminate for acute rejection. Indeterminate for acute rejec- tionis defined by the variable presence of the three main features of acute rejection (infiltration by a mixed but primarily mononuclearinflammatory population, including blastic or activated lymphocytes;crypt injury; and increased numbers of crypt apoptotic bodies), whichare usually focal and do not meet the criteria for mild acute rejection.The inflammatory infiltrate is usually minimal and localized.

Mild acute rejection. Mild acute rejection is characterized by a generally mild and localized inflammatory infiltrate, which tends tobe concentrated around small venules in the lamina propria. Themucosa is intact, but the including epithelial apoptosis is increased, usuallywith more than 6 apoptotic bodies per 10 crypts. If sampled in thebiopsy specimen, preexisting lymphoid aggregates (Peyer 's patches) demonstrate an intense accumulation of activated lymphocytes. Thevilli are variably shortened, and the architectural features may beslightly distorted because of expansion of the lamina propria byinflammatory infiltration (Fig. 2). Moderate acute rejection. Inmoderate acute rejection , the inflam- matory infiltrate is widely dispersed within the lamina propria.Crypt damage is distributed more diffusely than in mild acute rejec-tion, and the villi tend to exhibit a greater degree of flattening. Thenumber of apoptotic bodies is greater than in mild acute rejection,usually with focal \"confluent apoptosis. \"Mild to moderate intimal arteritis may be observed. The mucosa remains intact without ulcer-ation, although focal superficial erosions can be present (Fig. 3). Severe acute rejection. Severe acute rejection is distinguished by a marked degree of crypt damage and mucosal ulceration. As a conse-quence of the mucosal destruction, luminal contents gain access tothe submucosa, prompting a neutrophil-rich infiltrate and an over-lying fibropurulent (pseudomembranous) exudate, with widespread FIGURE 1.

Prognostic Use of the Grading System To evaluate the ability of the proposed acute rejection grading system to predict an unfavorable outcome, the histologic diagnoses ofacute rejection episodes were retrospectively correlated with theclinical outcomes and treatments. A biopsy was defined as represent-ing an acute rejection episode if the biopsy specimen was the first oneto be histologically diagnosed as acute rejection. A new rejectionepisode was defined by newly developed clinical symptoms and doc-umentation of new histologic features of ACR with at least onenormal mucosal biopsy between the rejection episodes. For endpointanalysis, patients were divided into groups with favorable or unfa-vorable outcomes. Objective unfavorable outcomes were defined bythe presence of any one of the following: (1) the rejection resulted ingraft failure (death or retransplantation) before resolution; (2) OKT3or antithymoglobulin was required for the treatment of acute rejection;or (3) complete resolution of the episode failed to occur within 21 days. Reliability of the Grading System Sixty-five posttransplantation small bowel biopsy specimens were randomly selected and reviewed by four pathologists. Before review-ing the slides, the pathologists agreed on the histologic gradingcriteria. Each participating pathologist rendered a final histologicdiagnosis on the basis of the standard criteria. Statistical Analyses The ability of the grading system to predict an unfavorable out- come was assessed with the chi-square test for trend, using thedefinitions for unfavorable outcomes.

RESULTS Histologic Diagnosis of Acute Cellular Rejection The histologic diagnosis and grading of ACR were performed after careful evaluation of 3268 mucosal biopsies from 55 small intestinal allografts. The initial histologic diagnosis for eachbiopsy specimen was established by the primary pathologistduring the daily signed-out process; each of the biopsies wasreevaluated by a separate pathologist (T.W.), and detailed his-tologic features were recorded. If an ambiguity regarding anyhistologic feature or a disagreement in diagnoses existed, thenthe slides were further reviewed under a multihead microscopewith two or more additional pathologists, and the consensusopinion was recorded. A biopsy was defined as representing an acute rejection episode if the biopsy specimen was the first oneto be histologically diagnosed as acute rejection. A new rejectionepisode was defined on the basis of newly developed clinicalsymptoms and documentation of new histologic features ofACR, with at least one normal mucosal biopsy between therejection episodes. On the basis of the aforementioned criteria,180 episodes of ACR were histologically diagnosed, amongwhich were 88 (49%) episodes of indeterminate for ACR, 74(41%) episodes of mild ACR, 14 (8%) episodes of moderate ACR,and 4 (2%) episodes of severe ACR. Among the 180 episodes ofhistologically diagnosed ACR (including indeterminate forACR), 85 (47%) episodes occurred within the first 2 monthsafter transplantation, 46 (26%) episodes occurred 2 to 12 months after transplantation, 24 (13%) episodes occurred 1 to 2 FIGURE 3.

April 27, 2003 1245 Page 236years after transplantation, and 25 (14%) episodes occurred more than 2 years after transplantation. The same histologic grading criteria were used for all biopsies in this study, including biopsies obtained frompatients with clinical symptoms and protocol biopsies. Theclinical presentations associated with ACR included ab-dominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and ab-dominal distention. These symptoms lacked specificity,however, and varied depending on the severity of rejectionand the presence of other pathologic conditions, such asacute enteritis, (CMV) infection, lym-phoproliferative disorder (PTLD). All of the patients withhistologic diagnoses of moderate or severe ACR exhibitedclinical symptoms, and approximately 95% of the patientswith histologic diagnoses of mild or indeterminate acuterejection exhibited symptoms. The remaining 5% of pa-tients with mild or indeterminate acute rejection exhibitedno symptoms at the time of the biopsies, and the diagnoseswere established with protocol biopsies. Most of the biop-sies without histologic evidence of acute rejection demon-strated either normal mucosa or mild nonspecific enteritis;some showed PTLD. Prognostic Ability of the Grading System We then wished to analyze the association between acute rejection grades and unfavorable outcomes. For this purpose, FIGURE 4. Severe acute rejection. There is extensive mucosal de- struction, with ) (hematoxylin- /H11547200).TRANSPLANTATION 1246 Vol. 75, No. 8 Page 237the patients were divided into those with favorable outcomes and those with unfavorable outcomes, according to the afore-mentioned criteria, and the ability of the grading system topredict an unfavorable outcome was assessed with the chi-square test for trend. The results demonstrated that a gradeindicating a more severe rejection episode was associatedwith a greater probability of an unfavorable outcome(P/H110210.01). In fact, all four of the histologically diagnosed severe acute rejection episodes resulted in graft failure beforeresolution, despite treatment with OKT3. Of those fourgrafts, three were removed because of uncontrolled ACR andone patient died as a result of ACR with the graft in place. Ofthe 14 episodes of moderate acute rejection, 2 episodes re-quired OKT3 treatment and 2 episodes failed to resolvewithin 21 days with immunosuppressive therapy (other thanOKT3). The outcome of one moderate ACR episode could notbe determined because of graft removal secondary to chronicrejection, before the resolution of ACR. The remaining nineepisodes of histologically diagnosed moderate ACR were notassociated with unfavorable outcomes. The outcomes weredifficult to assess for 3 of the 74 episodes of mild ACR,because of graft removal in 2 cases (because of chronic rejec-tion and opportunistic infection) and patient death in 1 case(resulting from opportunistic infection) before resolution ofthe ACR episodes. The remaining 71 mild ACR episodes werenot associated with unfavorable outcomes. The 88 indetermi-nate ACR episodes all resolved within 21 days (spontaneousresolution without treatment, resolution after increased im-munosuppressive therapy, or progression to mild ACR thatlatter resolved with treatment) and were not associated withunfavorable outcomes. Reliability of the Grading System A consensus diagnosis was reached by all of the participat- ing pathologists in 60 of the 65 cases (92%), including 4 casesof severe acute rejection, 9 cases of moderate acute rejection,10 cases of mild acute rejection, 13 cases of indeterminate forACR, and 24 cases of no acute rejection. Of the five cases forwhich a uniform diagnosis could not be established, two caseswere interpreted as either mild ACR or indeterminate forACR and three cases were interpreted as either indetermi-nate or no ACR. There was no disagreement regarding the diagnosis of moderate or severe acute rejection. Multiraterkappa analysis demonstrated that there was excellent over-all agreement among pathologists regarding the diagnosisand grading of small bowel acute rejection with this gradingschema ( P/H110210.01). Good intraobserver agreement was noted when the slides were reviewed in a blinded manner by thesame pathologist on two separate occasions (with an intervalof approximately 6 months). DISCUSSION The primary goal of this study was to develop a histologic grading system for the diagnosis of small bowel allograft ACR. To achieve this, we evaluated 3,268 small bowel allo-graft biopsies obtained from adult patients who underwentsmall bowel transplantation at our institute during the pastdecade. On the basis of previously documented major histo-logic parameters for small bowel allograft acute rejection, theseverity of acute rejection was graded as indeterminate,mild, moderate, or severe. This grading system was validatedby retrospective correlation with clinical outcomes; more se-vere rejection episodes were associated with a greater prob-ability of unfavorable clinical outcomes. The excellent overallagreement among different pathologists regarding the histo-logic diagnosis of acute rejection using the proposed criteriasuggests that this system is reliable for the routine patho-logic evaluation of small bowel allograft acute rejection. Toour knowledge, the criteria in this study represent the firstschema for assessment of acute rejection severity in humansmall bowel allografts. Several pitfalls in the histologic evaluation of small bowel mucosal biopsies are worth mentioning. We ob-served that four histologic features are particularly usefulfor the routine pathologic diagnosis of small bowel allo-graft ACR, including architectural distortion, crypt apo-ptosis, crypt epithelial injury, activated lymphocyticinflammatory infiltration in the lamina propria. These arerelatively easily identifiable features that can be reliablyquantitatively or semiquantitatively assessed, with a highdegree of reproducibility among different pathologists. Be-cause artery sampling is extremely rare in intestinal mu-cosal biopsies, arteritis has limited diagnostic value in theevaluation of mucosal biopsy specimens, although its pres-ence invariably indicates moderate or severe acute rejec-tion. In this study, arteritis was identified in only 2 of the3,268 mucosal biopsies. If biopsies are obtained from iso-lated ulcers or necrotic regions, then an exact histologicdiagnosis of acute rejection may be difficult to establish. Insuch circumstances, careful clinical and endoscopic corre-lation is particularly important and repeated biopsies fromnonulcerated regions are often required. The quality of the infiltrate (activated lymphocytes mixed with some eosinophils and the differentiation of ACR from other condi-tions. The intensity of the infiltration is generally correlatedwith the severity of ACR (mild infiltration in mild ACR andintense infiltration in severe ACR). In our experience, thearea of infiltration is a less-reliable marker, because theinfiltration in low-grade ACR can be diffuse (although lessintense). Although eosinophils are frequently observed inintestinal mucosa, significantly increased of eosino-phils with coexistent activated lymphocytes and crypt apo-ptosis suggest acute rejection. Peyer 's patches are commonly sampled in mucosal biopsies, especially from the ileum. Al-though localized Peyer 's patches without significant lym- phoid activation do not indicate acute rejection, Peyer 's patches with lymphoid activation (characterized by lymphoidcells with open chromatin, diffuse infiltration into the sur-rounding mucosa, or mixtures with eosinophils and neutro-phils) are frequently associated with acute rejection. Thesignificance of lymphocytic cryptitis (increased numbers oflymphocytes in the crypt epithelium) is unclear. Althoughcryptitis is present in some cases of acute rejection, it is alsoobserved in biopsy tissues without ACR (such as those exhib-iting nonspecific enteritis, viral infections, or PTLD). Statis-tical analyses in this study failed to demonstrate a correla-tion between lymphocytic cryptitis and the diagnosis of acuterejection. Acute cryptitis (increased numbers of neutrophilsin the crypt epithelium) is usually associated with variouscauses of acute enteritis and is not a diagnostic criterion foracute rejection.WU ET AL. April 27, 2003 1247 Page 238Adequate tissue sampling is necessary for accurate histo- logic diagnosis. Because the distribution of acute rejection may be patchy, multiple biopsies (usually three to five) areoften required. Biopsies from either the ileum or the jejunumare sufficient for histologic evaluation in most cases, al-though sampling from both the ileum and the jejunum maybe required in some cases with ambiguous diagnoses. Thetissue obtained should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered for-malin for at least 1 hr before processing, and multiple sec-tions (usually 10 -15) should be examined for each biopsy. Differentiation between indeterminate and mild ACR is important for treatment planning. In our center, most of thehistologically diagnosed mild acute rejection episodes weretreated with increased immunosuppression (except when re-jection occurred in association with opportunistic infectionsor PTLD), whereas treatment for indeterminate rejectionswas liberal, based on clinical assessments. A histologic dis-tinction between these two categories can usually be madewith this grading system. Among the listed criteria, the num-ber of apoptotic bodies is most helpful ( /H110216 apoptotic per 10 crypts for indeterminate ACR /H110226 apoptotic bodies per 10 crypts for mild ACR), followed by perivenularinfiltration (less common for indeterminate ACR and morecommon for mild ACR). We observed that mild acute rejec-tion was associated with favorable clinical outcomes, whichlikely reflects successful immunosuppressive therapy. Inde-terminate for acute rejection was also associated with favor-able clinical outcomes, which likely reflects the minimal ac-tivity of acute rejection in this group and the use ofimmunosuppressive therapy for some of the patients. Various pathologic conditions must be differentiated from acute rejection, the most common of which include nonspe-cific enteritis, CMV infection, EBV infection, and PTLD.Acute enteritis is often attributable to bacterial or viral in-fection and is characterized by neutrophil-rich infiltration inthe lamina propria, with acute activated lymphocytes or increased apoptosis.CMV enteritis can sometimes be associated with increasedinflammatory infiltration and increased apoptosis, and thediagnosis is made with the identification of characteristicnuclear and cytoplasmic viral inclusions, with confirmatoryimmunohistochemical staining. PTLDare often associated with significant mononuclear infiltra-tion, and the diagnosis is made with the identification ofatypical lymphoid cells on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sec-tions, immunohistochemical staining Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA, andclonality analysis. Ischemia-reperfusion injury is generallynot a problem in the differential diagnosis, because it usuallyoccurs immediately after reperfusion, with characteristic his-tologic features that resolve within 2 to 3 days in most cases.For patients with delayed recovery from severe ischemia-reperfusion injury, the diagnosis of early superimposed acuterejection can sometimes be difficult. Under such conditions,the presence of activated lymphocytes and eosinophils, ongo-ing crypt damage, and significant crypt apoptosis suggestsacute rejection. CONCLUSION This study provides a reliable, predictive histopathologic schema for assessment of the severity of human small bowelacute rejection. The availability of this grading systemshould provide important guidance for effective immunosup-pressive treatment of patients who undergo small boweltransplantation. It should also facilitate information ex-change within and between transplantation centers. REFERENCES 1. Abu-Elmagd K, Reyes J, Todo S, et al.

They have been divided into several general pathologiccategories that have prognostic signicance. These include or monomorphicPTLD. The B-cell origin and contain Epstein-Barrvirus (EBV). H owever, PTLDs of T- or NK-cell origin have been described, and late-arising EBV-negative lymphoid tumors are becoming more fre-quently r eported in this population. Other lymphoid neoplasms, such as those arising from mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALTomas), haverecently been recognized in transplant patients, and their relationship toPTLD is uncertain. Multicentric PTLD may represent either advanced-stagedisease or multiple independent primary tumors. Likewise, recurrent PTLDmay represent true recurrence or the emergence of a second primary tumor.Transplant patients are also at risk for other op portunistic neoplasms, in- cluding EBV-associated leiomyosarcomas that may be seen alone or in con-junction with PTLD. This underscores the necessity for pathologic diag-nosis of mass lesions in this patient population. The pathologist should striveto categorize the form of post-transplant lymphoproliferation in accordancewith currently accepted criteria. The diagnosis should inc orporate the histo- pathologic appearance, cell phenotype, clonal status, and EB viral status.The pathologist may play a special role in guiding therapy by ascertainingthe presence of such markers as CD20 on tumor cells. Specialized tech-niques, such as molecular analysis of oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes andevaluation of host:donor status of PTLD, may play im portant roles in diag- nostic evaluation in the future. The proper management of post-transplant lymphoproliferative dis- order (PTLD) is aided greatly by precise pathologic diagnosis.Transplant patients, like other patients, may develop non-neoplasticmass lesions, or they may develop tumors other than PTLD (1).Episodes of suspected allograft rejection may in reality representallograft-restricted PTLD, or may be due to concurrent acute rejec-tion and PTLD (2-5). Clinical recurrence of PTLD may reflect re-emergence of the same tumor, development of a separate tumorAuthor's afliation: M.A. NalesnikDivision of Transplantation Pathology, University Pennsylvania,USA Correspondence to: Michael A. Nalesnik, M.D.Associate Professor of Pathology Division of Transplantation Pathology University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Room E1549 Bioscience clone, or the appearance of a completely unrelated neoplasm (6, 7). The importance of pathologic diagnosis to management of PTLD is further emphasized by the variety of lymphoid tumors that comprise this syndrome (8). Some of these tumors are prone toregression and some are not, some contain the Epstein-Barr virus(EBV) and some do not, some are monoclonal and some are not,some are of B-cell origin whereas others may be of T-cell or NK-cellorigin. The classical role of the pathologist is to rst describe disease, then to categorize variants of the disease and nally to explain theevents underlying disease emergence, progression and resolution.Progress in these areas does not proceed uniformly, and advance-ment in one area often impacts or redenes the others. It is helpfulto keep these principles in mind as we summarize the various devel-opments that have contributed to our current understanding ofPTLD, and as we relate these lessons to the practical questions thatsurround the pathologic diagnosis of these disorders. Development of PTLD classication systems Pathologic interpretation of PTLDs was predated by the clinical observation that transplant patients appeared prone to developlymphomatous growths (9). The seminal studies dening the con-cept that a range of lymphoproliferations could occur in the post-transplant setting were performed by Frizzera et al. (10) on lesionsthat arose in kidney transplant patients. In 1981, there were nomonoclonal antibodies to type lymphocytes, and neither routineflow cytometry nor molecular clonal analysis with which to analyzetissues. Using histologic analysis alone, this group was able to de-ne two conditions that arose as abnormal growth of B lympho-cytes. These lesions were named polymorphic diffuse B-cell hyper-plasia and polymorphic diffuse B-cell lymphoma. These prolifer-ations had in common a diffuse, invasive growth pattern and avariety of cell sizes, representing a wide range of lymphoid matu-ration, on microscopic examination. The two conditions were dis-tinguishable from each other on the basis of large bizarre cells andnecrosis that were present in cases of polymorphic lymphoma, polymorphic hyperplasia. Based on immunoglobulin sections, it was determined that the polymorphichyperplasias were polyclonal and therefore reactive, and that thepolymorphic lymphomas contained an emerging monoclonal popu-lation of cells. The authors presumed that the large bizarre cells insuch cases represented this emerging monoclonal malignancy. Since 89 Transplant Infectious Disease 2001: 3: 88-96concomitant studies from this group also identied the presence ofthe Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in all of these lesions, it was con-cluded that the polymorphic B-cell hyperplasias most likely repre-sented virus-driven growths and that this process could ultimatelygive rise to malignant neoplasms. On this basis it was proposedthat antiviral therapy might prove useful in cases of polymorphicdiffuse B-cell hyperplasia, whereas antineoplastic therapy would bemore appropriate for the polymorphic lymphomas. Im portantly, the authors also observed that the behavior of a given tumor could notalways be predicted from the histopathology alone. Clonal analysis of lymphoid growths became clinically available shortly thereafter. The Stanford group applied this approach tolymphoproliferations that arose in their transplant patients and con-cluded that all of the lesions were monoclonal, regardless of histo-logic appearance (11). Study of additional cases from this series,particularly cases of multiple concurrent tumors, revealed that sep-arate monoclonal tumors could arise from separate clones, repre-senting multiple independent primary tumors. The philosophy ofreduced immunosuppression guided therapy of PTLD in the Pitts-burgh transplant series (12). This approach had the side effect ofallowing follow-up study of the behavior of PTLDs of differenthistopathologic appearances in the setting of partially restored hostimmune competence (13). Both polymorphic regress in a number of cases following reduc-tion or discontinuance of immunosuppression. We therefore electedto group these conditions together under the heading of ''polymor-phic PTLD'' (14). This had an added practical benet in that itsimplied analysis of small biopsies in which the histologic differen-tiation between polymorphic hyperplasia and polymorphiclymphoma was problematic. Some lesions in this series continuedto progress despite reduction of immunosuppression. A number ofthese had in common a more uniform appearance of lymphoid cells.Similar tumors had been recognized by the Minnesota group asimmunoblastic sarcomas and had been separated from the polymor-phic lesions in their series (10). H owever, we also observed tumors that did not t the criteria of immunoblastic sarcomas (using thethen-current terminology) but were also of uniform cell type andprogressed despite therapy. As we were able to detect the EBVin these tumors, the relationship of such tumors to standard non-Hodgkin's lymphomas was unknown. We therefore elected to de-scriptively group these lesions together as ''monomorphic PTLD''(14). As more PTLDs arose, limitations of the descriptive pathologic classication systems began to appear. Lesions with features inter-mediate between polymorphic B-cell hyperplasia and polymorphicB-cell lymphoma were described (15). The ability to detect EBV Page 248Nalesnik : Pathology of PTLD within routine pathologic samples improved (16) and gave rise to nosological questions. Was the presence of EBV necessary for thediagnosis of PTLD? What was to be done with lesions that con-tained EBV but fell short of the histologic criteria for inclusion intoone of the categories dened for PTLD? The answer to the rst question had been given from a practical standpoint all along. Although EBV was recognized as an impor-tant cofactor of PTLD, none of the classication systems had re-quired the presence of the virus for a diagnosis of PTLD. Theanswer to the second question will be considered under the headingof PTLD and EBV , below. In the Pittsburgh series it was recognized that a small percen- tage of PTLDs contained rearrangements of the c-myc proto-onco-gene, and that such tumors had a worse outcome than the overallPTLD population (17). H owever, it r emained for Knowles et al. (18) to apply molecular genetic techniques to the study of PTLD in auniform fashion, and to integrate it into their classicationsystem. Their ndings, based on their experience with PTLD in heart transplant patients, sup ported and extended earlier studies. Using molecular clonal analysis they found that all lesions that appearedhistologically as polymorphic B-cell hyperplasias were actuallymonoclonal of a misnomer, as hyperplasias do not typically containmonoclonal components. They conrmed the observation poly-morphic hyperplasias and polymorphic lymphomas often, but notalways, regress with conservative therapy, and they also noted thathistologic forms intermediate between these two categories existed.Nevertheless, they retained these two terms under the general cat-egory of polymorphic PTLD (or PT-LPD as an alternative acronym).Their molecular analysis of PTLD showed that anomalies describedin standard lymphomas, such as p53 or N-ras mutations or c-mycrearrangements, occurred only in the category of PTLD that histo-logically resembled lymphomas, i.e., the monomorphic PTLDs.They recommended that the term monomorphic be dropped andreplaced by standard lymphoma nomenclature for these lesions.They also recognized a benign-appearing diffuse growth of matureplasma cells, so-called plasma cell hyperplasia, as representative ofan early form of PTLD. Such lesions were invariably polyclonal orcontained at most a minor clonal component. These workers alsosuggested that such early cases, which commonly appeared in thehead and neck region, represented most or all of the cases in thePittsburgh series that underwent regression. (In passing, we notethat regression in our series was not limited to such cases). Thus,by 1995, the general categories of PTLD had been distilled intohyperplasias, polymorphic PTLDs, and Hematopathology classication system of PTLD Neither the classication system of Knowles et al. (18) nor any of the earlier systems (10-14) inc orpor ated entities such as T-cell lym- phomas or Hodgkin's disease, which were also being described intransplant patients (19, 20). In 1996 the Society of Hematopathology(SH) convened a meeting to review a collected series of PTLD casesand to attempt to inc orporate the entities into a common classi- cation system (8). Their system, although more inclusive than pre-vious systems, likewise recognized three major categories in thisfamily of disorders: a) lymphoid hyperplasias, lymphomatous monomorphicPTLDs. They also included an ''Other'' category to descriptivelyinclude some of the more recently described variants of lymphoidneoplams observed in transplant patients. The classication is im-portant because it represents a consensus among hematopatholo-gists as to how to approach such lesions. Despite the fact that onlyone of the principals of the three prior classication systems partici-pated in the discussions, the outcome was remarkably similar toprior attempts to classify these disorders. This classication worksfrom the strengths of a greater prior experience with the range ofPTLDs at this point in time, and from the expertise of the panel instandard lymphoma classication. A modied version of this classi-cation is given here (Table). Early lesions in this classication system include plasma cell hyperplasia, lesions resembling infectious mononucleosis, and otherforms of atypical lymphoid hyperplasias characterized by preser-vation of the underlying architecture. Such growths are usuallypolyclonal but may contain one or several minor clonal subpopula-tions as well. These lesions often regress following reduction ofimmunosuppression, but, like infectious mononucleosis itself, mayon occasion act in an aggressive fashion and lead to the death ofthe patient. This underscores an im portant point. Many of these lesions are rapidly growing proliferations that require some form ofintervention for control. The fact that a particular PTLD may proveto be ''benign'' in a pathological sense does not imply that it willnot progress if untreated. Polymorphic PTLDs represent destructive lesions that inltrate and destroy underlying tissue. The emphasis in the SH classi-cation was placed on recognition of a wide range of B-cell matu-ration in these cases, as opposed to the uniform appearance charac-teristic of lymphomas. The features originally used to differentiatepolymorphic B-cell hyperplasia from polymorphic lymphoma, i.e.,necrosis and recognized, but subdivision intopolymorphic hyperplasia or lymphoma was not considered essen- Page 249Nalesnik : Pathology of PTLD tial, as it was recognized that these lesions tend to behave similarly. Whereas immunocytochemical staining may give variable results interms of clonality, molecular studies show that virtually all of thesetumors are monoclonal. The response to therapy is variable in poly-morphic PTLD. Some tumors regress following reduction of im-munosuppression and some do not. At the time that the SH classi-cation was proposed there was no way to predict the behavior ofan individual polymorphic tumor. Similar to the nding of Knowles(18), this panel of investigators concluded that abnormalities ofoncogenes or tumor suppressor genes were not a feature of poly-morphic PTLD. The term monomorphic was retained and used for PTLDs that morphologically resembled non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The SHgroup recommended using lymphoma (i.e.,the Revised European American Lymphoma system [21]) to categor-ize such lesions, while including the term ''PTLD'' in the diagnosis.Most such tumors were of the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma sub-type, although other entities such as Burkitt lymphoma were alsoseen. In some cases, molecular studies could show abnormalities ofthe ras or p53 genes as noted above. In this collected series, reduc-tion of immunosuppression was r eported in six p atients. Two under- went sustained remission, two went into remission but developedtumor relapse, and two did not respond to this therapy. Thus itappeared that at least some examples of lymphomatous forms ofPTLD could respond to reestablishment of host immunologic sur-veillance, although clear-cut responsiveness was seen in only a mi-nority of these advanced lesions. In addition to B-cell lymphomas, the existence of post-transplant T-cell lymphomas was also recognized and was placed within thecategory of monomorphic PTLD. In contrast, lesions that resembledHodgkin's disease or B-cell lymphomas with a large number of Tcells were placed in the ''Other'' category, as were post-transplantplasma cell neoplasms such as plasmacytoma or multiple myeloma. Specic topics in PTLD pathology EBV and PTLD None of the classication systems described above has required documentation of intratumoral EBV for a tissue diagnosis of PTLD.The SH classication acknowledges that a pro portion of PTLDs, approximately 10%, fail to show evidence of the virus using pres-ently available methods of detection. Nevertheless, that group feltthat it was appropriate to include all such EBV-negative cases underthe umbrella term of PTLD. Thus, at present, any lymphoma thatoccurs in the post-transplant patient population is by denition con- 91 Transplant Infectious 2001: 8, 10, 14, 18, 27, and 40. 2Diagnostic line should incorporate histologic appearance, cell phenotype, clonal and EB viral status. Table sidered to be a variant of PTLD. This highlights a current limitation of our knowledge. Clearly some spontaneous lymphomas will arisein this population and be diagnosed as lymphomatous/monomor-phic PTLDs. Most likely (although not necessarily) these tumorswill not contain the EBV . H owever, we are not curr ently able to distinguish such tumors from those whose emergence is linked insome way to the immunosuppressed post-transplant state. Indeed,it may be that even spontaneously arising lymphomas become clin-ically evident at an earlier stage in their evolution within this pa-tient population due to a decrease in host immune surveillance. Leblond et al. (22) r eported a series of 11 transplant patients who developed EBV-negative PTLD. Tumors arose at a median timeof 60 months, with the earliest tumor arising at 6 months post-transplant. In contrast, EBV-positive tumors arose at a median of 6months, with the earliest arising 1 month post-transplant. Mediansurvival in the virus-negative group was 1 month, compared to 37months in the EBV-positive patient subset. Dotti et al. (23) alsonoted that a high pro portion of late-arising PTLDs in their series appeared to be EBV-negative. They r eported that 56% of PTLDs arising 22 months or later post-transplant failed to show evidence Page 250Nalesnik : Pathology of PTLD of intratumoral EBV . Such tumors were associated with a median survival time of 7 months. A pattern of late-onset EBV-negative PTLD was also observed in our own series, in which virus-negative cases occurred at a me-dian time of 50 months post-transplant as compared to 10 monthsfor EBV-positive PTLD (24). Interestingly, we observed that EBV-negative tumors accounted for only 2% of PTLD prior to 1991, butfor 23% of PTLD after that time in our series. In contrast to otherreports, we did nd that occasional cases responded to reduction of immunosuppression despite the absence of EBV in the tumors. Themechanism by which such putative regression may occur is ob-scure. However, it should be stressed that the majority of these tumors are r epor tedly recalcitrant to therapy and are associated with a worse prognosis than EBV-positive tumors as a group (22,23). T-cell, plasma transplant patients Both T-cell and NK-cell PTLD are included under the monomorphic category in the SH classication system (8). Post-transplant T-celllymphomas were r eported at least as early as 1987 and the absence of EBV in index cases indicated that not all post-transplant tumorscould be shown to be related to this virus (25). Dockrell et al. (20)estimated that only 38% of T-cell PTLDs contained the EBV . Prog-nosis has generally been considered poor. H owever, Kim et al. (26) reported a T -cell PTLD that arose approximately 2 months post- transplant and underwent regression following a reduction of im-munosuppression. In this case the tumor was negative for both EBVand HTLV-1, and clonal rearrangements of the gamma chain of theT-cell receptor were demonstrated. Gamma/delta T-cell lymphomastend to have a hepatosplenic distribution and have also been de-scribed in transplant patients (27). Other examples of post-trans-plant T-cell lymphoma demonstrate clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta gene (28). Hsi et al. (29) recently r eported a case of NK-cell PTLD in a renal transplant patient. This tumor had a monomorphic appearance,was EBV-negative and was unresponsive to therapy. Kwong et al.(30) r eported a similar dismal outcome in a renal transplant patient who developed a disseminated EBV-positive NK-derived PTLD. Incontrast, Mukai et al. (31) used to suc-cessfully manage a nasal NK cell lymphoma that arose in a renaltransplant patient. Post-transplant Hodgkin's disease has been uncommonly re- ported in transplant recipients. Rowlings et al. (32) noted an in-creased frequency of this tumor following allogeneic bone-marrow 92 Transplant Infectious Disease 2001: 3: 88-96transplantation. Five of six such cases contained EBV and arosemore than 2.5 years post-transplant. We observed a case of late-arising Hodgkin's-like lymphoma in a liver transplant patient (33).In this case chemotherapy was required and the patient has enjoyedlong-term remission. Smets et al. (34) also noted that Hodgkin's-likeforms of PTLD appeared to be unresponsive to immunomodulationand required antineoplastic chemotherapy for control. A possibly related T-cell-rich B-cell PTLD was r eported by Grosso et al. (35). The precise relationship of such B-cell tumors tospontaneous Hodgkin's disease is unknown at present. In contrast to reactive post-transplant plasmacytic hyperplasias, malignant post-transplant of PTLD. Knowles et al. (18) inc orpor ated multiple myeloma into their most advanced category of disease and the SHclassication includes both multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma-like PTLD within the ''Other'' category. These tumors may be EBVpositive or negative (36). In some cases the PTLD may present asan extramedullary plasmacytoma and later manifest as multiplemyeloma (37). In other cases it may present as an ascites-type tumor(38). One post-transplant extramedullary plasmacytoma in ourseries presented as an aural polyp. This was successfully excisedbut was followed several months later by a monomorphic large B-cell PTLD of the lower extremity (39). This latter tumor autologous lymphokine-actived killer Low-grade gastric phomas that arise mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTlymphomas) were rst observed by Wotherspoon et al. (40), whonoted that such lesions were associated with Helicobacter but not with EBV . Hsi et al. (41) recently described several post-transplantMALT lymphomas in their series. These late-appearing B-cell tu-mors arose on the average 7 years after transplantation. The histo-logic appearance was that of low-grade marginal zone lymphoma.No evidence of EBV was seen but Helicobacter was observed in gastric cases. All patients were alive at last follow-up and theauthors stress that proper recognition of these lymphomas wouldhelp to avoid unnecessarily aggressive therapy. Host versus donor origin PTLD At least 90% of PTLD that occur in solid organ transplant patients arise from recipient cells (42), and the opposite applies in the caseof bone marrow transplantation. Donor-derived PTLD in organtransplant patients may have a predilection for the allograft (43).Some authors have suggested that they may have a worse (2), andsome a better (44), prognosis than recipient origin PTLD. Furtherstudies are needed in this area. Page 251Nalesnik : Pathology of PTLD BCL-6 mutations and PTLD It has been notoriously difcult to predict the behavior of poly- morphic PTLDs. Penn (45) estimated that approximately 31% ofPTLD overall resolve under reduction or withdrawal of immuno-suppression alone, whereas others have placed this gure nearer50% (46). In our experience, the majority of PTLDs responsive tothis form of therapy include the early and polymorphic categories(47). H owever, the behavior of individual polymorphic tumors is usually determined by clinical trial, and the distinction betweenhistologic subtypes within this group is not helpful in predictingbehavior. In their approach to this problem, Cesarman et al. (48) studied bcl-6 mutations in PTLDs. The bcl-6 gene encodes a transcriptionalrepressor (49) that is rearranged in approximately 35-40% of dif-fuse large B-cell lymphomas (50, 51). Cesarman et al. (48) foundmutations of this gene in 40% of polymorphic PTLD and concludedthat the presence of this mutation predicted refractoriness to theeffect of reduced immunosuppressoion as well as shorter survival.Further studies are needed to sup port this im portant contention. Since the bcl-6 gene is also mutated in 30% of normal germinalcenter B cells (52), the interpretation of this nding is unclear. As-suming that this observation is upheld, it is not clear if the genemutation itself contributes to tumor behavior, or if bcl-6 mutationacts as a surrogate marker for a particular stage of B cell develop-ment that is less responsive to host immune control mechanisms.Our own studies (Nalesnik et al., manuscript in preparation) suggestthat EBV-negative tumors express bcl-6 protein but not CD138, con-sistent with a germinal center stage of development, and that EBV-positive tumors are usually bcl-6 negative, CD138 positive, sugges-tive of a postgerminal center phenotype. We have not been able tocorrelate bcl-6 protein expression itself with tumor behavior. EBV-positive leiomyosarcomas in immunodeciency states In 1995 Lee et al. (53) r eported the e xistence of EBV-positive sar- comas in several pediatric transplant patients. These tumors, which have been called ''post-transplant spindle cell tumors,'' have beenshown to be leiomyosarcomas by immunohistochemical analysis.Similar tumors have been described in AIDS patients (54). Cellsexplanted from one of these tumors showed low levels of the EBVreceptor CD21 and expressed lytic EB viral proteins (55), conrmingthe fact that active intracellular EBV infection was present. In at least some cases the tumors contained clonal EBV (53). In several cases these EBV-associated leiomyosarcomas have arisen inthe setting of prior PTLD. In one case it was shown that the sameclone of EBV was present in both the PTLD and the post-transplant 93 Transplant Infectious Disease 2001: 3: 88-96leiomyosarcoma (56). Such examples conrm the necessity of patho-logic diagnosis of mass lesions in transplant patients. Recurrent PTLD Clinical recurrence of PTLD has been estimated to occur in approxi- mately 5% of cases (6). Wu et al. (6) examined a series of 11 suchpatients and found that the recurrent tumors comprised a hetero-geneous assortment. In some cases the recurrence was morpholog-ically and clonally identical to the original tumor. In several casesPTLD recurred in a more aggressive form. For example, patientswith mononucleosis-like PTLD could present later with polymor-phic PTLD, and patients whose original disease was polymorphicPTLD might later develop one of the lymphomatous forms of PTLD.In one case, as noted above, a recurrent ''PTLD'' was found onbiopsy to actually be post-transplant leiomyosarcoma (56). For thisreason biopsy of such recurrences is encouraged. Suggested pathologic evaluation of PTLD General comments to the pathologist The diagnosis of PTLD is best made on tissue biopsy. Cytologicalpreparations are useful, particularly in the analysis of effusions (57),and can provide adequate diagnostic material particularly if ancil-lary studies such as phenotypic, clonal and viral analysis are alsoperformed. Since PTLDs may contain large areas of necrosis, excision of involved lymph node or tumor is preferred over a needle biopsy;however, in many cases a needle biopsy may be the only source of tissue available. If such specimens are compromised by extensivenecrosis it may still be possible to read through the necrotic areasand identify the cells as mononuclear in origin. Usually recuts willshow at least a few spared tumor cells that resemble the cell ghostspresent in areas of coagulative necrosis. In these cases we nd thatimmunostain for EBV latent membrane protein may still provideuseful information. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr early RNA (EBER), which is usually more sensitive than EBV immuno-stain in parafn sections, is essentially worthless in necrotic areasin our experience. Although it would be ideal to sample each tumor in cases of multicenter PTLD, this is seldom possible and the surgeon shouldbe encouraged to sample the largest or most clinically ominouslesion. Although each tumor may represent a separate clone, mostlesions in multicentric PTLD have a similar appearance. The histo-logic grade of tumor may be underestimated in multicentric casesif a marginally enlarged lymph node is sampled on the rationalethat it is the easiest site to biopsy. In this case the surgeon runs the Page 252Nalesnik : Pathology of PTLD risk of having sampled a reactive node that may contain evidence of EBV infection, while the primary lymphomatous PTLD lies else-where. As the response to therapy is followed, it is also useful toconsider biopsy of any lesion that responds in an atypical fashion,particularly if regression is documented in other concurrent lesions. Histologic evaluation should rst ascertain whether the lesion ts into any of the accepted categories of PTLD. In some cases it may hap-pen that EBV is demonstrated within what otherwise appears to bean innocuous inflammation. The approach of Finn et al. (5) provides amodel that we nd useful in handling such cases. Those investigatorsexamined the frequency of EBER-positive cells in intestinal allograftbiopsies in a pediatric population. A continuum of alterations was ob-served, beginning with with EBER-positive inflammation wereat risk for the development of PTLD, but reserved the term PTLD forthose cases in which frank histologic evidence of polymorphic ormonomorphic PTLD was present. Diagnostic reporting of PTLD The nomenclature proposed by the Society of Hematopathology pro-vides the most comprehensive and uniform basis for diagnosis andwe recommend its use for routine r epor ting. A revised version of this system, inc orpor ating recently described variants, is given (Table). It may be difcult to apply this categorization to small specimens orthose with extensive necrosis. At the least, an effort should be madeto differentiate those lesions with retention of underlying architecturefrom those with invasive growth patterns. The former most likelyrepresent a form of ''early'' or hyperplastic PTLD, and it is im portant that the responses of such lesions be separated from those of poly-morphic or lymphomatous PTLDs when the results of different thera-peutic interventions are compared. Phenotypic evaluation should be performed as part of the work- up of PTLD. The form that this takes is dependent upon local re-sources. At a minimum we recommend that phenotypic identi-cation of B- or T-cell tumor origin be undertaken. Therapeuticmonoclonal antibodies directed against the B cell antigen CD20 ap-peared to produce some examples of impressive remissions in earlystudies (58). Fortuitously, the immunostain for CD20 can be per-formed on routinely processed parafn embedded tissues andshould be part of the workup of all PTLDs. Clonal analysis of immunoglobulin genes may be used to sup- port the diagnosis of PTLD. In some cases it provides the infor- mation required to differentiate hyperplastic (early) PTLD frommore advanced forms of this disorder. H owever, we stress that both polymorphic and monomorphic (lymphomatous) PTLD are almostalways monoclonal, and the mere demonstration of monoclonality 94 Transplant Infectious Disease 2001: 3: 88-96does not itself predict tumor behavior in response to modulationof immunosuppression or other forms of therapy. In the case ofmulticentric or recurrent tumors, clonal analysis may be helpful instaging the disease since histologically identical tumors may actu-ally represent separate independent primary tumors (7). Clonal analysis may also be required to establish a diagnosis of lymphomatous PTLD of T-cell origin. The beta chain of the T-cellreceptor appears to be most commonly rearranged; h owever, ev alu- ation of the gamma chain may also be required, and it is notedthat gamma-delta T-cell lymphomas usually have a hepatosplenicdistribution. We recommend that a comment regarding tumor clo-nality be appended to the diagnostic line of PTLD. If no clonalstudies were performed, this should also be stated. We believe that it is im portant to make an effort to identify the EBV within PTLDs, and that this should be part of routine patho-logic evaluation. As more EBV-negative PTLDs are uncovered itbecomes im portant to document their pathologic features and re- sponse to therapy. In some cases cytotoxic T-cell therapy may beconsidered, and since this treatment is actually directed against thevirus-infected tumor cells, the presence of viral targets is necessaryfor this form of therapy to be effective. Molecular analysis of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes will undoubtedly play an increasingly im portant role in predicting behavior. At present, these techniques are not widely available andonly a few genes have been analyzed. As high throughput microar-ray analysis becomes a reality we can anticipate that the character-ization of PTLD will become much more precise and treatment regi-mens will be designed for more uniformly dened subpopulationsof this disease. At present we consider this to be an optional tech-nique for routine clinical practice. Likewise, we do not considerevaluation of host versus donor origin of PTLD to be necessaryfrom a clinical standpoint except in those cases in which cell ther-apy is to be employed, since HLA matching of effector and targettumor cell is necessary. In summary, we stress that it is im portant for the pathologist to be aware that the diagnosis of post-transplant lymphoproliferationscovers a large but knowable number of conditions that can beplaced into several general categories. Pathologic diagnosis shouldincorporate the histologic form of disease in as precise a manner as possible, phenotype of involved cell, and a determination of clonaland EB viral status of the lesion. Clinicopathologic correlationshould seek to stage the disease using standard systems such asthe Ann Arbor Staging Classication with Cotswald Modications(59). Only in this way will we get a clear picture of the range ofabnormal lymphoid growths in immunosuppressed transplant pa-tients and be in a position to design rational strategies for thesediverse conditions that exist under the generic heading of PTLD.

Utilizatio n of organ s from dono rs with maligna ncy, allocation of orga ns to tra nsplant ca ndidates with a history of mal ignan cy, and factors rel ated to develop ment and tre atment of recurrent or de novo posttransplant neo plasias serve a s referential point s from which to raise a num ber of issue s. The appli cation of immunoth erapy, particula rly cell therapy , to both infectious di sease and ne oplasia in the solid organ devel opment. The se and additio nal topics we re discusse d and debate d at this symp osium. Neoplasi a in the Donor Cancer may be tran sferre d from an o rgan don or to a recipi ent as a result of occult malign ancy in the donate d organ o r misdi agno sis, in a kno wn situati on su ch as when a sm all renal cell carcin oma o ccurs in the do nor ki dney an d unde rgoes wide ex cision, in a low-ri sk situation such as when the dono r has a known skin ma lignan cy or carci noma in situ of the cerv ix, or when a known cancer was believe d to have bee n cured. In ad dition, de no vo maligna ncy may arise fro m either graft parenchym al cells or passenger cells in the gr aft. Transmission of donor-related maligna ncies was examine d from multipl e perspe ctives, begin ning with insi ght b y Jose ph Bue ll, MD,[1] of the University of Cin cinnati, from the Isr ael Penn Intern wa s instituted in 1969 an d provi des b oth cu rrent and hi storical perspectives. In the past, many types of tumors have b een co nsidered ab solute contrain dicatio ns to organ donatio n. Tod ay, however, 2 tumors -- chorio carcinoma (93% tra nsmissio n, 64 % mortality) and melano ma (7 4% transmi ssion, 60% mortality) -- fa ll into this categ ory. In addition, since lu ng cancers and sarco mas, particula rly high -grade vari ants, also be have aggre ssively, procu ring organs from dono rs with these tumors i s not re commende d. Renal Cell Carcinoma had a high (61%) rate of tumor development, but a lower mortality rate (23%), if they received a graft from a patient with renal cell carcinoma. Furthermore, 14 cases of renal transplantation in which tumors in the donors we re identified and excised prior to transplantation were reported. All tumors were </= 4 cm in size (median 2 cm) with negative resection margins and Fuhrman grade I-II/VI histology based on rapid permanent histologic sections. No tumor development had been reported at a median follow-up time of 69 months. Renal cell carcinomas are more frequently detected as small lesions; this allows for the resection of earlier-stage tumors and improved survival. It wa s also noted that some renal tumors such as oncocytomas or angiomyolipomas are benign, regardless of size, and may be excised, whereupon the remaining kidney can be used for transplantation.[3] The reason that donors with cancer are even considered is the current organ shortage, according to L.Thomas Chin, MD, [4] of the University of Wisconsin , Madison, and Arthur I. Sagalowsky, MD,[5] of the University of Southwestern Texas, Dallas. The risk of cancer recurrence (in the donor) following partial nephrectomy for tumors < 4 cm in diameter was estimated at 0% to 3%. The incidence of bilateral involvement was estima ted at 10% to 20% for familial or papillary (Fuhrman nuclear grade I-II). Metastatic RCC may occur in tumors < 3 cm in diameter, and may occur in the donor as late as 20 years after the primary disease.[4,5] Most investigators suggest that donors should be disease- free for at least 2-5 years, and potential recipients with prior RCC should be disease-free for at least 2 years before transplantation. Central Nervous System (CNS) Tumors CNS tumors accounted for 21% of all cases in the IPITTR. Four risk factors for tumor transmission were identified: high-grade (grade III-IV) histology, previous surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The rate of tumor transmission was 7% in the absence of risk factors, but rose to 30% to 40% in the presence of 1 or more of these conditions. Development of CNS tumors in recipients was associated with a high mortality rate; the Cincinnati group advocates limited autopsies of donors with intracer ebral hemorrhage of unknown etiology to rule out CNS tumors. Interpretation of the literature on CNS tumors is difficult for a number of reasons: different pathologic terms may be applied to the same tumors, some series do not report histologic types of CNS tumors, and some tumors may show differ ent grades of differentiation either in a synchronous or metachronous fashion. The spread of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) recapitulates normal glial cell development, and the tumor invades not by lymphatic or vascular spread, but by migration of individual cells wi thin the CNS, observed Eric C. Holland, MD, PhD, [6] of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New Yo rk, NY. Mass lesions disrupt the blood-brain barrier, which in turn raises the question of spre ad of tumor cells outside of the CNS even prior to surgery or other forms of therapy. Almost all GBM have Ras activation and 70% have hyperactivity of Akt and downstream activation of mTOR, thought to promote tumor cell survival. Sirolimus and its derivatives have potent mTOR inhibitory activity, and blockade of the Akt-mTOR pathway has antitumor activity in other models. The possibility of a beneficial side effect of sirolimus in this circumstance was raised, although animal models suggest that this approach alone will likely not be curative for these tumors. The antiangiogenic effects of sirolimus in relation to its mTOR inhibitory function were discussed by Edward K. Geissler, PhD,[7] of the University of Regensburg, Germany.[8] He indicated that this antitumor effect was active at immunosuppressi ve doses, and suggested that sirolimus may be an exception to the rule that immunosuppressive drugs favor tumor development. Page 257A wide variation (0.5% to 18%) in transmission rates for GBM is reported. The possibility that rates may also vary among different organs was ra ised as a point worthy of study. The present unfortunate circumstance is that approximately 130,000 patients die annually from GBM in the United States. Continued explorati on of specific circumstances associated with minimal risk of tumor transmission may allow some of these individuals to serve as organ donors in the future. Breast and Colon Cancer Using recent cancer screening figures[9] and current donation rates, Reid B. Adams, MD,[10] of the University of Virginia, Charlottsv ille, estimated that inclusion of pat ients with stage 0-1 breast or colon cancer would result in a mere 9-10 addi tional donors per year. It was pointed out that a higher proportion of cancers might be detected at early stages in the future, potentially increasing the number of potential donors. Whether or not organs from such patients are suit able for transplantation is currently unknown, and both historical registry data and data concerning stage-specific cancer survival are starting points from which to estimate the risks of tumor transmission. Older series, comprised mainly of patients with advanced-stage cancer s, indicated a transmission rate of 6% for breast cancer and 25% for colon cancer. On the basis of more recent figures, it was suggested that patients with stage 0 or 1 colon cancer might be considered as organ donors following defin itive treatment resolution of their tumors. White males could donate immediately after therap y, whereas an interval of 5 years might be required for females or black males, as predicated by current survival figures. In the case of breast cancer, patients with stage 0 tumors, excluding those with high-risk features such as extensive carcinoma in situ, might be considered for organ donation at any time following definitive therapy. Patients with st age 1 T1a or T1b tumors could be considered after 10 years of disease-free follow-up. Patients with T1c or hi gher-stage breast cancer are not considered acceptable donors. Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer in the donor was addressed by Stephen C. Jacobs, MD,[3] University of Maryland, Baltimore. The use of widespread prostate spec ific antigen screening and early biopsy has led to prolonged survival in patients with prostate carcinoma, particularly in the case of low-grade histology. Dr. Jacobs observed that, given the near universal occurrence of this cancer with increased age, many transplants are undoubtedly performed using organs from donors with occult prostate carcinoma. If the patient with pr ostate cancer is a renal transplant candidate, therapies such as brachytherapy or cryosurgery that spare the bladder from radiation exposure might be considered. There have been no cancer-related deaths at this time in his series of renal transplant recipients who developed prostate carcinoma. Metastatic Disease The use of organs from donors with metastatic carcinoma of any type is associated with a high rate of tumor transmission and should be avoided, noted H. Myron Kauffman, MD,[11] consultant for the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) , in his perspective on donor malignancy based on UNOS Tumor Registry data.[12] An analysis from this database revealed that the frequency of tumors in donors was 0.04% with an overall tr ansmission rate of 0.016%. It was noted that, even in the case of good-prognosis RCC, the risk for recurrence in the nonimmunosuppressed population was 9.6% after 5 years. This figure has implications for both donors and potential recipient swithahistory ofthistumor. Similarly, therecurrencerateformelanom aintheoriginal Page 258host was up to 1% after 15 years. The risk of cancer transmission must be balanced against the need for life-saving transplantation, but UNOS caut ions against using donors with a history of certain types of cancer including choriocarcinoma; melanoma; lymphoma; GBM; medulloblastoma; or cancers of the lung, kidney, breast, or colon. Recommendations The risk of tumor transmission must be weighed against the risk of death without transplantation and the benefits of organ transplant ation on a case-by-case basis. The patient must be fully informed and involved in the decision to consider use of an organ from a donor with a possible malignancy. Full disclosure to and involvement of the patient at every step of this process was a theme echoed by a number of the speakers. Neoplasia in the Transplant Candidate and Recipient Solid organ transplant recipients are at particula r risk for the development of cancer (recurrent and de novo ) after transplantation; a major factor is th e effect of immunosuppressive drug therapy necessary to prevent organ rejection. The overall recurrence rate of tumors in transplant recipients with preexistent cancer is 21%, a ccording to data from the IPITTR by E. Steven Woodle, MD, of the University of Cincinnati, Ohio.[13] Cancers with a low (</= 8%) recurrence rate include uterine, cervical, testicular, thyroid, and early RCC. \"Incidental\" asymptomatic RCC had a recurrence rate of 8% with a 3% mortality ra te, whereas symptomatic RCC had a 43% recurrence and 26% mortality rate. Patients with RCC had a signifi cant rate of recurrent disease even after a 5-year disease-free interval prior to transplant ation. Patients with prior prostate cancer had a recurrence rate of 18% and a tumor-related mortalit y rate of 7.8%. The risk of recurrence of stage 3 cancer was more than double the risk of stage 1 or 2 cancer. The recurrence rate for bladder cancer was 18% with a mortality rate of 12%. The overall recurrence rate of breast cancer was 14% with a mortality rate of 8%. Patients wi th stage 1 or 2 disease had favorable survival compared with patients with stage 3 disease. The recurrence rate of vulvar cancer decreased after a 10-year wait, but the same was not true for cervical cancer. The overall recurrence rate of melanoma was 21%, with lower frequency of recurrence for lower-grade tumors. The tumor recurrence rate in patients with colon cancer (23%) was higher in thoracic vs nonthoracic organ transplant recipients. It was suggested that this mi ght relate to differences in immunosuppression levels. Data on the increased risk of canc er in transplant recipients from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry and the Scientific Regist ry of Transplant Recipients data for Southeast Michigan were presented by Friedrich K. Port, MD, MS,[14] of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) wa s defined as the observ ed/expected numbers of tumors in transplant recipients compared with age-matched and region-matched controls. By this definition, there was a 2-fold increase in solid tumors (confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-2.4) and a 4.3-fold increase in lymphomas (CI = 2.4-7.0) in transplant recipients compared with lymphomas and leukemia in controls. There were no significant differences in tumor incidences when analyzed by allograft type. Among solid tumors, t hose arising in the kidney, vulva, or colon appeared to have a high SIR. Evaluation of Transplant Candidates UNOS data show that the overall cancer recurr ence rates in kidney, liver, and heart transplant recipients are 1.1%, 6.5%, and 2%, re spectively. For all organ types, the risk is lower than the risk of developing de novo tumors, which is 8%, 5%, and 14%, respectively, in tedby Page 259Sundaram Hariharan, MD,[15] of the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. While many types of cancer cannot be screened for or detected at an early stage, the major types of cancer encountered after transplantation can be screened for. At this time it is not clear what constitutes optimal screening or the optimal periods of ti me between cancer treatment and transplantation. However, disease-free delay periods were suggeste d, taking into consideration probable times of relapse: No delay for incidental RCC; Delay of 0-2 years for nonmelanoma skin cancer; Delay of 2 years for cancers of the bladder, prostate, uterus, melanoma, or Wilms' tumor with appropriate cytogenetic support; Delay of 2-5 years for cervical cancer, breast cancer, RCC (2-5 cm in diameter), and lymphoma; and Delay of 5 years for colorectal ca ncer or RCC > 5 cm in diameter. Despite the availability of reliable and relatively simple and inexpensive screening tests for early detection, advanced cancer represents a major health risk after transplantation. Skin Cancer Forty percent to 70% of patient s develop skin cancers within 20 years after transplantation, according to Clark C. Otley, MD,[16] of the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. The most common skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), has a 7% metastatic rate and 56% 3-year survival following metastasis. Integration of dermatologic consultation into patient follow-up could aid in identification of high-risk patient s, early diagnosis of cancerous and precancerous lesions, and effective patient education regarding preventiv e measures. A variety of therapies, including topical retinoids, serial chemotherapy, biologica l response modifiers, and Mohs surgery, can be used in individual cases. Dr. Otley encouraged physicians and other transplant professionals to use the International Transplant Skin Cancer Co llaborative as a resource for information and consultation on skin cancer in their patients.[17] The implications of skin tumors in organ transplant recipients were further elucidated by Stuart J. Salasche, MD,[18] University of Arizona, Tucson. Since transplant recipients have a tendency to develop multiple and aggressive forms of SCC more often than the general population does, a high degree of vigilance was recommended. Fa ir skin, ultraviolet exposure, duration of immunosuppression, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and less common conditions such as osteomyelitis are risk factors for development of skin cancer. Patients with preexistent SCC may be at increased risk for multiple recurrence and metastasis. Delaying transplantation for 2-3 years in patients at high risk for metastatic SCC was suggested, giv en the poor prognosis associated with this type of cancer. A similar argument was made in general for melanoma, which is associated with a disproportionately high percentage of deaths. Ho wever, early-stage disease is associated with good survival. Stage 1 disease may be curable, but a small percentage of patients have demonstrated recurrent disease up to 15 years a fter transplantation. Indi vidual prognostic factors need to be weighed when considering the option of organ transplantation in the patient with melanoma. Merkel cell carcinoma is also prone to recurrence and metastasis after transplantation. It was recommended that patients be carefully assessed, preferably with dermatologic consultation. It has been observed that, unfortunately, only 14% of renal transplant recipients receive dermatologic follow-up. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Page 260Assessment of patients with HCC for liver transplantation in the setting of the Model for End- Stage Liver Disease (MELD) criteria[19] was discussed by Richard B. Freeman, MD,[20] of Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts. This scoring sy stem went into effect in the United States on February 27, 2000, and incorporates measures of b ilirubin, INR (international normalized ratio for coagulation testing), and serum creatinine. It resu lts in a score of 6-40, is predictive of death within 3 months, and is modified for pediatri c patients (Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease [PELD]). In most cases, liver transplantation is preferable to resection of HCC due to underlying cirrhosis, but a significant problem is tumor progression an d/or death while awaiting transplantation. Using the Milan criteria, [21] 3-year posttransplant survival wa s 83% with only 8% recurrence if transplantation was performed for a single HCC < 5 cm in diameter, or for up to 3 separate HCC lesions, each < 3 cm in diameter. In res ponse, the UNOS/Organ Procurement Transplant Network Liver Committee assigned a priority MELD weight of 24-29 points to patients with HCC who met the Milan criteria while awaiting transpl antation. Under this system, transplantation in patients with HCC increased 3.5-fold over a corr esponding time interval from the prior year; 86% to 91% of patients with HCC received a transplant within 3 months of being issued a priority MELD score based on a combination of liver disease and tumor. There has been no detectable trend toward increased use of priority scores to obtain transplants on a preferential basis. Analysis of the Milan criteria and other systems will continue in an e ffort to refine criteria for entry of patients with HCC into the liver transplant wait ing list. The continuation of studies such as this is necessary to assure the most equitabl e system of organ distribution possible. A model for staging HCC based on fraction of allelic loss to define the probability of posttransplant recurrence of HCC in liver transplant candidates with preexistent HCC was described by Wallis Marsh, MD, [22] of the University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Using this approach, Dr. Marsh and colleagues were able to categorize 91 of 103 patients; the model was 100% accurate in 81 evaluable patients. This model has potential to replace the staging system for HCC based on differentiation stat us. It appears to be an excellent way to determine who will and who will not have recurrent HCC, and this information could be used to decide who and who not to transplant. Cholangiocarcinoma Liver transplantation of patients with cholangiocarcinoma has historically been controversial. Charles B. Rosen, MD,[23] of the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, and C. Wright Pinson, MD,[24] of Vanderbilt University, Nashville , Tennessee, debated this issue. Dr. Rosen (pro) reported on a subset of patients with early-stage disease enrolle d in a protocol of pretreatment by radiation therapy and chemosensitization between 1993 and 2001. Fifteen of 41 enrolled patients survived 1-9 years after transplantation, 14 of these disease-free. According to Dr. Rosen, hilar cholangiocarcinoma is emerging as an indication for liver transplantation in patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy. Dr. Pinson (con) countered that transplanting patients with cholangiocarcinoma is a misappropriation of an al ready taxed donor supply, with limited return. Further objections included the high rate of patient dropout from the treatment protocol cited due to advanced disease or toxicity, the similarity of survival rates with those of resection for early- stage cholangiocarcinoma in some series , and the added variable of posttransplant immunosuppression. Despite these reservati ons, Dr. Rosen and Dr. Pinson concurred that continued development of this investigational prot ocol in selected expert centers is warranted in efforts to improve the survival for patients with these tumors. Lung Cancer The cure rate of resected stage 1 lung cancer is 70% to 80%, but only 15% of ge lung tumor nodules at least 3 times more frequently than chest x-ray, noted J. Michael DiMaio, MD,[25] University of Texas/Southwestern Medical School, Dallas. Dr. DiMaio's group performs annual CT scans in heart transplant recipients with a >/= 10 pack-year smoking hist ory. They noted that enforcement of smoking cessation in transplant candidates prior to tr ansplantation is one method of reducing a known risk factor for cancer, and this may have benefit as lung cancer typically arises a number of years after transplantation. Cancer Screening Prevention and early detection of cancer in tr ansplant recipients is not a routine part of posttransplant care. Bryce Kiberd, MD,[26] of Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, and William M. Bennett, MD,[27] of Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, encouraged transplant clinicians to incorporate American Cancer Society guidelines on screening and surveillance for cancer into patient follow-up. Questions were raised, however, regarding the effectiveness and potential harm of cancer screening in transplant recipients with limited life expectancy, since it can take at least 5 y ears before screening has an impact on survival. Invasive procedures such as colonoscopy might have a higher morbidity in immunocompromised patients, and screening tests such as stool guaiac could have a higher false-positive rate in patients with multiple sources of blood loss. On the basis of these concerns, it was suggested that no screening was required for patients with a life expectancy less than 5-7 years, but that screening be recommended for those with life ex pectancies exceeding 10-12 years. Patients in between should be informed of the relative risks and benefits of particular screening procedures. Cancer-specific rates of death are required to develop more objective criteria for refining cancer screening recommendations for transplant recipients. Immunity, Viruses, and Neoplasia T lymphocytes are a central component of the host immune response to viral infection and some cancers, and viruses are important cofactors in t he development of some cancers, particularly in the immunosuppressed patient. Work in the area of T cell-based therapy of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and melanoma was summarized by Philip D. Greenberg, MD,[28] of the University of Washington, Seattle.[29] His group has taken the approach of expanding antigen-specific T-cell lines in vitro and infusing these into immunocompromised patients to provide cellular immunity against specific targets. This therapy has been applied primarily to hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, who may develop fatal CMV disease during periods of immunodeficiency. T cells derived from the original donor are raised against CMV over a 6- to 8-week period and can provide protective immunity against CMV infection when infused into the recipient. Cytotoxic CD8 + cells provide immune effector activity, and long-lived immunity requires support from CD4+ T cells. In Dr. Greenberg's study, side effects we re mild. Current studies seek to modify the glucocorticoid receptor of the infused cells, as high-dose corticosteroids (such as might be given for rejection or graft-vs-host disease) normally cause lysis of lymphocytes leading to loss of effector function. Modification of T-cell receptors to introduce antiviral sp ecificities into T cells from CMV-seronegative organ transplant recipients is also developing as a viable strategy to generate a rapid and specific antiviral response. A modified approach is necessary for antitumor immunity, as tumors may actively downregulate or even destroy invading T cells. Using the melanoma model, this group has shown that CD8+ T- cell activity can be enhanced and prolonged in the setting of concurrent low-dose interleukin (IL)- 2 support as a surrogate for CD4+ help. Despite initially effective killi ng, the tumo r undergoes phenotypic evolution to shed the target antigen, leading to an antigen-deficient subclone. One strategy to circumvent this tumor evasion is to identify antigens that are indispensable to the To counter this, modified T-cell receptors exhibiting a higher antigen affinity for these targets, together with modi fied granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors capable of generating a signal for IL-2 production, have been developed and inserted into CD8+ T cells in vitro. Other changes that lo wer the energy of activation of the T-cell receptor also lead to endogenous IL-2 production. Such approaches can lead to the development of antitumor T-cell reagents with predefined specific ities, and may ultimately result in antitumor reagents that could be produced in advance and administered directly at time of therapy. James E. Sligh, MD, PhD,[30] of Vanderbilt University, Nashville , reviewed the association of HPV and skin cancer. HPV normally causes cutaneous warts. However, certain conditions, such as epidermodysplasia verruciformis, are associat ed with an antiviral immune defect and lead to numerous warts that can progress to malignancy, parti cularly in areas exposed to ultraviolet light. HPV with a high risk for cancer development (most commonly type 16 or 18) integrates its DNA into the host genome, in contrast to low-risk HPV, which persists as separate episomes. This may underlie differences in expression of the viral onc oproteins E6 and E7. These proteins have been shown to immortalize human keratinocytes in vitro and interfere with the tumor suppressor activity of the cell cycle proteins p53 and Rb. E6 protein may also protect against UV-induced apoptosis. Approximately half of all organ transplant recipients will develop warts by 5 years posttransplantation. This patient population also carries high-risk papillomavirus strains in the lower genital tract, more commonly than do nonimmunocompromised individuals. Thus, screening for premalignant lesions of the skin and genital tract was emphasized as a routine component of transplant recipient follow-up. Donald Ganem, MD,[31] of the University of California, S an Francisco, provided insight into the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) by contrasting HHV-8) other transforming gamma herpes viruses. He noted that KSHV is likely not a fully immortalizing virus and could even be lost from infected cells. He proposed that the lytic portion of the life cycle might contribute to KS by providing paracrine factors to stimulate angiogenesis and inflammation, by recruiting additional infected cells to the lesion to replace apoptotic cells, and by reinfecting cells that had lost their viral episomes. Murine models of hepatocellular carcinogenesis, particularly transgenic mice with expression of either hepatitis virus proteins or growth fact ors, were reviewed by Ravi S. Chari, MD, [32] of Vanderbilt University. Numerous strains transgeni c for hepatitis B virus (HBV) proteins have been developed, and these animals show variation in tumor characteristics. Tumors are also associated with mice transgenic for expression of hepatitis C vi rus proteins. Resultant tumors show expression of viral core, but not envelope pr oteins, suggesting the former as important for carcinogenesis. Mice transgenic for hepatocyte grow th factor or transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) also develop HCC with a high frequency. In the case of TGF-alpha, mice transgenic for both this gene and for either c-myc or HBV surface antigen show increased hepatocarcinogenesis indicating synergism between the genes and likely mimicking the clinical condition more closely. P53 knockout mi ce develop liver tumors when treated with diethylnitrosamine, but thes e are largely angiosarcomas. Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorders (PTLD) Cliona Rooney, PhD,[33] of Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, used the biology of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as a foundation for understanding PTLD and other EBV-related neoplasias. This infection normally reaches an asym ptomatic steady state in which largely latent viral-infected cells are controlled by a combinat ion of virus-specific T cells and neutralizing antibody. In immunosuppressed transplant re cipients, T-cell immunosuppression can allow outgrowth of viral-infected cell s that express a wide range of EBV proteins. Dr. Rooney'sgrouphasuseddono Hodgkin's disease in nonimmuno suppressed patients is an ex ample of an EBV-associated neoplasia in which tumor cells circumvent the immune response by downregulating a number of viral antigens and by producing locally immunosuppressive molecules. Some genetic modifications to counteract this include: engineering T cells to contain an immunodominant TGF-beta receptor to allow function in the presence of normally inhibitory levels of TGF-beta, and the use of IL-12-secreting T cells to counteract t he local Th2 microenvironment produced by tumor secretion of (TARC). The pathologic PTLD was outlined by Michael A. Nalesnik, MD,[35] of the University of Pittsburgh. The evolution of the cl assification systems was traced, leading up to the present World Health Organization (WHO) 2001 classification that divides PTLD into 4 categories: (1) early lesions (including infectious mononucleosis-like neoplasms), and (4) Hodgkin lymphoma/Hodgkin-like PTLD. For additional information on these classifications, go to the Tr ansplant Pathology Internet Services Web site. [36] \"PTLD\" is a generic term, and subclassification is crucial for appropriate selection of therapy. Evaluation should include histopathologic, phenot ypic, clonal, and virologic PTLDs ar e clonal proliferations, but ma y still be capable of regression with reduced immunosuppression, noted Dr. Nalesnik. There has been an increase in the relative frequency of EBV-negative PTLD in recent years. In some instances, these have been linked to Helicobacter infection, and treatment may lead to resolution of the lymphoproliferation. Recurrent PT LD may represent true recurrence or separate tumors, and biopsy is desirable in th is setting. Douglas W. Hanto, MD,[37] of the Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, focused on the polyc lonal-to-monoclonal transition that occurs in the development of PTLD, and classified PTLD into 4 conditions: (2) benign (4) monoclon al polymorphic B-cell lymphoma; these correspond to the first 2 general categories of the WHO classification. Dr. Hanto stressed the need for a multimodal approach to diagnosis, in particular emphasizing the importance of CD20 and EBV assessment. He noted that mononucleosis might resolve without therapy in some cases, but requires antiviral t herapy and reduced immunosuppression in others. Therapy must be individualized, and combinations of reduc ed immunosuppression, antiviral agents, and intravenous immune globulin in polyclonal disease were suggested. In some cases, CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and alpha interferon might have a role. He recommended reduced immunosuppression and anti-CD20 mAb or cytoto xic chemotherapy in cases of monoclonal disease, with surgical resection and radiotherap y used as appropriate. Prospective multicenter studies are required for development of optimal treatment algorithms. Current applications of therapeutic algorithms for PTLD were described by Steven A. Webber, MD,[38] of the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Webber underscored the role of reduced immunosuppression and pointed out the potential shortcomings such as rebound acute rejection and early chronic rejection. The advocacy of anti-CD20 mAb and/or chemotherapy as initial therapy requires prospective clinical trials fo r evaluation. Since a proportion of monomorphic PTLD may regress under the proper conditions, there is a need to define markers to separate these from other monomorphic tumors likely to require chemotherapy for resolution. Two additional therapies that are used without pr oof of clinical efficacy are antiviral and immune globulin agents. He advocated continued use of these agents based on clinical experience, until objective criteria for their use are established. Questions regarding the extent and length of immunosuppression reduction as well as reinstitution of antirejection therapy peripheral blood are a useful marker of dise ase activity. However, few data exist in the adult populatio n, and this marker is likely of little value in EBV-negative tumors.[39] Given the promising results of anti-CD20 mAb, a prospective multicenter trial addressing the role of this agent at the time of initial diagnosis is being planned. The use of chemotherapy in the treatment of PTLD was summarized by Thomas G. Gross, MD, PhD,[40] of Ohio State University, Columbus. He obse rved that in most published series, regimens for refractory disease or in patients in whom immunosuppression could not be reduced. He estimated a 50% long-term relapse-free survival using this approach. In order to reduce systemic toxicity and minimize the effect of chemotherapy on antiviral immunity, his grou p used low-dose cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) and prednisone (2 mg/kg/day) for 5 days in a multic enter pilot study of treatment of refractory PTLD in children.[41] This regimen, termed \"CHOP-Lite\", l ed to complete remission in 77%, which rose to 84% if patients with fulminant disse minated disease (which does not respond to any intervention at present) were excluded from analys is. However, the relapse rate was 18% with a 2-year relapse-free survival of 73%. Thos e patients who did not develop normal anti-EBV immunity appeared to be at greater risk for relapse. He recommended additional studies to optimize this regimen, particularly for fulminant di sease, and to evaluate its efficacy in the adult population. Cellular therapy for the treatment of EBV-associated PTLD[42] was proposed as a treatment by Malcolm K. Brenner, MD,[43] of Baylor College of Medicine. He observed that anti-CD20 antibody appeared to be a significant advance in therapy, but relapses were common in the solid organ transplant population, and in some cases recu rrent disease evolved into a CD20-negative phenotype, rendering the antibody treatment ineffe ctive. He reported a greater than 98% success rate in establishing anti-EBV cytotoxic T-cell lines from a series of 300 stem cell or solid organ transplant recipients. He noted that such lines could even be developed from patients who were EBV-seronegative at time of trans plantation. Infused cells behave differently in different patient subpopulations, expanding rapidly in stem cell recipients, while growing more slowly in organ transplant recipients. His group has taken the approach of monitoring EBV le vels at 2- to 4-week intervals early posttransplantat ion and utilizing anti-CD20 antib ody in cases of PTLD while simultaneously generating cytotoxic T-cell lines, a process that takes 4-6 weeks. The cells are then administered as definitive therapy. With this approach they have had no fatalities from EBV disease in a series of more than 600 solid organ and stem cell transplant recipients.
