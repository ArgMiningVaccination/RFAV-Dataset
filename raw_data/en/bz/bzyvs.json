OSTROWSKY PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RWJBARNABAS HEALTH HEALTH NEWS More Convenient Primary Care This fall, a new Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton primary care practice will open in Robbinsville. Other RWJUH Hamilton practices are located in Hamilton, Lawrenceville and Quakerbridge. A NEW CANCER SPECIALIST A new medical oncologist has joined the Cancer Center at RWJUH Hamilton. Philip A. Pancari, MD, who is board-certified in internal medicine, hematology and medical oncology, previously treated thousands of patients at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. He offers an array of novel treatments, including targeted medications and immunotherapies. Says Dr. Pancari, \"I aspire to personally guide each patient not only to his or her best possible clinical outcome but also to make the journey one of comfort, confidence and empowerment.\" A Culture of Inclusion RWJUH Hamilton and Community Options, a nonprofit organization that assists with housing and employment support for people with disabilities, recently celebrated the success of their 15-year partnership. Three years ago, Jovani Rodriguez started working as a volunteer at the hospital with guidance from onsite job coach Patricia Pavlovsky. Food Service Director Allen Reigert noticed Jovani's work ethic and hired him as a Senior Food Service Worker. The three were honored in a ceremony at RWJUH Hamilton.Celebrating a Good Year Time really does fly. Already, a year has passed since we first announced our partnership with Rutgers University, one of the nation's leading public educators, to create a new state of health in New Jersey. We're thrilled by how much already has been accomplished and how our partnership is benefiting patients and communities across the state. And we're energized by our plans for the future. Our medical group includes hundreds of primary care and specialty physicians with over 200 locations across the state. Our partnership with Rutgers gives each of these physicians seamless access to the strength of our combined, state-of-the-science medical expertise, services and treatments. One of the most exciting things to come out of our partnership with Rutgers so far is the recently announced creation of a dedicated cancer hospital, to be built in New Brunswick on the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital campus. This new cancer center of excellence will take on the most complex cases, enabling more cancer patients to stay in New Jersey close to family and friends for treatment. The Cancer Center at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton provides the most advanced cancer treatment\u2014close to home. We've invested millions in revolutionary cancer care for our community. Our cancer specialists provide renowned expertise and personalized treatment plans. State-of-the-art technology and patient access to clinical trials offer precision treatment options. Our signature holistic programs fill the mind and soul with comfort and relaxation during a difficult time. By caring for each patient's mind, body and spirit, we are unlocking the power of science and the soul to treat cancer\u2014right here in Hamilton. We look forward to bringing you many more benefits as we continue to hardwire Rutgers across the RWJBarnabas Health system.

Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton | RWJBH.ORG/HAMILTON | 7 Hamilton_Cal_Sum19_REV1.indd 7 6/17/19 10:33 AMThere are few opportunities for high school students and community members to learn about career pathways to medicine. That's one reason Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton launched the Mini Medical School program 18 years ago. Today, the class series\u2014which is offered twice a year\u2014is popular among high school students (kids from 14 area high schools attend), as well as adults. This spring, 96 attendees participated in the program and 50 people were on the waiting list. \"Our goal is to get participants excited about medicine,\" says F. Javier Villota, MD, CIME, Medical Director of Occupational and Corporate Health, Travel Medicine and the Mini Medical School program. A VARIETY OF CLASSES In the fall, an eight-week Mini Medical School teaches attendees about the body through lectures. Each week, a physician discusses a different part of the body, such as the heart, gallbladder, liver, pancreas and digestive system. Lecturers explain how they diagnose various conditions and how their careers started. In the spring, the hospital chooses one health topic to focus on during a four- week session. Last year, it was the opioid epidemic; this year, the focus was on global medicine. Dr. Villota spoke about his experiences as a physician in Mexico and Guatemala, and other physicians, including Ernani Sadural, MD, Director of Global Health for RWJBarnabas Health, discussed their experiences practicing medicine in countries such as Haiti, Grenada, the Dominican Republic, Nepal, India, China, Pakistan, Lebanon, Fiji and the Philippines. At the end of each session, which is held at the Center for Health & Wellness at RWJ Fitness & Wellness, participants receive a certificate of completion, a health guide and a graduation ceremony. \"This program can be life-changing for adults and high school students alike,\" says Billie O'Donnell, BSN, RN, CDE, a community nurse educator who coordinates the program. \"One adult participant who already had a family decided to go to medical school and became a gastroenterologist. There are lots of seeds being planted.\" PHYSICIANS TEACH STUDENTS AND ADULTS ABOUT MEDICAL PROFESSIONS IN A WILDLY POPULAR PROGRAM. MEETING THE COMMUNITY'S NEEDS Every three months, the Medical Advisory Panel (MAP), composed of healthcare professionals in a variety of specialties, meets to review the community education programs at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton. They discuss the needs of the community and how the hospital's educational offerings can best serve its neighbors. For instance, diabetes is a major public health concern, so MAP members decided to increase the offerings that focus on diabetes. \"I'm proud of MAP because we get ideas for classes from the members,\" says F. Javier Villota, MD, the MAP chair. \"Physicians suggest programs based on their observations while caring for patients.\" MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR THE COMMUNITY For a calendar of upcoming community education programs, see pages 4 to 7 of this issue of Healthy Together. To register for a program or event, call 609.584.5900. Mini Medical School is free for students. For adults, the fee is $40 for the spring session and $100 for the fall session. Left: F.

Recently, for example, there were the cases of an 8-year-old girl with an arteriovenous malformation, a bird's nest-like tangle of blood vessels at the top of her spine that paralyzed her, and a 21-year-old woman with a hemorrhaged brain stem cavernoma. Both patients were referred to Dr. Nanda and the enhanced neurosurgical program he is creating with colleagues throughout RWJBH. The lesions were successfully removed. \"People should know that we can take care of very complicated neurosurgical issues with good outcomes right here in New Jersey,\" says Dr. Nanda, who has been recognized as a global leader in neurosurgery. But Dr. Nanda is not just building a practice that specializes in cranial tumors in his roles as Senior Vice President of Neurosurgical Services for RWJBH and Professor and Joint Chair of the Department of Neurosurgery at both Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. Dr. Nanda is creating a world-class center of neurosurgery at RWJBH. In addition to providing state-of-the-art training for medical residents, the effort is attracting top talent to New Jersey from all over the world. GRATIFYING RESULTS Neurosurgery services at RWJBH cover many areas, including spinal disease, stroke, aneurysms, brain trauma and more. Dr. Nanda's specialty is surgery of the skull base, an area formed by bones at the bottom of the skull that is crisscrossed by nerves and blood vessels carrying messages and oxygen to the brain. Last fall, an especially challenging patient was referred: a 38-year-old woman whose personality had been slowly deteriorating over the previous five years. She had become hostile to family and friends, and her memory and cognition were impaired. Finally, an MRI of the woman's brain found the cause of her problems: a 9-centimeter (approximately 3.5-inch) meningioma, a benign, slow-growing tumor that forms on membranes covering the brain. \"The tumor's pressure on her frontal lobe\u2014which handles cognitive functions such as planning, memory and emotional expression\u2014was so great that it had been compacted and barely showed on the MRI,\" says Dr. Nanda. During surgery, Dr. Nanda first stopped the tumor's blood supply, then began the removal process. \"After a difficult operation, the growth was entirely removed, and with the pressure gone, the frontal lobe expanded to its normal size,\" he says. Three days later, the woman was sitting up and talking and her former upbeat personality had begun to return. \"It was really gratifying for our team to be able to effect such a dramatic change,\" says Dr. Nanda. \"Symptoms like this woman's are often chalked up to depression or schizophrenia or, in the case of an older person, dementia,\" he explains. \"In such cases, it's important to investigate possible causes in detail, sooner rather than later.\" For residents of New Jersey and the region, the good news is that excellent care for such conditions is available close to home. Says Dr. Nanda, \"RWJBarnabas Health is building a team of top neurosurgeons and other experts in neuroscience that is among the best in the world.\" To learn more about New Jersey's most comprehensive neurosurgery program, call 833.656.3876 or visit www.rwjbh.org/neurosurgery.

Dave Rodney, 62, didn't have time to be sick. A professional concert and travel promoter, and an avid musician and cook, he had too much living to do. But in August 2017, while working out, Dave felt a slight discomfort in his lower abdomen. He assumed he'd pulled a muscle. However, at a routine physical shortly afterward, his doctor advised him to go to the Emergency Department at Saint Barnabas Medical Center (SBMC) in Livingston. There, a scan revealed an abdominal mass. Dave was admitted for further tests. The eventual diagnosis: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This aggressive blood cancer, a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, usually starts as a fast-growing mass in a lymph node. From September 2017 through January 2018, Dave was treated with chemotherapy under the care of Andrew Brown, MD, a medical oncologist with The Cancer Center at SBMC. Unfortunately, a first round was unsuccessful, as was a second round with a different medication. The next step would typically be to assess whether a stem cell transplant might work. But now, there is also a new treatment called CAR T-cell therapy. \"It was very important that I get him to a specialty center that handles complex cases,\" says Dr. Brown. \"Because of our health system's partnership, I sent him down to Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick.\" NEW POSSIBILITIES In the fall of 2017, the Food and Drug Administration made a big announcement: It had approved CAR T-cell therapy for adults with DLBCL and for children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this therapy, T cells (a type of immune system cell) are taken from a patient's blood. In a laboratory, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), which binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells, is added to each cell. These CAR T cells are then added back to the patient's blood to attack cancer cells. The treatment is given only to patients whose cancer has proven resistant to chemotherapy and who may not be good candidates for stem cell transplants. Further, it can be offered only at centers that have clinicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals who are FACT (Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy)-certified. The teams at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) and Rutgers Cancer Institute fit the bill. Dave Rodney would be their first patient for CAR T-cell therapy. \"This is a transformative therapy,\" says Dennis Cooper, MD, Chief, Blood and Marrow Transplantation at Rutgers Cancer Institute. \"In the past, if a patient with this type of lymphoma wasn't responsive to chemotherapy, apart from experimental treatments we were essentially out of luck. Now we have a new option that's potentially curative.\" MOVING AHEAD Dave met with Dr. Cooper in March of 2018. At that and subsequent visits, he learned more about the procedure and its potential benefits and risks. \"They were very honest and open,\" Dave says. \"Yes, I'd be the first. But on the plus side, many eyes and ears would be watching me to make sure everything went well. What they said made perfect sense, so I was sold.\" \"I can't think of a time in my career where the staff spent so much time, collectively, preparing to treat a patient,\" says Dr. Cooper. \"There are strict criteria for care when a patient is getting CAR T cells, encompassing everything from the electronic record to drugs that can cause a reaction, and more. \"Everyone in the hospital was very committed. The people who work in the blood and marrow transplant unit, the ICU nurses, the nurse practitioners, the rapid response teams, the neurology attendings and literally every medical resident went through training before we treated our first CAR T-cell patient.\" After thorough preparations, Dave's T cells were collected and sent to a laboratory ANDREW BROWN, MD NEW CANCER TREATMENT, NEW HOPE DENNIS COOPER, MD Healthy Together | 12 | Summer 2019 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 13 System_CART_Sum19_REV1.indd 12 6/18/19 3:31 PMDave Rodney, the first CAR T-cell therapy patient at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, is back to doing the things he loves. in California to be re- engineered, a process that takes several weeks. In November, Dave received a mild pre-treatment chemotherapy to clear his blood of lymphocytes that could compete with CAR T cells. Then he was admitted to RWJUH to receive brand-new CAR T cells via infusion. He stayed in the hospital for two weeks as his body adjusted. \"It's impossible to describe the high level of care I had\u2014the professionalism, expertise, warmth and caring,\" Dave says. \"These are the best people on the planet!\" AN EXCITING FUTURE CAR T-cell therapy is currently under consideration to treat some forms of myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells. \"CAR T cells are also being modified in the hope they can work on solid tumors\u2014brain tumors, abdominal tumors,\" says Dr. Cooper. \"People are realizing that you can redirect CAR T cells to almost any target you want, as long as it's on a tumor cell and not a normal cell.\" Unlike in chemotherapy, which kills both healthy and cancer cells, the CAR T cells remain in the patient's body for months and continue fighting the cancer. \"There's a lot of work happening on ways to make CAR T cells stay in action even longer,\" says Dr. Cooper. Dave continues to return for scans to check on his progress. Meanwhile, his return to normal activity is encouraging. \"I'm as busy as ever,\" Dave says, \"feeling better and doing all the things I love doing.\" A version of this article first appeared in the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey publication Cancer Connection.

The fracture took a long time to heal. Worse, the pain grew and radiated throughout his body. \"I wasn't able to wear clothes. I couldn't shower. I couldn't walk. If a wind blew on me, I would be screaming,\" he says. Eventually, Jasper was diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)\u2014a chronic condition that is believed to be caused by damage to the nervous system\u2014at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. And although he underwent weeks of outpatient therapy, the pain only got worse. Jasper's physical therapist showed him and his parents an online video she'd found. It told the story of a girl who had suffered similar symptoms, but managed to get them under control through an intensive course of therapy at another children's hospital. \"My husband and I decided we must find a program like this for Jasper,\" says his mother, Lori Neale. After some research, they selected the inpatient Chronic Pain Management Program at Children's Specialized Hospital (CSH) in New Brunswick. Less than three weeks later, Jasper and his father were on a flight to New Jersey and CSH. That decision would change his life\u2014and, ultimately, make life better for other San Diego, Southern California and southwestern U.S. children living in pain.MASTERING THE PAIN At CSH, the innovative Chronic Pain Management Program treats children with this condition through intensive physical, occupational and psychological therapy. Patients learn coping techniques to desensitize themselves to pain and mitigate it\u2014without the use of opioids or other medications. \"One of the goals of the program is to improve the pain, but the main goal is to improve function and get our patients back to their lives,\" explains Katherine Bentley, MD, Director of the Chronic Pain Management Program. After seven weeks, Jasper graduated from the program and was able to return to his California home, and to his life as a teenager. But Jasper's recovery was not the only positive outcome of his experience. Aware of the need for a multidisciplinary approach to pain management for area patients, Rady Children's Hospital and CSH created a partnership. In April, the all-new Children's Specialized Hospital Chronic Pain Management Program at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego opened for business. \"This joint endeavor provides us the great opportunity to treat the needs of patients and families in the Southern California region,\" says Warren E. Moore, FACHE, President and CEO at CSH, \"and for that I could not be more grateful.\" Jasper would agree. \"Now,\" he says, \"I can do anything I want to do.\" For more information about Children's Specialized Hospital, call 888.244.5373 or visit www.childrens-specialized.org.PARTNERING TO FIGHT PAIN ONE BOY'S ORDEAL LED TO HELP FOR OTHER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHILDREN WHO SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN.From left, Gail Knight, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Rady Children's Hospital; Michael Dribbon, PhD, Vice President of Business Development and Chief Innovation and Research Officer, CSH; Patrick Frias, MD, President and CEO at Rady Children's Hospital; Warren E.

Healthy Together | 14 | Summer 2019 System_CSH_Sum11_final.indd 14 6/14/19 3:06 PMWhen it comes to protection against heart disease, the evidence is simple and clear: Preventive strategies work. \"People can have a significant effect on their heart health through the lifestyle choices they make,\" says Sergio Waxman, MD, MBA, an interventional cardiologist and Chief of the Division of Cardiology at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, an RWJBarnabas Health facility. \"There are not many diseases where that is so clearly documented.\" A key part of self-care is understanding the following about your heart health. Your primary care provider can check these numbers at your yearly physical, and you can track some of them between visits. BLOOD PRESSURE: The force of blood rushing through your vessels. High blood pressure, which can damage or weaken blood vessels, is defined as a reading of 130/80. \"A lot of patients get nervous in a doctor's office, which may elevate their blood pressure, so it's important to check it outside the office as well,\" says Dr. Waxman. You can buy a manual or digital blood pressure monitor at the drugstore, or use a public device available at some pharmacies. HEART RATE (PULSE): The number of times your heart beats per minute. \"This is helpful if you're exercising and want to see if your training is significantly affecting your heart rate,\" says Dr. Waxman. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. The more fit you are, the sooner your heart rate returns to normal after exercise. BLOOD SUGAR: High glucose (blood sugar) levels are strongly correlated with cardiovascular disease because over time they damage blood vessels and nerves. \"An annual blood test after overnight fasting is all that's needed, unless your levels are elevated,\" says Dr. Waxman. \"If they are, the other number you should know is your Hemoglobin A1C, which is a measure of your average glucose levels over the past three months.\" BLOOD CHOLESTEROL: A waxy substance produced by the liver. Cholesterol is transported to and from cells by lipoproteins. Low- density lipoprotein (LDL, known as the \"bad\" kind) deposits cholesterol on artery walls; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) removes it. Both levels are determined by a simple blood test. Your doctor also might suggest your blood be tested for C-reactive protein. \"Some investigators think this may be as important as the LDL number for assessing cardiac risk,\" says Dr. Waxman. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI): This is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. The higher your BMI, the greater your risk for cardiac and other diseases. You can calculate your BMI with the help of online calculators and charts from the National Institutes of Health or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most people know they should take better care of their health, they often feel that work and family demands prevent it, says Dr. Waxman. \"Try to give yourself one hour every day to devote to taking care of yourself, whether it's exercising, preparing healthy meals, checking your blood pressure, taking a nap or a combination of things,\" he advises. \"It's like what they say about oxygen on airplanes: Put your mask on first or you won't be able to help someone else.\" SERGIO WAXMAN, MD Your heart doesn't beat just for you.

The drug triggers a brief surge of endorphins\u2014the feel- good hormones\u2014each time it's inhaled through a cigarette or an electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS), such as an e-cigarette or vaping device. That pleasure dissipates quickly, leading to the urge for another inhalation. A pack-a-day smoker, for example, goes through this cycle about 250 times daily, creating an addictive reward system in both brain and body that causes dependence on nicotine. When the person tries to stop, withdrawal symptoms\u2014irritability, attention difficulties, sleep disturbances and more\u2014lead him or her to light up again, and the cycle continues. Most people who are still smoking today have already tried and failed to quit five to seven times, according to Connie Greene, Vice President, RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) Institute for Prevention and Recovery. \"They may even feel a lot of shame and guilt because of that,\" she says. \"But the truth is, if people who are dependent on nicotine could quit on their own, they would have done so already.\" Greene and her colleagues want these people to know that it's not their fault. \"They're in the grip of a very insidious addiction, which may have a genetic component,\" she says. \"But there is hope, and there is recovery. \"The more times you've tried and the more you've been unsuccessful, the greater chance you have for success with our Nicotine and Tobacco Dependence Treatment Program.\" A NEW APPROACH \"We look at quitting as a process,\" says Michael Litterer, Director of Prevention and Recovery at RWJBH. \"It's not as simple as making a decision and going cold turkey. In our program, we develop an individualized plan for each person who comes to us.\" When a smoker contacts the Nicotine and Tobacco Dependence Treatment Program by phone or email, a certified tobacco treatment specialist will be there to help. \"You don't have to quit right away,\" Litterer says. Instead, next steps can include: Individualized nicotine dependence assessment, focusing on triggers and stressors Ongoing support in both individual or group settings Access to a medical director on staff to assist with primary care coordination and prescription medications Free nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patches, gum and lozenges) Recommendations and navigation for appropriate prescription nicotine dependence medications Assistance in understanding the real impact of ENDS devices and cigarettes Behavioral modification and assistance in managing or eliminating nicotine withdrawal symptoms \"Most importantly, we will support people through the entire process of ending their nicotine or tobacco addiction. Relapsing and using nicotine during the quit attempt is sometimes part of the journey. We understand this,\" Litterer says. The program, which is funded by the New Jersey Department of Health Office of Tobacco Free, Nutrition and Fitness, does not charge participants. The most important thing for people to know, Greene says, is that they don't have to try to quit alone. \"Call the QuitCenter number, or send us an email,\" she says. \"We'll take it from there.\"RWJBARNABAS HEALTH OFFERS FREE AND PROVEN SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE WITH TOBACCO OR NICOTINE DEPENDENCE.

Today, she is back to her active lifestyle with her husband, Todd, and children. A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE Healthy Together | 18 | Summer 2019 Hamilton_Cardiac_Sum19_final.indd 18 6/14/19 11:06 AMIt was a beautiful July afternoon in Yardville, and 48-year old Kristin Mizenko could hardly wait to lace up her sneakers and hit the streets. A seasoned runner, she jogged three to five miles daily, and despite the sweltering 95-degree heat, she looked forward to her 45 minutes of exercise. Unfortunately, her dream run turned into a nightmare when she went into cardiac arrest\u2014in which the heart malfunctions and stops beating\u2014and collapsed about a quarter mile from her home. A neighbor, Anthony Pompei, who is a state trooper, saw Kristin fall. He immediately leapt from his car to begin administering CPR. Other neighbors quickly converged to call 911 and offer assistance. One of them was Chris Andrulis, RN, a nursing supervisor at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton. \"None of us knew who Kristin was, although we'd seen her jogging before,\" recalls Andrulis, who has been a nurse for 46 years. She and Anthony took turns performing CPR on Kristin, who wasn't breathing. \"We're lucky she was found so quickly,\" says Andrulis. \"It was so hot everyone was inside with the windows shut and the air conditioning on at full blast.\" TOP-NOTCH CARE Thankfully, Kristin was whisked to RWJUH Hamilton in an ambulance, where paramedics used a defibrillator to shock her heart. A neighbor had been able to identify her and called her husband, Todd, who raced to the hospital. \"I was met by the chaplain,\" he recalls. Fortunately, Kristin's heart began to beat again. RWJUH Hamilton critical care physicians had induced hypothermia\u2014a below-normal body temperature\u2014to reduce brain inflammation, which can occur after cardiac arrest as a result of the stopping and starting of blood flow to the brain. Inflammation can cause permanent cognitive and neurologic damage. Todd wasn't prepared for the first glimpse he got of his wife when he walked into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and saw her surrounded by a bevy of machines, tubes and wires. He was put at ease, however, by her nurse, Grace Chizek, BSN, RN, as well as critical care physician Howard Waksman, MD. \"Both did a great job explaining everything that was going on and answering all of my questions,\" says Todd. It turns out that Kristin's cardiac arrest was likely caused by a genetic abnormality. Kristin remained in the ICU for almost three weeks but wasn't awake or alert for the first 10 days. \"She'd have a burst of activity where she would talk and make jokes for about a half hour, then sleep for six,\" says Todd. \"Her physicians reassured us that this was her brain's way of trying to heal itself.\" Initially, Kristin had trouble remembering close family members like her son, Justin, 16. But when Todd showed her Facebook posts and photos of Justin, her memory gradually returned. A MIRACULOUS RECOVERY More than nine months later, Kristin has made a successful recovery. She received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, a device that shocks the heart to restore a normal heartbeat if a person's heart is beating erratically. She also underwent rehabilitation for three weeks. While she still struggles with memory problems, she was able to return to work last fall as a special education assistant. Kristin's recovery was due to a combination of factors: the immediate CPR, defibrillation and hypothermia protocol, says Christina Wjasow, MD, Kristin's cardiologist. Todd believes Chizek's outstanding care also contributed to Kristin's recovery. She sang to Kristin daily, played music for her, and even washed and styled her hair\u2014no easy feat in the ICU. Last year, Todd nominated Chizek for a Daisy Award, which she received. The award honors exceptional nurses at hospitals across the country. Kristin has been cleared to run again, and she's visited the ICU at RWJUH Hamilton several times to see the staff members. \"I owe so much to them,\" she says. KEEPING HEART FAILURE PATIENTS HEALTHY More than 20 percent of heart failure patients are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days and about half by six months. Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton is determined to reverse this trend with its innovative Healthy Lives Heart Failure program, which launched in April. The program's multidisciplinary team\u2014including a cardiologist, nurse practitioner, nurse, pharmacist, nutritionist and social worker\u2014gives patients and family members the tools they need to manage their disease. \"Managing heart failure is difficult,\" says Connie Moceri, Director of Disease Management. \"It requires patients to adhere to a diet and daily medication regimen and to monitor their symptoms.\" Once patients hospitalized with heart failure are discharged, they'll return for outpatient visits within four to five days. \"This allows us to see how they're doing at home,\" says Moceri. \"Are they able to adhere to their medication schedule? Are they eating the right foods? The hope is that they'll be able to manage their heart failure so well on their own that they won't need repeat hospitalizations.\" Your heart doesn't beat just for you. Get it checked.

Here, she explains how integrative medicine is used to treat gynecologic conditions. What is integrative gynecology? With integrative medicine, we combine traditional treatments with holistic approaches, such as exercise, supplements, nutrition, chiropractic and acupuncture. To provide such comprehensive care, we spend more time counseling patients about treatment. How are gynecologic conditions treated with this approach? Women in perimenopause\u2014the transition to menopause\u2014often gain weight. We recommend a multipronged approach to this problem. We encourage participating in aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, running or cycling. We also promote a Mediterranean-style diet, which emphasizes plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and nuts, and healthy fats like olive oil instead of butter. Many times, I'll order thyroid testing because an underactive thyroid often shows up in the years surrounding menopause and can affect weight. I also screen patients for vitamin D deficiency, which is common and can affect overall well-being. Another example is pelvic pain. When I perform an ultrasound and examine a patient, she may appear normal. But sometimes there's birth trauma, which can take years to show up. We see a lot of success when we recommend pelvic floor physical therapy for these patients. Physical therapy involves internal and external massage and other techniques. How does integrative gynecology benefit patients? We empower patients to take charge of their health. For example, I prescribe probiotics to help restore the natural vaginal flora after a patient is treated with antibiotics for an infection. When she uses this treatment, she feels she's doing something positive for her health. What kind of feedback about integrative gynecology have you received from patients so far? Patients know I spend extra time with them. They say, \"Thanks for listening to me.\" At the end of the day, I offer patients additional treatment options, and they are happier and healthier as a result. For me, that's what counts.

THE FOUNDATION AND AUXILIARY WORK TOGETHER TO SUPPORT MAJOR HOSPITAL IMPROVEMENTS.A COMMITMENT TO THE BEST CARE In February, the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton Auxiliary presented a check for $20,000 to the RWJUH Hamilton Foundation. The funds support the hospital's new radiation oncology suite, which has new equipment, including vein finders (small devices that help healthcare providers locate veins underneath the skin) and a renovated lobby. The funds also cover medications for patients who can't afford them. RAISING CRITICAL FUNDS The Auxiliary, which will celebrate its 49th year this fall, has 56 paying members and about 20 active members. The volunteer group works more than 4,600 hours per year to raise important funds for the hospital. Members run the hospital gift shop, and half of the shop's proceeds go to the Auxiliary. In addition, each year, up to 20 vendors set up tables outside the gift shop and sell a wide array of items, such as candy, scrubs, Tupperware, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, purses, suitcases, sheets, towels and blankets. A portion of the sales is given to the Auxiliary. Through this effort, the group raises about $12,000 to $15,000 per year, which goes to the Foundation. \"The impact of the time and fundraising efforts of Auxiliary members is substantial and exceptional,\" says Diane Grillo, Vice President, Health Promotion. \"Their donations go toward supporting patients and families in our community.\" Over the years, the Auxiliary's efforts have funded many key projects at the hospital: $50,000 for the Grounds for Healing at the Cancer Center; $175,000 for the Lakefront Tower Building; $50,000 for the pediatric Emergency Department; and $50,000 for the new Cancer Center. \"I enjoy working for the community,\" says Carol Holloway, president of the Auxiliary. \"I'm always helping someone.\" Once a month, Auxiliary members meet to stuff and sew handmade bears for pediatric patients in the Emergency Department and the same-day surgery unit. As of April, they had made 6,211 bears. The group also collects new sweatsuit pieces for hospital patients who need clean clothes. \"Auxiliary members represent the spirit and soul of the hospital,\" says Bill Pritchard, Vice President of the Foundation. \"Their commitment enables us to provide the best care for patients.\"The RWJUH Hamilton Auxiliary raises funds for the RWJUH Foundation. This check supports the hospital's new radiation oncology suite and patients in need.ARTWORK FOR A GOOD CAUSE The Lakefront Gallery at RWJUH Hamilton, located above the caf\u00e9, showcases work from local artists. A variety of paintings, photographs and mixed media pieces are on display. The exhibits are maintained by the Princeton Photography Club, and the art is available for sale. Proceeds are given to the Foundation. The gallery is open daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Healthy Together | PB | Summer 2019 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton | RWJBH.ORG/HAMILTON | 21 Hamilton_Foundation_SUM19_final.indd 21 6/14/19 11:08 AMONE PATIENT RECEIVED STATE-OF-THE-ART CARE WITHOUT DISRUPTION IN HIS SCHEDULE.From left: Jean Withers, radiation oncologist Michael McKenna, MD, and patient John Withers, who is grateful for his care at RWJUH Hamilton BATTLING CANCER CLOSE TO HOME Healthy Together | 22 | Summer 2019 Hamilton_Cancer_Sum19_final.indd 22 6/14/19 11:13 AMJean Withers has worked as an oncology director and hospice nurse. So when her husband, John, 76, was diagnosed with prostate cancer last summer, she sprang into action. \"His urologist wanted him to see an oncologist in Summit, which is 75 minutes away from our home in Hightstown,\" recalls Jean. \"I was skeptical. It seemed very far, and I was convinced we could get just as good\u2014if not better\u2014care locally.\" Jean was right. John was successfully treated for Stage II prostate cancer at the Cancer Center at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton by radiation oncologist Michael McKenna, MD. He and Jean couldn't have been happier with the care they received. \"We got the benefit of the latest equipment as well as personalized attention, and the Center was no more than a 10-minute drive from our home,\" says John. \"I rarely, if ever, had to miss a day of work during my four months of treatment.\" CONVENIENT CARE The Withers knew they had made the right choice the moment they met Dr. McKenna. \"Our first visit was more than 90 minutes, and we never felt rushed,\" says Jean. (Dr. McKenna's exam was so thorough he ended up referring John to a dermatologist to check out a mole on his back, which ultimately turned out to be benign.) Jean put Dr. McKenna through his paces with her questions. \"I grilled him about the Center's medical physicist,\" she recalls with a chuckle. \"They're the ones who ensure the treatment is being done precisely and accurately. He didn't bat an eye once at my queries.\" Given John's age, the Withers and Dr. McKenna decided that he would have external beam radiation rather than surgery. During the procedure, a machine called a linear accelerator emits high-energy beams at the prostate gland. \"The first treatment was the longest\u2014around 90 minutes\u2014because they wanted to program the linear accelerator to be as precise as possible to minimize side effects,\" recalls John. \"I was nervous, but the technicians bent over backwards trying to accommodate me. They asked me what my favorite music was, and as soon as I said old school rock and roll, they had the Rolling Stones and the Beatles playing.\" For the next two months, he received 39 treatments. \"They always had me in and out,\" he says. \"I'd come straight from my job as a substitute teacher, get radiation at 3:45 p.m., and be back home by 5 p.m.\" A FULL RECOVERY The Cancer Center's focus on patients made both John and Jean feel deeply cared for. \"Whether it was the scheduler, Crystal, who loved to discuss history books with John, or the nurse, Allison, who checked his vitals every week, we truly felt like the staff saw John as more than just a cancer patient,\" says Jean. Ultimately, the biggest praise Jean can give to the Center is the fact that she was so rarely there. \"I think if John had been treated at a larger institution, I would have felt the need to accompany him so that I could advocate for him,\" she says. \"But I had no worries about RWJUH Hamilton. I knew that whenever he was there, he was fine and didn't need me to intervene in any way. It gave me some time for myself, and it took an enormous weight off of my shoulders.\" Today, the Withers spend their free time listening to music, volunteering at their synagogue and the Hamilton Rotary, and enjoying their four grandchildren, ages 15, 9, 8 and 6. John, who is now in remission, returns to the Center every six months to see Dr. McKenna. \"I'm grateful to be done with treatment and to have my health back, but I'm also thrilled that I got state-of-the-art cancer care without having to travel far from home,\" he says. \"For those four months of treatment, the hospital made sure my life was disrupted as little as possible. For that, I'll be always grateful.\"CARING FOR THE CAREGIVER Providing unparalleled patient care is a top priority at the Cancer Center, but ensuring that caregivers' needs are met is just as important. The Center employs a social worker who runs both patient and caregiver support groups. \"Our aim is to be there for every single patient and his or her family,\" says Amy German, director of the Center. In addition, the Center offers Reiki, pet therapy, art healing workshops, nutritional counseling and massages for both patients and caregivers, says German. The healing garden surrounds the infusion chairs with several birdhouses and a waterfall. \"We often find that while caregivers are waiting for their loved ones, they sit outside or take a stroll around the garden,\" she says.
