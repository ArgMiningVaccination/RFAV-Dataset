However, caring for patients and community members can be an extremely stressful task, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of House Staff Appreciation Week, we are highlighting a few of the GME programs across the institution that have developed wellness initiatives for its trainees to preserve and better the health of its most dedicated medical professionals. In July 2017, the pediatric residency program introduced a wellness rotation as part of the curriculum for the PGY-2 year. The rotation was created to improve resilience and combat increasing rates of burnout in the program. This four-week rotation is intended to give residents the opportunity to invest time in self-care and improve work-life balance. During the rotation, residents are highly encouraged to make at least one primary care or obstetrics/gynecology appointment, check in with the staff psychologist and schedule a visit at Rush's Center for Clinical Wellness. They are also required to create a board exam study plan, work on their mandatory quality improvement project and meet with their career advisors. During the rotation, clinical duties are limited to weekly continuity clinic. This allows the wellness resident to be available to provide coverage for any other pediatric resident with a wellness need, including mental health appointments, doctor or dental visits. \"The wellness rotation is such a great reset. It is strategically scheduled between two of our busiest rotations and really allowed me to catch up on those 'life things' that sometimes get put on the back burner when we're busy,\" said Jessica Wyka, MD, chief resident in the department. \"Along with scheduling routine check-ups, I was able to establish a good exercise routine, which I carried forward even when I got busier. As an added bonus, it allowed me to rest up before an ICU month, which I think really cuts down on burn out.\" Since the rotation's implementation, the program has observed a sustained reduction in resident burnout during the PGY-2 and PGY-3 years, as defined by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Residents appear to be requesting their own health coverage more often as a result of the wellness rotation. In addition to the wellness rotation, the pediatric residency maintains a robust, longitudinal wellness curriculum including monthly house staff meetings to receive feedback and discuss improvements for the residency, quarterly confidential class meetings with a staff psychologist and annual retreats for each class during which residents are excused from clinical duties. Clinical rotations are also optimized by alternating more strenuous months with call-free months and minimizing cross-coverage duties. The Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation also instituted a unique wellness initiative structured around a \"Wellness Wheel.\" The wheel includes seven elements of wellness: social, physical, emotional, spiritual, occupational/intellectual, environmental and financial. To ensure that all residents in the department took advantage of the program, initiative leaders took an individualized and group approach. Residents are required to meet with program leadership quarterly to discuss any acute or chronic issues related to their wellness. If an issue is identified, a plan incorporating the Rush Center for Clinical Wellness is created. Individual conversations highlighted systemic issues with rotations, scheduling and other components of the program that could be negatively impacting other residents. Concerns regarding widespread issues impacting wellness within the program are brought to faculty meetings. Over the last two years, the physical medicine and rehabilitation department adjusted call schedules, clinical rotations and protocols for excusing residents for wellness issues to improve resident wellness. The department also established the Intradepartmental Wellness Subgroup, which includes faculty and members of each residency class interested in wellness. The subgroup assisted in reallocating residency department funds towards wellness-themed initiatives such as teambuilding events and dinners, birthday lunches for each resident, creating a wellness library in the resident room and initiating a FitBit challenge. The department's wellness initiatives were recently highlighted in in the Winter 2021 issue of [Physiatry Forward](https://www.physiatry.org/page/PhysiatryForward). The Department of Orthopedics also has a dedicated wellness initiative focused on forming meaningful connections with co-residents and faculty. In place of its regular didactic lecture, residents attend a bonding activity three times a year. Previous activities included bowling, bubble soccer and bow and arrow dodge ball. The department also established a \"blind date dinner,\" during which five residents attend dinner with the residency program and a mystery guest. \"It is an amazing way for the residents to hang out with one another as well get to know the program director and another attending physician in way that they may not have the opportunity to do so otherwise,\" said Monica Kogan, MD, FAOA, program director for the residency program. \"The mystery of who the attending physician is keeps them guessing until they see them walk through the door.\" The department also organizes volunteer activities one to two times a year. In the past, these activities included making blankets for Child Life or serving dinner at the Ronald McDonald House.

This week, Rush University is proud to host its first ever Residency Appreciation Week. To celebrate our residents and fellows, we're highlighting their work through each of the Graduate Medical Education Committees. Here's everything you need to know about the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement (PSQI) committee from second-year internal medicine residents Joshua Thomas, MD and Athavi Jeevananthan, MD. Our purpose is to improve patient safety and improve the quality of care here at Rush by promoting quality improvement projects that residents are working on, educating residents on safety measures already in place at Rush and working with hospital leadership to improve care. Thomas: Dr. Jeevananthan and I were interested in this committee because we believe that quality improvement is an essential component of a thriving health care system. This committee allows us to work with both the house staff and hospital leadership to achieve this goal. Our committee has about 25 members. Our vision is that the committee would continue to work to promote current projects that will improve Rush while fostering a curiosity for patient safety among the residents. Co-presidents Lane Lagattuta, DO and Nicholas Skertich, MD introduce the committee that represents and advocates for Rush resident physicians This week, Rush University is proud to host its first ever House Staff Appreciation Week. To celebrate some of our outstanding residents and fellows, we're highlighting each [Graduate Medical Education (GME) committee](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training/graduate-medical-education/house-staff-committees). Here's everything you need to know about the House Staff Association (HSA), led by co-presidents Lane Lagattuta, DO (PGY-3, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation) and Nicholas Skertich, MD (PGY-3 General Surgery). The HSA is responsible for representing Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) resident physicians in matters relating to: Lagattuta: This is a unique opportunity to represent and advocate for my fellow residents. We are given the chance to work closely with RUMC leadership on various tasks including improving resident wellness, which is also a very rare opportunity for most residents. Skertich: Being involved in the HSA is an incredible opportunity to advocate for your peers and implement positive change to our training experience. All house staff, both residents and fellows, are considered members. The HSA's executive board is made up of two co-presidents, a vice president, secretary, treasurer, patient safety/quality improvement chair and wellness chair. Our main mission as house staff co-presidents is to represent and advocate for our peers. During the COVID-19 pandemic we are particularly focused on resident wellness and finding ways for us to connect with each other despite the social limitations imposed by the pandemic. To that end, we have recently started a bimonthly house staff newsletter instead of hosting meetings. This accommodates all house staff schedules so that more residents and fellows can stay informed and participate. Residency and fellowship can obviously be a very stressful time, pandemic aside, so we have also converted our social chairs to wellness chairs in hopes of focusing on improving house staff wellness. We have also worked with RUMC leadership all year to ensure wellness center resources are available to all house staff. Despite our country's nearly year-long battle with COVID-19, which has significantly affected resident and fellow training, our house staff have shown incredible resilience. When training has been affected, house staff been flexible and have carried on with overwhelmingly positive attitudes. We hope this committee continues to grow and pushes for the best resident and fellow experience possible, from improving resident resources and workspaces, to fostering an excellent educational experience. We also want to be at the forefront in promoting and supporting resident wellness. This week, Rush University is proud to host its first ever House Staff Appreciation Week. To celebrate our house staff, we're highlighting the work of each [Graduate Medical Education committee](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training/graduate-medical-education/house-staff-committees). Here's everything you need to know about the Diversity, Inclusion and Equity (DEI) committee featuring a Q&A with co-president Bianca Williams, MD, MBA (PGY-3, Pediatrics). Bianca Williams: Our mission is to create a more prosperous healing and working environment through the championing of the diverse communities we serve and hope to reflect. Our goal is to facilitate the purposeful creation and maintenance of a more diverse, equitable and inclusive Rush University Medical Center. BW: There is an apparent lack of female physicians and physicians of color within our nation. This is mainly due to the fact that many groups were \"unauthorized\" to achieve medical training in decades past. Now that no one should be discriminated against based on their innate being, it is our job to recruit and retain diverse staff as to not backtrack efforts to create more diverse workspaces, but to move forward. BW: Our members range in level of training from medical students to attending faculty. We are aided by administrators from many different offices across Rush. Active membership has been between 50-70 members over my tenure. BW: We are most proud of the house staff recruiting effort our team executed during the last two seasons. We were able to recruit not only in Chicago, but also at other major city conferences before the pandemic hit. I believe Rush University will see the effects of our work for many years to come. We have also been working closely with the Graduate Medical Education office to fine-tune and build on our efforts. Other initiatives include multicultural programming and pursuit of research funding to specifically address how our patients and physicians are affected by health care inequities and socioeconomic struggles. BW: We are in the \"paying it forward\" stage. We hope excited medical students, resident house staff and attendings will join our cause and bring their ideas to the table. This week, Rush University is proud to host its first ever Residency Appreciation Week. To highlight the great work our trainees do across the institution, we're highlighting each [Graduate Medical Education house staff committee](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training/graduate-medical-education/house-staff-committees). Here's everything you need to know about RES-CORE from Nithin Pusapati, MD (PGY-2, Internal Medicine) and Vishal Jani, DO (PGY-3, Emergency Medicine). The Resident Committee on the Rush Environment, also known as RES-CORE, is a house staff-led committee that collects and adjudicates instances of mistreatment that occur within the Rush learning environment. We discuss cases during monthly meetings to discuss appropriate approaches to reports we receive. There is also a medical school equivalent of our committee called SCORE - the Student Committee on the Rush Medical College Environment. Rush is deeply committed to maintaining a positive learning environment at all levels of medical education and training. Jani: I was looking for a way to get involved outside my residency training program and wanted to find a committee that focused making tangible changes by working with representatives from other programs at an institutional level. RES-CORE was formed during my PGY-1 year, and it appeared to be a good way to achieve this. As I attended meetings, I appreciated the impact RES-CORE's efforts had on those residents/fellows whose cases we addressed. We have 25 resident and fellow members. We continuously monitor an [online portal](https://rush.medhub.com/index.mh) for reports submitted to resolve any on-going issues. The presence of RES-CORE has an impact at the individual level by addressing specific concerns of house staff as well as being part of institutional change. As a committee, we hope to continue to diversify our membership by attracting membership from more programs. Also, we strive to continuously increase awareness among house staff that we are available should they have any concerns that we can address. Rush University Graduate Medical Education and the Rush Medical College Alumni Association are pleased to announce House Staff Appreciation Week on Feb. 22-26, 2021. Our yearlong battle against the COVID-19 pandemic has been especially difficult for our graduate medical education programs. Despite these ongoing challenges, our residents and fellows have shown incredible resilience and have always put our patients and community first. Our trainees have not only staffed COVID-19 floors and ICUs, but many have volunteered to do so. When training has been affected, house staff have been flexible and have carried on with overwhelmingly positive attitudes. To celebrate our trainees throughout the week, house staff committees and wellness stories will be highlighted on social media. In addition, meals will be provided to residents and fellows in the house staff lounge (482 Atrium Building) throughout the week on a first come, first serve basis: The week will culminate with Thank a Resident/Fellow Day on Friday, Feb. 26. Trainees can stop by the GME office (403 Armour Academic Center) to pick up Rush swag and popcorn from 9 a.m. - 3 p.m. \"We are incredibly grateful for our trainees and couldn't have gotten through COVID without them,\" said Mashonda Daniels, director of graduate medical education. \"You all are the true superheroes, and we hope this week exemplifies our gratitude for your hard work, dedication, and persistence as health care professionals during such difficult times.\" To see social media highlights throughout the week, follow #RushGMEAppreciationWeek, as well as Rush GME ( *The photo of residents from the Department of Emergency Medicine was taking during a retreat before the COVID-19 pandemic. For better or worse, many people are watching more TV as a way to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic. One medical residency program found a healthy use for TV: inspiration for recruitment season. The pandemic has limited residency and medical school student recruitment to video meetings, so medical schools and academic health centers across the country have had to find creative approaches. That includes the [neurology residency program](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training/graduate-medical-education/residency-programs/neurology-residency) at Rush University. Neurology at Rush knew it needed a novel way to connect with potential residents. The program created two videos to set itself apart and give students a better sense of its culture: one that gives a [tour of the facilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vyS_qmevTM) in a style similar to the TV series Billy on the Street and a [parody video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P1eisD23Kj9fvpfVdjT8XTz7sC4-hOO4/view) of the TV show The Office. \"We have an excellent residency program, but we needed a way to showcase who we are better than a standard day-in-the-life video would,\" says [Rebecca O'Dwyer, MD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/rebecca-odwyer-md), director of the neurology residency program at Rush. \"Our video showed we can have fun together and enjoy our work. \"It also was a good filter \u2014 some candidates might not get the humor, so that person might not be high on our list. We thought our videos helped paint the picture of our program and culture for everyone.\" Though a virtual recruitment season was not unexpected, it left residency programs and medical students wondering how exactly the 2021 Match season would play out. \"You can learn a lot by meeting with somebody in person that you wouldn't learn on a Zoom meeting,\" says [Joy Sclamberg, MD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/joy-s-sclamberg-md), senior associate dean of [Graduate Medical Education at Rush University](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training/graduate-medical-education). \"That made it tough for the faculty member doing the interview as well as the student.\" Sclamberg says one of the biggest indicators of whether a medical student will be a good fit within a program's culture is how well they get along with the residents currently in the program. Through video, it can be difficult for residents and prospective residents to interact as much as they would like. \"On Zoom, it's hard to take someone aside and talk to them one-on-one,\" says Michael Williams, MD, a third-year resident in Rush's [general surgery program](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training/graduate-medical-education/residency-programs/general-surgery-residency), who helped with recruiting. \"And in a large video meeting, some people may not be as willing to speak up.\" Finding a way to have meaningful interactions with current residents is essential for medical students, who are trying to figure out if a program and city \u2014 sometimes one that a student has never been to before \u2014 is right for them. \"Getting a feel for different programs was tough,\" says Aretha Boakye-Donkor, a fourth-year medical student at Rush who will be specializing in internal medicine-pediatrics as a resident later this year. \"If you ask current residents, they'll tell you that it was the gut feeling they had when they went to a location on interview day. We had to trust that it will all work out.\" And for Boakye-Donkor, who is Black, the potential racial implications of a virtual recruitment season were a concern as she went through the process. \"I was worried about the biases that exist. Are those going to be compounded in a virtual setting?\" Boakye-Donkor says. \"Without the advantage of body language, it's so hard to tell over video how someone is perceiving you. You just have to trust the process.\" Rush started the new recruitment season with a virtual residency fair in September. The various residency programs worked with the marketing department at Rush to create virtual tours and other videos that would give students a sense of what the program and facilities are like. Prior to COVID, a key part of the recruitment process was a social event the day before an interview when faculty, current residents and prospective residents are able to engage with one another in a more natural way. That, of course, was another virtual event this year, with people breaking into smaller groups to allow people to become more familiar with one another. \"Though challenging, we were able to get across to students the sense of camaraderie that residents at Rush have,\" Williams said. \"How the people and place make you feel is so important, and we were able to show what it's like to be at Rush as best we could.\" Medical colleges across the country were facing many of the same barriers for various events, including the Second Look Day in the spring when students make a usually crucial follow-up visit to a school. \"That's the day they often meet their future classmates, their future roommates, and realize they definitely want to come here,\" says Alyssa Cannataro, MEd, assistant director of admissions and recruitment at Rush Medical College. Cannataro and her colleagues not only overcame the challenge of not having an in-person Second Look Day but they took the experience to another level, holding an entire month for Second Look experiences. Throughout April 2020, they held events that included wellness challenges through social media. Students shared photos and thoughts about topics such as yoga, meditation and clean eating. \"It was a huge hit,\" Cannataro says. \"The students were excited and engaged. If COVID disappeared tomorrow, we would of course go back to having an in-person Second Look Day, but you can bet we would definitely incorporate some of these successful ideas we used virtually.\" There was one massive benefit for both prospective medical students and residents: cost savings. In a normal year, the cost of travel for in-person and follow-up meetings is significant. Virtual meetings have also helped students save precious time that they need to devote to their current education. And with travel logistics not a concern this year, students are considering programs they may not have put on their list. That has broadened the applicant pool for medical schools and residency programs. \"Every info session we do with potential students can now include several of our current medical students,\" Cannataro says. \"If I was traveling to, say, California, I couldn't bring five medical students with me to talk to pre-med students. We can now reach more pre-med students who get to talk to more current students, and that helps both sides.\" There is still a lot to figure out for medical schools, residency programs and students alike in this virtual environment, but there is a general sense of encouragement as they look ahead. \"We're learning and we'll do better next year, because this is the reality we'll still be looking at,\" Sclamberg says. \"Some of these virtual components may be the way of the future. It can be a lot easier to do some of these things over Zoom. We don't have all the answers yet.\" Until the dust settles, programs and students are doing their best to connect in meaningful ways. \"Selecting a residency program is a huge decision for students. It can change the trajectory of their career,\" says O'Dwyer, who sees more Office TV show parodies \u2014 or other creative tactics \u2014 continuing as a recruitment tool for her program. \"All we can do is our best to make the process more personalized so they can get a sense of who we are. That's what we're all striving for: placing students in a place that feels like home.\" Having trouble keeping up with all of the COVID-19 information in your news feed? Join the Club. Shortly after the pandemic began, students across Rush University came together to start the [Rush University COVID-19 Journal Club](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/research/covid-19-science/covid-19-rush-journal-club) to sift through the staggering amount of news and research about the virus. Their work is making the science more accessible not only to health care workers but also the general public. The group now has more than 70 members across the University's four colleges, including third-year Rush Medical College students Bijan Zarrabi and Morgan Sturgis, who recently talked about the initiative's work and how it began. Tell us about the COVID Journal Club. Bijan Zarrabi: On our webpage and [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/rmc_covidjournal) we create summaries of research articles and topics that show up in the news to discuss the study design, findings and limitations of each research article. That includes topics such as drugs used to treat COVID and the vaccine trials. Our audience tends toward medical professionals and students, but we're slowly gaining a following from the general public, especially on the Instagram page that Morgan is running. Morgan Sturgis: On our Instagram page, we make the information a bit more digestible and user friendly, and that has allowed us to reach an even broader audience. So instead of just practicing physicians, now we're reaching the general public. We're reaching people like our parents and grandparents who want to know about these hot topics. How did the idea begin? BZ: It started around April when Dr. Beth Hall, a recent Rush Medical College graduate, and I were recruited by [Dr. Elizabeth Baker](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/elizabeth-baker-md), senior associate dean of the college, and Scott Thompson, director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center and our faculty adviser, to organize a group of students who expressed interest in participating in research efforts related to COVID-19. We saw that there were thousands of articles being published on COVID-19, so it's nearly impossible to read every single paper thoroughly. The alternative is reading only the abstracts of those papers. But if you do that, you're not truly able to understand the clinical implications or limitations of each paper. So we decided to create the Journal Club so that we can help people stay up-to-date on the news literature in time-efficient way. What motivated you to get involved? MS: This has just been such a stressful and really unique time for everyone. As medical students, we have seen a lot of our upperclassmen, as well as the physicians who are training us, at the frontline as health care providers for people who have COVID-19. This Journal Club has been a really meaningful way for us to contribute. While we can't be there at the frontline, we can still contribute something positive to the field that we're so passionate about. Do you have a particular interest in infectious disease? MS: ID (infectious disease) has a special place in my heart. My most influential premedical mentor was a man named Dr. Wayne Campbell, who has since passed away. But he was a really well-known ID doctor on the East Coast, and he had this contagious \u2014 pun very much intended \u2014 passion that sparked my interest in ID and really solidified my pursuit of a medicine as a career. At the end of the day, I think ID has a place in any field of medicine, but I definitely have an interest in it and love learning about it. ID is not something that discriminates. It impacts every single person across the world. And I think you can just have a really broad impact in medicine once you understand it. What have been your biggest takeaways from sorting through all the research as part of the COVID-19 Journal Club? MS: Especially at the very beginning, the recommendations and the protocols surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic were just constantly evolving and, quite frankly, really confusing. So I think one of my biggest takeaways has been how essential clear communication and patient education are. The Journal Club has reminded me how important these two pillars of medicine are. We get to cater to this really diverse audience that has changed throughout the course of the Journal Club. And one thing we've been able to do through that is provide an opportunity for people outside of the medical community to ask the questions that are heavy on their minds and hearts. They can ask for a breakdown of some drug they had never heard of but is common in our vocabulary as people in the medical field. BZ: I completely agree. One of my other big takeaways is realizing the power that a small group of students has in being able to come together and generate something so unique but also really useful. I feel like students at Rush are really eager to help others while also educating themselves. Also, the people involved, like Morgan and [our leadership](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/research/covid-19-science/covid-19-rush-journal-club/covid-19-rush-journal-club-leadership), have been so great at what they do, so it inspires you and pushes you to be better and work harder. What do you hope people will take away from your work? BZ: I hope people learn the importance of keeping themselves informed through credible research and the importance of reading those articles critically. As Morgan said, there is so much information coming at us about COVID-19. It's like trying to drink water from a fire hose. We're trying to improve the clarity of the information we're receiving. Seems like you all work well as a group. What has that experience been like? BZ: People are so good at stepping up and are so excited to work on this project. The leadership has been so versatile in terms of taking on different responsibilities. We wouldn't be where we are if it wasn't for the group's leaders. MS: When you start something from the ground up, leadership is so essential. It sets the tone. We have such a great leadership board, from first-year medical students to current physicians. We really have a broad spectrum of experience, but there's a common interest in advocacy, research, education and lifelong learning that really brought us together. Student leaders across Rush University mobilize to create care packages for the clinicians treating patients with COVID-19. Rush Medical College student Sanket Aggarwal remembers how impressed he was by the perseverance of the nurses who helped him adjust to COVID-19 protocols during his clinical rotation this past year. That's partly why he and other student leaders and groups across Rush University created care packages, including encouraging messages, for clinicians at Rush who are treating patients who have COVID-19. \"Due to the length of the pandemic and the political climate drawing attention away, sometimes we lose sight of how much we owe to frontline clinical workers,\" Aggarwal says. \"We wanted to do something to alleviate the stress they face.\" Aggarwal and fellow third-year medical student Christi Brown, who are co-presidents of the student group [Do No Harm](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-experience/student-affairs/student-life-and-engagement/getting-involved/do-no-harm-national-institute-healthcare-improvement-chapter), kick-started an idea that grew to include seven other student organizations spanning each of Rush University's four colleges. Together they raised money for roughly 1,000 care packages, which include wellness items like stress balls, lip balm, lotion, tea and candy. Each care package contains a card with encouraging messages written by Rush students, who assembled and handed out the kits to the nurses, physicians, respiratory therapists and other clinicians who have been caring for patients with COVID-19. Thank you for your dedication and service to the medical field. You are truly making a difference in the fight against COVID, and we as students look up to you! \"We have to take care of frontline workers,\" says Brown, who developed the idea for the wellness packages. \"They're crucial for making sure our patients are safe and healthy. The pandemic has been here for a long time and the numbers are getting bigger, but our frontline workers are still going.\" Brown and Aggarwal first estimated they would have enough resources for 200-300 care packages, but they reached out to other organizations and the interest around campus grew. That included assistance from [Rush Wellness](https://www.rush.edu/health-care-professionals/rush-wellness) and Bryant Adibe, MD, chief wellness officer at Rush. \"Everyone was eager to help,\" Brown says. \"It really shows that our students are thinking of our frontline workers. It's not an easy job.\" Not only have you worked tirelessly to help patients in the COVID units but you've also been a role model and asset to students such as myself. Thank you for persevering, thank you for staying strong, thank you for being YOU! Brown worked with the [Office of Student Life and Engagement](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-experience/student-services/student-life-and-engagement) to pick up deliveries and store items for the care packages at her home. Then, during the winter break Brown single-handedly assembled 700 care packages herself to accommodate the University's social distancing guidelines before taking them all to the University for distribution to frontline workers. Brown and Aggarwal, who managed the budget and item inventory, credit [Shobha Rao, MD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/shobha-l-rao-md), Do No Harm's faculty adviser, for connecting students with University and Medical Center leadership as they were trying to figure out how to complete the project. They also praised University staff members Kapula Patalinghug, Graham Davis, Melissa McCrary, Justin Sapp, Ahad Bootwala and Kamran Ali for supporting the project and providing help with logistics, from ordering items for the care packages and facilitating delivery to finding room to assemble the care packages. The other student organizations at Rush involved are the [American Medical Student Association](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-experience/student-services/getting-involved/american-medical-student-association-0), the [American Medical Association](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-experience/student-services/getting-involved/american-medical-association-0), the [Military Interest Group](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-experience/student-affairs/student-life-and-engagement/getting-involved/rush-university-military-medicine-interest-group-rummig), [Physician Student Society](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-experience/student-services/getting-involved/rush-university-physician-assistant-student-society), the [Graduate College National Medical Association](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-experience/student-services/getting-involved/student-national-medical-association) and [RU Well](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-experience/student-services/getting-involved/rush-university-student-wellness-association-ru-well#overlay-context=rush-experience/student-services/getting-involved). \"Knowing people were there to support us every step of the way was very reassuring,\" Aggarwal says. \"It's pretty amazing to see how everyone came together. There was a spirit and determination to get this done, because we all feel strongly about showing frontline workers that we care.\" In early March, [Rush University](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/) halted its student volunteer program at the Franciscan House of Mary and Joseph homeless shelter to ensure the safety of its students. Despite the danger and uncertainty of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.rush.edu/patients-visitors/covid-19-resources/covid-19-community-resources), students remained determined to continue serving the community. The Franciscan initiative is part of the [Rush Community Service Initiatives Program (RCSIP)](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-experience/rush-community-service-initiatives-program), a volunteer program dedicated to providing services to more than 10,000 members of the West Side communities near Rush University Medical Center. Students worried that the shelter would lack critical support if they were not allowed to participate. \"As a team, we were very concerned about the health inequalities of the homeless population in this shelter, as our team were normally the ones to provide their medications and address their medical concerns,\" says Stephanie Moss, a [Rush Medical College](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-medical-college) student volunteer. \"This virus had the grave potential to exacerbate their complex medical needs and put them at a higher risk of contracting the disease.\" Sharon Gates, DSW, MA, senior director of student diversity and community engagement, brought these concerns to the leaders of the Franciscan RCSIP project. \"I said, 'Here's the deal: We can't stop the show,'\" Gates says. \"The students don't want to stop the show.\" After consideration, the faculty leaders decided that they would take on the role of patient-facing care; later, students were granted approval to assist on the back end. The students' determination eventually fostered a community-wide effort to support the homeless population in Chicago. Three health systems (Rush University System for Health, Cook County Health and UI Health), the Lawndale Christian Health Center, Heartland Alliance, and numerous homeless and communal shelters on the West Side soon joined Rush faculty and students to expand their efforts. The coalition became known as the Chicago Homelessness and Health Response Group for Equity (CHHRGE). The coalition grew to include community partners and organizations such as the Salvation Army and the Haymarket Center, which provides aid to recovering individuals with substance use disorders, who supported the initiative by opening more sites to increase social distancing and continue patient care. But it was the student volunteers who played a vital role in contributing support on the ground. They made daily visits to sites without COVID-19 cases to ensure people stayed healthy, aided Rush faculty members with COVID-19 screenings and referred people for testing for COVID-19. On April 3, they helped organize the distribution of 25,000 articles of personal protective equipment (PPE) and cleaning supplies including gloves, masks and sanitizing wipes. Perhaps most importantly, students coordinated transportation of vital resources to those who could not pick them up from a shelter. They traveled around the Chicago area, even during the spring unrest, to deliver necessary supplies. \"Many of the surrounding pharmacies were just decimated. So students took gift cards, cash, you name it, to the suburbs, and they picked up medication, and they brought it back to the people,\" Gates says. Megan Cunningham, managing deputy commissioner of the Chicago Department of Health, summarized the impact of Rush's work when she stated that had it not been for this large effort, Rush and its partners would not have made so much progress in protecting the unsheltered. CHHRGE is continuing its work through the fall by performing services such as assembling care packages for the homeless community, administering flu vaccinations at shelters and distributing face masks to prevent outbreaks within shelters. The success of Rush University's initiatives does not rest solely on the extent of its impact but also on the relationships it builds with community members. When a Rush academic building that Gates used to house PPE converted into a COVID-19 testing site, student access to the building was revoked. When Gates mentioned the problem to a group of senior women living in Oakley Square, a housing development where Rush operates a clinic, the women were eager to help. They offered their exercise room as a storage facility and allowed students to retrieve supplies whenever necessary. Why? The women appreciate the students' efforts and the time they take to get to know the community. Pre-pandemic, these women and other community members socialized with students by participating in a book club. They read the same books Rush students read for class, such as The Death Gap: How Inequality Kills or The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. Afterward, discussions were held, and community members provided their views on the information learned. They helped students broaden their understanding of working with patients from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives. Gates recounted a story a student told her in which a former patient from Franciscan House saw the student on the street and told the student how he had taken his medical advice and his health had improved. The student was thrilled to see the man, since they were worried about his health and if he was taking care of himself. It is exactly this type of care and relationship that really sets Rush students apart, Gates observes. \"To be identified on the street, by a homeless person that you've been thinking about and concerned about, that speaks volumes about the kind of relationships that are fostered, and how the individuals living in the spaces where our students serve value the respect our students bring,\" Gates says. \"That they treat them no differently than they would their brother, their father, "}
