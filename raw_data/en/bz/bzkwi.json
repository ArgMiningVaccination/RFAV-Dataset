Bacillus subtilis, a harmless intestinal commensal, has recently earned a strong reputation as a vaccine production host and delivery vector, with advantages such as low cost, safety for human consumption, and straightforward oral administration. In this study, we have succeeded generating \"S spores\" by engineering B. subtilis with spore coat proteins resembling the spike (S) protein of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. With the addition of two immunostimulating natural products and Coriolus versicolor (CV), oral administration of S spores could elicit mild immune responses against COVID-19 infection without toxicity. Mucosal IgA against the S protein was enhanced by co-feeding with AM and CV in an S spores-inoculated mouse model. Faster and stronger IgG responses against the S protein were observed when the mice were fed with S spores prior to vaccination with the commercial COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac. In vitro studies demonstrated that AM, CV, and B. subtilis spores could dose-dependently activate both macrophages and dendritic cells by secreting some other proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines. In conclusion, the combination of S spores with AM and CV may be helpful in developing a vaccine-like supplement against interest statement The authors declare no conflict of interest.
