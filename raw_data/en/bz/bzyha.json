2017 iMEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, FACULTY, STAFF, STUDENTS, ALUMNI, AND FRIENDS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY: The current environment for higher education brings with it a new set of challenges. We propose this budget during a time when the competing priorities of the federal government threaten traditional avenues of support for our mission. At the same time, policymakers in Frankfort have made clear that the mounting financial obligations of state government - for the pensions of retired teachers and state workers, and rising health care costs for so many Kentuckians - are a continuing challenge. At the same time, tax revenue has not been as robust as predicted. As a result, last month, state agencies were asked to reduce budgets by 1 percent in the final month of the fiscal year. The governor exempted, for now, Kentucky colleges and universities. The future, though, remains uncertain. But our University has confronted challenges in its storied past. Founded amid the still healing wounds of the Civil War, we have overcome and persisted in times of financial upheaval, national recession, and global conflict. Because of the leadership and vision of those who came before us, as well as the campus and community-wide commitment to our continued success as Kentucky's public flagship and land grant research university, we are well-positioned to continue to make progress. During the last six years, we: E nrolled successive first-year classes that are among the best prepared and most diverse classes in our history. While at the University, ourstudents make remarkable contributions to our campus and communitythrough their academic and extra-curricular work. In many cases, it is ourstudents who are the first to volunteer in communities at home and abroad;create and contribute to our understanding of the world through research;and provide care at a patient's bedside. These students - some 37,792 in thelast six years - leave with a highly-regarded degree, prepared to continuetheir education or enter the private and public sector workforce.C ompleted, initiated, or approved more than $2.2 billion in capital investments to improve our teaching, research, community, and healthcare facilities. In response to the current climate and demands on the stategeneral fund, we made progress through prudent financial managementand a creative mix of private partnerships with private businesses,philanthropists, and UK Athletics. In the academic year ahead, we willopen new upperclass and graduate housing in University Flats, the Lewis Honors College, and the new student center. We will also break ground on the renovated and expanded College of Law and continue work on a new baseball stadium that will make way for additional green space and intramural playing fields in the heart of our campus. These projects are in addition to the ongoing effort to restore and modernize existing facilities in the core of our campus. C ontinued to expand our growing research portfolio, which, last year, surpassed $315 million in external grants and contracts received by our faculty. Kentucky families face - at rates far higher than the national average -incidences of heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer'sDisease, and other chronic illnesses that UKfaculty are committed to addressing. Often,the results of their work have national andglobal implications, as evidenced by the recentawarding of a second Clinical and TranslationalScience grant from the National Institutes ofHealth. At the same time, our faculty discoverand create across all the academic disciplinesavailable at the University - broadening ourunderstanding of ancient cultures and history,and adding a rich score to art and music. Matched the biomedical advances forged in our research laboratorieswith unparalleled health care in Kentucky communities, and served theneeds of patients and families through a network of partner providers.To further our efforts in medical education, we are launching satelliteacademic programs in partnership with hospitals and universities inBowling Green, Northern Kentucky, and Morehead. Our work - the teaching, research, service, and patient care - underway at the University of Kentucky underscores our enduring mission as the University for Kentucky. iiPRESIDENT'S BUDGET MESSAGE June 16, 2017 The $3.7 billion operating and capital budget for FY2017-18 presented in the pages that follow, acknowledges and adapts to our current reality. It builds on past progress. Our priorities for funding align with our Strategic Plan and the values that define our campus: maintaining access and affordability for our students; ensuring competitive compensation for our faculty and staff; protecting academic quality; and continuing our commitment to a campus defined by belonging. T o balance the ambitious pursuit of goals embodied in our Strategic Plan while keeping the University of Kentucky education accessible andaffordable, we are implementing moderate tuition and fee increases - a4 percent increase for resident students and a 6.5 percent increase forstudents from outside the Commonwealth of Kentucky. This is thefifth consecutive year with an increase of no greater than 5 percent forKentucky resident students. T he out-of-pocket expense for tuition and fees each semester for undergraduate resident students has grown by less than $600, on average,between 2010-2016 because of our aggressive approach to scholarships andfinancial aid. In 2017-18, we are increasing scholarships and institutionalaid by 8 percent to $126 million, and investing $2.5 million in initiativesaimed directly at ensuring the success of our students. A bout half of UK students continue to graduate without debt. The default rate on federal student loans for UK students is 4.4 percent\u2014farless than half of the national average default rate of more than 11 percent.The upcoming academic year also marks the further implementation ofour effort to realign our financial aid program to address unmet need. G uided by our continuing effort to reward and retain faculty and staff for strong performance in their work, the budget includes a merit salarypool of 2.5 percent - the fifth year of salary increases under PresidentCapilouto. As the UK HealthCare enterprise operates on a separatesalary review cycle, decisions will be made this fall about UK HealthCareemployee merit increases. T o continue to rebuild and reinvest in our campus - a campus-wide effort resulting from the Board of Trustees' decisive action six yearsago - we are investing an additional $1 million in a recurring capitalrenewal pool, which is now up to $8 million annually, to address deferredmaintenance and modernize our campus. And a new fund, with an initial$500,000 investment, will create a pool of funds to address utility needs.Our priorities to invest in student aid and support; reward faculty and staff performance; address fixed cost increases; and make strategic investments in our campus and programs total some $31 million in additional funding needs. We are able to fund these priorities, even in an era of flat or declining state support, through a series of efficiency efforts led by our faculty and staff that maintained our commitment to students and our mission. As part of our budget process, we identified more than $13 million in increased efficiencies, new operating revenue returns, modern utility conservation practices, service assessments to self-supporting units, and strategic reallocations. To be sure, financial pressures at the state and federal levels make planning a delicate and complex task. But we are financially strong and we are managed well, thanks to the people who share an unwavering commitment to our work. This budget is focused on our people - the students we serve and the faculty and staff who carry out our mission and moral responsibility to teach, conduct research, and provide care and service throughout our Commonwealth, and around the world. This budget reflects our priorities of student success and affordability, consistent movement toward competitive pay for our employees, enhancement of academic quality, and a commitment to being a community of belonging that makes the University stronger and more vibrant. Because of your hard and smart work, as well as the soundness of our vision for our University, I remain optimistic that our ambitious institutional goals, and - through them - our efforts to serve the Commonwealth, are achievable. As the University for Kentucky, we are focused on our people, our Commonwealth, and our shared future. Sincerely, Eli Capilouto Presidentiii2015-2020 UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY STRATEGIC PLAN \"Transforming Tomorrow\" Year One Progress Report iv\"There is no vaccination against ignorance, but there is us. There is this university. And we still have heavy doors to open, unmet obligations to the land and its people. There are still leadership opportunities to advance the Commonwealth, this nation, and our world towards fulfilling its potential, towards meeting its lofty promises ... Let men and women come here as seeds, let us invest in them until they form sufficient roots and leaves to obtain their food. Let them grow from here not just trees, but a fruit-bearing, deeply-rooted forest.\" Frank X Walker Professor in the UK Department of English and 2015 Kentucky Poet Laureate Written for the University of Kentucky's 150th Sesquicentennial Anniversary vSEEDTIME IN THE COMMONWEALTHFrank X Walker viUNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY MESSAGE FROM THE UNIVERSITYThrough the education we provide, the creative research we conduct, and the care and service we render, we are the University for Kentucky. We are the institution our Commonwealth has charged with confronting profound challenges - in education, economic development, health care, and cultural and societal advance. The University of Kentucky Board of Trustees endorsed the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan in October 2015. The ambitious plan embraces the University's historic mission as a public, flagship, and land-grant research institution, and calls us to: This institution and the members of the UK family boldly confront challenges, rise to meet new opportunities, and embr ace the goals we set as the University for Kentucky. Now, in the year following the endorsement of the Strategic Plan, we made progress on its aspirational agenda. Here, we report our results to those we serve. A university - by its design and the opportunities we have to teach, to share, to explore, to challenge, to question, and to comfort - is the place where we can, must, and will make progress in resolving the complex questions of our day. Our Strategic Plan supports and informs this work, and, as this report makes clear, guides us in advancing toward the bright future of the University of Kentucky. Each day w e are, together, grappling with how we continue to best fulfill this vision. We are working with a sense of common purpose, in a distinctive place. We are walking the path as the University for Kentucky, for today's generation and those who will follow. MESSAGE FROM THE UNIVERSITYUniversity of Kentucky Be the University of choice for aspiring under-graduate s tudents within the Commonwealth and beyond, seeking a transformational education thatpromotes self-discovery, experiential learning, andlife-long achievement. Strengthen the quality and dis tinctiveness of our graduate programs to transform our students intoaccomplished scholars and professionals whocontribute to the Commonwealth, the nation, andthe world through their research and discovery,creative endeavors, teaching, and service. Enhance the diversity and inclusivity of ourU niversity community through recruitment, promotion, and retention of an increasinglydiverse population of faculty, administrators, staff, and students, and by implementing initiatives that provide rich diversity-related experiences for all to help ensure their success in an interconnected world. Expand our scholarship, cr eative endeavors, and research across the full range of disciplinesto focus on the most important challenges of theCommonwealth, our nation, and the world. Lever age leading-edge technology, scholarship, and research in innovative ways to advance thepublic good and to foster the development ofcitizen-scholars. viiThis institution and the members of the UK family boldly confront challenges, rise to meet new opportunities, and embrace the goals we set as the University for Kentucky. President Eli Capilouto and Provost Tim Tracy viii Undergraduate student support efforts are centered upon four pillars of student success: Academic success, Financial stability, Belonging/community, and Health/wellness. To reach our goals, we must use these four pillars as our compass, while also thinking and acting differently and intentionally. To that end, UK is actively realigning the crucial student support services that report to the Office of the Provost. The realignment is structured to allocate every available resource toward direct, frontline support for students. To that end, we are investing even more in crucial services like advising to better integrate the entire student experience. We also ar e providing more professional development opportunities; better integrating communication among advisors across campus; and expanding living-learning communities in new residence halls. In addition, we are aggressively confronting the second pillar of student success: financial stability. We know that one of the biggest barriers to student success - if not the biggest - is unmet financial need. At as little as $5,000 in unmet need, retention rates drop by 8 percent or more. Over the next several years, under the UK Leveraging Economic Affordability for Developing Success (UK LEADS) initiative, the University will move from awarding approximately 90 percent of its aid based on Be the University of choice for aspiring undergraduate students within the Commonwealth and beyond, seeking a transformational education that promotes self-discovery, experiential learning, and life-long achievement. We will make strategic inv estments in faculty recruitment, retention, and development, and in approaches that support innovative teaching and learning. In addition, we will advance student success through programs that provide high-quality curricular and co-curricular opportunities. UK will consistently produce outstanding graduates who complete their degrees in a timely manner, think creatively, communicate effectively, and are able to contribute as leaders to a diverse, global society. UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE ONE Promises Made. Promises Kept. Shared Success in Transforming TomorrowUNDERGRADUATE STUDENT SUCCESSStrategic Objective One ixYear One Lessons Learned Over the last year, we laid the groundwork for further success on our priorities. The University's next steps include realigning parts of the campus to make greater progress on our goals, with a specific focus on bolstering student success and academic excellence. To do so, the University must match money to mission and will allocate its resources in a way that provides the best environment for student success. Aligning these efforts also requires clarified definitions and purpose. Therefore, the University will continue its work to bring student support units and the colleges together with a common, collaborative vision for student success and academic excellence. Establishing continuity and coordination among units requires a clear implementation process. Year Two Priorities The University will continue to thoroughly evaluate its approach to Enrollment Management in order to determine how we can better support and organize these crucial efforts on behalf of our students. Enrollment Management is critical to the financial health, mission, and vision of the institution; as with all areas, the University's efforts will maximize our strengths while looking for opportunities to improve. In addition, the campus will continue its efforts to build a new culture of success within the Division of Student and Academic Life. The new division will strive for continuous improvement, building upon the good work already underway, to be as student-centric as possible. The academic enterprise will continue to build a structure that supports the work of UK's faculty and staff and fosters the culture of collaboration needed to help every student thrive. UK also will continue to enhance advising and other student support services within the colleges by focusing its efforts on the four pillars of student success and through continued collaboration among the units and colleges. academic merit, to awarding a majority of its aid based on financial need. This initiative is part of a holistic effort to focus intentionally and comprehensively on student success at all levels. We also have increased funding for the Provost Persistence Grant program, which encourages retention, progression, and graduation of UK undergraduate students by assisting students experiencing financial challenges. To nurture the feeling of belonging and community on our campus, we have merged the critical efforts of the divisions of Student Affairs and Undergraduate Education, creating the Division of Student and Academic Life. This alignment blends, in an intentional, coordinated way, the curricular, extra-curricular, and co-curricular. We also are strengthening the Office of Institutional Diversity by examining and aligning its structure to support student success and belonging. Finally, we have significantly expanded our capacity to support students' wellness, through aggressive investment in campus counseling services, including the hiring of eight additional counselors. Through the UK Counseling Center, students are able to receive excellent care and treatment. xTHE RHODES LESS TRAVELED UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE ONE University of Kentucky senior Rachel Dixon, of Lexington, was named a finalist for the Rhodes Scholarship in November 201 6. An English and writing, rhetoric, and digital studies double-major and Hispanic studies minor, Dixon also is a Lewis Honors College member and former college ambassador. Rhodes Scholars are chosen not only for their outstanding scholarly achievements, but for their character; commitment to others and to the common good; and potential for leadership in their future careers. Dixon is a Gaines Fellow who has worked on expanding our understanding of the Celtic culture, as part of the Lexington Oral History Research Project. She gave presentations on Kentucky's coal rhetoric at the 2016 Rhetoric Society of America National Conference and on cultural rhetoric, assimilation, and acculturation at the 2014 National Conference for Undergraduate Research. She has had her work published in five journals, books, and reports, and served as an editorial assistant for manuscripts on collaboration, population health, and health policy in the College of Public Health. Dixon is equally busy outside of UK's classrooms and research facilities. She has held several leadership positions including director of partnerships for the UK Center for Community Outreach and director of For Unity and Service In Our Neighborhoods (FUSION). She also volunteered teaching children English in Jinotega, Nicaragua, as part of UK Alternative Service Br eaks. In many ways, Dixon's experience as a UK student exemplifies the opportunity to explor e the intellectual and cultural diversity of the world, and to passionately pursue one's interests. This is the type of high-quality undergraduate experience that will position our graduates to lead lives of meaning and purpose.Rachel Dixon xi In May 2016, the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees approved the creation of the new Lewis Honors College at UK. The college will attract top-quality students and improve access for under-represented minority students and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to educational environments otherwise reserved for students at expensive, independent institutions. The creation of both an honors college and Lewis Hall, the living-learning facility wher e it will be housed, was made possible in October 2015 by UK alumnus Thomas W. Lewis and his family. Their commitment of $23.5 million to create one of the country's leading honors colleges is the single-largest gift in UK's history. \"Across the University of Kentucky campus are profound examples of people's faith in our institution, the work we do, and the lives we shape,\" President Eli Capilouto said. \"The Lewis family is investing in the University, and their investment will yield an extraordinary academic experience for students in the new Lewis Honors College.\" In the last five years, at the direction of President Capilouto and the Board of Trustees, participation in the University's Honors Program has nearly doubled, growing from 750 students to nearly 1,400. \"I have a strong belief in the value of education and helping young people become the best they can be,\" Lewis said during his gift announcement on October 22, 2015. \"This gift is our way of helping University of Kentucky honors students reach their full potential as leaders who will create, shape, and influence people, ideas, and discoveries for this and generations yet to come.\" Transforming the Honors Experience at Kentucky \"Across the University of Kentucky campus are profound examples of people's faith in our institution, the work we do, and the lives we shape.\" President Eli Capilouto xiiOur action steps are designed to transform the quality and distinctiveness of our graduate programs. Over the last year, three action steps in particular have yielded the most promise. The Graduate School is responsible for awarding multiple fellowships, many of which are intended for entering students. The process for awarding fellowships, though, held opportunities for improvement to help programs make offers and recruit the best and brightest graduate prospects earlier in the recruiting calendar. To address this, the Graduate School established the block funding initiative and piloted it in five programs that represented a range of disciplines and graduate support mechanisms (Integrated Biomedical Sciences, Psychology, Computer Science, English, and Plant Pathology). The approach involved providing funds to these programs at the very beginning of the recruiting cycle and applying few constraints on how the programs could use their funds in their recruitment efforts. Thus far, feedback from the programs has been uniformly positive. At the same time, the professional development of our graduate students is key to their long-term success. To support both professional development and career planning opportunities, the Graduate School offers courses in preparing future faculty and professionals. In September 2016, more than 50 students attended the first Graduate Student Leaders Conference; this full-day event was specifically designed to improve their leadership skills. The recently launched GradDegree+ program involves a unique partnership between the Graduate School and UK Human Resources to help develop Strengthen the quality and distinctiv eness of our graduate programs to transform our students into accomplished scholars and professionals who contribute to the Commonwealth, the nation, and the world through their research and discovery, creative endeavors, teaching, and service. We recognize that the scope of professional opportunities for our gr aduate students is changing in fundamental ways. So, too, is our approach to graduate education, as we closely examine course offerings, as well as graduate students' teaching and research responsibilities throughout their degree programs. In addition, we are targeting financial support for graduate education in ways that will increase selectivity and expand and enhance programs that leverage UK's existing and emerging areas of strength in research and creative work. UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE TWO Promises Made. Promises Kept. Shared Success in Transforming TomorrowGRADUATE STUDENT SUCCESSStrategic Objective Two Denitio n Metric Baseline 2020 Goal Doctoral Program SelectivityPercentage of doctoral applicants who receive offers of admission25.0% Graduate Degrees Awarded*Master's, Education Specialist, and Doctoral degrees awarded1,539 1,501 Diversity prior yearxiiiYear One Lessons Learned Our progress to date is a strong foundation for future success. Critical to additional progress is the coordinated communication between the Graduate School and college departments to improve the application process for prospective graduate students. Our research indicates that a large number of applications for graduate study are started but never completed. Coordinated communication across academic and administrative units responsible for recruitment and enrollment can assist applicants with the process and provide the necessary information to join their preferred program. Under-represented minority graduate student mentoring enhances academic success. The mentorship program is in its infancy, but the discussion at the fall 2016 LTJ/SREB reception supported the concept that a greater sense of belonging and the ready availability of a close support structure for students will lead to greater academic success. Though the Graduate School already is offering many professional development and career advising programs, more are needed. It is clear that in order to grow and flourish, these programs must also be offered, in partnership with the Graduate School, at the departmental or college level. At the same time, our surveys identified that the top three transferable skills graduate students want to develop in order to complement their scholarly training are project management, personnel management, and grant writing. Year Two Priorities To build on the proven success over the last year, the Graduate School will, in partnership with the graduate programs, develop a new marketing and communication strategy to increase applications from, and ultimate enrollment of, high-performing domestic, international, and under-represented minority students. The Graduate School developed a proposal to expand the block grant pr ogram, whereby the pools of flexible funds will be given to the colleges who, in turn, will provide support to their graduate programs. We believe that the central administration of each college is in a better position to assess program recruitment needs than the Graduate School. The Graduate School consistently competes for top international and domestic applicants to its programs; however, more can be done to maximize the recruitment of top students from UK's undergraduate programs. The University Scholars Program (USP) allows undergraduate students to enroll in the Graduate School as seniors and count up to 12 credit hours of coursework toward both their undergraduate and graduate degrees. The clear benefit at the graduate level is that the degree can be completed in a shorter time; this is a key consideration at a time when growing student debt is a major national concern. There is potential in developing more interdisciplinary collaborations, like the recently established USP linking agricultural biotechnology undergraduate majors with the master's degrees in medical science. and refine the transferable skills highly sought by employers. Examples of short courses offered in this program include \"Communicating across Cultures,\" \"Managing Conflict,\" and \"Leading Effective Teams.\" The third area of great promise relates to further enhancing diversity and inclusivity. As the Graduate School strives to increase the number of under-represented minority students enrolled, it also must do everything possible to ensure their subsequent academic success. To this end, the assistant dean of graduate academic services has been instrumental in developing a mentorship program, particularly for recipients of the Lyman T. Johnson Fellowship (LTJ) and Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) Doctoral Scholars awards for under-represented minority students. The goal is to identify a faculty mentor for each scholar; to date, 54 of the more than 70 eligible students have been paired with mentors. xivOver the last several years, the Three Minute Thesis competition has grown exponentially and given graduate students an opportunity to hone their communication skills and present their research to an audience of laypersons. Participants have one PowerPoint slide and three minutes to effectively communicate the goals of their ongoing dissertation or thesis research to public audiences. UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE TWO The most recent competition featured nine graduate student finalists from five colleges (Agriculture, Food, and Environment; Arts and Sciences; Education; Medicine; and Pharmacy), who competed for an all-expense-paid trip to the Southern Council of Graduate Schools regional competition. The winner, Carleigh Fedorka (representing the Department of Veterinary Sciences in the College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment) presented, \"The Dirty Brood Mare...Cleaned Up.\" YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES, GO! Carleigh Fedorka xvUK Chemistry Graduate Student Receives NASA Fellowship The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) has launched a major initiative to transform the culture of graduate education and to implement changes that will broaden the career preparation of doctoral students. The University of Kentucky and 27 other colleges and universities received a total of $1.65 million in grants to facilitate the transformation. UK's program, Careers Beyond the Professoriate, will provide resources and support to humanities and social science graduate students who are interested in exploring diverse career paths. Careers Beyond the Professoriate is supported by the College of Arts and Sciences and an NEH Next Generation Humanities PhD Grant. Led by project director Sarah Lyon, UK's planning grant will enable integration of multiple career outcomes early in a student's experience in graduate school; revisions to curriculum and degree requirements to better prepare students for a diverse array of future occupations; maximization of faculty buy-in for a transformed doctoral degree; identification of methods for supporting students beyond teaching-focused funding; initiation of partnerships with non-academic institutions; and development of an evaluation plan for future activities and implementation. \"The academic-focused future we ar e accustomed to training graduate students for is disappearing,\" NEH Chairman William D. Adams said. \"If graduate programs wish to make a case for the continuation of graduate education in the humanities, they are going to have to think about the professional futures of their students in entirely different ways.\" Looking to the Future of Humanities Graduate EducationAlexis Eugene, a UK doctoral student in the Department of Chemistry, has been awarded the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship. More than 700 applications were submitted for the 2016 awards, and Eugene was one of only 73 who received a fellowship in earth science. \"I am honored to receive this prestigious fellowship, and I am grateful for this opportunity to work with NASA scientists to further NASA's goals while making progress toward my degree from UK,\" Eugene said. Eugene will collaborate with members of NASA's Langley Aerosol Research Group Experiment by analyzing the chemical composition of cloud water and aerosol samples collected during flights over the Atlantic Ocean. Specifically, she will study what chemicals are there and how they affect the properties of the atmosphere. xviEnhance the diversity and inclusivity of our University community through recruitment and retention of an increasingly diverse population of faculty, administrators, staff, and students, and by implementing initiatives that provide rich diversity-related experiences for all to help ensure their success in an interconnected world. The Office of the Provost has seen great success with the Pr ovost Persistence Grant program, which encourages undergraduate retention, progression, and graduation by assisting students experiencing financial challenges. Over the past year, 309 such grants were awarded, 52 percent of which supported under-represented minority students and 38 percent of which supported African-American students, specifically. Additionally, 57 percent of recipients were students from Kentucky. Last year, UK awar ded $15.2 million in William C. Parker Scholarships. Of these, 1,956 awards\u2014or 86 percent \u2014 supported under-representedminority students; 47 percent supported African-American students; and 71 percent supportedstudents from Kentucky. UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE THREE We will achie ve this objective by working collaboratively to create an environment where all members of the UK community live and work in an environment of openness and acceptance, and in which people of all backgrounds, identities, and perspectives can feel a sense of belonging. We ar e committed to providing an enriching UK experience for all faculty, administrators, staff, and students by actively exploring and adopting new initiatives that will expand both the diversity and inclusivity of our campus community. Promises Made. Promises Kept. Shared Success in Transforming TomorrowDIVERSITY ANDINCLUSIVITYStrategic Objective Three xviiYear One Lessons Learned Across our campus and our country, there is much that unites us. But, at the same time, deep divisions exist. As Kentucky's flagship, land-grant institution, we must continue striving to be a community where our embrace of diversity and expression welcomes everyone \u2014 of every race and religion; identity and perspective; and background and ideology. Therefore, the University must maintain an awareness of, and foster a sense of belonging for, all student populations that comprise our community through increased communication, programming opportunities, and services that contribute to success. UK must foster the same sense of community and belonging for all our faculty and staff, as well as those who visit us. We know that building the infrastructure for diversity and inclusion that includes participation throughout campus is essential to accelerate student success; increase faculty and staff representation; provide cultural competency; and enhance growth of the University community. Year Two Priorities Every member of the UK family shares the r esponsibility for sustaining a community of belonging for everyone, and each of us shares the commitment to continue our progress. To do so, we must develop a UK diversity plan in compliance with the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education's \"Kentucky Public Postsecondary Education Policy for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\" In addition, we must examine employment categories where underutilization exists, taking affirmative measures to attain continuous progress in the number and proportion of female and under-represented minority faculty and staff, including UK HealthCare enterprise goals. We have seen great pr ogress and results from our continued UBI training completed thus far. We must continue this initiative for all members of the University community. Based on a realignment of student activity fee funding, Inclusive Excellence Programming Grants became available as well. The University is soliciting proposals from student organizations and faculty and staff units to enhance inclusive excellence across the student population. The primary focus of this funding opportunity is on collaboration and innovation. Upon conclusion of the first year of implementation, benefits of exemplary programs will be communicated to the University community. While recruiting a more diverse community of students, faculty, and staff, the University also has launched a variety of new initiatives to nurture a feeling of safety and belonging on campus. The Unconscious Bias Initiative (UBI) began in earnest in early 2016, with trainings and a formal assessment of the campus climate. Throughout fall 2016, campus leadership, areas within the Office of the Executive Vice President for Finance and Administration, UK HealthCare officials, smaller colleges, smaller academic units, faculty search committees, and teaching assistants received UBI training. The University will continue this important work with additional training in the future, with an ultimate goal of reaching all UK faculty, staff, and students through training, e-learning, and other learning opportunities over the next 2-3 years. To str engthen the impact of this training and foster continuous improvement, each college identified diversity and inclusion officers, for a total of 38 officials. Following training of those officials in September and October 2016, their charge is to work collaboratively with college leadership, the Office of the Provost, and the Office for Institutional Diversity to facilitate achievement of the diversity and inclusivity strategic initiatives. Focus areas for these officials include leading in the development of initiatives and programs that support equitable opportunities; enhancing recruitment and retention efforts; and tracking college-wide efforts through narrative and data collection. xviiiUK has initiated a variety of efforts regarding faculty recruitment and retention. Assessment of the Strategic Plan first-year employment data indicates an increase in both the number and proportion of female, African-American, and Hispanic faculty. For several months, under-represented minority faculty groups, including African-American, Hispanic, Muslim, LGBTQ*, Asian, and Native-American, engaged in conversation to discuss the benefits and challenges of university life. These discussions provided a foundation for developing initiatives and recommendations that support hiring and retaining under-represented minority faculty. UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE THREEA CAMPUS-WIDECONVERSATIONTerry Allen | Sonja Feist-Price University of Kentucky adminis trators continue to work diligently to address five primary concerns that students presented to them in November 2015. One of the primary concerns was the lack of African-American professors and their retention on campus. xix Most high school students are exposed to history, biology, and algebra classes; but a fortunate group of students from Lexington's Bryan Station High School (BSHS) had the unique opportunity to do much more. Four BSHS students were chosen by their school educators to participate in a health sciences mentoring program for economically disadvantaged but ambitious African-American students. The program was developed by University of Kentucky undergraduate student Kevin Landwehr under the mentorship of Assistant Professor and Gill Heart Insitute faculty member Dr. Michael Winkler, with support from the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine. The BSHS students have participated in a variety of activities such as human subjects researcher training; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) training and certification; and library science training (through the medical library). They also attended a life sciences entrepreneurship lecture via telecast from Rice University; toured and had lectures on hospital testing laboratories; attended an autopsy presentation; took part in simulation training via the simulation lab for ICU care; attended curriculum vitae sessions meant to prepare them to pursue hospital jobs in the future; and had many shadowing experiences in different departments from radiology and cardiology to neurosurgery. Chief of the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine and Medical Dir ector of the Gill Heart Institute Dr. Susan Smyth points to a critical challenge for the practice of medicine and science in terms of achieving equity in health care delivery and diversity in the workforce. \"This is an incredibly exciting and much needed pr ogram,\" she said. \"We face very real inequities in the STEM workforce. As a university that embraces diversity of thought and strives to promote an inclusive environment, we will need to develop programs and processes to affect change.\"Early Hands-on Science Education Inspires a New Generation of Researchers xxExpand our scholarship, creative endeavors, and research across the full range of disciplines to focus on the most important challenges of the Commonwealth, our nation, and the world. Continuing our commitment of the past 150 y ears, we will pursue research and creative work that cross interdisciplinary boundaries to address challenges and disparities of our citizens. Strategic support and investment will be directed toward scholarship that capitalizes on strengths and enriches the lives of those in the Commonwealth. As a land-grant institution with 17 colleges and UK Libraries, research and creative scholarly activity span our campus - a place where excellence takes many forms. To recognize the breadth of research excellence by our faculty, the Office of the Vice President for Research restructured the University-wide Research Professorship Program. Each college sets its own nomination criteria for excellence. The one-year, $10,000 award for excellence in research and creative work by faculty is used to further the research, scholarship, and creative endeavors of the awardee. The landscape for extramural resear ch funding is highly competitive, and our ability to compete depends on the intellectual capital of our scholars. Over the last year, UK researchers increased extramural grants and contracts earned by 11 percent. In addition, multidisciplinary research that addresses complex questions continues to grow. Over the last year, the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) received a second Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) totaling more than $19 million. In addition, continued NIH funding for the Alzheimer's Disease Center within the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging assures that important basic research and clinical trials for Alzheimer's therapies will continue. The newly formed Institute for Bioinformatics received a $2.8 million Major Research Instrumentation Grant from the National Science Foundation to support the development of the Kentucky Research Informatics Cloud. UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE FOUR Promises Made. Promises Kept. Shared Success in Transforming TomorrowRESEARCH ANDSCHOLARSHIPStrategic Objective Four *Preliminary, unpublished dataxxiYear One Lessons Learned It has been a productive year for UK's research enterprise \u2014 one that has yielded multiple accolades as a nationally competitive institution for creative scholarship and discovery. There is, however, opportunity to refine existing metrics in terms of their definition and source. This is a continuous process that requires considerable thought, evaluation, and benchmarking. Year Two Priorities In the year ahead, UK's Markey Cancer Center will compete for the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute Comprehensive Cancer Center status. Competing for Comprehensive Cancer Center status moves the Markey Cancer Center and UK's research in this critical area of health care to the next level, by adding depth and breadth to the research enterprise. This effort is central to our function as the University for Kentucky, as cancer death rates in the Commonwealth are among the highest in the nation. As our new resear ch building opens, we must be ready to optimize the use of our state- of-the-art laboratories. Therefore, the Office of the Vice President for Research will develop policies and procedures that align the allocation of laboratory space in multidisciplinary research buildings with thematic goals to address health disparities through interdisciplinary research. This effort will include policies and procedures for financial support of new multidisciplinary research centers and institutes that perform research addressing problems of the Commonwealth. Over the last year, we have strengthened the research enterprise by recruiting new leadership for five of the 13 multidisciplinary research centers that serve as collaborative research environments crossing academic and disciplinary boundaries. The University also welcomed a new director of the Office of Technology and Commercialization, and a new executive director of the Proposal Development Office following nationwide searches. Finally, cutting-edge imaging instrumentation was brought into revised research support core facilities to enhance research capabilities and competitiveness of faculty for extramural funding. The $265 million multidisciplinary resear ch building will bring together researchers across numerous fields including health care (both basic and clinical), public health, behavioral sciences, agriculture outreach and extension, economics, and engineering to focus on cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke, drug abuse, and obesity and diabetes. Kentucky leads the nation in incident rates in these complex health conditions. \"To solve complex pr oblems, you have to use a multi-pronged approach,\" said Vice President for Research Lisa Cassis, who also is a researcher in pharmacology and nutritional sciences in the College of Medicine. \"Some of my colleagues tell me that obesity is about economics. I am approaching the problem from a very basic, biomedical research perspective. This building will allow us to put people like me in close proximity to someone who is studying obesity from an economic perspective. The real power of research is realized in bringing different groups of experts together. This building will give us a vehicle, and my job is to promote that culture here at UK.\" xxii The Strategic Plan for research focuses on expanding scholarship, creative endeavors, and research acr oss the full range of disciplines. Seventeen faculty were named University Research Professors for 2016-2017, including Diana Hallman and Brent Seales. Hallman, an associate professor of musicology in the College of Fine Arts, is an internationally recognized scholar of 19th-century French opera. In 2003 Hallman wrote a New York Times article on the historical and contemporary meanings of La Juive (The Jewess) in the Met's production of the opera. She has dedicated her scholarship to revising the history of French grand opera, which is haunted by anti-Semitic attacks on the genre and its composers. Seales, chair of the Computer Science Department in the College of Engineering, is a pioneer in scann ing and virtual unwrapping techniques. He was able to recover legible sections (compiled from 10,000 separate CT slices) of the Herculaneum scrolls buried by volcanic ash. Seales was featured in publications around the globe for unwrapping the En-Gedi scroll, a 1,700-year-old, badly burned text that includes part of the book of Leviticus in the Hebrew Bible. \"The text revealed today from the En-Gedi scroll was possible only because of the collaboration of many differ ent people and technologies,\" Seales said. \"The last step of virtual unwrapping, done at the University of Kentucky through the hard work of a team of talented students, is especially satisfying because it has produced readable, identifiable, biblical text from a scroll thought to be beyond rescue.\" UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE FOUR University Research Professors Represent Excellence Across CampusLight Microscopy Core Instruments, Staff Boost Research Capacity The Office of the Vice President for Research invested $1.3 million in two new microscopes for the Light Microscopy Core to support an array of research efforts across campus. Chris Richards, core director and assistant professor of chemistry, said these instruments and the hiring of manager Thomas Wilkop (an electronics engineer from the University of California, Davis), will enable UK researchers to utilize the most advanced imaging available. \"If we want to understand biological systems, ranging from neuroscience to physiology, or to apply imaging techniques for cutting-edge materials science, we really need to have the type of equipment that makes us competitive with other universities. These microscopes absolutely do it,\" Richards said. xxiiiThe mission of UK Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CCTS) is to accelerate the translation of basic science discoveries into tangible improvements in public health. Through funding, training, infrastructure, and community engagement, the center facilitates and supports innovative team science. CCTS provides critical research infrastructure and pilot funding for new ideas. Over the years the center has provided $4 million in awards, which have yielded $38.5 million in competitive extramural research funding. \"To catalyze early-stage, innovative team science, we have funded 100 multidisciplinary team science projects,\" said Philip A. Kern, CCTS director . \"The awards have yielded an 8-to-1 return on competitive extramural research funding to UK.\" The center also supports a two-year career development program that provides funding, research training, confer ence travel support, and mentorship designed to help junior investigators obtain independent investigator awards. As the CTSA hub for Central Appalachia, CCTS focuses on addressing health disparities in the region and collaborates with universities and hospitals in Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, and Tennessee. Through the Community Leadership Institute of Kentucky, CCTS has provided grants and research training to 14 community-based health partners.Clinical and Translational Science Award Renewed, CCTS Continues to Bring Discoveries to Communities A UK entomologist is leading an international effort to find long-term, sustainable control options to effectively manage a mosquito known to transport several potentially deadly viruses, including Zika virus. Grayson Brown, entomologist in the College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment, is a former president of the Entomological Society of America, the world's largest entomological organization. As the world confronts the dangers of Zika virus, another UK professor, Stephen Dobson, and his former doctoral student turned business partner, Jimmy Mains, developed technology that uses male mosquitoes to effectively sterilize females through a naturally occurring bacterium and without using chemical pesticides that can negatively impact beneficial non-target insects like bees and butterflies. With the help of the National Institutes of Health, the Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation, and the Gatton College of Business and Economics' Von Allmen Center for Entrepreneurship, Dobson and Mains have commercialized their research and launched MosquitoMate, which is currently conducting field trials of their product. This critical discovery may hold a key to unlocking a solution to deadly diseases transmitted by mosquitos \u2014 not just Zika virus, but also diseases like yellow fever, dengue fever, and malaria, to name a few.UK Entomologist Leads Zika Solution Effort xxivUNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE FIVELeverage leading-edge technology, scholarship, and research in innovative ways to advance the public good and to foster the development of citizen-scholars. Over the past year, UK faculty, staff, and students laid the groundwork for continued success in community engagement. We developed and adopted data systems to collect and recognize faculty and staff efforts related to outreach and community engagement. An additional module in Digital Measures, a system already used by half of UK's colleges, was added. The group will continue its work to develop budget-neutral solutions. Technology has allowed us to greatly expand how we connect with community partners, near and far. Our efforts are based in the disciplinary strengths of our 17 colleges, research centers, UK Libraries, our network of extension offices, and in the creative and innovative interdisciplinary work of our students and staff in Student and Academic Life and other interdisciplinary academic units that are both curricular and co-curricular. Our service extends across the breadth of our land-grant institution - fr om evolving Extension Service efforts that touch every county of the Commonwealth, to high-tech, high-touch healing that is expanding access to quality, complex care. UK faculty, staff, students, and alumni are engaged in their local communities, the Commonwealth, and abroad. We must accelerate our efforts to enrich and improve lives in all of the communities in which we engage. Also, we must use what we learn from those we serve to inform and augment learning and research at UK.Promises Made. Promises Kept. Shared Success in Transforming TomorrowOUTREACH AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTStrategic Objective Five Partnerships betweenUniversity and community stakeholders xxvYear One Lessons Learned Aligning traditional scholarship with engaged scholarship is critical to achieving our goal with respect to outreach and community engagement. In addition, and underscoring our work to establish definitions, a common reporting language improves consistency and measurability of engagement efforts. We also must continue to remove structural barriers across all areas of outreach and community engagement. Year Two Priorities The Community Engagement and Outreach Council was established as a consultative steering committee for UK's engagement efforts. Its recommendations will advance and support policies, structures, and data collection for high-impact initiatives to further institutionalize community engagement in alignment with the University's Strategic Plan. The council assists the Office of Community Engagement in mobilizing town-gown partnerships, community-based scholarship, and outreach efforts that lead to societal change in the Commonwealth, nation, and world. We will continue our progress by outlining the council's future goals and objectives. We also will identify the top three-to-five issues most important to our partners, to continue our collaborative efforts and shared progress. Building upon our work with data reporting systems, we will continue to operationalize them using Digital Measures for faculty activity, course-tagging, and volunteer matching for student activity. xxviUNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE FIVE IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCEAisha Nwandu Nwandu has spent her time at UK balancing various service positions with FUSION, Alpha Phi Omega, Campus Kitchen, and the Kentucky Refugee Ministries. She also works at the UK Center for Community Outreach (CCO) as a director of the Wildcats for Service (WFS) program. Nwandu said that one thing she has realized coming from Nigeria is the universality of social problems. \"I think of all the problems we have back home, and then all the ones we have her e. I can see now that every population has its own unique struggles,\" Nwandu said. \"And it is never too late to become a conscious citizen.\" Nwandu plans to retur n to Nigeria someday. With her experience at the CCO, she said she knows that she is able to make a difference when she returns home. \"I have learned a lot about dedication and service at UK,\" she added. \"I do not have to sit ar ound and wait for another person to do it. I can do it myself.\"A University of Kentucky senior from Nigeria, Aisha Nwandu, finds passion in her involvement with service groups on campus and around Lexington. xxviiA passion to do good is inspiring one University of Kentucky professor's work and shaping his students' academic experience. Gregory Luhan, the John Russell Groves Endowed Professor of Architecture in the College of Design, has always been interested in giving his students opportunities to create solutions for real-world problems. \"Without a doubt, I love what I do. I have a great passion to do good for people,\" Luhan said. \"We have the opportunity to build our ideas and to implement them and to improve communities around Kentucky.\" Luhan's work took him and his students into West Liberty, Kentucky, a town ravaged by tornadoes in 2012. There, his studios helped design solutions for communities rebuilding after natural disasters. He dedicated three years to the project. \"We r ealized a lot of terrain in the area is very mountainous and hilly, so building on those types of sites is very expensive,\" he said. \"So, we have been working with the structural engineering folks in construction science to think about the building as a different type of system. There were 100 families that were displaced, and now we are actually going to be building new prototypes for living on these difficult sites.\"Rebuilding Kentucky Communities A summer health careers camp and a project to strengthen the nursing care continuum in a rural hospital system recently received seed grants from the Kentucky Rural Community Health program. Administered by the University of Kentucky's Community and Economic Development Initiative of Kentucky (CEDIK), the Kentucky Office of Rural Health, and the Kentucky Hospital Association, the program provides funds to rural hospitals and health care coalitions. It assists them in addressing health issues and concerns that were identified when the hospitals completed their community health needs assessments, as required by the Affordable Care Act. Marcum and Wallace Memorial Hospital in Irvine will use its $5,000 grant to impr ove care coordination, which will lead to improved quality of care and patient outcomes. This, in turn, will result in a positive impact on the hospital's financial picture. Barbourville Appalachian Regional Hospital will use its $2,500 grant to team up with the Southern Kentucky Ar ea Health Education Center and Union College Nursing Program to host the Summer Rural Health Scholars, a three-day health careers camp for high school students. Participating students will be exposed to a variety of health care opportunities. CEDIK, part of the College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment, has a history of working with rural hospitals, health coalitions, and networks throughout Kentucky. CEDIK Extension Specialist Melody Nall said local hospitals and doctors' practices often have the largest economic impact in rural communities, by providing jobs and returning dollars to the local economy. Good health care is also vital to attracting employers to a region. \"They want a healthy workforce, and they also want to have health care available for their employees,\" Nall said. \"Having both of those components in a community is vital for strong economic development...At the heart of both projects is the desire to improve health care and economic stability in rural communities.\"CEDIK Grants Fund Rural Health Care Projectsphoto credit: Shaun Ring xxviiiUNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE FIVE Since 2014, a number of UK faculty, students, and community partners have spent their spring vacations participating in an international practicum in rural Mayasandra, India - a rural farming village south of Bangalore with a population of fewer than 4,000. Designed to enhance students' understanding of interdisciplinary and inter-professional services, the program allows students from interdisciplinary early childhood education, special education, physical therapy, and medical school to participate in the provision of services to children with disabilities and their families. Teams of students, faculty, families, therapists, and teachers assess and develop intervention plans, share their expertise, and collaborate while gaining an understanding of global service delivery for children with disabilities. This annual service-learning experience has evolved to include all stakeholders in the children's lives. In 2014, students saw 100 childr en and families because there was a significant drought in the region; families were not working and had the opportunity to travel to the clinic. Traveling from more than 100 miles away and using all forms of transportation, families came from surrounding villages and communities for assessment by the UK team. In 2015 and 2016, even when farmers were working in the fields, resulting in a reduction in the number of families who came to the clinic for interventions, the UK teams saw more than 50 children and families each year. \"This work is tremendously important for our students to understand the role of each team member in the assessment and intervention for children with disabilities and their families,\" said Katherine McCormick, professor of interdisciplinary early childhood education, in the College of Education. \"We believe that students who participate in this intensive immersive experience will be better teachers, therapists, and health providers when they return to their own communities of practice. We hope to promote the understanding that complicated issues such as hunger, poverty, and health disparities are universal and global issues that require thoughtful and intentional interventions.\"Preparing UK Students for Interdisciplinary Practice and Teaching through Service-Learning xxixThrough the education we provide, the creative research we conduct, and the care and service we render, we are the University for Kentucky. We are the institution our Commonwealth has charged to confront profound challenges - in economic development, health, and cultural and societal advance.We are committed like never before to transforming lives through teaching and learning, care, creativity, and discovery. Against this backdrop, the University of Kentucky's Fiscal Year 2018 Operating and Capital Budget affirms our commitment -- closely connected to and working in concert with our Strategic Plan.

Overthe same period, appropriations to postsecondaryeducation have decreasedapproximately $100 million. xxxiPerformance Funding Fiscal Year 2018 marks a transformative period of accountability efforts for postsecondary education in the Commonwealth. Kentucky joined a growing majority of states which have adopted a performance based funding program to formally link state appropriations with desired student success goals and other objectives for postsecondary education. The passage of House Bill 303 by the 2016 Session of the Kentucky General Assembly allocated five percent of Fiscal Year 2017-18 state funds for most of Kentucky's public colleges and universities to a Postsecondary Education Performance Fund. House Bill 303 further established a Performance Funding Working Group - made up of representatives from the Governor, Kentucky House and Senate, the Council on Postsecondary Education, and public postsecondary education presidents -- to develop a comprehensive model and submit its recommendations by December 1, 2016. Those recommendations culminated in the passage of Senate Bill 153 during the 2017 Session of the Kentucky General Assembly. Senate Bill 153 finds that improved opportunity for the Commonwealth's citizens and building a stronger economy can be achieved by its public college and university system focusing its efforts and resources on the goals of: 1.Increasing the number and types of credentials and degrees earned by all types of students 2.Increasing retention and progression of students toward timely credential or degree completion 3.Increasing the number of credentials and degrees that garner higher salaries upon graduation, such as science, technology, engineering, math and health (STEM+H); and in areas of industry demand 4.Closing achievement gaps by increasing the number of credentials and degrees earned by low-income students, underprepared students, and underrepresented minority students 5.Facilitating credit hour accumulation and transfer of students from KCTCS to four-year institutions xxxiiBUDGET AT A GLANCE The University of Kentucky | Promises Made.

Promises Kept. In FY08, the University's operating budget totaled $2,072,187,800, about 57 percent of the recommended FY18 budget. The changes in the University's operating budget over the last ten years reflect a significant increase in patient care, an increase in extramurally funded research grants and contracts, and a shift in funding from the state to our students. Understanding the University's Consolidated Budget: Where does the money come from and how is it used? A balanced (revenues and net transfers equal expenses), consolidated budget is established prior to the beginning of each fiscal year and amended during the year as plans change and unanticipated events occur. Financial activity is reported quarterly to the Board of Trustees with interim financial statements. An independent accounting firm audits the annual financial statements.The University's consolidated budget is primarily comprised of four types of current funds: General, Auxiliary, Restricted, and Fund Balance. The first three types are recurring (funds that generally are received or earned every year such as state appropriations and tuition and fees AppropriationsSales/Services $219$398$675$507$267 FY 2017 -18 Operating Budget BillionOperating Revenues by Fund Source FY 2007- 08 to FY 2017- 18 In millions 1xxxviBUDGET AT A GLANCE The University of Kentucky | Promises Made.

Undesignated General Funds are received centrally and allocated to colleges and units as base support and strategic initiatives. Designated General Funds are received directly by the colleges and units that generate thefunds and are designated to be used for purposes in accordance to the mission of the college or unit: oU ndesignated General Funds comprise 21.2 percent of the University's total budget and include state appropriations(7.3%), tuition revenue (12.8%), and other income (1.1%) suchas service assessments and short-term investment income. oD esignated General Funds comprise 54.9 percent of the University's total budget and include income from hospitalservices (43.4%) and other revenues (11.5%) such as studentfees and county appropriations. uky.edu/uk4kyWhere does the money come from and how is it used?University of Kentucky 7% 1% 13% - 21% Money comes from: State Appropriations Tuition Investment Income Service Assessments Pays for: Instruction Public Service Utilities Administrative Support ScholarshipsState Appropriations Other Tuition uky.edu/uk4kyWhere does the money come from and how is it used?University of Kentucky 12% 43% FY 2017-18 Operating General Funds - 55% Money comes from: UK HealthCare County Appropriations Mandatory Fees Course and Program Fees Pays for: Public Service Instruction Student Services Academic SupportUK HealthCare Other BUDGET AT A GLANCE The University of Kentucky | Promises Made.

This responsibility is generally further delegated to the colleges and major units. The budget responsibilities for designated general funds, auxiliary funds and restricted funds, in particular, are decentralized to the lowest appropriate level. Following is a summary of the FY18 current funds revenue budget by major fund type as compared to FY17. Undesignated General Funds The overarching financial decisions related to the University's educational and general activities are based on the availability of or the opportunity to earn Undesignated General Funds. Similar to past years, the Undesignated General Funds Operating Budget was developed in a sequential three-step process: Step 1: Assess funding needs Step 2: Identify available resources, andStep 3: Determine proposed tuition and fee rate increases Step 1: Assessing Funding Needs The list of identified needs to be funded with Undesignated General Funds revenues totals $31.0 million (shown below). Funding needs can include new expenses as well as supplanting declining revenues.

In FY08, UK's state appropriations were originally budgeted to exceed $335 million. With $267 million expected for FY18, state appropriations will have been reduced by more than $68 million since FY08. In nominal terms, state appropriations will be close to the same amount received in Fiscal Year 1998-99. S tudent Financial Aid. The University previously committed to increasing its student scholarship budget by $8.9 million, or 7.6 percent to attract and retain a diverse and academically prepared student body. F aculty and Staff Compensation. In alignment with the budget development principles, the FY18 budget includes a 2.5 percent salary pool to be distributed based on merit and effective July 1, 2017 for non-UK Healthcare employees. A 2.5 percent salary pool is created for all eligible employees using current fund sources. The majority of UKHC employees are paid based on the applicable market. Any annual salary increase for UKHC employees will be determined at a later date and, if implemented, is usually effective October 1.

Fixed cost increases are estimated to total $4.9 million and include funding for utility rate increases, prior commitments, and an additional $1.0 million for capital renewal which will result in a total $8.0 million recurring capital renewal / modernization pool to invest in existing facilities. In addition, the University has set aside $.5 million to begin a new pool for utility renewal and modernization. Strategic Investments. FY16 included the first installment of incentive funds to be distributed to the colleges through 2020 based on performance measures - a model that encourages faculty, staff and administrators to focus on what matters most. FY16 included $5 million recurring to reward student success and $4 million non-recurring for improvements in retention and student credit hour production. The FY17 budget included another $7 million of recurring incentive funds to be distributed to the colleges to reward student success ($5 million) and research efforts ($2 million). In addition, the FY17 budget included $1 million non-recurring for student credit hour production. Due to fiscal constraints, the FY 18 budget only includes $2.5 million in recurring funding to be distributed to the colleges to reward student success initiatives. In addition, the FY18 budget includes $2 million of non-recurring funding for research efforts and $1 million non-recurring for student credit hour production. The FY18 strategic investments also include $500,000 for a faculty \"fighting\" fund for retention efforts.Step 2: Identify Available Resources As part of the development of the FY18 operating budget, $13.5 million of available resources to address the funding needs has been identified (shown below). These resources are a combination of increased efficiencies, enhanced revenues, and strategic reallocations. Increased Efficiencies and Other Revenues . Over $10.5 million of available resources have been identified as efficiencies and new revenues. The major component is improved investment performance including investment income from operating funds, the endowment management fee and the spending distribution from a new quasi endowment created with an allocation of operating funds -- all of which are projected to generate revenue in excess of $6.2 million. In addition, the Energy Conservation Program is estimated to save an additional $1.1 million. Revenues totaling $3.2 million include increases in service assessments to self-supporting units, tuition revenue from new incentive programs with colleges, and other miscellaneous revenues.

Based on historical costs and gross payroll, the miscellaneous fringe benefits rates were reduced allowing the University to reduce benefit budgets by more than $2.5 million without reducing any employee benefits. The benefits covered by the miscellaneous fringe benefits rates include the employee education program, workers compensation, unemployment, retiree health credit, long-term disability, and terminal vacation and sick leave. In addition, one unit became a self-supporting unit over the past two years. Step 3: Determine Proposed Tuition and Fee Rate Increases Only after having identified $31.0 million of funding needs and $13.5 million of available resources in Steps 1 and 2, do we consider additional revenues from increasing tuition rates. Proposed tuition and mandatory fee rates for the upcoming academic year were presented to the UK Board of Trustees and approved for the FY 2017-18 (AY18) on June 6, 2017. The approved rates are expected to generate sufficient tuition revenue to balance the FY 2017-18 operating budget.K entucky Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE). Pursuant to KRS164.020, CPE has the statutory authority to determine tuition rates for Kentucky's public colleges and universities. In March 2017, CPE approved resident, undergraduate tuition and mandatory fee ceilings for AY18. CPE allowed moderate increases to support a necessary balance between students' and families' ability to pay for college and institutions' need for resources to fund fixed cost increases and to support continuing progress toward attainment of the goals established in 1997 with passage of House Bill 1, the Postsecondary Education Improvement Act. As a result, CPE approved AY18 resident undergraduate tuition and mandatory fee ceilings that equate to increases of no more than four percent for the University of Kentucky. In 2016, CPE adopted a Non-Resident Student Tuition and Fee Policy that requires institutions to generate non-resident tuition and fee revenue (net of institutional student aid to non-resident students) which equals or exceeds 100 percent of direct instructional and student services costs per student. Recent analysis concludes that since 2010, UK has consistently exceeded the 100% threshold, meaning that nonresident tuition and fee revenue exceeds the average direct instructional and student services costs. CPE also approved allowing the public universities to submit market competitive tuition and mandatory fee rates for graduate and professional programs for Council approval.

Like most states, Kentucky has adopted ambitious goals for degree attainment. Unfortunately, the state's continued disinvestment in postsecondary education weakens the important linkage of college affordability and student completion. At the University of Kentucky, we constantly monitor and analyze college affordability. We are using sophisticated analytics to develop, pilot, and evaluate student aid programs striving to improve diversity and student success. For example, a recent analysis of all undergraduate, full-time students from Kentucky enrolled in Fall 2016 revealed that: 2 5 percent of these students are from families with a median income of less than $20,000.

Center for Rural Development Established in 1996 in Somerset, Kentucky through the vision of U.S. Congressman Harold \"Hal\" Rogers, the Center for Rural Development is a nonprofit organization focused on improving quality of life for individuals in the 45 county service region. The primary mission is to provide leadership to stimulate innovative and sustainable economic development solutions for citizens. The Center's programs and services focus on four primary efforts: public safety, arts and culture, leadership and technology. Public safety - The Center administers a national public safety program, the Rural Domestic Preparedness Consortium (RDPC), and through its member institutions provides rural communities with the knowledge, skills and abilities to enhance the safety, security and quality of life for their citizens through training, technical assistance and information sharing Arts and culture - The Center promotes arts and culture throughout its 45-county primary service area through outreach activities in local schools, visual arts exhibits and two annual performing arts series. The Center will continue targeted outreach activities into local schools in order to expose children, students and adults to valuable cultural programming that they might not otherwise encounter Leadership - The Center offers a wide variety of leadership programs and initiatives including three annual summer leadership youth camps for middle and high school students. These programs help students develop leadership and entrepreneurship skills; promote active community service; and build awareness of in-demand careers in science, technology and mathematics. The Center also features leadership initiatives that involve strategic planning grants funded by the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). In addition, the Center is a key partner in ARC funded philanthropic efforts to establish permanent endowments through local community foundations. The leadership effort also includes Forward in the Fifth, a Center affiliated organization that promotes educational attainment in the region. The Center plans to further develop leadership efforts by: expanding youth programs to new areas and opening them up to more students; continuing to award strategic planning grants to encourage local economic development and tourism; continuing to work with partners to nurture a culture of philanthropy in the region; and continuing to support Forward in the Fifth's efforts to stress the value of education to students, parents and local leaders Technology - The Center offers the region and state a variety of technological services, including commercial services such as web design, web site hosting, video production and data recovery. The Network Operations Center is the hub of the Center's statewide video conferencing network and serves as the host for data, online content and courseware management systems for private business, colleges and universities. The Center will continue to expand its efforts in this area The Center for Rural Development is actively engaged in a joint initiative with Governor Matt Bevin and Congressman Rogers, entitled Shaping Our Appalachian Region (SOAR). SOAR was created to address economic, educational and quality of life challenges facing Eastern Kentucky. The Center's President and CEO is a member of the SOAR steering committee and also chairman of the Broadband Working Group. Center staff are members of SOAR working groups. The Center will work on SOAR initiatives until problems surrounding citizens in Southern and Eastern Kentucky are resolved. Through the dark fiber project, the Center is at the forefront of addressing the economic opportunity disparities resulting from the ever increasing rural digital divide. Upon completion, this open access, high-speed, broadband middle-mile project will have a significant and long-term economic, social and cultural impact on Eastern Kentucky. This unparalleled fiber project will provide our poorest communities with equal access to global communications networks for commerce, healthcare, education and public safety. With the support and partnership of the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, numerous county/city governments, and a host of commercial organizations, the Center is committed to creating a stable and sustainable fiber network connecting anchor institutions statewide, serving vulnerable communities and the public interest, and creating a sustainable middle-mile infrastructure for private operators to further develop innovative last- mile networks throughout the state. Implementation of the Eastern Kentucky portion of the state-wide fiber infrastructure project, dubbed the \"Super I-Way\" by Congressman Rogers, will be managed by the Center for Rural Development.Page 41 seeblue. Center for Rural Development To further increase the opportunity for successful integration of this technology into rural Kentucky, the Center will complement the fiber project with ongoing community education on the benefits of high-speed internet access, provide technical training for business and entrepreneurs and support local final-mile initiatives to expand the system.

In collaboration with the University of Louisville's College of Business, the Gatton College launched a joint Executive MBA program in 2014. Designed for mid-level to C-level executives from for-profit, non- profit and government organizations, the UK-UofL Executive MBA gives students the leadership skills and the hands-on tools to advance to the highest levels in their organizations. The Executive MBA program meets every other Friday and Saturday over 20 months. The cutting-edge curriculum is delivered by Gatton College and University of Louisville faculty, alternating locations between Lexington and Louisville. Since the program's inception, 25 students have graduated and the majority of students have reported positive career outcomes such as promotions during their coursework. The current class of 19 students will graduate in the spring semester of 2018 and is notable for including 52 percent women in the group compared to an industry average of 28 percent. The Master of Science in Accounting (MSACC) program is now in the ninth year of the revised program in which students have the option to prepare and sit for the CPA exam while completing their graduate coursework. The MSACC courses are offered in modules synchronous with the Becker CPA review course and the program has experienced significant success for pass rates on the CPA exam. Eighty-four percent of candidates from the class of 2016, who Page 59 seeblue. Gatton College of Business and Economics sat for all four parts of the CPA exam, passed all four parts. Also, pass rates on each individual section exceeded ninety percent. Placement of our graduates has improved over the past seven years. Ninety-five percent of our domestic MSACC graduates from the class of 2015 accepted a full-time accounting position by the end of the semester they graduated. The vast majority of these positions were in public accounting. The quality of students recruited into the program has remained consistent. The grade point average overall and in the major for the class of 2017 is 3.63 and 3.67, respectively and the pass rates on the CPA exam to date are consistent with prior years. We also had an entering class of 47 students for the fall semester of 2016. The Gatton College received approval for two new one- year MS programs to be launched in fall 2017: MS in Finance and MS in Applied Economics. The Gatton College offers two Ph.D. programs, a doctorate in Business Administration and the other in Economics. The Economics program produced its first graduate in 1931. The doctoral program in Business Administration produced its first graduates in 1972 and its first Ph.Ds. in 1990. Today, alumni of both doctoral programs occupy senior positions at academic, government and corporate institutions in the United States and throughout the world. Both programs emphasize the importance of giving doctoral students individual attention and mentoring throughout their course of research and study. Students of exceptional aptitude and motivation for research are recruited nationally and internationally to both programs. Ph.D. students are chiefly supported in their studies through teaching and research assistantships as well as college and university fellowships. Several centers support the research and service missions of the Gatton College: The Center for Business and Economic Research (CBER) conducts research studies for state and local government agencies, not-for-profit organizations and private industry. In addition, each year CBER sponsors the Business Outlook Conference and, as mandated by the Kentucky state legislature, produces the Kentucky Annual Economic Report The University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research (UKCPR) conducts research that informs evidence-based policy on the causes, consequences and correlation of poverty and inequality in the United States. Now in its 15th year, UKCPR has been the recipient of numerous grants from federal agencies and foundations and has used this funding to support major conferences, fund research graduate students, and has appeared in leading academic and policy presses, as well as major media outlets including the New York Times, The Economist, The Washington Post, National Public Radio, and PBS The Don and Cathy Jacobs Executive Education Center works with organizations to design and develop professional executive education programs that address specific operational, performance and strategic needs.

College of Design initiatives tackle design-related issues impacting Kentucky's economy and quality of life of our citizens including energy, the delivery of healthcare, workplace performance, educational effectiveness and the use of our natural and built resources. These initiatives bring together stakeholders from the local community with professors and students of the college in a unique public/private partnership. The multi-year \"House Boat to Energy Efficient Residences\" (HBEER) project has been the focus of numerous federal grants. The project develops energy efficient, prefabricated housing by utilizing former houseboat manufacturing facilities and workforce in Southeastern Kentucky. The College has collaborated with the Center for Applied Energy Research to create a 100-year site plan for the impending de- activation of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Kentucky. Student speculations ranged from activity on the site to replacing the economic impact that will be lost due to the plant closing. A user group evaluation of new university housing is on the forefront of understanding relationships between retention and graduation rates. A recent project in Historic Preservation has explored the relationships between historic preservation, disaster preparedness and economic bounce back, while another study has focused on the economic benefits of locating low- income housing in historic districts. In fiscal year 2016-17, the College of Design developed its 5-year strategic plan, Vision 2021, which includes the following primary goals for fiscal year 2017-18: Promote the undergraduate experience--We aim to offer a differentiated undergraduate design experience that is unique regionally and nationally, with signature programs relevant to Kentucky that can be translated beyond. We will continue to build collaborative fabrication facilities and studio- away venues that offer students broad and deep design experiences. We will enhance our already outstanding recruitment and advising framework. While continuing to maintain a high standard for success, we will also diversify our student body Strengthen quality and distinction of graduate programs--We aim to offer a differentiated graduate design experience that is unique regionally and nationally, with signature programs relevant to Kentucky that can be translated beyond. If we succeed we will be increasing and diversifying the graduate student body while setting and maintaining a high standard for student success. This will include strengthening existing programs concurrent with developing new graduate degrees - which will include both online and hybrid opportunities - and increasing, developing and diversifying graduate faculty in all units Cultivate diversity and inclusion--We will invest in Page 69 seeblue. College of Design initiatives that invite a more diverse student body and enhance our global awareness of the diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, faith, economic situation, place of origin and political perspective within the profession and culture of design. Once here, students from all programs will be welcomed and embraced by an environment of inclusion Shape a culture of creative scholarship--Research in design disciplines covers a variety of types of creative scholarship - spanning theory to creative practice. In addition to more traditional research in design history, the College of Design units have their individual histories of creative scholarship inspired by the needs of our Commonwealth. Part of the task of this goal is to discern and disseminate the very definition of design research Elevate the place of design within community engagement + outreach (CE+O)--The College of Design has a reputation for exemplary approaches to community engagement and outreach (CE+O). We will build on existing relationships and form new partnerships with community and industry peers to explore how the College of Design can participate and assist in local, regional, national and global projects. Our students' academic lives are enhanced by our relationship with the Kentucky community at large and in our work around the world. We will seek ways to further build community engagement and outreach into our curriculum, amplifying the University's definition of best practices in this area Enhance the student experience of the college-- The cultural experience of the College of Design comprises a combination of unique disciplines. One of the challenges is how to enhance and cultivate a shared culture when the College of Design is spread across four different buildings on campus. This will be even more challenging as the College of Design continues to grow and add new programs. While Pence Hall is the administrative center, there exists no central hub for students and faculty to interact, to attain information on upcoming events or to exhibit work. Both students and faculty express a desire for greater awareness of the work of other disciplines and studios. Increased interaction between students and faculty facilitates the exchange of ideas, a more dynamic culture and, in turn, more outreach for the College. Despite the current physical and spatial constraints, and the uncertainty of a new building, we will continue to consider ways that the College of Design can enhance its shared experiences Page 70 seeblue.

At the graduate level, students may choose from certificates in Informatics, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Lean Systems, Stream and Watershed, Engineering in Healthcare and Power and Energy. Research priorities in the College of Engineering are aligned with Kentucky's economic strengths and potential growth areas, as identified by Kentucky's Department of Commercialization and Innovation and are driven by industry demand. Work in these research areas will afford the Commonwealth the best opportunity to build centers of research excellence around which competitive technology-based clusters can grow. Currently the College has active research in a number of Kentucky's priority areas, such as energy biosciences, visualization, biomaterials and sustainable advanced manufacturing. Faculty research is at a historic high. Engineering faculty research is interdisciplinary, engaging with colleagues in UK Colleges like Education, Arts and Sciences, Pharmacy, Medicine, Dentistry, Health Sciences and Agriculture, Food and Environment. The College's dynamic research enterprise currently exceeds $35 million in new extramural funding annually. The College will continue to diversify and grow its research enterprise by focusing on increased collaborations with other colleges, particularly those associated with the UK Medical Center as well as increased research funded by industry. Diversity and interdisciplinary collaboration are assisted by the use of research centers and industry consortia. Ten research centers/consortia and institutes are directly administered by the College and four additional research centers maintain a close working affiliation with the College. Recent innovations are improving the College's already well-respected degree programs. For example, the new and popular Engineering Living and Learning Program (LLP) gives a unique opportunity for freshman engineering students to live in a community with other engineering students. The program, currently housed in Woodland Glen III, started with less than 100 students and is the largest LLP on campus, expected to reach over 600 students in the coming year. The LLP continues to show value in student success, in terms of scores and persistence. The average GPA of the current 2016 cohort in this challenging major is 3.2. An astounding 18.5% of these students secured a 4.0 GPA in their first semester at UK. The retention rate for students in the 2016 College of Engineering cohort who selected to reside in a UK LLP students was 93% for their first year at UK. Those students who selected not to reside in a UK LLP were retained at a rate of 80% (a 13 percent difference). In July 2016, the college started its new First Year Engineering Program (FYE). This program helps first year students build a solid foundation for their engineering education. All new first year students will take a common set of classes, including introductions to the various engineering specialties. The FYE approach will assist students in selecting a major that is right for them by giving them the opportunity to explore all engineering disciplines. In addition, the students Page 74 seeblue. College of Engineering will be actively engaged in hands-on learning, will work in teams on design projects, and will be trained in technical communications. Transfer students will also participate in the courses with one of the courses focusing specifically on success for engineering transfer students.

College of Nursing The College of Nursing's mission is to promote health and well-being through excellence in nursing education, research, practice and service while fostering diversity and inclusion. With aspirations to become one of the nation's top nursing programs, in fall 2015 faculty approved the following values with UKCON as the acronym: Unique and innovative contributions to healthcare; Knowledge and evidence- based practice; Collaborative and diverse learning environments; Open and respectful relationships; Nursing leadership and recognition. The College of Nursing predominantly meets its mission by currently providing educational experiences leading to three academic degrees. The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) has four entry points - traditional, second-career, Med-Vets and registered nurses (RN to BSN). Started in 1960, the traditional Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree is a four-year program of study that provides entry into professional nursing practice and boasts 100% back-to-back NCLEX first time pass rates for 2016. It has now expanded to include students who hold baccalaureate or higher degrees in other fields (second-career), Med-Vets (through HRSA grant funding in fall 2015, the College enrolled Veterans that were trained as medics and met qualifications for the second-career option) and RNs with two-year/associate degrees (offered 100% online as of fall, 2015) to earn BSN degree in three semesters of full-time study. The College also offers graduate degree programs for practice and research. It was among the first nationally to offer the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree program in Kentucky graduating more than 1,500 Advanced Practice Nursing (APRN) students. The last cohort of MSN students admitted in 2009 completed the program in 2013. Prompted by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) recommendation for doctoral preparation for Advanced Practice Registered Nursing (APRN), faculty voted to suspend MSN programs of study. Therefore, in 2009, the College added a post-BSN entry option to the post- MSN Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program. Today, the College offers two doctoral programs of study. Both programs offer post-Bachelor of Science in Nursing and post-Master of Science in Nursing entry points. In 2001, the post-master's Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program was the first of its kind in the U.S. and is now in its 16th year and is ranked #26 by U.S. News and World Report. The practice-focused DNP program is designed to prepare experts in specialized advanced nursing practice. APRNs focus on practice that is innovative and evidence-based, reflecting the application of credible research findings. In its 30th year, the Ph.D. program was the first in the region and prepares students to assume leadership roles in nursing research and education and delivery of nursing services. Ranked #8 by the National Research Council, emphasis is on conducting clinical research and developing and testing mid-range theories for the generation of new knowledge applicable to nursing practice. The PhD and DNP programs differ in their goals and the competencies of their graduates. They represent complementary, alternative approaches to the highest level of educational preparation in nursing (American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 2006). In January 2015, the College began a partnership with Norton Healthcare. This program is a seven year commitment to transition approximately 150 of Norton's BSN staff nurses into advanced practice registered nurses with doctoral-level education/through the College's DNP program. Norton nurses will continue to be employed while they are in the program; all the classes are held in Louisville and supplemented with online and independent study. This is a natural extension of the on-campus program. This partnership allows integration of an advanced-practice nursing care model with both ambulatory and inpatient care models, while enhancing the existing program. The College admits 20-30 BSN-DNP students annually and graduated its first cohort of 30 BSN-DNP prepared nurses in December 2016. During the 2017-18 academic year, the College of Nursing will be focusing on further growth in both the undergraduate RN-BSN 100% online program and graduate programs of study. Faculty will be reactivating the MSN degree offering predominantly RN to MSN and/or BSN to MSN with options focusing on competencies for clinical education, primary care expanded roles for RNs and nursing management. The College's research emphasis is prevention and management of chronic health problems and health service and delivery and boasts a $21 million portfolio in active research and training grants. Within the field of health service delivery research, the emphasis is on the development of the science underlying the design of health programs. Ranked #8 among public universities by NIH nursing research, faculty collaborate with interdisciplinary colleagues to ensure research is conducted on significant health problems in Kentucky and across the United States, utilizing diverse Page 87 seeblue. College of Nursing methodologies and linking faculty with investigators in other fields. The academic clinical enterprise is significant to the educational, research and service missions of the College. Faculty and professional staff provide clinical services in over 20 locations with 38 NP faculty contracts, including UK HealthCare, Eastern State Hospital, Norton Healthcare and sites in Central and Eastern Kentucky. Nursing faculty also practice within UK HealthCare, including the Center for Advancement of Women's Health, Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Pediatric Endocrinology and the Chandler Medical Center's Intensive Care units. On September 15, 2015, the College opened the first nurse managed clinic in Wilmore, Kentucky - the University of Kentucky College of Nursing Phyllis D. Corbitt Community Health Center and has now generated over 1250 patient encounters. These clinical practices offer important services to advance health and wellness in the Commonwealth as well as optimize student learning environments that promote integration of faculty practice with collaborative and interprofessional teams. Strategic goals, initiatives and tactics for the College of Nursing for fiscal year 2017-18 include the following: Enhance Undergraduate Student Growth and Success Strengthen Graduate Student Growth and Success Enhance Faculty and Student Research and Scholarly Work Improve Diversity and Inclusivity Across Learning and Working Environments Advance Community and Faculty Practice Engagement College of Nursing General Auxiliary Restricted General Auxiliary Restricted Funds Funds Funds Funds Funds Funds Personnel Services Faculty 764,900 45,000 809,900 0 626,100 Benefits 2,666,200 0 0 2,666,200 2,661,600 0 0 2,661,600 Total Personnel Services 12,572,800 0 45,000 12,617,800 12,787,800 690,800 0 433,400 1,124,200 Capital Outlay 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Recharges/Pass Thru (1,321,500) 0 0 Budget Total TotalPage 88 seeblue.

Student and Academic Life The division of Student and Academic Life was recently created by merging the Office of Undergraduate Education and the division of Student Affairs. Its purpose is to usher in a new era of student support at the University of Kentucky - designed to integrate fully the UK undergraduate experience. The division of Student and Academic Life has a tri-fold function in enhancing the student academic experience. It offers appropriate support services (e.g., counseling, disability services, career counseling, Residence Life, etc.); value-added, co-curricular opportunities (e.g., UK 101, Living Learning Programs, student activities, Greek Life, etc.); and infrastructural needs (e.g., operation of student-focused facilities such as residence halls, the UK Student Center, Greek Houses, etc.). The work of the division is matrixed and organized around four pillars (the four reasons why students succeed): Academic success Health and wellness Community and belonging Financial stability Through this matrixed organization, the division focused this year on five key initiatives: Comprehensive Professional Academic Advising - This division launched a campus- wide initiative to create a highly-coordinated and integrated professional advising system that reflects discipline-specific norms, but stresses standardized, shared outcomes. The initiative places a premium on students changing majors across campus. It also leverages technology and facilitates common practices, procedures and communication so students have a seamless advising experience regardless of which college they choose, move into or leave Investment in Front-Line Support Personnel in Health and Wellness - Through internal reallocation, the division made a deeper investment in campus mental health counseling services so UK students are able to receive excellent care and treatment in real-time. A similar investment in the Violence Intervention and Prevention Center (VIP) was also made to build out the Center's advocacy arm Student Financial Stability - Understanding that unmet need is one of the biggest risk factors for our student retention and persistence goals, the division of Student and Academic Life, in conjunction with other Provost Office units, implemented a series of programs during the 2016-2017 academic year to address unmet need. These programs included the pilot One-Time Grants, aimed at a cohort of students with unmet need; the Provost Persistence Grants; the Student Financial Wellness program, which engages students in financial literacy programs; among other initiatives Integration of Academic and Behavioral Alerts - A fourth matrixed initiative was the purposeful integration of two previous stand-alone alert systems. Through merging academic and behavioral alerts into one platform, our support services to the students who were most at risk were streamlined and targeted Summer and First-Year Transitions - In partnership with the division of Enrollment Management, the division of Student and Academic Life worked to rethink our summer and first-year transition programs (See Blue U and K Week, respectively) so that the two programs provide complementary, consistent and coordinated information framed around the four pillars of why students succeed Overall, a primary focus of Student and Academic Life is to hire more front-line student support service personnel - which includes academic advisors, career counselors, clinical counselors and student organization advisors - with the purpose to serve the needs of our diverse student body. In addition, we have spent the fiscal year 2016-17 bolstering and integrating many of the great value-added student experience opportunities (e.g., Dance Blue, FUSION, Greek life, internships, student clubs, etc.) with academics and faculty. The focus for the 2017-18 academic year include: Further strengthening of the living-learning programs and residence life Planning programming attendant to the UK Student Center Renovation and Expansion Further investing in front-line student support personnel, including professional academic advisors, career counselors, mental health Page 112 seeblue.

Student Aid - Central In fiscal year 2017-18 the university launched UK LEADS (Leveraging Economic Affordability for Developing Success), a new institutional aid initiative. Based on internal studies that demonstrated the impact of unmet need on retention and graduation rates, this initiative aligns directly with the University's Strategic Plan to increase student success. Through the initiative, the university plans to rebalance the amount of institutional aid provided towards financial need. In addition to the UK LEADS initiative, the University provides students with many scholarships and financial aid options. Students may be eligible for and receive other opportunity-based scholarships, academic-based scholarships, need-based assistance and department and college-based scholarships. Opportunity-based awards are intended to aid students in achieving both academic and financial success at the University of Kentucky, and are determined by a student's combination of financial need and academic standing The Academic Scholarship Program for incoming first-year students assists in the recruitment and retention of top academic students from Kentucky, the U.S. and beyond. Among the scholarships provided through this program are the Otis A. Singletary Scholarship, Patterson Scholarship for National Merit/Hispanic Finalists, Presidential Scholarship, Kentucky Futures Scholarship, Kentucky Heritage Scholarship and Provost Scholarship The Continuing Student Scholarship Program provides scholarships for currently-enrolled UK undergraduate students who have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.5 at the University and are not otherwise receiving renewable awards through the Academic Scholarship Office The Transfer Scholarship Program provides academic scholarships to students transferring to the University from an accredited institution.

Our mechanisms for delivering this mission include: 1) service - comprehensive assistance to researchers using the on-campus high performance computer (HPC), 2) training our faculty and students on HPC protocols and software and 3) participation in some funded research projects involving the HPC. Our goals include increasing publications and research funding linked to research computing at the University of Kentucky, increasing access to specialized computational resources (assets, relationships and people) and growing the computational user base through outreach and education. The Center was launched in 1990 by the Commonwealth of Kentucky as a Center of Excellence. A key focus of CCS in recent years has been to support the increasing HPC needs of informatics projects. Some areas using, or planning to use, the HPC for informatics projects are the Department of Biology, Department of Physiology, Department of Entomology, Markey Cancer Center, the Department of Radiology/ Gill Heart Institute and the newly formed Institute for Biomedical Informatics. Big data and machine learning have also emerged as key areas for HPC support in recent years, and CCS is establishing the expertise and infrastructure needed to support these emerging research areas. Moreover, CCS continues to invest in areas of existing strength and still supports a core set of users in non-informatics research areas including physics, chemistry and engineering that continue to utilize a significant portion of the Center's time and resources. CCS facilitates training classes to teach users and faculty how to maximize their productivity and impact in using the HPC services. The training classes and hands-on workshops focus on software supported by HPC/CCS and new tools that could be made available to improve their research productivity. This includes programming principles and techniques for using resources and services effectively. CCS also emphasizes helping research groups with little or no computational expertise whose research we believe could be enhanced through a collaborative combination of laboratory experimentation and computation. Much of CCS's work directly serves faculty research teams. The expansion of computational science into the areas of health sciences and clinical and translational medicine represents a tremendous growth opportunity for CCS, as well as an opportunity to provide a significant benefit to health and clinical-based research at UK. These collaborations are expected to lead to a number of new National Institutes of Health grant proposals. The Center is expanding its role in the National Science Foundation-sponsored Campus Champions Program, part of Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), and has been introducing computational techniques into those areas that do not traditionally use computers. The Center supports computational research at UK through student fellowships and assistantships, technical support for computational faculty and their research groups, and by assisting researchers in identifying and accessing computational resources tailored to their needs. It coordinates the acquisition of state-of-the-art computational equipment, such as supercomputers and public/private (virtualized) cloud computing resources, and also manages the research computing software used on these systems. The Center provides assistance with authorization interfaces and data transfer protocols that enable large private datasets to be analyzed in the context of well- known special-purpose limited-access databases. The Center also provides support for a growing number of research areas that depend on machine learning and the computational resources (e.g., GPUs) needed to support machine learning. In fiscal year 2017-18, the goals of the Center for Computational Sciences are: Continue to expand education, training and outreach activities that will enhance research and scholarship by facilitating courses that include computational sciences and hosting seminars, training and workshops Expand efforts to involve underrepresented groups such as women, minorities and the economically disadvantaged in research computing projects Further develop expertise and consulting services to meet the expanding next-generation sequencing assay needs including genetic/genomic analyses, Page 140 seeblue.
