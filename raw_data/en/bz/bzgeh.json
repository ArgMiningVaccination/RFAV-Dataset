In this article, we investigated the oncogenic capacity of HTLV-1, in comparison with those of other oncoviruses and one oncobacterium(Helicobacter pylori, H. Pylori) based on published literature. We conclude here that HTLV-1 is one of the most and may be the most carcinogenic among them and arguably one of the of the known human carcinogens. Th is fact has not been noted before and is particularly important to justify why we need to study HTLV-1 as an important model of human viral oncogenesis. At the time of discovery of HTLV-1 (Poiesz et al., 1980a,b; Hinuma et al., 1981), the concept that viruses could cause cancer (ATL, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma by HTLV-1) in humans was a far-fetched idea that the medical community eventually accepted, despite the earlier identifi cation of Epstein-Barr virus in cultured lymphoblasts from Burkitt's lymphoma (Epstein et al., 1964). After 35 years, the concept of viral oncogenesis has become a textbook fact and several viruses have joined the group of human oncoviruses. In addition, there is now one oncogenic bacterium (Helicobacter pylori) and a strong suspicion of more. Th e list of these oncogenic microbes, their global burden, and the incidence of malignant disorders involving them are provided in Table 1 and summarized below. T able 1. Summary of the statistics on malignancy development associated with oncogenic microorganisms. Th e mechanism by which a virus causes tumor diff ers from virus to virus. While some viruses seem to require co-factors, and/or work indirectly such as by micro-environmental alterations, others directly transform host cells. One thing in common is that there are not yet eff ective cures for viral malignancies in humans. We conducted a literature survey in order to compare the carcinogenic potency of known oncoviruses, and present the risk of malignancy development following the infection of each oncovirus. Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) In developing countries, the prevalence of EBV infection reaches over 90% before the age of 20. But even in high-risk area (East Asia), the incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in association with EBV is at best 0.05% or less. Numbers for endemic Burkitt's lymphoma is more imprecise but estimated as 3~4/100,000 among Ugandan children (Hjalgrim et al., 2007), one of the most endemic area of EBV-related Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). It is also of note that the EBV-mediated malignancy development generally requires a co-factor, especially malaria in the case of BL and dietary factors in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Elsewhere, the role of EBV as an oncogenic agent remain unclear. Th us, EBV is an oncogenic virus but one with very low level of oncogenicity and appears to be only one factor in a multi-factorial cause. Human Herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) Th ough it is a cause of Kaposi's sarcoma (HHV-8 is thus also known as the Kaposi Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) and a more special and very atypical form of lymphoma in collaboration with HIV, HHV-8 is very minimally oncogenic in the absence of HIV. We also note that in most of primary eff usion lymphoma cases associated with HHV-8, EBV is detected along with HHV-8, another support that HHV-8 is not potently oncogenic on its own (Bhutani et al., 2015). Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) More than 100 HPVs exist, and at least 13 of them are associated with human cancers (zur Hausen, 2009). Th e high rise types 16 and 18 are particularly responsible for 60~70% of cervical cancer worldwide (Khan et al., 2005). More than 80~90% of sexually active men and women will be infected with at least one type of HPV at some point in life and nearly 50% of these infections are with a high risk HPV type (Hariri et al., 2011). In the US, these high-risk HPV causes 2~3% of all cancer cases among men and women (Jemal et al., 2013). Th is translates to 0.29% of the newly infected individuals with high-risk HPVs eventually developing HPV-related cancer. HPV infection can cause cervical, vaginal, and Infectious organismGlobal burden (% in population)Lifetime risk of malignancy development following MCV 0.06% 3 www.ihv.or g Discover y A Newsletter of the Institute of Human Virolo gy4 Discover y A Newsletter of the Institute of Human Virolo gy www.ihv.or g Dr. Robert Gallo, Mary Jane Gallo, and Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesDr. Patrick Dakum of the IHV-Nigeria, Dr. Man Charurat of the IHV, and Dr. John McHutchison of Gilead Sciences, Inc Dr. Robert Gallo and Dr. Jay Perman of the University of Maryland, Baltimore L to R: Dr. Amy Yerkes Schmaljohn of Friends School Baltimore, and from the IHV, Dr. Alan Schmaljohn, Dr. Marzena Pazgier, and Dr. Anthony DeVico Dr. Robert Gallo and Dr. Jeff rey Schlom of the National Cancer Institute L to R: From the IHV, Dr. Olga Davide Zella, and Franco Nuschese of Georgetown Entertainment Group Ada Anthony and Dr. Robert Anthony of Saint Mary's Hospital5 www.ihv.or g Discover y A Newsletter of the Institute of Human Virolo gy IHV's Dr. Robert Redfi eld and Franco Nuschese of Georgetown Entertainment Group L to R: Diane Blattner, Mary Jane Gallo, and Joy Redfi eldL to R: Mary Jane Gallo, Dr. Robert Gallo, Dean E.

Evans Foundationvulvar cancers, cancers of the penis or anus, as well as some head and neck cancers. Vaccines against HPV 16 and 18 have received approval in many countries. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)/Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) [HCV] 85% of acute HCV infections will be unresolved, developing into chronic infection. Importantly, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that HCV is directly oncogenic, nonetheless it is clearly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Th at said, one study estimates that the HCC develops in 1~3% of HCV infected persons after 30 years and the mechanisms are obscure (Goodgame et al., 2003). A chronic infection with HBV establishes when infection occurs in infants and children. [HBV] <10% of healthy adults over 19 years will develop chronic hepatitis following HBV infection. A study conducted in Taiwan, a hyperendemic area of chronic HBV, shows that lifetime risk of HCC with HBsAg seropositive is 6.96% among women, but is an amazing 27.4% among men with HBsAg seropositivity (Huang et al., 2011). In a study conducted in the US, the 5 year HCC cumulative incidences with HBV-associated cirrhosis was 10% (Fattovich et al., 2008). Considering that <10% of HBV infected healthy adults develop chronic infection, the percentages of HCC development by HBV infection should be much lower than 1%. Adeno-Associated Virus Type 2 (AAV2) Th is is the newest member to the family of oncogenic microorganisms (Nault et al., 2015). Th e oncogenesis of AAV2 is associated with HCC without cirrhosis (thus distinguishing then from those caused by hepatitis virus B or C). A clonal integration of AAV2 was found in 11 of 193 HCC cases in which AAV2 integrations occurred in cancer driver genes such as cyclin A2, E1, Telomerase reverse transcriptase etc. Th ese insertions of AAV2 led to the over-expression of target genes. Th ere is still very limited information available for the epidemiological facts about HCC caused by AAV2. Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCV) MCV was discovered in 2008 (Feng et al., 2008) and causes a rare but aggressive neuroendocrine tumor (Merkel cell carcinoma, MCC) of the skin and its incidence seems rising. A 5 year mortality rate is as high as 46%. Th e annual incidence of MCC is 0.6 per 100,000 persons (0.06%) and about 1,600 new cases annually appear in the US. Th is rise in incidence may be partly because of the increased awareness and improved diagnostic methodology. Th e median age at diagnosis is >70 years. Only 4% of patients are diagnosed at 50 year or younger and it is extremely rare in children (Hughes et al., 2014). Th e oncogenic mechanism of MCV is still under investigation. No viral elements have been shown to directly cause cellular transformation. Nor does MCV seem to exploit cellular oncogenic mechanisms (p53, PTEN, Raf, Ras, etc.) (Lemos and Nghiem, 2007). Increase of MCC upon UV irradiation is reported, suggesting a potential involvement of defective DNA repair mechanism in the carcinogenesis (Lunder and Stern, 1998). In addition, a weakened immune function may be related to the occurrence of MCC. For example, the incidence of MCC is 5~10 fold higher in immune-compromised individuals with AIDS or solid organ transplant (Becker, 2010). Some anecdotal regression of MCC has been observed following improvement in immune function (Wooff et al., 2010). As with most other oncogenic viruses, the presence of MCC seems insuffi cient to induce MCC and additional cellular events together with the loss of immune-surveillance are postulated. In summary, there is still missing information to evaluate the oncogenic potential of MCV in comparison with other oncogenic viruses, however MCC caused by MCV may represent another case of aggressive viral oncogenesis. Human Immunodefi ciency Virus-1 (HIV-1) HIV is not generally listed with the oncogenic viruses by most virologists. However, in some reports it is analogous to HCV in that from an epidemiological view it is related to the frequency of developing cancer, notably non-Hodgkin lymphomas, Kaposi sarcoma, and cervical cancer that are known as AIDS-defi ning malignancies (reviewed in Levine, 1993). Th e mechanism(s) of cancer is indirect and relates to the microenvironment and perhaps to the diminished immune surveillance because the virus is rarely found in the tumor cells. Th e incidence of cancer development in HIV infected persons is about 40% (Levine, 1993) and usually accompanies co-infection with other oncoviruses. Human T-cell Leukemia Virus-1 (HTLV-1) Th e oncogenic nature of HTLV-1 is solid; (1) Epidemiology studies (recently reviewed by Gessain and Cassar (Gessain Director's Message (continued) n.n.. 6 Discover y A Newsletter of the Institute of Human Virolo gy www.ihv.or g 7 www.ihv.o rg Discovery A Newsletter o f the Institute of Human Virol ogyand Cassar, 2012), (2) Clonal integration of the HTLV-1 in ATL cells (Hahn et al., 1983). Th is indicates that the virus was present at the level of the progenitor cell that gave rise to the leukemia. (3) Animal models that recapitulate human leukemia/lymphoma development by HTLV-1 or its genetic HBZ) of HTLV-1 (Hasegawa et al., 2006; Satou et al., 2011), (4) Immortalization of T cells by the Tax-1 gene of HTLV-1 (Grassmann et al., 1989), (5) Reproduction of the leukemia/lymphoma by the whole virus. Th e prevalence of ATL is 3-5% among infected persons and HTLV-1 infection is 0.1% as global average but the epidemiological data are still incomplete because those from highly populated areas such as China, India, the Maghreb, and East Africa are still unavailable. ATL is extremely diffi cult to treat, to the point that patients diagnosed with aggressive forms (acute and lymphomatous phases) were estimated to have <1 year of life left. However, recent years have seen promising developments of novel treatment modalities including arsenic trioxide (Bazarbachi et al., 2011), allogeneic stem cell transplant (Utsunomiya et al., 2001; Katsuya et al., 2015) and antibody therapy involving humanized anti-CCR4mAb (Ishida and Ueda, 2011; Katsuya et al., 2015). However, the establishment of a curative treatment for ATL probably needs more creative ideas. Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori) Helicobacter is a bacterium, and represents the fi rst example of what may be emerging examples of bacterial oncogenesis. It has been somewhat controversial how infection with helocobacter pylori would increase or decrease various type of cancer in humans. A recent study in Japan (involving 1,526 patients) reported that gastric cancer develops in approximately 3% of H. pylori-infected patients, compared to none of the uninfected patients (Uemura et al., 2001). Th is number matches the development of Adult T cell Leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) in HTLV-1 infected individuals. In summary, we note here that HTLV-1 is one of the most oncogenic entities known among human viruses and even among most known human carcinogens. Th e oncogenic mechanism of HTLV-1 is more direct compared with other entities and to date there is no evidence for any particular co-factor requirement. Th is striking characteristic of HTLV-1 seems overlooked because of its low prevalence in the U.S. and Europe. As discussed in an accompanying paper, we propose to revert the name of HTLV-1 back to the original, Human T-cell leukemia virus. Th is is also supported by a recent survey among 21 HTLV-1 experts from all over the world who belong to the HTLV-1 task-force of the Global Virus Network (GVN, http://gvn.org), a coalition of virologists on a global scale, as the result of the vote (16 vs. 5) supported the original name \"leukemia\". Another vote conducted at the 18th International HTLV-1 meeting (Tokyo, 2017) again showed majority support (78 vs. 26) on the \"leukemia\" name. We believe that this most carcinogenic virus deserves the \"leukemia\" name.

Bryant, DVM , formerly Associate Professor of Pathology, Director, Animal Models Division, Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine It has been a joy for me to have been a member of the Institute of Human Virology (IHV) family for 21 years. I am retiring as an Associate Professor of Pathology/Director Animal Models Division and Director Animal Core Facility. My retirement became eff ective July 1, 2017. It was in the summer of 1996 that Dr. Robert C. Gallo, and his colleagues, Dr. William A. Blattner and Dr. Robert R. Redfi eld, co-founded the Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. This meant a move for me, as I was working at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at the time. Dr. Gallo wanted an Animal Model Division to develop animal models under the same roof with the other Divisions, as it relates to HIV/AIDS and AIDS-associated diseases. Therefore, the rest is history. The 21 years I spent at the Institute was an extension of a close collaborative research relationship, as well as a social relationship that was started at the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR) at NIH. I was at NIDR in Building 30 and Dr. Gallo was of course at the National Cancer Research (NCI) at NIH. His lab was the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) and I established a strong working relationship with two of his scientists, Dr. Yanto Lunardi-Iskandar and Dr. Barbara Ensoli on developing a model for Kaposi Sarcoma (KS). This collaborative relationship was extended to other scientists around 1990 at LTCB including, Dr. Felipe Samango and Dr. Marvin Reitz (Adjunct Professor of Medicine in IHV's Division of Basic Science). Our collaborations began with the development of an animal model for KS from AIDS patients and from a non-AIDS patient, and we were successful. The AIDS patient KS model was established by Dr. Lunardi-Iskandar from cells from an AIDS patient with KS. This was the fi rst time that the model was developed, which would eventually lead to a model to study the pathogenesis and drug development treatment. The AIDS KS cell line was designated KSY-1 in recognition of Dr. Lunardi-Iskandar, who was the fi rst to isolate the KS cells. At the same time, we were able to grow the KSY-1 cells in an immune defi cient mouse model. We observed that the tumor grew in male mice and in non-pregnant mice. However, they did not grow in Dr. Joseph Bryant is surrounded by former and current Division colleaguesDr. Joseph Bryant Retires11 www.ihv.or g Discover y A Newsletter of the Institute of Human Virolo gy pregnant mice. This led to studies in mice and humans on a pregnancy factor(s) that caused the tumor not to grow. We had also developed the fi rst HIV transgenic mouse model at NIDR in 1988. After the observation in the immune-defi cient mouse model with the pregnant animals, we tested this same principle in the transgenic mice and was able to show that early pregnancy in these mice blocked the expression of HIV genes in the mice. It was at this point that we moved to IHV in Baltimore and continued our studies on the KS model and HIV transgenic mouse model. At the Institute, we established the fi rst HIV-1 Transgenic Rat Model, the fi rst HIV transgenic mouse model that develops a B cell Lymphoma, and set up Non-Human Primate colonies for testing Vaccines against HIV. Over the past two years we have established Humanized mouse models for studying HIV pathogenesis, vaccines, and AIDS associated cancers. Over the 21 years, I was pleased to have established a strong relationship with everyone at IHV, both the professional staff and non-professional staff . My fondest memories will always be how the Institute made a diff erence in Baltimore, and in the world, on HIV. I have been so impressed with what the Institute has accomplished that I had hoped to write a book after retirement titled, A STORY THAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD. I will now have time to work on this. I will always cherish the trips Dr. Bob Gallo and I went on with our wives, the many meals we shared in Bethesda and Baltimore at some of the best restaurants, pool parties, movies in Bethesda, baseball at Camden yards, and, oh yeah, football at the stadium and at Dr. Jeff Schlom's house. Finally, I will really miss those great \"TENNIS Matches\" in Bethesda in the Parks and at the Potomac Tennis Club: a total of over 25 years on the court, and we were good. I leave one more thing to Bob, my friend..... \"Old Man River. \" It just keeps rolling along, as will Bob.

Th is story, about a wretched, little crime against a senior citizen, might do all that. But then, you might be as surprised by the turn of events as Bob Padousis was. Let's make that Dr. Padousis, if you please, because he is a retired dentist, 78 years old, and a Vietnam War veteran who was stationed in Cam Ranh Bay with the U.S. Army Dental Corps in the 1960s. Th ese days, Dr. Padousis lives with his wife in Essex. He has a disability for which he relies on a walker\u2014and the help of a caregiver when he needs to go somewhere. A couple of Wednesdays ago, Dr. Padousis had an appointment at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in downtown Baltimore. Afterward, he and his caregiver, Gladys Jackson, decided to visit Lexington Market a few blocks away. \"I hadn't been there in 20 years,\" Dr. Padousis says. Th ey had lunch at Faidley's Seafood\u2014always a good choice\u2014on the Paca Street side of the market. Th en, around 2 p.m., they walked through the main hall toward Eutaw Street. When they reached the glass doors, Jackson held one of them open. As he walked through, Dr. Padousis tripped and fell. He thinks he caught his foot on a rubber mat. \"I landed in a prone position, on my stomach, face down,\" he says. \"It happened so fast. My wallet was in my jacket pocket on the left side, and it must have been visible after I fell.\" In the next instant, someone grabbed the wallet and pulled it away.\"He's stealing my wallet!\" Dr. Padousis yelled.the baltimore sun A wallet recovered, faith restored at Lexington Market Dan Rodricks, April 15, 2017Th e thief\u2014described as a man in his 40s, with eyeglasses, a gold-plated incisor, wearing a cap, tan pants and a gray jacket \u2014 started to run south on crowded Eutaw Street. Some witnesses pointed at him and called for help: \"He just took that man's wallet!\" But others yelled encouragement to the thief: \"You got it! Go ahead. You're good. Go!\" Chris Roberson heard all this, sized it up quickly and decided to get involved. He's 38 years old, a nurse practitioner at the Institute for Human Virology on the University of Maryland School of Medicine campus a few blocks south of the market. He works with patients with HIV infections. Roberson had just come from lunch when he heard the commotion and saw an old man on the ground and a younger man running away. Roberson, dressed in blue jeans and a polo shirt, his UM identifi cation tag dangling about his neck, decided to follow the thief. \"He was jogging, not too fast, and I saw him cut into the alley across from the market,\" Roberson says. \"I fi gured he would not want to be too conspicuous, you know? So I predicted he would cut through the alley and pop up on Fayette Street. So I went to Fayette and saw him pop up in the crowd. I heard police sirens.\" Roberson thought he could track the robber and help the police locate him. But after following the guy for a couple of blocks, Roberson decided to escalate his eff ort. Near a fast-food restaurant at the corner of Fayette and Howard streets, he got in front of the guy. Got in his grill. \"Did you really take that older gentleman's wallet?\" Roberson asked.\"No, I didn't,\" the guy in the cap said.Roberson could see the wallet tucked in a stack of papers under the guy's left armpit. \"I don't have no wallet,\" the guy in the cap insisted.\"Th e one right under your armpit?\" Roberson said. \"You're going to give me that wallet right now or I'm gonna ...\" And, just like that, the robber, hearing the police sirens, handed the wallet to Roberson and jogged off toward Park Avenue. Roberson hustled back to Lexington Market, where he found the elderly man who'd been robbed resting against his walker, his caregiver at his side. \"Here you are, sir,\" Roberson said.\"Is this my looked up and asked.\"Yes,\" said Roberson. \"I encountered the gentleman who took it from you and got it back from him.\" \"I can't believe it,\" Dr. Padousis said.He off ered the younger man a cash reward. But Roberson declined it. Dr. Padousis spoke of having visited Lexington Market since boyhood. But here was his fi rst visit in 20 years: He fell, and some lowlife picked his pocket while he was down. \"Th at shouldn't have happened to you,\" Roberson said. \"I hope it won't deter you from future visits.\" Dr. Padousis tried to off er him a reward again, but Roberson declined again. \"T ry to enjoy the rest of your day,\" he said, then walked back to work.

Of the 252 youth HIV diagnoses in 2015, 82.5 percent were male and 17.5 percent were female in Maryland while 82.1 percent of these new diagnoses were African American. The statistics are astounding considering the availability of prevention therapy. \"During our Care and Support Access study, we found that HIV infection is not only disproportionately aff ecting young black gay men, but we found that these young men face signifi cant personal challenges as they attempt to remain on treatment for HIV. Being on treatment reduces the risk of new infections and poor health, \" said Carla Alexander, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine. \"We co-founded the non-profi t Baltimore Project to Save Lives to create a positive, safe place for Baltimore's young men to congregate to learn about prevention and treatment options in addition to providing resources for homelessness and other socio-economic conditions that impact self-care. \" Participants of the event's paint party with the theme, \"Be Authentically YOU!!\" \"These data inspire us to do more to ensure that all those we serve at risk for HIV infection get engaged in our provider services, including PREP , \" said Robert Redfi eld, MD, The Robert C.

One day in 1994, they found I had hepatitis C.\" Despite the test results, it took Richardson a while to get her life together. \"I stopped drinking and drugging, and I've been clean for 14 years,\" she said. Hepatitis C, a virus known as HCV, is curable with pills, and new medicines are on the way. Despite the cure, HCV accounts for 30 percent of liver transplants in the United States and can lead to fatal liver disease. One of the big issues with HCV is how easily it can spread through blood or blood products. Th at reality has made Richardson, a peer educator and navigator at the University of Maryland Medical Center Midtown Campus, a strong advocate for hepatitis C testing, providing support and education and assisting newly diagnosed Hep C patients and those who dropped out of treatment get back into care. In many ways, Richardson sees her own risky behavior mirrored in the people she tries to help each day. Th e risk-taking contributes to what she calls an epidemic of Hep C, intertwined with escalating drug abuse in and around Baltimore. Most troubling is the rising tide of opioid overdoses. If not outright deadly, the overdoses suggest habits that can lead to HCV infection. \"You know they're sharing needles. And with that comes the risk that Hep C will keep spreading,\" she said. On Friday July 28, 2017, free Hepatitis C testing will be available at University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) Midtown Campus (Community Health Education Center-CHEC), 821 Eutaw Street; and at the UMMC University Campus, 22 S. Greene Street, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Th e free testing, sponsored by UMMC Community Outreach and the JACQUES Initiative at the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Institute of Human Virology, is part of World Hepatitis Day, to raise awareness about what the hepatitis virus is, what it can do to the liver and how it's spread and treated. Th e most common blood-borne virus, HCV is a contagious disease usually spread when an infected person's blood enters the body of someone not infected, primarily aff ecting the liver. \"About half of those with HCV don't know they have it, meaning they can spread the virus without intending to, so it's important to get tested and protect yourself by not sharing razors or needles and practicing safe sex,\" said Eleanor Wilson, MD, MHS, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Institute of Human Virology. HCV can be acute\u2014 a short-term viral infection that spontaneously clears within six months. But people with what's known as chronic HCV can live for decades without symptoms. Chronic HCV is the leading cause of cirrhosis (scar tissue that replaces normal liver tissue) and liver cancer. \"If we can identify and treat the HCV cases aggressively, then we can reduce the progression to cirrhosis and liver cancer, and the need for liver transplantation,\" said liver disease specialist William R. Hutson, MD, professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and medical director of liver transplantation at the University of Maryland Medical Center. Several groups of people are key targets for HCV testing: \"Baby boomers\" born between 1945 and 1965, anyone with a history of intravenous drug use, anyone who had a transfusion of blood products before 1992, and individuals who had tattoos done outside of a professionally licensed business. After living with HCV for many years without symptoms, Richardson has begun taking a medication that can cure the disease. \"Hepatitis C will keep spreading if people don't get tested for it. Some people are afraid of fi nding out, or afraid their partner may reject them. But Hep C can be deadly, so why not be tested, especially when it can be cured,\" Richardson said.
