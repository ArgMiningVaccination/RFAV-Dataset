You might have noticed a sense of internal unbalance, or you might even have noticed you have been more sensitive to feelings and emotions when they arise. The uncertainty of the surrounding environment will have certainly played its part, but the state of our energetic health may also be of influence. Metaphysical teachings across the world examine the importance of energetic balance. The subtle energies in our bodies that work to create equilibrium for our mental and physical wellness are called chakras. Unexplained symptoms, feelings of numbness or low motivation may be caused by an imbalance in these chakras. Being able to identify and heal your chakras is a powerful way to retune your energetic health. It can help to sustain a balance that keeps us healthy, happy and at our optimal wellbeing. This article will share ways that you can rebalance your chakras using crystals and rituals of visualization. What are Chakras? Our chakras are our body's main energy centres. There are seven main chakras located from the base of the spine all the way up to the crown of our head. Chakras (Sanskrit for 'wheel') maintain the natural, healthy energy cycles of the body. When functioning properly, they provide the right balance of energy to regulate our physical, emotional and spiritual health. It's common for chakras to become depleted, over-active or blocked, especially when exposed to modern-day stressors, trauma or lack of self-care. How can I rebalance my Chakras? Working with the vibrational frequency of crystals is one of the ways chakras can be tuned and revitalized. Crystals are one of nature's sources of energetic power. As humans, we emit our own frequencies or vibrations, which are based on our mood, interactions and environment. High-vibration frequencies are positive feelings of happiness, love and gratitude, whereas low-vibration frequencies include negative feelings of anger, despair and fear. By contrast, crystals act as a stable source of vibrations owing to their rock density and natural geometric construct. As such, the interaction between humans and crystals can help raise our own vibrations to reframe our mindset and emotions. Placing crystals over our chakra can begin our healing process. Here we guide you through how you can rebalance you seven chakras and call on greater healing with techniques of visualization and words of affirmation.
