People coming off of psychiatric medication need special considerations not found in a \"drug rehab.\" You are likely well aware that getting yanked off of medications would be a disaster. Surprisingly, most help professionals seem to be largely unaware of this. After almost 20 years of focusing on the worst of the worst cases, we have become world experts in safe, comfortable medication withdrawal. Intravenous Therapy is a great way to get a concentrated effect on the physiology, which is highly effective applied to medication withdrawal. We have crafted our IV's to be specific for each type of medication withdrawal. There also are formulations for those suffering from various substance addictions including opiates. This truly is top-shelf science being delivered to the class of patients that most centers consider throwaways.....those same outcasts were us at one time. We get it. 15 Years Experience by Professionals Who Understand Your Journey. Each person has a unique physiology, and at times, that physiology drives us to \"crave\" things in order to self-medicate ourselves into some state of balance. If we are too slow, we may want to go faster. If we are too anxious, we might want sedation. If we have a sugar imbalance, we may crave alcohol. There are many facets of what we call an ADDICTIVE BIOCHEMISTRY. Our Sedona and Flagstaff drug rehab and addiction treatment program uses a wide range of lab testing, including genetic testing and can design a medication withdrawal program using natural neurotransmitter precursors to offset, and oftentimes correct addictive cravings in a way that is nothing short of magic. There are reasons why one person craves opiates, and another, a stimulant. Why does one person get crazy on two drinks and someone else remains reasonably normal? There are physiological drivers for these things and if those factors are not attended to, failure is the typical result. There are certain \"hacks\" that address these issues so that the many other therapies provided, like counseling, nutritional therapies, physical therapies, and spiritual interventions finally have an opportunity to work. Success is more than just getting off of medications. The symptoms that got a person on medications generally come back if the underlying causes are not attended to. In MANY cases, the neurotoxic accumulation of poisons based on individual genetics gets overlooked in medication withdrawal. Our program draws on the fundamentals of Environmental Medicine by pulling out heavy metals, hormone-mimicking toxins, and other physiological and neurological stressors. Simultaneously, highly specific neurochemical and hormone precursors and natural forms of top-shelf science support are administered so that getting off of the medications is even possible. We have a staff many of whom have suffered similarly and actually understand the plight from first-hand experience. Have you ever thought your doctor does not really understand you? Like maybe if they had ever taken the medication you or your loved one was prescribed, or had to suffer what occurs with improperly administered medication withdrawal, they might suddenly stop dismissing your concerns. We get it, we have fought our own struggles here and many of us consider ourselves survivors. Our methods and information are leading the way for the \"new doctor\" as the curriculum being taught at licensed educational institutions begins to evolve. Sometimes, medications do have a role, and we have found that most people do not have to live as if the medications are the only solution. Genetics, diet, exercise, detoxification as a lifestyle and the people we surround ourselves with are truly the major components of mental health, yet often get neglected in the \"hope\" that some drug is going to perfectly fix all of our ills. Symptoms are likely the body and mind literally crying for what it needs. Instead, our bodies and minds tend to get further neglected and dismissed when we dump drugs on them in complete disregard for any other changes. Our mission is to reverse this disregard and to use the most optimum scientific approaches to medication withdrawal and recovery to make life actually worth living again.

Genetically we are all different, and our physiology needs to be researched and respected as such. Socially we are different as well and how we define ourselves. What is a medicine for one individual can be a detriment to another. Medication withdrawal, safe tapering, supplement protocols, counseling styles and virtually every portion of the program is tailored to individual need. Green Psychiatry and Nutritional Psychiatry take the Spotlight for Medication Withdrawal We published the only long-term study comparing being on medications versus not being on them. And between 75% and 87.5% depending on medication class fared better without the medication. This has given proof of the efficacy of nutritional mental health and holistic mental health approaches. This was a study we self-funded, and we paid for a top-class medical statistician to give an unbiased evaluation of the data collected for over four years. The essential components of Holistic Psychiatry include: Diet and supplementation, and cleaning up environmental toxicity Exercise Good integrative medical guidance And instead, many people have given an excessive and unwarranted amount of faith to pharmaceutical medications that, realistically, have no ability to correct inadequate lifestyle factors.
