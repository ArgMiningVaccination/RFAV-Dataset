Chiropractors perform spine adjustments as well as adjustments to other parts of the body. The goal of these alignments is to ease pain, correct alignment issues, and support the body's ability to heal itself. Chiropractors may also use other treatments to heal the body, such as hot and cold therapy. A holistic chiropractor is a specialized chiropractor who focuses on treating the whole body. The theory behind holistic chiropractic care stems from the idea that the sum is greater than its parts. In other words, holistic chiropractors treat your physical and mental symptoms to achieve total body wellness. To qualify as a holistic chiropractor, one must spend thousands of hours studying beyond their doctoral degree. Holistic chiropractors receive specialized training so they can help patients relieve physical, emotional, and chemical stressors. Traditional chiropractors, on the other hand, mainly focus on the physical stressors of the body. You can view these physical, emotional, and chemical stressors as three points in a pyramid that work together. Let's take a look at what treating each point looks like: Physical Stressors To treat physical stressors, holistic chiropractors will use traditional chiropractic adjustment techniques. The techniques your chiropractor uses will depend on the extent of your injuries and pain, but generally speaking, there are five techniques that chiropractors use to address physical stressors. These include: - Flexion distraction to [treat disc herniation](https://www.innergateacupuncture.com/blog/chiropractic-herniated-disc), scoliosis, and facet joint pain - Drop table technique to treat the spine and other extremities - Activator technique to treat back pain, migraines, and headaches - Gonstead technique to reduce pain, realign joints, and reduce stiffness - Diversified technique to adjust the spine and other extremities When you schedule a consultation with a chiropractor, they'll go over the techniques they plan to use to treat your physical pain.

Oftentimes, holistic chiropractors will work with a certified nutritionist or [naturopathic doctor ](https://www.innergateacupuncture.com/naturopathic-medicine)onsite to suggest a meal plan for patients that helps their bodies return to normal function. Mental Stressors Holistic chiropractors also work alongside mental health professionals to treat the mental anguish that comes along with physical pain. In addition to general chiropractic care, your holistic chiropractor may also offer other services to treat the triad of stressors. These services may include yoga, [acupuncture](https://www.innergateacupuncture.com/acupuncture), and [massage therapy](https://www.innergateacupuncture.com/massage-therapy).

So why should you see a holistic chiropractor? Here are some of the main benefits: Takes Into Account the Whole Body The holistic approach allows patients to heal their minds and body instead of just one specific area. The mind and the body are intrinsically connected, and often, you can't heal one area without also focusing on the other. Treating just one area of the body may result in superficial healing that's only temporary. With a holistic approach, you can get to the root of your problems. For example, through working with a nutritionist, you may find that certain foods you eat lead to inflammation and pain. Or, you may find through your mental health work that when you feel stressed out, your pain levels increase. Exploring each side of the triad will help you get to the root of your issues so you can eradicate them at the source. Reduce High Blood Pressure If you're suffering from high blood pressure, a holistic chiropractor may be able to help. A [Human Journal of Hypertension](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/news/20070316/chiropractic-cuts-blood-pressure#1) study found that chiropractic adjustments can be just as powerful as certain high blood pressure medications. With a holistic approach, you can also work on the stress factors and diet choices that may be causing your blood pressure to rise. Reduce Headaches According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/headache-disorders), up to three-quarters of adults have suffered from headaches in the past year. Often, headaches and migraines are a result of back pain and spinal issues. They can also be a result of stress and poor diet. A holistic chiropractor can perform adjustments and offer nutritional guidance to help you experience headache relief. Reduce Inflammation Inflammation is one of the leading causes of pain, tension, and joint issues. Chronic inflammation is also linked to a number of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and chronic pain. Your holistic chiropractor can help reduce inflammation throughout your body with adjustments. They can also set you up with a nutritionist to set up a diet plan that focuses on foods that lower inflammation. Sugar, artificial trans fats, refined carbs, and alcohol can all lead to higher levels of inflammation throughout the body. If you're struggling to eliminate these foods from your diet, a holistic chiropractor can help you put together a plan.
