[Pain in our neck](https://centralorthopedicgroup.com/5-easy-exercises-for-stiff-neck/), knees, and joints become more common as we get older. You name it, it hurts.

There are options for pain management out there. However, what if you're trying to avoid the side effects. In reality, the side effects of these medications are downright scary. Some of them can (in milder cases) cause drowsiness. And, others can possibly lead to drug addiction. Nutraceuticals, or natural supplements, can be a smart alternative. But which ones are best for alleviating your regular aches and pains?

Specifically, it is helpful for those of us with chronic back pain (basically everyone over 40). Vitamin D is vital for strengthening bones and joints. Anyone deficient in vitamin D is more likely to experience pain on a frequent basis. Vitamin D can be found in fish and milk. However, it might not be possible for you to receive the necessary levels without taking supplements. Adding a vitamin D supplement will not cure your back pain absolutely, but it will help ease the burden. 2. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) MSM's primary uses include improving immune function, lowering inflammation, and restoring body tissue. Active sulfur is the main component of MSM, which helps the body to release excess fluids. These fluids cause swelling and pain in joints and tendons. MSM supplements aid in decreasing joint inflammation, neck stiffness, and knee problems. By helping the body create new joint and muscle tissue, it will improve flexibility. Because of all of these benefits, MSM is usually included in an anti-arthritis regimen. 3. Devil's Claw Devil's Claw is derived from an African plant. The supplements provide relief from [arthritis](https://centralorthopedicgroup.com/what-you-need-know-about-arthritis-diagnosis/), gout, tendonitis, and bursitis. The name \"Devil's Claw\" comes from the miniature hooks that cover the fruit. African natives traditionally dried and chopped up the roots to treat pain and indigestion. In addition to tea infusions, Devil's claw is available in capsule form. The active ingredient is beta sitosterol, which adds to its anti-inflammatory effects. 4. Turmeric This trendy spice can do more than add flavor to Indian food! Turmeric, a root from the ginger family, contains curcumin. Curcumin serves as a natural anti-inflammatory. Turmeric is widely accepted as a pain management supplement. It's antioxidant properties destroy free radicals in the body that damage cells. Turmeric has been known to help with joint pain and inflammation in people with rheumatoid arthritis.
