FR\u00dcHWEIN & PARTNER As part of our post/Long Covid-19 assessment and therapy, we offer complementary therapies: Traditional Chinese Medicine During the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, more than 60,000 patients suffering from COVID-19 in the Wuhan area have been treated with Chinese medicines in addition to Western medicine. Observational studies show a significant reduction in symptoms and mortality. The use of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can be a useful adjunct, especially after surviving COVID-19 disease, in cases of persistent respiratory problems or fatigue symptoms. TCM always takes into account your individual medical and health history. In a detailed initial anamnesis, we develop a therapy concept in which we combine acupucture treatments and proven Chinese herbal therapy. We offer acupuncture in our practice as an individual health service (IGeL). The treatment is usually reimbursed by private insurance companies, please ask your insurance company. (Dr. Anna Beck and Dr. Anna Lohse (certificate acupuncture) have many years of experience in the field of TCM and offer the treatment in our practice). Homeopathy The time of the pandemic is also a great challenge for homeopathy. After a lively exchange of experiences, a few therapeutic approaches are also emerging for the Post Covid Syndrome, which are communicated e.g. by the German Association of Homeopathic Physicians. Homeopathy is always an individual treatment. We are not looking for a remedy for a disease symptom, but for a remedy for the individual person who comes to us with his symptoms. We always start with a detailed initial interview. Private and some public health insurance companies now reimburse the treatment. Check with your health insurance provider. (Dr.v.Reitzenstein (member of the Central Association of German Homeopathic Physicians and holder of the Homeopathy Diploma) has been offering homeopathic treatments in our practice for years). "}
