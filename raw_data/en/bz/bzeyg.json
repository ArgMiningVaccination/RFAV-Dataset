Read this post to find out. (Warning: this post may offend or challenge you.)", "sitename": "Hareesh.org", "date": "2020-03-12", "cleaned_text": "The 'healing' industry is booming and its profits are soaring. I put the word 'healing' in quotes here because I'm not talking about actual healing of mental and physical illness through still-inadequate but well-vetted and well-regulated modalities (such as allopathic medicine, physical therapy, psychotherapy, somatic therapies, etc.), I'm referring to the countless forms of so-called ['energy' healing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_medicine) that constitute a multibillion dollar industry [[1]](#_ftn1) but so far have no compelling evidence of consistent efficacy and yet claim to solve real (and imagined) problems of both mind and body. Here the term 'energy healing' is interchangeable with 'energy medicine', 'shamanic healing', 'quantum healing', and similar terms. All of these phrases boil down to a simple claim: some special, gifted individuals can feel and manipulate an energy field unknown to science that pervades and affects the human body through an unknown mechanism, or some specially attuned people can channel a unique type of energy unknown to science that can accomplish real-world effects. These amount to claims that magic works, magic being a word for a domain untouched (and possibly untouchable) by science. We can repudiate these magical claims because anything that works consistently, even if it's only 5% of the time, can be shown to work through [carefully designed tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial), even if we don't yet understand how it's working. That is to say, the scientific community is open to and interested in the demonstration of any consistent effect, especially effects that are not understood and are therefore likely to attract research grants. Our system is set up in such a way that if any form of 'energy healing' was consistently effective, we would know that by now, and there would be incentives to figure out why. Am I embracing the scientific method dogmatically and claiming that it can explain everything? Am I claiming that we can know for sure that energy healing never works? Absolutely not, to both questions. All I'm saying is that magic (call it what you will), if it exists, doesn't work consistently or predictably. Therefore, those who make specific claims for the efficacy of any form of energy healing are fooling themselves and others. And if they charge everyone who walks in the door the same rate, that's an implicit claim of consistent efficacy, or an implicit claim that the likelihood of effective treatment is reasonably high, neither of which have been shown to be true in the case of anything labelled as 'energy healing' or its synonyms. None of these facts rule out the possibility of outliers\u2014practitioners who are getting consistent measurable results with their clients, even through completely mysterious means. It's just that we can confidently say that such practitioners are rare enough that they don't produce statistically significant results when averaged against the mass of non-effective practitioners. They don't raise the signal above the ambient noise floor, as it were. Why, then, are these energy healers and alternative wellness practitioners found everywhere, in every major town and city? Is it because the general public is so pathetically gullible, so uneducated, and so desperate? I would say no, that's not the reason. The general public in the US and the UK is fed up with the limitations of an outmoded health care system that for the most part can only deal with the ailments that are both extreme and well-studied, and has no time for conditions that are difficult to diagnose and are not visibly debilitating. But we need to dig even deeper to understanding why the various forms of 'energy healing' are flourishing. I contend that many chronic physical conditions are somatoform in nature, which is to say that they are either caused or (more commonly) greatly exacerbated by unresolved and largely unconscious psychological issues, probably in the manner outlined by Dr. John Sarno and his collaborators in the book [The Divided Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Divided-Mind-Epidemic-Mindbody-Disorders-ebook/dp/B000SEHJOI). [[2]](#_ftn2) But our understanding of how the psyche affects physical health and chronic pain is still in its infancy, so it's easy for more conservative scientists to level criticisms at that book and others like it, though I'm convinced their fundamental ideas will prove to be correct. The first thing to consider here is that those with chronic conditions that are largely somatoform in nature are likely to feel symptomatic relief from any form of prolonged contact with a sympathetic and caring person, even without physical touch. That symptomatic relief can be greatly enhanced, however, by the placebo effect, which of course is partially dependent on the patient's perception of the caregiver as competent and qualified. Therefore, someone with virtually any sort of chronic condition can feel significant symptomatic relief from something like Therapeutic Touch or Reiki or acupuncture if they have a rapport with the practitioner and if they believe that the modality is likely to be effective. The second factor used to be thought primary in the placebo effect, but we now know that the former is at least as important. [[3]](#_ftn3) That is to say, human connection, and sympathetic human presence, is responsible for much of the real-world benefit of the placebo effect. It's important to understand that the placebo effect, contrary to popular belief, is very often real, not imaginary. If you need convincing of this, consider the little-known fact that placebo surgery (that is to say, convincingly faked surgery) can be [just as effective as real surgery](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/11/853753307/all-the-worlds-a-stage-including-the-doctor-s-office) in resolving some physiological conditions. [[4]](#_ftn4) If the practitioner knows how to hold space well and exude care, they can provide symptomatic relief, in the same way a pill can provide relief for physical pain (though through a different mechanism). This is great, but it shouldn't really cost more than a pain-relief pill. There is some evidence to suggest that on very rare occasions, a practitioner of one of these 'energy healing' disciplines can intuitively facilitate actual healing (in which case the discipline itself is usually just a kind of pretext or smokescreen for something that happens mostly spontaneously on the basis of real human connection and, well, the power of what we can only call love). If actual healing happens, the difference from symptomatic relief is substantial and obvious: the ailment or condition is no more. It's, you know, healed. With symptomatic relief, the condition can temporarily feel as if it's gone, only to return full-force a few hours or days later. If that happens, and the person you paid calls themselves a healer, then by rights you should get a refund, because you're not healed. (If they call themselves a 'symptom reliever' then that's a different story!) Would you not demand a refund from a medical doctor that failed to perform the needed procedure, leaving you no better off than before? (Of course, sometimes medical doctors do charge people despite accomplishing nothing, and that's not okay either!) What if we reserved the word healing for situations in which healing has demonstrably taken place? Remember, a synonym for 'healed' is 'cured'. Now, having said that, it is of course possible that partial healing could take place in one of these 'energy healing' sessions. But that, too, should be demonstrable: the condition is permanently improved, like a wound being measurably smaller. If you aren't sure whether healing has happened (after a few days), then it probably hasn't. And you certainly shouldn't be paying big bucks for something that you're not sure worked at all beyond the temporary symptomatic relief. We don't have the spacetime for a long excursus into physics, but I do feel compelled to note that many 'energy healers' love to invoke the term 'energy field' or even 'quantum field'. In many spiritual communities it's accepted virtually without question that people have an 'energy field' that only psychics and energy healers can detect and influence. This imagined energy field escapes detection by even our most sensitive of scientific instruments, that can detect X-rays emitted billions of light-years away and can detect neutrinos\u2014subatomic particles with almost no mass and zero electromagnetic charge\u2014far beneath the earth's crust. But somehow science can't detect the energy field that energy healers claim to affect? [[5]](#_ftn5) This strange supposition only reveals that most people don't know what an energy field is. By definition, an energy field is always measurable\u2014for example, thermal energy exists as a scalar field in which each point in three-dimensional space can be assigned a value we call temperature. If someone speaks of an energy field, the easiest way to test whether they know what that term actually means is to ask \"Is it a [scalar field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field), a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field), or a [tensor field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_field)?\"\u2014those being the different types of energy field. There's no such thing as an undetectable energy field, but more importantly, there can't be any such thing, because energy literally means 'the power to do work' or 'the capacity to transform [something]' and by definition, work and transformation are observable. But I seem to be suggesting that all energy healing is bogus. So how is it a Near Enemy to the truth, which by definition is close to a real and profound truth? Let's consider that question now. I contend that the vast majority of people who are suffering unidentified mental and physical ailments (and even some of those suffering diagnosed ailments) don't need healing per se, they just need to learn to more fully digest their emotions and experiences, because unresolved and undigested experiences involve unconsciously suppressed emotions which can lead to somatoform illnesses and chronic pain conditions (to put it simplistically). First let's address the majority of people who think there's something somehow wrong with them that needs healing: you feel chronic angst, fatigue, and/or mysterious sources of dull and diffuse pain (emotional and physical), so you do cleanses and you go to self-professed healers and perhaps even pay to have your aura analyzed and non-specific 'blockages' removed from your chakras. If this doesn't work, you might go to the next level and pay a 'shamanic healer' to retrieve lost pieces of your soul and/or remove invisible but parasitic noncorporeal 'entities'. [[6]](#_ftn6) This, of course, is nearly always a load of (very profitable) nonsense. I propose to you that in truth, your real issue is the same issue that most humans have: emotional indigestion, which is easily resolvable through basic emotional hygiene. A little background is necessary to understand this. In classical Tantra, we learn that the 'subtle body' (also known as the mental-emotional body) [digests emotions and experiences](https://hareesh.org/blog/2016/12/6/the-most-intimate-part-of-you) in much the same way that the physical body digests food\u2014extracting energy and releasing waste, without remainder. At least, that's how it's supposed to work. However, since most humans receive zero coaching in how to [be with their emotions](https://www.ted.com/talks/guy_winch_why_we_all_need_to_practice_emotional_first_aid) in childhood, or indeed at any other time, a portion of many of their emotional experiences (especially the most impactful ones) remains, as it were, 'undigested' in the form of what we call [samskra](https://hareesh.org/blog/2015/9/21/impressions-of-past-lives) [s](https://hareesh.org/blog/2015/9/21/impressions-of-past-lives) (lit., 'impressions'), which are kind of like chunks of unresolved past experience that hang around in the subtle body. (I should mention here that the term 'subtle body' is virtually synonymous with the term 'psyche', but it is preferably because it emphasizes the yogic teaching that the psyche actually interpenetrates the physical body, and thus we often feel these samskras, these pieces of undigested experience, manifest themselves somatically more than conceptually.) There can be samskras of pleasurable experiences as well as painful ones, but even the latter are not intrinsically bad for you; in fact, they constitute a source of potential energy that is released through the process of digestion, as already outlined in the previous chapter. Even though samskras are not intrinsically bad, when we accumulate a lot of them, it has a significant detrimental impact on our life experience overall. In this traditional yogic model, one's life-force is a finite quantity, and each samskra sequesters a certain amount of it, so the more undigested experiences one has, the less life-force one has available, resulting in fatigue, depletion, ennui, angst, loss of passion, and/or a sense of meaninglessness or pointlessness to life. Furthermore, in a person who possesses a critical mass of undigested painful experience, these samskras can, as it were, start to 'toxify' in later life, resulting in bitterness, dourness, rigidity in mind and body, the inability to feel compassion or empathy, and/or other symptoms. [[7]](#_ftn7) To be clear, here I'm talking about the 'normal' human experience in our society; I'm not addressing the situation of exceptionally traumatized people. But as a society we need to start acknowledging that the 'normal' human experience in the 21st century is one of considerable chronic suffering, concealed as thoroughly as possible for the sake of social status and image crafting. We are far from okay, but there's nothing intrinsically wrong with us, we just need to learn to digest our experiences. This is harder in the 21st century than in previous eras because we don't have (or don't allow ourselves) sufficient time and space in quiet solitude (or with a trusted friend) when, for many people, emotional digestion can happen almost automatically. So we have a backlog of undigested suffering, which spurts out in the almost unbelievable vitriol we see online or gets suppressed and turns into mysterious physical ailments of all kinds. Many of us blame the latter on diet, but I contend that if we can digest our emotions, we'll digest our food better as well, in which we need not engage in the obsessive forms of selective food-avoidance that are increasingly prevalent today. If we had a sane society, emotional digestion would just be a normal part of life. No one would think it odd or unwarranted if someone excused themselves in a middle of a conversation or a meeting to go cry or scream for ten minutes (or simply be quiet with their feelings), because everyone would understand that virtually anything in everyday life can trigger a samskra of an old experience, and the triggering of a samskra is a golden opportunity for digestion, and all successful digestion adds to your aliveness. And, by the way, it need not be a samskra getting triggered at all\u2014one can digest emotions related to the present-moment situation in real time, which also enhances aliveness and avoids the depositing of a samskra which will need to be digested later. Unfortunately, we don't yet live in a sane society or an emotionally healthy world. Most people don't know how to digest their challenging emotions and experiences, so they tend to dump them on others\u2014through blaming, shaming, emotional off-loading, etc.\u2014or they suppress them, shoving them down inside, where they slowly toxify. Additionally, if you believe others are to blame for what you feel, that inhibits digestion, and makes it more likely that you try to enlist those others to do your emotional labor for you. Emotional digestion happens fairly easily and naturally in the following context: a) you can acknowledge and take responsibility for your feelings (without blaming anyone)\u2014\"this is what I'm feeling, and it's totally normal that I'm feeling this, given the situation and my past history; no one's to blame, but it's my job to digest my emotions, since no one else can do it for me.\" b) you value yourself enough to take some time every day to fully be with whatever you feel, giving yourself the space to both feel and digest it; c) you can recognize that your stories about what you feel are just that\u2014mental fabrications that seek to explain the feeling and thus gain an illusory sense of power or control over it, and you recognize that believing these stories inhibits emotional digestion; and d) you can lay the stories and interpretations aside and bring the raw feelings in close, welcoming them into your heart, while affirming your ability to digest them\u2014\"I welcome this feeling, whether not I like it. I permit it to pass over me and through me. I let myself feel it fully. I'm not trying to get rid of it too soon, and I'm not hanging on to it. I can digest this. And when I do, I become stronger.\" (I'm not suggesting you repeat exactly these words, I'm trying to point towards the kind of attitude that is effective.) Emotional digestion needs to happen almost every day. Healing work, on the other hand, is what is called for when someone has a physical or emotional wound sufficiently deep that it needs special attention. Without such attention, it becomes life-threatening. Emotional wounds become life-threatening when they sap the joy out of life and begin to paralyze one's life-force. Perhaps someone with a very strong psyche can heal themselves of deep emotional wounds; but most people need some assistance and support. For example, the inability to forgive yourself for hurting someone, or the inability to forgive someone for hurting you (and we should note that that language is almost never accurate\u2014nearly all painful interpersonal experiences are thoroughly co-created) can effectively inhibit the normal digestion process. In this case one often needs a therapist who can facilitate the understanding that makes forgiveness possible and thus makes digestion of the experience possible. The type of professional help one engages matters\u2014the right tool for the right job, as it were. For example, if you are consciously or unconsciously terrified of the intensity of your undigested feelings, then you won't be able to access them at will, in which case a somatic therapist might be needed to work with the physical body in such a way as to help you access the buried emotion and feel it fully so it can move through and resolve itself. For some other people, only psychedelic-assisted therapy can help them access what they need to see and feel and digest within themselves to experience their intrinsic wholeness. And here we must note that a therapist is a trained, certified, and licensed professional. A self-appointed 'energy healer' operating in a totally unregulated industry cannot substitute for a therapist. I've talked about emotional digestion you can do on your own versus the need for professional assistance. But isn't there something in between? Some middle ground where we need a bit of help but not full-scale professional intervention? I would say yes. But this middle ground does not need to be occupied by monetized 'energy healing' or 'shamanic healing'\u2014we can, as a society, learn to come together and support each other in this way, outside the capitalist model. I'll explain. Significant emotional wounds that don't require professional intervention can be healed, partially or totally, with the support of a trusted friend who is intuitive and/or emotionally intelligent. If that person can hold space, witness you compassionately, and reflect your experience back to you (without distortion) when needed, they might be able to co-create real healing with you beyond what you can do on your own. Additionally (and here's where it might sound a bit woo-woo, but it's real, I assure you), if that friend is somewhere on the spectrum of spiritual awakening, she might instinctively know how to connect her subtle body to yours and share psychic space (for lack of a better phrase), in which case she can help you digest your samskra (emotional wound) on a purely nonconceptual level as you feel it together. No special technique is needed for this: just the intuitive sense of how to dissolve the artificial boundary between two people and feel through stuff together. There are people who know how to do this without knowing how they know, so they don't call themselves healers or psychics or anything. Indeed, almost anyone on the spectrum of awakening can learn to do it. [[8]](#_ftn8) But it doesn't make sense to charge money for this, because a) it only tends to work when there is already a bond of trust and friendship, b) there's no guarantee of it working at all, and c) you can't put a price on it. It has to be based in the authentic desire for connection and the authentic desire to contribute to another's well-being for the intrinsic value of doing so. There are many other ways that spiritual friends can support each other in the digestion of difficult emotions and challenging experiences. They can be surprisingly simple, such as having your trusted friend rock your body rhythmically in various ways while you moan or sigh or vocalize whatever needs to come out (your friend would need to be okay with weird sounds coming out of you\u2014this is a normal part of emotional release for many people). Another powerful method is to have a friend with a strong voice sing OM or some other mantra(s) into the place in your body where the emotional energy is 'stuck' (if you know where that is). Some readers will know what I mean, others can simply leave aside this paragraph. These are the kinds of things friends would do for each other as a matter of course in a sane society, and these are the kinds of things friends can and should do for each other in any healthy community. Such support shouldn't need to be paid for because it requires no special skill (and because it's not something we could institutionalize and regulate). If holding space effectively in this way seems like a special skill, that's only because we are still so very far from a sane society. Perhaps someday everyone will learn these things in school as a matter of course; perhaps someday we'll realize that our primary and secondary schools need to train kids in emotional intelligence, interpersonal communication, real life problem-solving, critical thinking, and emotional digestion rather than subjects that only a tiny minority of those kids will go on to utilize (like maths, science, literature, and history). Doubtless those readers who consider themselves energy healers will be upset by this chapter. Drafts of it were very controversial in the community of which I'm a part. I have found that when people's livelihood and/or self-image is involved, they get strongly triggered by arguments that seem to challenge either. Having already up those folks, I might as well go the final mile and say this: you're in an unregulated industry precisely there's nothing to regulate. None of these modalities based in undetectable forms of energy that you claim to feel* has been proven to have any effect beyond placebo, i.e. beyond the valuable symptomatic relief that happens when a) one believes or wants to believe that the treatment will work, and b) one receives the loving touch and/or benevolent care of another human. Based on personal experience with several of these alternative modalities (when I used to have recurrent lower back pain), I would say that a significant part of the symptomatic relief is due to the fact that the person receiving the treatment often enters a meditative and relaxed state that, with a little practice, they could actualize on their own. [ *I don't doubt your collective testimonies that you feel something, and that your clients often claim to feel something, but there are alternative explanations for this than the existence of a scientifically undetectable energy that has real-world effects. So please understand, I'm not calling you a liar if you claim to be an energy healer or the like. I'm claiming that you're (probably) self-deceived.] Other people will want to point out that many traditional cultures, including Tibetan culture, teach a kind of spiritual healing or what might well be called 'energy healing'. But let's be clear about this: these are modalities whereby shaman-type figures attempt to heal actual ailments of the mind or body (like malaria or schizophrenia) through magical or supernatural means (as well as, sometimes, through herbs and plants). These folks are, in sense, more honest than New Age 'energy healers' because they openly acknowledge that they deal in magic. But these traditional shamans are traditionally held to a high standard: they are only judged as having been successful if the malady in question actually goes away (i.e., a cure is effected). I think we should apply the same standards to 'energy healers' in the West. In fact, to avoid hypocrisy, we must apply the same critical standard to traditional and modern claims of efficacy. \"But,\" I hear some of you objecting, \"don't you teach so-called energy body practices as part of [Tantrik Yoga](https://tantrikainstitute.org/7-facets-overview/)??\" Yes indeed. The difference\u2014and it's a huge difference\u2014is that there are no claims of healing power being made. Nor are there implicit promises of enlightenment. I don't teach that the subtle body practices of traditional Tantrik Yoga will bring about this or that result. I invite people to try out these practices and discover what the results are for them, because I know that results of any given spiritual practice can vary widely from person to person, and what seems to work miraculously well for one does nothing at all for another. Additionally, I want to avoid the effects of [priming](http://blog.motivemetrics.com/What-is-Priming-A-Psychological-Look-at-Priming-Consumer-Behavior) as far as possible, the phenomenon whereby someone primed to have a particular kind of experience and who wants to have it imagines they do have it but with no actual lasting beneficial impact (hypnotic priming is a central technique in both the 3HO \" [Kundalini Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini_yoga#Yogi_Bhajan)\" cult as well as in the MISA/ [Natha](https://natha.dk)/ [Tara](https://tarayogacentre.co.uk)/ [ATMAN](https://atmanyogafederation.org) cult). Indeed, the purpose of the practices of Tantrik Yoga is not to have an experience at all, but rather to bring about a gradual, inexorable, powerful paradigm shift that is nonconceptual yet utterly indisputable (to the one who undergoes it). Of course, in that process of paradigm shift we call [awakening](https://hareesh.org/blog/2016/8/16/what-spiritual-awakening-really-means), moments of spontaneous emotional digestion and even moments of deep healing can and do occur as a wondrous side effect. And yes, it's also possible that those who go as far as one can go with the Tantrik energy-body practices may develop the capacity to accomplish things, up to and including healing cancer and HIV, through some means that science cannot yet explain. Such accomplished masters can also demonstrate other powers that should be impossible according to science, such as delivering messages to people in dreams or visions, messages which can then be subsequently verified. I've seen these anomalies myself. But allowing for the existence of such very rare outliers does not undermine the argument of this chapter. Put simply, it's irresponsible to recommend 'energy healing' to someone will real mental or physical illness if it has a 1 in 1000 chance of effecting real healing. And recommending it\u2014and/or unproven herbal supplements and homeopathic 'remedies'\u2014instead of conventional medicine and well-vetted therapeutic modalities is worse than irresponsible. It's dangerous. Join me at [Tantra Illuminated](https://learn.tantrailluminated.org/purchase/) for more teachings!

[[6]](#_ftnref6) Where there term 'shamanic' relates not to any traditional practices of indigenous people, but rather a recently created imaginal world all its own (with tenuous connections to some traditional shamanic ideas), serving a specific cultural demographic that is overwhelmingly white, privileged, and 'alternative'. Consider this example chosen almost at random, which uses language that has become ubiquitous in these circles: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/biancasalonga/2021/08/07/shamanism-demystified-enhance-overall-wellness-through-shamanic-healing/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/biancasalonga/2021/08/07/shamanism-demystified-enhance-overall-wellness-through-shamanic-healing/) [[7]](#_ftnref7) NB: to the reader who thinks the language used in the last couple of paragraphs is not really all that dissimilar to that which I previous criticized, I would say that what I'm presenting is a conceptual model validated by its effectiveness; I'm not invested in the question of whether it's literally true. From my perspective, virtually nothing said in words is literally true. These are terms of art that are effective in a given context. I'm interested in efficacy. And I'm suggesting here (and at many points throughout this book) that it would be most beneficial if you, dear reader, were likewise concerned with efficacy. Pace the unfortunate poetic statement of Keats, truth cannot be legitimately correlated with what is pleasing, but rather with what is effective. [[8]](#_ftnref8) I use the phrase 'spectrum of awakening' to emphasize that spiritual awakening is not a simple binary, as is wrongly implied by the outmoded dichotomy of the terms enlightened vs. unenlightened. Rather, spiritual awakening can be analogously compared to pregnancy: there is a binary in the sense that someone is either pregnant or they're not, but pregnancy itself has many stages and phases and aspects. Like awakeness, it's far from a static state. (But like all analogies, this one breaks down at some point: there is no final state of enlightenment that would analogically correspond to the delivery of the baby.) ~ ~ ~ What are 'near enemies to the truth'? Borrowing this phrase from Buddhism, I use it to refer to slightly distorted versions of spiritual teachings\u2014statements that are close to a profound and subtle truth, but are distorted just enough to make a big difference over time. When we're talking about deep and fundamental truths, getting it a little bit wrong doesn't matter in the short run, but it does in the long run, just like a tiny adjustment to the rudder of your boat makes little difference at first, but after 1000 miles, it lands you on a different continent. Now, some people object to the use of the word 'wrong' in the previous sentence, subscribing as they do to the idea that the only necessary criterion for truth is it feels true to me. This view is as dangerous in spirituality as it is in [politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-truth_politics), because it usually means I want it to be true, so I'm going to believe it, regardless of the facts. If you don't see how dangerous this is, or if you doubt whether there really are facts or universal truths, please read the second half of the [first blog post in this series](http://tantrikstudies.squarespace.com/blog/2017/7/22/near-enemy-1-everything-happens-for-a-reason). Understanding the Near Enemies to the Truth, and why they are near enemies and not the truth itself, is hugely important for any spiritual seeker who wants to get past the beginner stages and into the deep (and deeply fulfilling) spiritual work. Having said that, it's important to note that if a Near Enemy is near enough, it can be a Temporary Ally for a beginner. But as the stakes get higher in spiritual practice, there is no such thing as 'close enough' anymore, and your comforting affirmations must be sacrificed on the altar of truth, or else your spiritual progress stalls.
