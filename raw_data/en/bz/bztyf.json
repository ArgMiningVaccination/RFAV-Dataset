Monkeypox On July 16, 2021, Texas DSHS confirmed a Dallas County resident contracted Monkeypox after traveling from Nigeria. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Adviso ry: HAN Archive -00446 | Health Alert Network (HAN) (cdc.gov) Monkeypox is a viral illness that is transmitted via contact with African animals or animal products infected with the virus. It is sometimes spread person -to-person or through contaminated materials via respiratory droplets or direct contact with body fluids. Per CDC guidance, the incubation period typically is 7 -14 days. However, it can range from 5 -21 days. Signs and symptoms of Monkeypox consist of the following: fever, headache, muscle aches, backaches, swollen lymph nodes, chill, exhaustion and lesions. One of the most fundamental methods to prevent contracting Monkeypox is to avoid contact with those that are infected, including animals, unless wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Prevention methods include wearing PPE while perfo rming patient care, as well as performing proper hand hygiene, including washing hands with soap and water or using alcohol -based hand sanitizer.

Page 3 Healthcare Safety Newsletter Health News Detection of Candida auris Requires Special Laboratory Equipment Candida auris (C. auris) became a notifiable condition on January 1, 2021, per the Texas Administrative Code. As of July 13 , 2021, a total of 94 C. auris cases have been reported in Texas, most of which have occur red in two different outbreaks. Detection and identification of this pathogen requires special laboratory equipment that not all laboratories have. C. auris can be misidentified in the laborator y when using traditional phenotypic methods for yeast identification such as VITEK 2 YST, API 20C, BD Phoenix yeast identification system, and MicroScan. All C. auris and Candida isolates that may be misidentified or cannot be identified should be sent to the DSHS Laboratory in Austin. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) recommends use of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -registered hospital -grade disinfectant effective against C. auris (EPA List P). If none of the above products are available, CDC recommends use of an EPA -registered hospital -grade disinfectant effective against Clostridioides difficile spores (List K). If you are interested in learning more about C. auris , including DSHS screening recommendations, you at: esistance/Candida Associated Burkholderia pseudomallei The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the State Health Departments in Kansas, Texas , Minnesota and Georgia are investigating four cases of melioidosis caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei . Most cases of melioidosis have a history of travel to South Asia where B. pseudomallei occurs naturally in soil and water, but none of these four patients traveled outside the United States. The patients might have been exposed to the same source such as a contaminated product, but the source has not been identified yet. The CDC issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) on Multistate Investigation of Non -Travel Associated Burkholderia pseudomallei on June 30, 2021 and a second Health Alert Network (HAN) New Case Identified of Non -travel Associated Burkholderia pseudomallei in Georgia on August 9, 2021. On July 1, 2021, the CDC also issued a HAN to clinical laboratori es: CDC Clinical Laboratory Notification on Burkholderia pseudomallei . According to the HAN: \"Laboratory testing involving automated identification algorithms (i.e., MALDI -TOF, 16s, VITEK -2) may misidentify B. pseudomallei as another bacterium, such as occurred with the case in TX, where the isolate was initially misidentified as \"Clinical laboratories that have identified any of the agents listed above from hospitalized patients from January 1, 2021 to the present should c onsult with their state or local public health department to determine if referral to a Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratory for rule out of B. pseudomallei is indicated.\" If a suspect isolate is still available, contact your local health departmen t to organize forwarding it to the appropriate LRN lab for identification (https://www.dshs.texas.gov/lab/eprLRN.shtm ). Public health departments sh ould contact their Regional Zoonosis Control office if they receive inquiries related to this investigation or additional suspect cases https://www.dshs.texas.gov/IDCU/health/z oonosis/Contac t-Us.aspx Safety :T C A N D I D A A u R I s 11 RESILIENCE OUTBREAK R C A I I T I N J u R y s N PATHOGEN J E E A N T I B I 0 T I C s TRAINING MONKEYPOX H N s F N u 0 u T B R E A K CDC ANTIBIOTICS E 0 p I N T V A C C I N E T VACCINE R I N R L I T R A I N I N G INJURY CANDIDA AURIS E T p K E I s E N K T I D E SAFETY DISINFECT A C A C E V E I I A I N u A MASK INFECTION E E T R I y E N D A A p s A PREVENTION K F H s A N p N C C H A s K B N 0 C C V H 0 T E F y A 0 N I G G C D C s X I F D A p I p E R 0 N C R E H 0 R R E 0 I N s A F E T y E E N I R Play thls puzzle onllne at : https://thewordsearch.coe/puzzle/2720315/ Page 4 Healthcare Safety Newsletter Upcoming Events San Antonio, Texas will host the ASHRM 2021 Annual Conference .

Health and Human Texas Department of State Services Health Services Healthcare Safety Newsletter Page 5 Resilience and Mental Strength The sudden, unpredictable, and virulent nature of the COVID -19 pandemic required healthcare workers to quickly adjust to a highly stressful environment where standards and best practices changed on a very frequent basis. Successfully navigating this chaos tested each healthcare worker's resilience and mental strength. Resilience: Ability to face adverse situations Ability to remain focused during a variety of situations Ability to maintain optimism for the future Resilienc e can be learned and strengthened! Mental Strength: The capacity of an individual to deal with stressors in a positive way Ability to continue to perform to one's best ability even in uncertain and/or chaotic conditions. Mental strength can also be learned and strengthened. Healthcare organizations must also be able to demonstrate resilience by anticipating, preparing for, responding to, and adapting to changes and/or sudden disruptions in order to survive and thrive. FOOD FOR THOUGHT : Consider the impact that the COVID -19 pandemic, the shortage of healthcare workers, and the disruption of the supply chain presented for your organization. From what source(s) has your organization been able to draw upon resilience? Interested in building your resilience? The practice of \"mindfulness\" is a great way to begin! A study found that resilience can be improved by meditation (Bajaj and Pande, 2015). Mindful people can better cope with negative emotions. Mindfulness promotes increased awareness of self and environment. A favorite mindfulness activity is the walking meditation . Walking meditation be st begins with a period of sitting meditation where the emphasis is on one's breathing. This is followed by walking meditation. The walk can be pre -determined (i.e., in a specific circle or pattern, a specific distance, etc.) or the walk can be spontaneo us. During the walk, begin to allow yourself to concentrate on specific elements of your walk. Note your environment (seeing, hearing, smelling). Next, focus on your gait. What are your arms doing? Your legs? Your neck and shoulders? Are your shoes making any noise on the surface of the walk? What does it sound like? Is the sound consistent? Notice the movement of your leg, your knee, and your foot as you make each step. Try to remain focused on these exercises. If your mind wanders (and it will), just retu rn to your mindful exercises and refocus. Want to learn more? Multiple materials are available to help you learn to practice mindfulness. Look for resources online, YouTube, books, professional journals, popular magazines, etc. Texas healthcare workers, throughout the pandemic, have been required to draw upon their great reserves of resilience. For much of the pandemic, healthcare workers faced a highly contagious and deadly disease without adequate personal protection equipment. These daily acts of heroi sm represent the application of resilience at its highest level. Texas will always thank you most sincerely for all your effort during this trying time.
