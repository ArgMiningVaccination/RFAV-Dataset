INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 174, Defendant. Case No. COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES COMES NOW the Plaintiff, by and through its attorneys of record, and states and alleges as follows: I. PARTIES 1.1 Plaintiff Glacier Northwest, Inc., d/b/a CalPortland, (hereinafter \"Glacier\") is, and at all times mentioned in this Complaint was, a Washington Corporation doing business in Washington state, engaged in the sale and delivery of ready-mix concrete and aggregates to various customers in King County, Washington and other Washington counties. 1.2 Defendant International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local Union No. 174 (hereinafter \"Union\") is, and at all times mentioned in this Complaint was, a labor organization representing employees. The Union transacts business in, and its principal office, officers and agents are located in, King County, Washington. 6 1.3 At all times material with respect to the allegations in this Complaint, the Union was, and for many years has been, the exclusive bargaining representative for drivers employed by Glacier in King County, Washington who are members of the Union (hereinafter \"Glacier Drivers\"). 1.4 At all times material with respect to the allegations in this Complaint, Richard Hicks (hereinafter \"Hicks\") was Sec retary-Treasurer of the Union, an agent and employee of the Union, and acting within the course and scope of that agency and employment. On this basis, the Union is liable for the consequences resulting from Hicks' conduct with respect to the allegations in this Complaint. 1.5 At all times material with respect to the allegations in this Complaint, Carl Gasca (hereinafter \"Gasca\") was a Business Agent of the Union, an agent and employee of the Union, and acting within the course and scope of that ag ency and employment. On this basis, the Union is liable for the consequences resulting from Gasca's conduct with respect to the allegations in this Complaint. 1.6 At all times material with respect to the allegations in this Complaint, Michael Walker (hereinafter \"Walker\") was a Business Agent of the Union, an agent and employee of the Union, and acting within the course and scope of that agency and employment. On this basis, the Union is liable for the consequences resulting from Walker's conduct with respect to the allegations in this Complaint. II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2.1 This Court has jurisdict ion over this dispute and venue in this action is prop er because the tortious acts 7 that have caused Glacier damages occurred in King County, and the Union trans acts business in King County. 2.2 This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute because this dispute involves traditional Washington state law tort actions subject to state regulation, and the state has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from th e wrongful, damaging and tortious acts of destruction of property; false, fraudulent and material representations; and interference with performance of contractual and business relationships. III. FACTS 3.1 Glacier enters into contracts, agreements and/or business relationships with Glacier's customers for the sale and delivery of concrete, aggregate and associated se rvices and products from Glacier to Glacier's customers (hereinafter \"concrete customers\"). 3.2 Glacier services its concrete customers in King County through several of Glacier's facilities, including Glacier facilities located in Seattle, Kenmore and Snoqualmie, Washington. A. The Events of August 11, 2017. 3.3 Concrete contains environmentally sensitive chemicals and mixtures that must be disposed of promptly, safely and correctly. 3.4 To prepare concrete for immediate delivery to a concrete customer, the concrete is \"batched,\" which generally means measuring and mixing the different ingredients of the concrete (e.g. , cement, sand, 8 aggregate, admixture and water) subject to the concrete customer's specifications. 3.5 Batching occurs when the raw materials for the concrete are moved into a weigh hopper pursuant to the specific design of the given concrete customer. Once the raw materials are blended together to meet the specific design request, the raw materials cannot be separated or \"unblended.\" The raw materials are then discharged from the weigh hopper into either a hopper or a barrel, depending upon the batch plant. The hopper or barrel batches the concrete by mixing and folding the raw materials together into concrete. 3.6 Once batched, concrete is immediately discharged from the hopper or barrel into a concrete ready-mix truck for immediate delivery to the concrete customer for ultimate discharge into the concrete customer's project. Concrete ready-mix trucks are specifically designed to maintain the integrity of the batched concrete in a revolving drum (located at the back of the ready-mix truck) during transport to the concrete customer's location. 3.7 When the concrete is discharged from the hopper or barrel into the ready-mix truck, the raw materials for the next load are discharged from the weigh hopper into the hopper and barrel and the batching and mixing of the next load of concrete commences. 3.8 Concrete is a highly perishable product. Once at rest, concrete begins hardening immediately, and depending upon the mix can begin to set within 20 to 30 minutes. Once batched, a load of concrete cannot be saved for another day. It must be delivered to a customer, poured and finish ed. A limited amount of 9 time exists for the concrete to be transported in a ready-mix truck from Glacier 's facility to a concrete customer and discharged before the concrete becomes useless. 3.9 If batched concrete remains in the revolving drum of the ready-mix truck beyond its useful life span, the batched concrete is certain or substantially certain to harden in the revolving drum and cause significant damage to the concrete ready-mix truck. Once it starts to set, the concrete begins to thicken, placing pressure on the hydraulic system in the barrel of the ready-mix truck when the revolving drum is rotating. When the revolving drum is not rotating, the setting process commences and the concrete begins to harden inside the drum of the ready-mix truck. 3.10 If batched concrete is not timely delivered to a Glacier concrete customer, the batched concrete is certain or substantially certa in to harden so as to be destroyed by being so materially altered in its physical condition as to de prive Glacier of possession or use of the batched concrete. 3.11 Commencing in the very early hours of August 11, 2017, Glacier and the Glacier Drivers were engaged in servicing a number of Glacier's contracts, agreements and business rela tionships with Glacier's concrete customers through the batching and delivery of concrete to Glacier's concrete customers. This work was scheduled to continue throughout the day. 3.12 The Union and some or all of its officers, employees and members were aware of the perishable nature of batched concrete, of Glacier's operations, and of Glacier's servicing of the contracts, agreements 10 and business relationships with Glacier's concrete customers on August 11, 2017. 3.13 On August 11, 2017, the Union and some or all of its officers, employees and members consciously acted together pursuant to an understanding, plan or agreement among them, to sabotage, ruin and destroy Glacier's batched concrete and thereby interfere with Glacier's performance of Glacier's contracts, agreements and business rela tionships with Glacier's concrete customers by preventing Glacier's performance and causing it to be more expensive or burdensome. 3.14 The Union and some or all of its officers, employees and members knew the August 11, 2017 sabotage, ruination and destruction of Glacier's batched concrete was certain to, or substantially certain to, interfere with Glacier's performance of its contracts, agreements and business relationships with Glacier's concrete customers by preventing Glacier's performance and causing it to be more expensive or burdensome. 3.15 The Union and some or all of its officers, employees and members participated in the August 11, 2017 sabotage, ruination and destruction of Glacier's batched concrete with the improper purpose to harm Glacier by causing Glacier's batched concrete to be destroyed and to thereby interfere with Glacier's performance of its contracts, agreements and business relationships with Glacier's concrete customers by preventing Glacier's performance and causing it to be more expensive or burdensome. 3.16 The sabotage, ruination and destruction of Glacier's batched concrete began shortly before 7:00 11 a.m. on August 11, 2017, when Union agents Hicks, Gasca, and Walker were pre sent at Glacier's Seattle facility while Glacier Drivers were engaged in the process of loading and/or delivering batched concrete to Glacier's concrete customers. 3.17 At that time, Union agents Hicks, Gasca, Walker and unnamed Union members engaged in a sudden cessation of work at Glacier's Seattle, Kenmore and Snoqualmie facilities when Glacier's concrete was being mixed and batched, when Glacier's ready-mix trucks were loaded and being loaded with batched concrete, and when ready-mix trucks were in the process of delivering batch ed concrete to Glacier's concrete customers. 3.18 The Union and some or all of its officers, employees and members knew or had reason to know that the August 11, 2017 batched concrete was Glacier's batched concrete and was to be delivered from Glacier to the immediate possession of Glacier's concrete customers. They also knew or had reason to know there were substant ial volumes of batched concrete in Glacier's barrels, hoppers and ready-mix trucks. 3.19 Rather than taking reasonable precautions to protect Glacier's equipment, plant and batched concrete from the foreseeable imminent danger resulting from the August 11, 2017 sudden cessation of work, the Union and some or all of its officers, employees and members acted tortiously and indefensibly by sabotaging, ruining and destroying Glacier's undelivered and perishable batched concrete. 12 3.20 With the improper purpose of sabotaging, ruining and destroying Glacier's batched concrete, the Union and some or all of its officers, employees and members intentionally timed the August 11, 2017 sudden cessation of work for a time of day when they knew Glacier's concrete was being mixed and batched, when ready-mix trucks were loaded and being loaded with batched concrete, and when ready-mix trucks were in the process of deliv ering batched concrete to Glacier's concrete customers. 3.21 The Union and some or all of its officers, employees and members knew their August 11, 2017 conduct was certain to, or substantially certain to, destroy or so materially alter the physical condition of Glacier's batched concrete as to deprive Glacier of possession or use of the batched concrete. 3.22 The Union, Hicks, Gasca, Walker and unnamed Union members instructed, commanded, supervised, led, encouraged, urged, instigated, aided and abetted, approved, confirmed, ratified, adopted, acquiesced, participated in and acted pursuant to the understanding, plan or agreement among them to intentionally sabotage, ruin and destroy Glacier's batched concrete, and to interfere with Glacier's performance of its contracts, agreements and business relationships with Glacier's concrete customers by preventing Glacier's performance and causing it to be more expensive or burdensome on August 11, 2017. 3.23 Pursuant to that understanding, plan or agreement, Glacier Drivers sabotaged, ruined and destroyed Glacier's batched concrete by immediately and suddenly ceasing all concrete delivery activity 13 work, and abandoning or discharging at the Glacier facilities the batched concrete under their control. 3.24 In response to the August 11, 2017 understanding, plan or agreement to sabotage, ruin and destroy Glacier's batched concrete, Glacier immediately attempted to mitigate the emergency situation by, among many other remedial actions, constructing bunkers on Glacier's property where the batched concrete could be offloaded, offloading the hardening batched concrete into the constructed bunkers, ensuring washout of the ready-mix trucks, and preventing damage to Glacier's plant, equipment and waste water system. 3.25 As a result of its immediate actions, Glacier was able to offload the se mi-solid concrete in an environmentally correct manner without destruction of Glacier's ready-mix trucks, plant and equipment; however, the batched concrete was destroyed by hardening in Glacier's yard and in the constructed bunkers. 3.26 The August 11, 2017 sabotage, ruination and destruction of Glacier's batched concrete necessitated Glacier bringing in excavating equipment and trucks to break up the August 11, 2017 fully hardened concrete and to haul it away to offsite disposal sites. 3.27 The above-described conduct of the Union and some or all of its office rs, employees and members caused Glacier's concrete to be destroyed by materially altering its physical condition so as to deprive Glacier of possession or use of the concrete, resulting in financial loss to Glacier, including but not limited to damage to the lost concrete, associated cleanup costs and expenses, other consequential costs 14 and expenses, back charges, lost profits and other damages. 3.28 By destroying Glacier's concrete, the above- described conduct of the Union and some or all of its officers, employees and me mbers prevented Glacier's August 11, 2017 performance of Glacier's contracts, agreements and business rela tionships with Glacier's concrete customers and caused Glacier's performance to be more expensive or burdensome, resulting in financial loss to Glacier, incl uding but not limited to damage to the lost concrete, associated cleanup costs and expenses, other consequential costs and expenses, back charges, lost profits and other damages. 3.29 At all times material with respect to the sabotage, ruination and destruction of Glacier's concrete and the resulting interference with Glacier's performance as described above, the Union and some or all of its officers, e mployees and members acted together with knowledge of the conditions and intending the conduct or its consequences, and combined to accomplish the wrongful and unlawful sabotage, ruination and destruction of Glacier's concrete. 3.30 At all times material with respect to the above- described conduct in this Complaint, the Union and those Union officers, emp loyees and members were the agents, servants and representatives of each other, and were at all times acting with the permission, consent, knowledge and ratification of each other, and were acting consciously together within the course and scope of their agency. 3.31 As a direct and proximate result of the above- described conduct, Glacier was caused to suffer 15 property damage, unanticipated costs and expenses, lost profits and other damages in an amount, scope and extent not fully known and subject to proof at trial. The Union is liable for these damages. B. The Events of August 18 and 19, 2017. 3.32 At all times material with respect to the allegations in this Complaint, Glacier and its concrete customer, GLY Construction, Inc. (\"GLY\"), had a contract, agreement and business relationship requiring Glacier to furnish ready-mix concrete to the Vulcan Block 31 commercial project (\"Vulcan Project\"), which is a massive commercial building project in Seattle's South Lake Union area. 3.33 At all times material with respect to the allegations in this Complaint, the Union and its agent Hicks were aware of Glacier's contract, agreement and business relationship with GLY for the Vulcan Project. 3.34 After the sudden cessation of work on August 11, 2017, Glacier and GLY po stponed an August 12, 2017 mat pour which Glac ier was contractually obligated to complete for the Vulcan Project and of which the Union and its agent Hicks were aware. 3.35 A mat pour involves the continuous delivery by a large number of ready-mix trucks of a massive volume of concrete to pour a concrete slab that acts as the foundation for a large commercial building. 3.36 Mat pours are complex operations requiring substantial planning and coordination including, among many other coordinated and timed tasks, traffic planning, obtaining street use permits, retaining testing labs, scheduling labor for the pour, obtaining concrete pumps and backup equipment, and 16 hiring off-duty police, mechanics, clean-up personnel and pour watch personnel. 3.37 Large mat pours like that for the Vulcan Project often occur at night and sometimes on a weekend due to the complexity, coordination and traffic disruptions associated with the mat pour. 3.38 Ted Herb (\"Herb\"), CEO of GLY, had responsibility on behalf of GLY for determining whether the Vulcan Project mat pour would occur on August 19, 2017. 3.39 Herb contacted Hicks at the Union on August 18, 2017, to determine if the Glacier Drivers had ratified a new labor agreement and would be returning to work at Glacier, and if the Glacier Drivers intended to respond to work the Vulcan Project mat pour on August 19, 2017. 3.40 In the August 18, 2017 discussion between Herb and Hicks, Hicks co nfirmed that the Glacier Drivers had ratified a ne w labor agreement and the Glacier Drivers intended to and would respond to work the Vulcan Project mat pour on August 19, 2017. Hicks stated to Herb that the Union had \"specifically instructed the drivers to respond to Dispatch.\" Hicks both impliedly and specifically assured Herb that the Glacier Drivers intended to work the August 19, 2017 Vulcan Project mat pour and would respond by working the August 19, 2017 Vulcan mat pour. 3.41 Upon information and belief, the Union had in fact instructed Glacier Drivers to not answer calls from Glacier Dispatch and/or to not report to work if the Glacier Drivers received a call from Glacier Dispatch for the August 19, 2017 Vulcan Project mat pour. 17 3.42 Hicks' August 18, 2017 statements and assurances to Herb were false, fraudulent and material representations. 3.43 Hicks' August 18, 2017 false, fraudulent and material representations to Herb were express and implied misrepresentations of fact, opinion or intention for the purpose of inducing the scheduling of the Vulcan Project mat pour for August 19, 2017. 3.44 Hicks concealed and never informed or even suggested to Herb that his August 18, 2017 statements and assurances were false, or that the Union had instructed Glacier Drivers to not answer calls from Glacier Dispatch or to not report to work if the Glacier Drivers received a call from Glacier Dispatch to work the August 19, 2017 Vulcan Project mat pour. 3.45 Hicks made the August 18, 2017 false, fraudulent and material representations to Herb intending or having reason to expect that the substance of those statemen ts and assurances would be communicated to Glacier, and that it would influence GLY and Glacier in scheduling the Vulcan Project mat pour for August 19, 2017. 3.46 Hicks intended or had reason to expect that GLY and Glacier would be in fluenced by and act upon Hicks' August 18, 2017 false, fraudulent and material representations to Herb by scheduling the Vulcan Project mat pour for August 19, 2017. 3.47 On August 18, 2017, af ter his discussion with Hicks, Herb informed Glacier of the substance of his above-described conversation with Hicks and, based upon Hicks' false, fraudulent and material representations, Herb advised Glacier that the 18 Glacier Drivers intended to and would respond to Glacier Dispatch to work the Vulcan Project mat pour on August 19, 2017. 3.48 At all times material with respect to the allegations in this Complaint, Hicks concealed and did not disclose, or otherwis e make known to GLY or Glacier, that Hicks' August 18, 2017 statements and assurances were false, or that the Union had in fact instructed Glacier Drivers to not answer calls from Glacier Dispatch or to not report to work if the Glacier Drivers received a call from Glacier Dispatch for the August 19, 2017 Vulcan Project mat pour. 3.49 GLY and Glacier justi fiably relied upon Hicks' August 18, 2017 false, fraudulent and material representations by scheduling the Vulcan Project mat pour for August 19, 2017. 3.50 On August 18, 2017, Glacier left messages with approximately 60 Glacier Drivers providing their start times for the August 19, 2017 Vulcan Project mat pour, posted a \"call tape\" with each Glacier Driver's start time, and \"overbooked\" the number of Glacier Drivers in the event there were any \"no shows\" for the August 19, 2017 Vulcan Project mat pour. 3.51 On August 19, 2017, approximately 17 Glacier Drivers had clocked in at their scheduled time to perform the Vulcan Project mat pour, and approximately 5 more Glac ier Drivers showed up later. At least 40 Glacier Drivers were needed and scheduled for Glacier to perform the Vulcan Project mat pour. The August 19, 2017 Vulcan Project mat pour was cancelled. 19 3.52 Scheduling of the Vulcan Project mat pour for August 19, 2017, (which ultimately failed to occur) resulted in Glacier being contractually responsible to GLY for approximately $100,000 in out-of-pocket expenses/damages as a direct and proximate result of the Union and its agent Hicks' false, fraudulent and material representations to Herb on August 18, 2017. 3.53 The Union and its agent Hicks' false, fraudulent and material representations to Herb on August 18, 2017, directly and proximately caused Glacier to suffer additional damages, lost profits and unanticipated costs due to the scheduling of the Vulcan Project mat pour fo r August 19, 2017, in an amount, scope and extent not fully known and subject to proof at trial. The Union is liable for these damages. IV.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (August 11, 2017 Intentional Interference with Glacier's Performance) 4.8 Glacier realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 4.7 above as though fully set forth herein. 21 4.9 On August 11, 2017, Glacier had valid contracts, agreements and business relationships with its concrete customers. 4.10 The Union and some or all of its officers, employees and members knew, or reasonably should have known, of the existe nce of those contracts, agreements and business relationships. 4.11 The August 11, 2017 sabotage, ruination and destruction of Glacier's concrete wrongfully, unlawfully, willfully, intentionally and maliciously interfered with Glacier's performance of Glacier's contracts, agreements and business relationships by preventing Glacier's performance and causing Glacier's performance to be more expensive or burdensome. 4.12 The wrongful interference with Glacier's performance of its contract, agreements and business relationships was intentional and done with an improper purpose and by an improper means to harm Glacier. 4.13 The Union, with knowledge of the conditions, intended that wrongful interference and its consequences. 4.14 The wrongful interference directly and proximately caused Glacier to suffer damages in an amount, scope and extent not fully known and subject to proof at trial, including but not limited to Glacier being deprived of the possession or use of the batched concrete, damage to the lost concrete, associated cleanup costs and expenses, other consequential costs and expenses, back charges, lost profits and other damages. 22 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (In the Alternative - August 11, 2017 Civil Conspiracy) 4.15 Glacier realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 4.14 above as though fully set forth herein. 4.16 The Union and some or all of its officials, employees and members combined to accomplish the wrongful and unlawful purpose of sabotaging, ruining and destroying Glacier's batched concrete on August 11, 2017, and to thereby interfere with Glacier's performance of its contracts, agreements and/or business relationships on August 11, 2017. 4.17 The Union and some or all of its officials, employees and members engaged in that combination to accomplish an unlawful purpose or to act by unlawful means. 4.18 That wrongful conduct directly and proximately caused Glacier to suffer damages in an amount, scope and extent not fully known and subject to proof at trial, including but not limited to Glacier being deprived of the possession or use of the batched concrete, damage to the lost concrete, associated cleanup costs and expenses, other consequential costs and expenses, back charges, lost profits and other damages. FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION (August 18, 2017 - Fraudulent Misrepresentation and Concealment) 4.19 Glacier realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in 23 Paragraphs 1 through 4.18 above as though fully set forth herein. 4.20 On August 18, 2017, the Union and its agent Hicks represented that the Glacier Drivers intended to and would respond to wo rk the August 19, 2017 mat pour, and that the Union had instructed the Glacier Drivers to respond to Glacier Dispatch. 4.21 The Union and its agent Hicks' August 18, 2017 representations were material to the scheduling and conducting of the Vulcan Project mat pour. 4.22 The Union and its agent Hicks' August 18, 2017 representations were false and fraudulent. 4.23 The Union and its agent Hicks intended that the August 18, 2017 false, fraudulent and material representations be acted upon by GLY and Glacier with the improper purpose to harm Glacier. 4.24 GLY and Glacier were ignorant of the falsity of the Union and its agent Hicks' August 18, 2017 false, fraudulent and mate rial representations, and the Union and its agent Hicks concealed and did not disclose or otherwise make known the truth. 4.25 In scheduling the Vulcan Project mat pour for August 19, 2017, GLY and Gl acier relied upon the Union and its agent Hicks' August 18, 2017 false, fraudulent and material representations. 4.26 GLY and Glacier had a right to rely upon the truth of the Union and its agent Hicks' August 18, 2017 representations when scheduling the Vulcan Project mat pour for August 19, 2017. 4.27 The Union and its agent Hicks' false, fraudulent and material representations to Herb on August 18, 2017, directly and proximately caused 24 Glacier to suffer damage s in an amount, scope and extent not fully known and subject to proof at trial, including but not limited to Glacier being contractually responsible to GLY for approximately $100,000 in out-of-pocket expenses/damages, other consequential costs and ex penses, lost profits and other damages. FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION (August 18, 2017 - Negligent Misrepresentation) 4.28 Glacier realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 4.27 above as though fully set forth herein. 4.29 On August 18, 2017, the Union and its agent Hicks supplied information for GLY and Glacier in their Vulcan Project business transaction that was false or misleading. 4.30 The Union and its agen t Hicks knew or should have known the information was supplied to guide GLY and Glacier in that Vulcan Project business transaction. 4.31 The Union and its agent Hicks were negligent in communicating the false information. 4.32 When scheduling the Vulcan Project mat pour for August 19, 2017, GLY and Glacier relied upon that false information communicated by the Union and its agent Hicks. 4.33 GLY and Glacier's reliance on that false information was reasonable. 4.34 The Union and its ag ent Hicks' supplying of that false information on August 18, 2017, directly 25 and proximately caused Glacier to suffer damages in an amount, scope and extent not fully known and subject to proof at trial, in cluding but not limited to Glacier being contractually responsible to GLY for approximately $100,000 in out-of-pocket expenses/damages, other consequential costs and expenses, lost profits and other damages. SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION (August 18, 2017 - Intentional Interference with Glacier's Performance) 4.35 Glacier realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 4.34 above as though fully set forth herein. 4.36 On August 18 and 19, 2017, Glacier had a valid contract, agreement and business relationship with GLY. 4.37 The Union and its agent Hicks knew, or reasonably should have known, of the existence of that contract, agreement and business relationship between Glacier and GLY. 4.38 By making the August 18, 2017 false, fraudulent and material representations, the Union and its agent Hicks wrongfully interfered with Glacier's performance of its contract, agreement and business relationship with GLY by preventing Glacier's performance and causing Glacier's performance to be more expensive or burdensome. 4.39 The Union and its agent Hicks' wrongful interference with Glacier's performance of its contract, agreement and business relationship with 26 GLY was intentional and done with an improper purpose and by improper means to harm Glacier. 4.40 The Union and its agent Hicks' wrongful interference directly and proximately caused Glacier to suffer damages in an amount, scope and extent not fully known and subject to proof at trial, including but not limited to Glacier being contractually responsible to GLY for approximately $100,000 in out-of-pocket expenses/damages, other consequential costs and expenses, lost profits and other damages. V.

DATED at Seattle, Washing ton, this 4th day of December, 2017. DAVIS GRIMM PAYNE & MARRA Fifth Avenue, Suite 4040 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 447-0182 Attorneys for Plaintiff 28 HONORABLE JOHN ERLICK Noted for Hearing with Oral Argument February 9, 2018, at 10:15 a.m. IN THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE STATE OF WASHINGTON FOR KING COUNTY GLACIER NORTHWEST, INC., d/b/a CalPortland, Plaintiff, v. INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 174, Defendant. Case No. 17-2-31194-4 KNT PLAINTIFF'S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO CR12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) I. INTRODUCTION The Union obfuscates the Federal labor preemption doctrines to attempt to avoid clear lability for its tortious conduct under state law. The Union fails to address the actual conduct that forms the basis of Glacier's state law Complaint. Glacier alleges two acts of tortious conduct under state law: (1) the Union's intentional destruct ion of Glacier's property, and (2) the Union's false representations to GLY inducing the scheduling of the mat pour. Glacier's causes of action are premised entirely upon those two acts of tortious conduct. Glacier seeks damages that flow only from those two ac ts of tortious conduct. Amalgamated Ass'n of St., Elec. Ry. & Motor Coach Emp. of Am. v. Lockridge , 403 U.S. 274, 292 (1971) (it 29 is the conduct being regulated that must be the focus of the preemption analysis). The Union must affirmatively prove that intentional destruction of property and fraudulently inducing a mat pour are arguably subject to the National Labor Relations Act (the \"Act\"). Longshoremen's Ass'n, AFL-CIO v. Davis , 476 U.S. 380, 394-395 (1986). To carry this burden, the Union must show the state law claim prohibits the identical Union conduct that is arguably prohibited by the Act. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Carpenters, 436 U.S. 180, 196-197 (1978); Belknap, Inc. v. Hale, 463 U.S. 491, 510 (1983). Or, alternatively, the Union must make a strong showing that its co nduct is arguably protected by the Act and the injured party ( i.e., Glacier) has a means of bringing the dispute before the National Labor Relations Board (the \"Board\"). Davis, 476 U.S. at 393, n.10; Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, (Golden State II) , 493 U.S. 103, 110 n.7 (1989); Sears, 436 U.S. at 202-203 (t here is insufficient justification for preempting state jurisdiction over arguably protected conduct where the injured party has no acceptable means of bringing the issue to the Board). The fallacy of the Union's argument is that the Union ignores clear precedent establishing that intentional destruction of Glacier's property is not arguably protected under Section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. The Union completely fails to prove to the Court that Glacier has the legal means to bring such a dispute before the Board. Unsurprisingly, intentional destruction of property is not protected strike activity under Section 7 of the Act. Likewise, there is no Board charge that Glacier could file to 30 resolve the Union's intentional destruction of Glacier's property. When a strike is timed to cause perishable concrete to be destroyed in ready-mix trucks resulting in financial harm to an employer, the conduct is an intentional tort that is not preempted by the Act. Rockford Redi-Mix, Inc. v. Teamsters Local 325, Gen. Chauffeurs, Helpers & Sales Drivers of Rockford, 551 N.E.2d 1333, 1337-1340 appeal denied 561 N.E.2d 707 (1990). Causing concrete to be destroyed in ready- mix trucks while the concrete is being delivered is not protected activity under the Act. NLRB v. Marsden , 701 F.2d 238, 242 n.4 (2nd Cir. 1983) (Concrete cannot be \"saved for another day or simply left to harden. Once poured, it must be finished.\"). Sabotage, intentional conversion, or despoiling of an employer's property during a strike are unlawful acts that are not protected by Section 7 of the Act. NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp. , 306 U.S. 240, 253 (1939). Deliberately timing a stri ke with the purpose of causing maximum damage and financial loss to an employer's property is unprotected activity condemned by the Supreme Court. NLRB v. Marshall Car Wheel & F. Co. , 218 F.2d 409, 413 (5th Cir. 1955). The Union's intentional destruction of Glacier's property is not protected by the Act. Glacier has no means of bringing the dispute against the Union before the Board. Instead, Glacier must resort to state court to recover damages for the Union's intentional destruction of Glacier's property. Fansteel , 306 U.S. at 253-254. An employer has the right to discharge the participating employees and the right to \"resort to the state court to recover damages.\" Id. (emphasis added). Recovery must occur in state 31 court because Congress did not supplant traditional state court procedure for c ollecting damages caused by tortious conduct. United Constr. Workers v. Laburnum Constr. Corp. , 347 U.S. 656, 663-669 (1954). To conclude otherwise would mean a union \"may destroy property without liability for the damage done.\" Id. at 669. The Board itself directs that claims for intentional damage to employer property be brought in state court. A state court, not a Board proceeding, is the proper tribunal for an award to an e mployer for damage to property caused by a union. Local 30, United Slate, Tile & Composition Roofers, Damp & Waterproof Workers Ass'n, AFL-CIO, (\" Associated Builders\") Center , 312 NLRB 90, 102 (1993). As for the GLY counts, the Union manufactures allegations of bad faith bargaining that appear nowhere in the Complaint. The Union's motion creates false allegations, such as: \"in order to induce Glacier to enter into a succe ssor contract, [the Union] falsely represented (to Glacier directly and to Glacier through one of its customer s, GLY) that the strike would end if it did so.\" (U nion Brf., p.2). There is no such allegation in Glacier's Complaint. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.32-3.53. Based upon these nonexistent allegations, the Union contends that its false representations to GLY to induce the scheduling of the mat pour are arguably prohibited bad faith bargaining under Section 8(b)(3) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(3). Glacier's Complaint does not allege bad faith bargaining. There is no such allegation in the 32 Complaint. The Union's false representation was made to GLY\u2014not Glacier. Procedurally, the only type of Board charge that could even conceivably be brought before the Board in connection with the Union's tortious state law conduct alleged in the Complaint, wo uld be what is commonly referred to as a \" Bill Johnson's \" charge alleging objectively baseless and retaliatory litigation. BE&K Const. Co. v. NLRB , 536 U.S. 516, 529-537 (2002). To bring this type of charge, the Union would have to frivolously claim that Glacier's state law litigation before this Court is itself objectively baseless and retaliatory. Id. A Bill Johnson's charge does not bar the instant lawsuit. In fact, the Board holds such charges in abeyance pending the conclusion of the state court lawsuit, Beverly Health & Rehabilitation Services, Inc. , 331 NLRB 960, 961 (2000), because the plaintiff has a First Amendment right to have state law questions decided by the state court judicial system. Id. II. STATEMENT OF THE FACTS While damages to Glacier's business from the Union's protected strike activity are not recoverable, Glacier does not seek any such damages. Glacier's Complaint requests relief for two acts of tortious conduct under state law: (1) the Union's intentional destruction of Glacier's property, and (2) the Union's false representations to GLY inducing the scheduling of the mat pour. Glacier's causes of action are premised entirely upon those two acts of tortious conduct. Complaint \u00b6 2.2. Glacier seeks damages that flow only from those tw o acts of tortious conduct. 33 Glacier's Complaint is summarized below. The Union must be held accountable for its tortious acts. 1. The August 11, 2017 destruction of Glacier's property. The Union intentionally created a crisis placing Glacier's plant, equipment and product at immediate risk of harm. If batched concrete is not timely delivered to a Glacier cust omer, it is substantially certain to harden. This places Glacier's plant, equipment and product at immediate risk of harm. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.3-3.10. The Union was aware of the nature of Glacier's batched concrete and Glacier's customer delivery operations on August 11, 2017. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.10-3.11. With the intent to cause Glacier financial harm, the Union initiated a scheme to sabotage Glacier's batched concrete. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.13-3.15. The Union carried out that scheme, placing Glacier's plant, equipment and product at immediate risk of harm. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.16-3.23. Glacier attempted to mitigate the emergency and was able to prevent damage to the plant, equipment and waste water system. But the batched concrete was destroyed. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.16-3.27. The Union's conduct caused Glacier damages. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.27- 3.31. By destroying Glacier's concrete, the Union interfered with Glacier's August 11, 2017 performance of Glacier's contracts by causing Glacier's performance to be more expensive or burdensome. Complaint \u00b6 3.28. The factual circumstances underlying Glacier's allegations were extensively investigated prior to the filing of Glacier's Complaint with the Court. By way 34 of example only,1 Business Agent Walker (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 1.6, 3.17) was observed physically making a slashing sign \"cut signal\" across his neck, signaling the beginning of the action to damage Glacier's property. Walker was a concrete ready-mix driver for many years at a Glacier competitor. Glacier Dispatch almost immediately instructe d Glacier Drivers of the obligation to finish a concrete pour that had been started. Upon information and belief, Glacier Drivers who were acting as Union Shop Stewards, Picket Captains, or in a similar ag ency role, stated \"return your vehicle to your domicile immediately.\" Other statements included \"I was t old to go park my truck,\" \"Leave the fucker running,\" \"We will not be dumping them or rinsing them out. Somebody else's problem,\" and \"Consequences are Consequences.\" Other Glacier Drivers simply laughed, abandoning their loaded ready-mix trucks and walking away with perishable concrete left in the drum. When Glacier responded to the emergency, there were ready-mix trucks loaded with concrete parked everywhere ( e.g., wash rack, under the batch plant, in the yard). 2. The Union's August 18-19, 2017 false representations to GLY inducing the scheduling of the mat pour. Contrary to the Union's invented allegation, Glacier has not alleged a claim about bargaining. Glacier has not alleged that the Union \"in order to induce Glacier to enter into a successor contract, falsely represented 1 A court may consider hypothetical facts supporting a plaintiff's claim in a motion to dismiss. Kinney v. Cook , 159 Wn.2d 837, 842 (2007). These facts are provided to assist the Court in understanding the allegation s in Glacier's Complaint. 35 (to Glacier directly and to Glacier through one of its customers, GLY) that the strike would end if it did so.\" (Union Brf., p.2). Glacier has no understanding as to why the Union has invented such an allegation. The allegations in the Complaint do not state what the Union claims the allegations state. On August 18, 2017, the Union, through its agent Hicks, made intentional and knowingly false representations to GLY, a Gl acier customer, to induce the scheduling of a mat pour for August 19, 2017. This caused financial harm to Glacier. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.32-3.48. The Union's false representations were not made to Glacier. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.40. The Union's false representations occurred after the ratification of a new labor agreement. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.39. The Union's representations were knowingly false. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.41-3.42. The Union's false representations were made to induce the scheduling of a complicated mat pour for August 19, 2017. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.43-3.46. The Union's false representations caused the scheduling of the mat pour for August 19, 2017. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.47-3.49. There were not enough Glacier drivers necessary to perform the mat pour. The mat pour was cancelled. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.50-3.51. The scheduling of the mat pour for August 19, 2017, directly and proximately caused Glacier damages. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3.50-3.53. Contrary to the Union' s manufactured allegation, Glacier's Complaint does not reference any conduct occurring during bargaining. By way of example only, 2 Ted Herb, CEO of GLY, is anticipated to testify 2 See footnote 1, supra . 36 to the facts as outlined in the Complaint. GLY is not a bargaining agent of Glacier. Presently, and for many years, four concrete companies\u2014Glacier, Cadman, Stoneway and Salmon Bay\u2014have engaged in coordinated bargaining. Upon completion of the bargaining, the four companies enter into separate and nearly identical labor agreements with the Union. GLY is not involved in th is bargaining. GLY is a contractor. First Cause of Action: Conversion, trespass to chattels and equitable restitution. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 4.1- 4.7. The Court's inquiry is whether the Union intentionally caused destru ction of Glacier's batched concrete or caused it to be so materially altered in its physical condition as to change its character. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 226 (1965); Potter v. Washington State Patrol , 165 Wn.2d 67, 78 (2008). This is not protected activity under Section 7 of the Act. This state law claim is not identical to any prohibition under Section 8 of the Act. Third Cause of Action: In the Alternative\u2014 August 11, 2017 Civil Conspiracy. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 4.15- 4.18. This was pleaded in the alternative to the liability under common law agency principles. This cause of action is based on the unprotected intentional destruction of Glacier's property. The Court's inquiry is the same. This is no t protected activity under Section 7 of the Act. Th is state law claim is not identical to any prohibition under Section 8 of the Act. Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action: Fraudulent and Negligent Misrepresentation. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 4.19-4.34. The Court's inquiry is whether the Union intentionally or negligently made a misrepresentation 37 of fact, opinion, intention, or law to GLY to induce the scheduling of the mat pour on August 19, 2017. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 525 (1977); Restatement (First) of Torts \u00a7 870 (1939); Restatement (Second) of To rts \u00a7 552 (1977). This is not protected activity under Section 7 of the Act. This state law claim is not identical to any prohibition under Section 8 of the Act. Second and Sixth Causes of Action: Intentional Interference with Glacier's performance. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 4.8-4.14; 4.35-4.40. The Co urt's inquiry is whether the Union intentionally and improperly sabotaged, ruined and destroyed Glacier's batched concrete, and made the false representations to GLY inducing the scheduling of the mat pour, which caused Glacier's performance under its custom er contracts to be more expensive. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766A 3; Scymanski v. Dufault , 80 Wn.2d 77, 83 (1971) (en banc). This is not protected activity under Section 7 of the Act. This state law claim is not identical to any prohibition under Section 8 of the Act. The conduct\u2014destruction of property and fraudulent representations\u2014are the type of conduct left to the states to regulate. III. STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE Has the Union carried its burden to prove that state law claims of intentional destruction to property and fraudulent inducement of the scheduling of a mat pour are preempted by the Garmon or Machinists doctrines? 3 Glacier has not alleged a claim under Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766. The facts do not support such a claim. 38 IV. EVIDENCE RELIED UPON Glacier relies upon the actual allegations and claims set forth in its Complaint. V. AUTHORITY A motion to dismiss is granted sparingly. Kinney v. Cook , 159 Wn.2d 837, 842 (2007). \"Dismissal is warranted only if the court concludes, beyond a reasonable doubt, the plaintiff cannot prove 'any set of facts which would justify recovery.'\" Id. \"The court presumes all facts alleged in the plaintiff's complaint are true and may consider hypothetical facts supporting the plaintiff's claims.\" Id. The Union may not raise new issues in its reply brief. Cowiche Canyon Conservancy v. Bosley , 118 Wn.2d 801, 809 (1992) (en banc). 1. The State's interest in destruction of property and false representations. The state's interest \"is no less worthy of recognition\" simply because it does not concern protection from physical injury. Farmer v. United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners of Am., Local 25 , 430 U.S. 290, 291 (1977). The Union's suggestion to the Court that it must relinquish its jurisdiction over the Union's tortious conduct unless there is violence is not true. Whether by direct physical contact, or by act of sabotage such as placing nails in front of a truck's wheel, sand in the gas tank, or leaving equipment in a position where damage is imminent, the intentional destruction of property is actionable. \"Peaceful\" act is not the test. Destruction of property is clearly a matter left to the states. It is not preempted. Lodge 76, Int'l Ass'n of Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n (\"Machinists\"), 427 U.S. 132, 136 (1976). 39 Violence or \"peaceful\" act is not the test. Linn v. United Plant Guard Workers of Am., Local 114, 383 U.S. 53, 55 (1966) (claims for false and defamatory statements are not preempted); Farmer , 430 U.S. at 302 (intentional infliction of emotional distress claim not preempted despite that conduct was arguably prohibited by the Act); Sears, 436 U.S. at 205-208 (claim based upon peaceful trespassory picketing not preempted); Belknap , 463 U.S. at 509-512 (misrepresentation and breach of contract claims not preempted). The state \"surely has a substantial interest in protecting its citizens from misrepresentations that have caused them grievous harm....\" Belknap , 463 U.S. at 511; Carriers , 960 F.2d 1401, 1417 (9th Cir. 1991), as amended on denial of reh'g (May 4, 1992) (fraudulent representations were not \"arguably prohibited by the Act\" as bad faith bargaining). Federal labor law does not create an exemption from state law liability for misrepresentations or promises that are not specifically privileged as a matter of federal policy. Belknap , 463 U.S. at 512; F.2d 764, 770 (5th Cir. 1989). Glacier's state law claims based upon the Union initiating an intentional destruction of Glacier's property, and the Union's false representations inducing the scheduling of the mat pour, are clearly the type of tortious conduct the Supreme Court has left to the state. 40 2. What is the primary jurisdiction of the Board? The Board has primary jurisdiction over activities regulated by Sections 7 and 8 of the Act. Section 7 protects certain conduct of e mployees. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. Section 7 protects employee rights, not the rights of unions or employers. Id . Section 8 prohibits certain conduct of employers and labor organizations. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158. Section 8 provides a list of specific prohibitions against certain union and employer conduct. Id. A. The right to strike does not protect destruction of employer property. The Union falsely claims t hat its initiation of the destruction of Glacier's property is arguably protected by the Act. While certain ly Section 7 protects an employee's right to strike, the Act does not protect destruction of property. Machinists , 427 U.S. at 136. The right to strike under the Act does not protect the right to cause concrete to be intentionally destroyed, causing financial harm to an employer. Rockford Redi-Mix , 551 N.E.2d at 1337-1340. Such acts are destructive acts unprotected by the Act. Id.; Marsden , 701 F.2d at 242 n.4 (causing concrete to be destroyed in ready-mix trucks while the concrete is being delivered is a destructive act not protected by the right to strike under the Act). In conclusory fashion, the Union's brief repeatedly asserts that Glacier seeks damages for peaceful strike activity. This is patently false. State court damages for intentionally destroying batched concrete in ready- mix trucks are \"not awarded for striking or any other 'economic coercion,' but for the destruction of 41 property.\" Rockford Redi-Mix , 551 N.E.2d at 1338. This conduct is not protected and, therefore, not subject to being preempted by Federal labor preemption. Id. Where the object is protected, but the tactics used unlawful, the courts award damages for the losses directly resulting from the unlawful activity. Rainbow Tours, Inc. v. Hawaii Joint Council of Teamsters, 704 F.2d 1443, 1448 (9th Cir. 1983). The Union is completely wrong in claiming it has a protected right to intentionally cause destruction of Glacier's property during a strike. The Supreme Court has long held that sabotage, intentional conversion, or despoiling of an employer's property during a strike are unlawful acts that are not protected by Section 7 of the Act. Fansteel , 306 U.S. at 253; Southern S.S. Co. v. NLRB , 316 U.S. 31, 47 (1942) (while \"the absence of violence was a fortunate feature of the affair\" the danger to the employer's vessel was certainly present); Marshall Car Wheel , 218 F.2d at 413 (\"the union deliberately timed its strike without prior warnin g and with the purpose of causing maximum plant damage and financial loss to\" the employer); Marshall Car Wheel, 107 NLRB 314, 315 (1953) (right to strike under the Act does not include intentional act of sabotaging an employer's operation by timing a strike to place the plant, equipment and property at immediate risk of harm from the sudden cessation of work); In Re Int'l Protective Servs., Inc. , 339 NLRB 701, 702 (2003) (the right to strike does not protect unlawful conduct including the failure to pro tect the employer's plant, equipment or products from immediate danger and the test is not whether notice of the strike was or was not provided.) 42 Again, while the object may be lawful, the means were not. When a union intentionally damages the employer's property, the employer has its normal rights of redress against such unprotected acts, including the right to discharge employees and the right to \"resort to the state court to recover damages....\" Fansteel , 306 U.S. at 254 (emphas is added). Likewise, here, Glacier has the right to resort to this Court to recover damages for the Union's unlawful tortious means resulting in destruction of Glacier's property. There is no other remedy but this state court action. B. The prohibitions under the Act do not supplant traditional court lawsuits for damages caused by tortious conduct. The Union falsely claims that its fraudulent representations to GLY are pr ohibited by the Act. With respect to the prohibitions against labor organization conduct under the Act, the 1947 Labor Management Relations Act (\"LMRA\"), also known as the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 USC \u00a7\u00a7 141-197, modified the Act. The LMRA \"prescribed a new preventive procedure against unfair labor practices on the part of labor organizations....\" Laburnum Constr. Corp. , 347 U.S. at 666. This Co ngressional action was \"consistent with an increased insistence upon the liability of labor organizations for tortious conduct and inconsistent with their immunization from liability for damages caused by their tortious practices.\" Id. at 667. Congress did not supplant \"traditional state court procedure for collecting damages for injuries caused by tortious conduct.\" Id. at 663-664. To conclude otherwise would mean a union \"may destroy property without liability for the damage done.\" Id. at 669. 43 These new LMRA preventive procedures against labor organizations were set forth in the prohibitions of Section 8(b) of the Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158. These prohibitions are for the following types of union conduct: coercion of employ ees [8(b)(1)(A)], coercion of employees in their choice of representatives [8(b)(1)(B)], causing or attempting to cause an employer to discriminate ag ainst employees [8(b)(2)], collective bargaining (violation s) [8(b)(3)] and boycotts [(8(b)(4)], jurisdictional disputes 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158. As can be seen, Congress did not include union sabotage and destruction of employer property in these prohibitions. Congress did not include union false representations to induce harm in these prohibitions. When Congress has not prescribed a procedure for dealing with the consequences of tortious conduct, there is no basis for concluding that liabilities for tortious condu ct have been eliminated by the Act. Laburnum Constr. Corp. , 347 U.S. at 665. Thus, there is no federal preemption when, for example, there was no compensatory relief under the Act for the consequences of the tortious conduct. Int'l Ass 'n of Machinists v. Gonzales , 356 U.S. 617, 625, n.6 (1958) (the union's conduct did not violate Sections 8(b)(1) or 8(b)(2) of the Act, and the Board could not have provided the relief that was sought in the state court lawsuit). In the instant case, Glacier's Complaint falls squarely within the principle cited in Rainbow Tours , 704 F.2d 1443. \"[W] hen th e object of a union's 44 conduct is protected but the ta ctics used to attain that end are not, we believe the district court should award damages only for the losses directly resulting from the unlawful activity.\" Id. at 1448. Here, there is no compensatory relief under the Act for the Union's sabotage of Glacier's pro perty or for its false representations inducing the scheduling of the mat pour. Glacier's state law claims are not identical to any prohibition under Section 8 of the Act. C. The Board does not have authority to award damages for the Union's tortious conduct. Preempting Glacier's claim would prevent any remedy for the Union's intentional destruction of property. Sears, 436 U.S. at 206-207 (refusing to find preemption because preempting the employer's state law claim for peaceful trespassory picketing would \"deny the employer access to any forum in which to litigate\"). Congress did not give the Board the authority to award damages for state law tort conduct. The Act \"sets up no general compensatory procedure except in such minor supplementary ways as the reinstatement of wrongfully discharged employees with back pay.\" Laburnum Const. Corp. , 347 U.S. at 665. The \"one instance\" in which the Act prescribes judicial recovery of damages for unfair labor practices is for unlawful secondary boycotts under Section 8(b)(4), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4). Id. Here, there is no Section 8(b)(4) secondary boycott allegation in Glacier's Complaint. The Board itself recognizes the limits of its jurisdiction to remedy state law torts. The Board conclusively holds that it does not have jurisdiction to 45 award damages for tortious conduct. Associated Builders, 227 NLRB at 1444. Board precedent holds that a state court proceeding, not a Board proceeding, is the proper tribunal for an award to the employer for the damage to property caused by the union's tortious acts. Id. The Board's reasoning is that employers \"legally damaged by the tortious conduct of unions\" are better served pursuing private remedies before tribunals (i.e., the state courts) which have more experience and are better equipped than the Board to measure the impact of tortious conduct. Id. Even if Congress had created an unfair labor practice charge covering the Union's tortious conduct alleged in the Complaint, the Board would tell Glacier to proceed to state court to recover damages for the union's tortious conduct. The Board's holding in Associated Builders is the unwavering position of the Board. See BE&K Const . 316 NLRB at 1310 (destruction of employer property caused by union's violation Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act and employer's request for an award of property damages were denied because Board is not proper tribunal for damages caused by tortious conduct); J. J. Jordan Geriatric Center, 312 NLRB at 102 (destruction of employer property caused by union's violation of Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act and employer's request for an award of property damages from the Board denied because \"assessment of such damages to automobiles and other property is a matter which can be handled more efficiently and effectively by state courts\"). 3. Garmon Preemption Rather than recognize this Court's primary jurisdiction to remedy tortious damage to property 46 and false representations, the Union demands the Court surrender its jurisdiction under Garmon preemption. The Supreme Court announced the \"Garmon \" preemption doctrine in San Diego Bldg. Trades Council, Millmen's Union, Local 2020 v. Garmon , 359 U.S. 236 (1959), which was subsequently refined by the Supreme Court in Sears, 436 U.S. 180. Sun Carriers , 960 F.2d at 1413-14 ( Sears refined the Garmon analysis).4 Under its present formulation, Garmon preempts state court jurisdiction only if the state law prohibits the identical conduct that is arguably prohibited by the Act, Sears, 436 U.S. at 190-198; Belknap , 463 U.S. at 510, or if the conduct is arguably protected under the Act and the injured party has a means of bringing the dispute before the Board, Sears, 436 U.S. at 199- 207; Belknap , 463 U.S. at 510; Davis , 476 U.S. at 393 n.10; see also Golden State II, 493 U.S. at 110 n.7 (providing concise statement of Supreme Court's current formulation of the Garmon preemption doctrine). The \"arguably prohibited\" and \"arguably protected\" questions must be analyzed separately because they raise different legal considerations. Sears , 436 U.S. at 190. The Supreme Court in Sears recognized an additional consideration necessary to conclude that conduct is arguably protected under Section 7 of the Act. This additional consideration requires that the injured party ( i.e. Glacier) have a means of bringing the dispute before the Board. Davis , 476 U.S. at 393, n.10; Golden State II, 493 U.S. at 110 n.7; Sears , 436 4 The Union omits the Supreme Court's Sears decision in its briefing to the Court. 47 U.S. at 202-203 (there is insufficient justification for preempting state jurisdiction over arguably protected conduct where the injured party has no acceptable means of bringing the issue to the Board). After this inquiry, if the Union's conduct alleged in the state court action is determined to be arguably protected or prohibited by the Act such that Garmon preemption applies, the conduct may still survive Garmon preemption under the exceptions for conduct that touches interests deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility. Belknap , 463 U.S. at 498 (citing Sears, 436 U.S. at 200). A. The \"arguably protected\" question and the Union's destruction of property. There is a case directly on point. In Rockford Redi- Mix, Inc. , an employer sued a union, its agents, and members, named and unnamed, for damages resulting from destruction to the employer's concrete trucks. 551 N.E.2d 1333. Pursuant to an instruction by a union representative, the Rockford Redi-Mix drivers reported to work, filled their mixer trucks with concrete, left the employer's facility, and waited for the union to meet with the employer to demand the employer sign a collective bargaining agreement. Id. The union met with the employer. Id. The employer refused to sign the agreement. Id. The union responded that \"a strike was in progress.\" Id. The union in Rockford claimed it instructed the drivers to make their deliveries to the jobsite. Id. After some effort to locate the customer, the drivers decided to leave the concre te trucks at the jobsite, with the ignitions off and drums stopped. Id. When the employer ( Rockford Redi-Mix ) located its mixer 48 trucks at the jobsite, the concrete had hardened in the trucks. Id. at 1336. The employer attempted to rotate the drums of the mixer trucks to mitigate the damage, causing the mixer trucks' hy draulic lines to blow. Id. All but one of the employe r's mixer trucks were taken out of operation, causing the employer to lose business. Id. The Rockford employer brought a state law intentional tort claim to recover the damages. Id. at 1337. The court ruled the claim for intentional damage to the employer's property was not preempted by Garmon. Id. at 1337-1338. The court reasoned that the damages in the case were not awarded for striking or for any other lawful economic coercion contemplated by the Act, but for destruction of property, which is not a protected activity subject to preemption by Federal labor law. Id. at 1339. The court reasoned that the Act did not protect the conduct of the strikers because the conduct was destructive and therefore unprotected by Section 7 of the Act. Id. The Rockford court reasoned that \"the tort claim entailed little risk of interference with the jurisdiction of the Board.\" Id. (quoting Sears, 436 U.S. at 196-197). As in Rockford , Glacier has not asserted tort claims that entail a risk of interference with the jurisdiction of the Board. The act of striking is not unlawful. The tactic of initiating the destruction of Glacier's property was tortious and unlawful. The Union asks the Court to conclude that its intentional destruction of Glacier's property is arguably protected strike activity under Section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. The Rockford court explained the difference, reasoning that in Machinists the Supreme Court held that peaceful refusals to work 49 are protected by federal law, but also held that destruction of property is most clearly a matter for the states. Id. at 1339 (citing Machinists , 427 U.S. at 136). Intentional torts are not preempted by Federal labor law. Id. at 1340. The Union makes the same misplaced argument as was rejected in Rockford . Glacier does not seek damages for strike activity. Glacier seeks damages for the initiation of destruction of property by the Union, which is a matter for the state court. Id. at 1338. The Union has not made a strong showing that the conduct outlined in Glacier's Complaint is arguably protected by the Act and that Glacier has a means of bringing the dispute before the Board. Sears, 436 U.S. at 199-208; Davis, 476 U.S. at 393, n.10 (1986); Golden State II , 493 U.S. at 110 n.7. Board precedent authoritatively holds that the Union's conduct was not protected activity under the Act. There is no question that Glacier has no means of bringing this dispute before the Board. The Union cites Brown v. Hotel & Rest. Employees & Bartenders Int'l Union Local 54 , 468 U.S. 491 (1984) (which involved a state casino legislation in New Jersey) to argue that the Union's sabotage and destruction of Glacier's property is arguably protected under Section 7 of the Act. (Union Brf., pp. 7-8 and 10). Brown provides no authority to conclude that destruction of property is protected by Section 7 of the Act. In fact, as has been shown, it is neither actually, nor even arguably, protected by Section 7 of the Act. The cases cited by the Union (Union Brf., p.10) do not involve the initiation of sabotage or destruction of property. The Union cites Garmon where the 50 employer's claim was for damages for peaceful picketing, not for destruction of property. 359 U.S. at 237. The claim in Garmon literally requested damages for peaceful picketing. Id. The Union cites Local 20, Teamsters, Chauffe urs & Helpers Union v. Morton where the employer sought damages in state court for peaceful secondary activities to induce customers to cease doing bus iness with the employer, which is regulated under Secti on 8(b)(4) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4). 377 U.S. 252, 253 (1964). Glacier has not alleged a claim based upon secondary activities. The Union cites Kaufman v. Allied Pilots Ass'n , where airline passengers brought state law claims against a union for conducting a sick-out, not for intentional destruction of property. 274 F.3d 197, 200 (5th Cir. 2001). Glacier has not alleged a claim requesting damages for a sick-out. Instead of addressing the initiation of tortious sabotage and destruction of property alleged in the Complaint, the Union lists immaterial cases about strikes, lockouts, sick-outs or picketing. See, e.g Inc. , 673 N.E.2d 1053, 1055-1056 (1996) (a cemetery customer brought action against cemetery during a gravediggers strike because the customer was unable to bury her mother due to the employer lockout, not for tortious destruction of property); and Mobile Mech. Contractors Ass 'n, Inc. v. Carlough, 664 F.2d 481, 483 (5th Cir. 1981) (employer association sued unions to enjoin an unlawful strike under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(e), which relief was granted, and subsequently requested damages under state law caus ed by that peaceful but unlawful strike). None of these cases have anything 51 to do with the initiation of sabotage or intentional destruction of property. The Union cites to employee discharge cases under Board law. (Union Brf. pp. 14-15). Discharge cases are most certainly a subject for regulation by the Board. Glacier has not a lleged an employee discharge cause of action in its Complaint. Glacier could not bring an employee discharge case before the Board to remedy the damage to Glacier's property. The state law in Glacier's Complaint is different than any discharge prohibitions under the Act. The inquiries are different. The Union's unsupported assertion that its initiation of destruction of Glacier's property was protected under the Act is legally insufficient. The Court does not credit any argument by the Union. Instead, the Court must assess the strength of the argument that Section 7 does in fact protect the disputed conduct. Sears, 436 U.S. at 205. The state court is fully permitted as part of its preemption analysis \"to evaluate the merits of an argument that certain activity is protected\" or prohibited by the Act, and such evaluation by the state court \"does not create an unacceptable risk of interference\" with Board jurisdiction. Id. at 204-206 (analyzing Board precedent with respect to peaceful trespassory picketing in preemption analysis); Linn, 383 U.S. at 60-61 (analyzing Board precedent with respect to libel and defamation in preemption analysis). The discharge cases cited by the Union support Glacier's position. See, e.g. , Columbia Portland Cement Co. v. NLRB , 915 F.2d 257 -58 (6th Cir. 1990), supplemented , 919 F.2d 140 (6th Cir. 1990) (the 52 Act does not protect abandonment of jobs if it poses a foreseeable risk of damage to the employer's plant because the Act does not protect striking employees who commit acts of vanda lism or sabotage against their employer); Fishman & Sons, Inc. , 122 NLRB 1436, 1447 (1959) (the Board and courts hold that intentionally timing a strike to cause damage to the employer's property is not protected activity). The Union's case Oklahoma Milk Producers, 125 NLRB 419, 435 (1959) further il lustrates the issue for the Court. In Oklahoma Milk Producers , the Board found the perishable nature of milk created no unusual circumstances that might cause loss to be sustained, and the employ er was able to promptly take action to get the milk to market. Id. at 415. Glacier's Complaint does not allege that employees engaged in harmless actions posing no immediate risk of harm. In footnote 10, the Board in Oklahoma Milk Producers specifically distinguished the harmless milk circumstance from the circumstance of immediate harm in Marshall Car Wheel , where the Board's precedent provides that the right to strike under the Act does not include sabotaging an employer's operations by timing the strike to place the plant, equipment and property at immediate risk of harm as foreseeably would result from the sudden cessation of work. 107 NLRB at 319. Oklahoma Milk Producers does not involve the intentional tort of destruction of property. Contrary to the Union's assertion, deliberately timing a strike with the purpose of causing damage and financial loss to an employer is unprotected activity condemned by the Supreme Court. Marshall Car Wheel , 218 F.2d at 413 (citing Fansteel , NLRB at 315; Boghosian Raisin Packing, 342 NLRB 393, 396 (2004) (\"there can be little question the product damage was intentional\" and \"[n]ecessarily a strike will cause some economic loss to an employer,\" but in tentional damage to the employer's product \"goes be yond such loss and where strikers deliberately time their strike to cause product damage, then their activity is unprotected....\"); Int'l Protective Servs., 136; , 306 U.S. at 253. As shown, the Union's claim that its initiation of sabotage and destruction of Glacier's property is protected strike activity has been authoritatively rejected by the Supreme Court and the Board. A \"party asserting preemption must advance an interpretation of the Act that is not plainly contrary to its language and that has not been 'authoritatively rejected' by the courts or the Board.\" Davis , 476 U.S. at 395; Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , 190 Wn.App. at 21 (citing Davis , 476 U.S. at 397). The precondition for preemption, \"that the conduct be 'arguably' protected or prohibited, is not without substance.\" Davis , 476 U.S. at 394. The party asserting preemption \"must make an affirmative showing that the activity is arguably subject to the Act.\" Id. at 394-399. The Union has failed to make any such affirmative showing. Likewise, there exists no means by which Glacier could bring this dispute before the Board. Glacier's claims, based upon the Union's intentional destruction of Glacier's property, are not preempted under Garmon . 54 B. The \"arguably prohibited\" question and the Union's false representation. The Union has likewise failed to establish that the Court's inquiry with respect to the Union's false representation to GLY to induce the scheduling of the mat pour is identical to any prohibition under the Act. Throughout, the Union completely misrepresents Glacier's Complaint. The Complaint makes no allegation of statements made to Glacier relating to bargaining. Nor does the Complaint cover any of the alleged factual circumstances the Union invented and then analyzed in its Brie f. (Union Brf., pp. 18-21). The Act does not regulate the alleged false representations the Union made to GLY. The Union is not the authorized representative of GLY's employees. GLY is not a bargaining agent for Glacier. \"A union cannot compel an employer to bargain for employees the union does not represent.\" Operating Eng'rs Pension Tr. v. Wilson , 915 F.2d 535, 540 (9th Cir. 1990) (state law tortious misrepresentation claim against union was not preempted because union did not have a bargaining relationship with the entity to whom it made the misrepresentation and was thus not engaged in bargaining); Nw. Ohio Adm'rs, Inc. v. Walcher & Fox, Inc. , 270 F.3d 1018, 1028 (6th Cir. 2001) (state law tortious misrepresentation claim against union is not preempted because union did not have a bargaining relationship with the entity to whom it made the misrepresentation and was thus not engaged in collective bargaining). Glacier's Complaint does not allege any discussions or conduct occurring during collective bargaining. State law tort claims of fraudulent inducement or 55 false representations cannot be bad faith bargaining when they occur outside the collective bargaining process. Sun Carriers , 960 F.2d at 1416 (claims of fraud and misrepresentation were not preempted under Garmon as bad faith bargaining because nowhere do the claims assert that the lies occurred during the collective bargaining or negotiations); Wells v. Gen. Motors Corp., 881 F.2d 166, 171 (5th Cir. 1989) (the parties had completed collective bargaining and the alleged fraudulent inducements had no bearing on the collective bargaining process and were not offered to obtain ratification of an agreement); Voilas v. Gen. Motors Corp. , 170 F.3d 367, 380 (3rd Cir. 1999) (state law fraud claims are not preempted by Garmon as bad faith bargaining when they are made independent of the bargaining process); Hernandez v. Creative Concepts, Inc. , 862 F.Supp.2d 1073, 1088 (D. Nev. 2012) (state law fraud ulent misrepresentation claims are not preempted by Garmon as bad faith bargaining where they occurred outside the completed collective bargaining process). Glacier's Complaint does not allege bargaining conduct. Glacier's Complaint does not contain the factual allegations the Union analyzes in its arguments about the Union's false representations to GLY. The Union has failed to affirmatively prove that fraudulent misrepresentation in the circumstance described in Glacier's Complaint is identical to conduct that is arguably prohibited by the Act. Sears , 436 U.S. at 193-198; Belknap , 463 U.S. at 510. The claim is not preempted. 56 C. Tortious interference with Glacier's performance. The Union spends significant briefing focused on Glacier's tortious interference claims despite that they are based on the same unprotected conduct as the other claims\u2014intentional destruction of Glacier's property and fraudulent inducement of the mat pour. While certainly claims for tortious interference with contract are often preempted by Garmon , preemption occurs frequently because su ch claims involve conduct that is also prohibited by the Act. Glacier's claim does not involve any such prohibi ted conduct under the Act. For a common-law tort action for interference with a contract to be preempted by the Act, it must be founded on conduct that is arguably within the ambit of \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8. Local 926, Int'l Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO v. Jones , 460 U.S. 669, 677 (1983). The Act contains no express preemption provision. Bldg. & Const. Trades Counc il of Metro. Dist. v. Associated Builders & Contractors of Massachusetts/Rhode Island, Inc. , 507 U.S. 218, 224 (1993). The Supreme Court is reluctant to infer preemption. Id . \"Consideration under the Supremacy Clause starts with the basic assumption that Congress did not intend to displace state law.\" Id. Due only to the destruction of property on August 11, 2017, and the scheduling of the mat pour for August 19, 2017, Glacier alleges interference with Glacier's own performance of its customer contracts, which caused Glacier's own performance to be more expensive under Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766A. Glacier has not alleged a claim under Restatement Second of Torts \u00a7 766, which involves 57 interfering with the performance of a contract between another ( i.e., Glacier) and a third person ( i.e., Glacier customers) to induce or cause the third person (i.e., Glacier customers) to not perform the contract (i.e., cease doing business with Glacier). In contrast to Restatement \u00a7 766A, Restatement \u00a7 766 claims are Section 8( b)(4) secondary boycott type claims (if a union and employer are involved). See Retail Prop. Tr. v. United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners of Am. , 768 F.3d 938, 943 (9th Cir. 2014) (describing secondary boycott claims). These Restatement \u00a7 766 / Section 8(b)(4) type state law tortious interference claims are frequently preempted unless the union coercion involved violence. Id. at 955-66 (citing Morton , 377 U.S. at 260-61). The cases cited by the Union in its brief (Union Brf., pp. 11-12) are these types of tortious interference claims. These are the cases the Union cite s to the Court when it claims \"violence\" is required to avoid preemption. The Union seems to argue that if there is no violence, they are home free. Such is not the law. Glacier's tortious interference claims are different. Glacier's tortious interference claims involve Union interference with Glacier's own performance due to the initiation of property damage and the misrepresentation to GLY. Th is type of claim does not raise any arguable protection or prohibition under the Act. The Act's \"secondary boycott activity\" applies to Union conduct towards a neutral employer, not conduct towards a primary em ployer such as Glacier. NLRB v. International Rice Milling Co. , 341 U.S. 665, 672-674 (1951) (the applicable proscriptions of Section 8(b)(4) are limited); Local 1976, United Bhd. Of Carpenters and Joiners of Am., AFL-CIO v. NLRB , 58 537 U.S. 93, 98 (1958) (no sw eeping prohibition was intended by Section 8(b)(4), it does not speak generally of secondary activity, and instead describes and condemns specific union conducted directed to specific objects.) We start with the basic assumption that Congress did not intend to displace state law. Glacier's Restatement \u00a7 766A tortious interference claims are premised upon interference with Glacier's own performance, not arguable secondary boycott activity. Glacier's \u00a7 766A claims do not involve conduct arguably protected or prohibite d by the Act. Glacier's intentional interference claims are even further removed from the ambit of the Act because both of Glacier's tortious interference claims are based entirely upon conduct that is not within the protection of the Act. These claims are traditionally left to the states to regulate\u2014destruction of property and false representations. The Union has failed to identify any arguable prohibition under the Act. As the Act is not implicated, one does not even get to the violence exception to preemption. Glacier's state law tortious interference claims entail little risk of interference with the jurisdiction of the Board. Sears , 436 U.S. at 196-197. The claims of intentional interference with Glacier's performance are not preempted. Glacier does not have to show violence. Violence is an exception to claims that ar e within the Act's arguable protections or prohibitions such as secondary boycott claims. Glacier's claims are not within the arguable protections or prohibitions of the Act. There is no conflict with the Act. 59 D. The exceptions to preemption would apply even if the Union established any conduct that was arguably protected or prohibited under the Act. Conduct that touches interests deeply rooted in local feeling and responsib ility is not preempted. Belknap , 463 U.S. at 498 (citing Sears, 436 U.S. at 200). Intentional destruction of property is most clearly a matter left to the st ate and is not preempted. Machinists , 427 U.S. at 136. The state has \"a substantial interest in protecting its citizens from misrepresentations that hav e caused them grievous harm...\" Belknap , 463 U.S. at 492 (1983) (misrepresentation claim not preempted). Any possible connection between Glacier's Complaint and conduct arguably protected or prohibited under the Act would be so remote and peripheral to the Act that the local interest exception to preemption would readily apply. Likewise, preemption is inappropriate because Glacier does not have a means of bringing the dispute before the Board. Davis , 476 U.S. at 393, n.10; Golden State II, 493 U.S. at 110 n.7; Sears , 436 U.S. at 202-203 (there is insufficient justification for preempting state jurisdiction over arguably protected conduct where the injured party has no a cceptable means of bringing the protection issue to the Board). 4. Machinists preemption. Machinists preemption precludes both state law and Board interference in conduct that Congress intended to be unregulated and left to the free play of economic forces. Machinists , 427 U.S. at 140; Belknap , 463 U.S. at 499-500. Machinists preemption forbids 60 both the states and the Boa rd from regulating certain conduct. Retail Prop. Tr. , 768 F.3d at 951. For example, a union strike that drains an employer of its profits is fair game. Similarly, an employer lockout can seriously impact a union. Machinists preemption does not apply to Glacier's claims. For Machinists preemption to apply, one would have to reach the preposterous conclusion that Congress intended to allow the parties to a labor dispute to intentionally destroy one another's property and to engage in fraudulent misrepresentation without any regulation. Damage to property is a matter most clearly left to the state to regulate. Machinists , 427 U.S. at 136. Likewise, federal labor law does not create an exemption from state law liability for misre presentations or promises that are not specifically privileged as a matter of federal policy. Belknap , 463 U.S. at 1417; Windfield , 890 F.2d at 770. VI. CONCLUSION The Union has not affirmatively proved that the allegations set forth in Glacier's Complaint are arguably protected or prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act or that Glacier has a means to bring this dispute before the National Labor Relations Board. The claims are not preempted by Federal labor law preemption. The Union's motion to dismiss must be denied.

I am currently employed as Ready-Mix Concrete Manager \u2014 Washington Division \u2014 at Glacier Northwest (\"Glacier\" or \"Employer\"). I have been employed in this capa city since Se ptember 2016. I report to Melanie O'Regan, whose job title is Vice President/General Manager. I have been working in the ready-mix concrete business since 2001. I am responsible for all of Glacier's ready-mix operations throughout the State of Washington. This includes approximately 215 employees. Among the groups of employees who are under my jurisdiction are our Seattle, Kenmore, and Snoqualmie operations. The ready-mix drivers at these locations are represented by Teamsters Local 174. We have 80-90 drivers covered by our contract with Teamsters Local 174. 2. 1 was working at the Duwamish facility on August 11, 2017, when the strike with Teamsters Local 174 began. It starte d at 7:00 a.m. We had absolutely no advanced notice that the employees 72 were going to strike. Three Teamsters representatives appeared jus t before 7:00 a.m. (Hicks, Walker, and Carl Gasca). Then, our drivers began walking away from their assigned mixer trucks, leaving jobsites, turning aro und en route to jobsites, and began bringing their assigned mixer trucks back to the yard. Many of the mixer trucks that they brought back to the yard were loaded with 9-10 cubic yards of concrete. They were fully loaded. The concrete had not been delivered. 3. There were at least 16 drivers who came back with fully-loaded trucks. Th ey parked their trucks in our yard. 9 of those drive rs abandoned their trucks with no notice to anyone at Glacier. 7 of those drivers parked their truck, but did notify a Glacier representative of their actions and asked for instructions. Or, they took some action to protect their assigned mixer truck. At the time, the initial 16 warning letters were written by Glacier, I was not aware that 7 of those individuals had contacted a Glacier representative and asked for instructions or had taken other actions. 4. I was present in the yard when the loaded trucks came rolling back in on August 11. 9 drivers abandoned their trucks without notice. If we'd had notice, we could have asked them to add a retardant to their loads, or offload elsewhere, or park their trucks in a certain sequence for offloading. These are just a few examples of mitigating steps we could have taken. It was complete chaos. We had to offload the concrete from the barrels before it \"set up.\" We had to dispose of the concrete in a timely manner to avoid costly damage to the mixer trucks and in a manner so as not to create an environmental disaster. We had to 73 reorganize material stor age bunkers into which we offloaded the concrete. We had to deal with settling ponds, treatment of material and filter presses to handle hundreds of cubic yards of concrete. It took us 5 hours to properly handle and clean-up the mess created by the drivers. 5. I participated in the decision to write the original 16 warning letters for the August 11, 2017 conduct based on data collected by Dispatch and our dispatch system. The drivers came into our yard with full loads and abandoned their trucks without notice. This violated several of our Work Rules and Safety Rules, which are cited in our position statement. And, consequently, it was poor performance and gross misconduct that was the basis for those warning letters. The drivers deliberately put our business in imminent harm, and they knew it. 6. After the strike ended, our management team continued to investigate the events that transpired on August 11 and discovered t hat 7 of those drivers had, in fact, contacted Glacier and/or had taken appropriate steps to try to protect their assigned mixer trucks. So, I withdre w their warning letters. Those 7 drivers are Blame Elledge, Allen Marple, Jeff Harris, Rick LaVera, Bill Roark, Brian Wimmer, and Corwin Matwichuck. I withdrew their letters. 7. I participated in the decision to issue the 39 warning letters for the conduct that occurred on August 18, 2017. In that case, these 39 drivers had been contacted twice by Dispatch, on a phone number they provided as a contact, and given start times for the GLY mat pour to start at 1:30 a m. on August 19. The Dispatch team also put out a tape- recorded list 74 of start times for the drivers. This is a normal procedure. I personally spoke with 3 drivers on Friday, August 18, informing them of the planned pour; and only one of those drivers reported at his scheduled start time. These 39 drivers did not answer calls, or return calls, although we asked them to. They did not report for work. The huge GLY pour had to be cancelled. This pour was 5,200 yards to be delivered at a rate of 600 yards per hour. Our drivers must be available to work. They had been notified at least twice previously of this pour. They apparently chose not to work. I have read the foregoing 4 pages and declare under the penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington that the foreg oing is true and correct. Dated at Seattle, WA , this 12 day of October, 2017. (City) (State) 75 BEFORE REGION 19 NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD Glacier Northwest d/b/a CalPortland Company (\"Employer\") Case No. 19-CA-203068 and DECLARATION OF ADAM DOYLE General Teamsters Union Local No. 174 (\"Union\") I, Adam Doyle, being over the age of 18 and having personal knowledge of the same, declare as follows: 1. I am currently employed at Glacier Northwest (\"Glacier NW\") in the position of Dispatch Coordinator. I have been employed at Glacier NW in this capacity since December 18th, 2016. My duties include supervising our team of 10 dispatchers, whose job it is to schedule Glacier NW's ready-mix concrete mixer drivers and to give them direction on their job assignments and other instructions. 2. Our dispatchers are responsible for approximately 80 Teamsters Union Local No. 174 (\"Union\" or \"Local 174\") ready-mix drivers who report to our facilities in Snoqualmie, Kenmore, and Seattle, Washington. They set-up our telephone recording each day which tells each driver when to report for work the next day. They direct the drivers when to pull under the Batch Plants to be loaded with concrete, and they are responsible for communicating the delivery assignments and instructions, problem solving, and organizing the work flow. 3. Some of the communication between drivers and Dispatch is electronic over Company-issued hand-76 held devices called tablets. Much of the communications with drivers occur over the Company radio. Special instructions, such as accidents, jobsite issues, or traffic problems, are also handled between our drivers and dispatchers over the Company radio. 4. I was working on the morning of Friday, August 11, 2017. This is the day the Teamsters Local 174 strike began. We had our Local 174 drivers scheduled to begin work from 2:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. at staggered start times. The drivers d eliver anywhere from 3-6 loads of concrete per shift, depending upon work assignments, job flows, traffic, etc. After a driver delivers his load of concrete, he typically is dispatched to return to one of our batch plants to be batched with another load of concrete to be delivered, on a repeated basis throughout the day. Our drivers are not given their delivery assignments each day until they pull under the batch plant. That is because the work fluctuates greatly every day. We can't predict each driver's work day when it begins. For example, a driver might deliver a load of concrete to a school building, and his next load to a large downtown high rise, and then his third load to a housing development, etc. 5. On August 11, 2017, our Dispatchers learned shortly before 7:00 a.m. that the Union had called a strike. We had concrete mixer drivers on job sites delivering their loads of concrete. We had mixer drivers on the road fully-loaded. We had mixer drivers in the yard waiting to load. And, we had drivers in the yard fully-loaded and ready to leave. 77 I made the following announcement over the radio, on the Seattle channel, at the request of Melanie O'Regan: Hey, good morning, everybody. I've just been informed to advise you that we are obligated to finish any job that we have started. So, I am just putting that out as an FYI in a bulletin. 6. At 7:00 a.m., all of our drivers began pulling into the yard. Many had loa ds of concrete in their trucks. We also had a few calls from drivers after 7:00 a.m. asking for instructions as to what to do with their trucks because they were on a strike. Those calls and the responses were as follows: \"What do you want me to do with my truck? We are on strike.\" In some cases, we directed the driver to discharge his load into a bunker and wash-up. In other cases, we asked the driver to drive his truck to a certain area of the yard. 7. Normally, when a driver completes his concrete delivery, he returns to one of our yards. He offloads his leftover concrete into a reclaimer or into an ecology block form. He then rinses out his drum, and he gets back in line for his next loa d. The \"next load\" may be delivered to any one of dozens of active jobs on a given day. This is not what happe ned at 7:00 a.m. on August 11, 2017. 8. On August 11, 2017, the drivers brought all of their mixer trucks back to their yards, between 7:00 a.m. and 7:45 a.m. Many trucks contained partial or full loads of concrete. To the best of my knowledge, approximately 10 drivers abandoned their trucks in the yard without notice to anyone in management. With regard to the mixer trucks and their active loads of concrete, we had manag ement representatives and 78 maintenance personnel scrambling to deal with the problems that this created. Those problems included countless trucks parked by drivers with full or partial loads of concrete still in the barrel of the mixer. Concrete is a perishable commodity. There was an environment of chaos trying to determine which trucks contained how much concrete, and how much time was left before the concrete would begin to harden in the barrel of each truck. Also, I was later informed, this process included significant efforts to build bunkers to discharge the concrete into, to offload the concrete, and to clean-up the yard and the trucks. 9. With regard to the events of August 18, 2017, the following facts are relev ant. We had a mat pour (a large pour) scheduled for GLY Construction in Seattle on the previous Saturday, August 12, 2017. However, that mat pour was cancelled due to the Union's strike which began on August 11, 2017. 10. Consistent with our normal practice, we notified our drivers 1-3 weeks in advance of the originally scheduled August 12, 2017 mat pour. That notification was posted in the Drivers' Room. To the best of my knowledge we also notified some of the drivers via a message to their Company-issued tablets. We did this before the August 11, 2017 strike. When there is a mat pour, we generally will need most \u2014 if not all \u2014 of the drivers to work. When the Union struck on August 11, 2017, the August 12 mat pour was postponed. It was ultimately rescheduled for August 19, 2017. 11. On Friday, August 18, 2017, we learned at approximately 11:00 a.m. that the Teamsters Local 174 contract had been ratified. The strike was over. 79 GLY, our customer, wanted to go forward with the previously postponed mat pour. Thus, it was rescheduled to begin at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday, August 19, 2017. Therefore, our Di spatcher, Dirck Armitage, began calling the drivers in seniority order at approximately 12:30 p.m. His message to each driver was as follows: [Glacier NW] has been given notice the recent contract has been ratified. We are calling you to inform you of your start time for (time) . If you fail to report you will be in violation of your contract. Call Dispatch back to confirm your start time. 12. A phone call placed is a \"work assignment.\" We do not require a call-back. Dirck Armitage used the phone numbers that each driver provided to us for contact purposes. The vast majority of the crew never answered their phones. This has not happened before. Due to lack of response, and consistent with Section 3.02 of the Union contract, Armitage and Dispatcher David Hayes called every driver again before 5:00 p.m. on August 18, 2017, and reiterated their start times. We needed approximately 40-50 drivers to handle this work. The first starting time was supposed to be approximately 12:20 a.m. We also put a tape recording of everyone's start time on our call list \u2014 which every driver was supposed to call. As it turned out, only 17 drivers reported for work. The rest of the drivers did not answer their phones and completely ignored their job assignments. We had to call GLY, and the pour was cancelled. 80 I have read the foregoing 6 pages and declare under the penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington that the foreg oing is true and correct. Dated at Seattle , Was hington , this 12th (City) (State) day of October, 2017. 81 BEFORE REGION 19 NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD Glacier Northwest d/b/a CalPortland Company (\"Employer\") Case No. 19-CA-203068 and DECLARATION OF DAVID SIEMERING General Teamsters Union Local No. 174 (\"Union\") I, David Siemering, being over the age of 18 and having personal knowledge of the same, declare as follows: 1. I am currently employed at Glacier Northwest (\"Glacier NW\") in the position of Production Manager. I have been employed at Glacier NW and its predecessor companies for 34 years. I report to Justin Denison, whose job title is General Manager, RMC. My duties include overseeing the orderly concrete batching, delivering, environmental work, and the clean-up and washout f unctions in our yard at Duwamish. My office is located at our Duwamish location. 2. I became aware that our Teamsters 174 ready- mix drivers were going on strike at 7:00 a.m. on August 11, 2017, as soon as the strike began. I had just completed my rounds walking through our Duwamish yard. I was informed that the Union leaders (Hicks, Walker, and Gasca) were at our yard and that our drivers were all bringing their trucks back to our yard \u2014 many with full loads of concrete in the drums. 82 3. I could see that some of the mixer trucks were coming back empty after delivering their loads. I also saw that a number of our mixer trucks were brought back to our yard with full loads of concrete in them. Concrete is a perishable co mmodity. I knew we had a very limited time to deal with the issues presented. The trucks were simply parked, and the drivers walked away from them. A load of concrete will begin to harden in approximately 20-30 minutes. 4. With Justin Denison's input, we immediately rounded up two crews of employees to deal with this problem. We had approximately 20 or more trucks in the yard. Most were loaded with perishable concrete which needed to be addressed. I led a crew of Quality Control Technicians and Mechanics. I assigned our Operating Engineers Local 302 Foreman (Chuck Spegal) to supervise a crew of about 7 Operating Engineers, plus 2 Batch Pl ant Operators. It was a mad scramble to figure out which trucks had concrete in them; how close the concrete was to setting up (hardening); and where to du mp it safely and in an environmentally correct manner. Concrete contains chemicals and admixtures which are environmentally sensitive and must be disposed of promptly and correctly. 5. Spegal's crew immediately operated their \"yellow iron\" loaders to build 5-6 bunkers on our property where we could offload the concrete on the ground. The semi-solid concrete (\"mud\") had to be safely offloaded and contained. They also performed the following tasks: they dealt with the wastewater from the washouts; they cleaned out the batch plants; they dealt with the settling pond and the filters; and 83 they handled and controlled the holding tanks and treatment tanks \u2014 all of which were processing this huge volume of concrete and the clean-up. 6. While Spegal's crew were building bunkers and dealing with a huge volume of wastewater, my crew was going from truck-to-tru ck to determine which trucks were loaded, which ones needed to be offloaded, and which ones needed to be washed out. Many of the problems were exacerbated by drivers simply parking their fully-loaded trucks and walking away. My crew then organized the trucks for unloading on the ground in the bunkers. They drove the trucks one-by-one to the bunkers, affixed the chutes, and unloaded the concrete into the bunker. I had the QC Techs driving the trucks to the bunkers for disposal. Then, every truck had to be properly washed out. This task was handled by the QC Techs and Mechanics. The washed-out material had to be properly handled and stored. The washing-out occurred at our water chute. We washed out the drums, reversed the drum, and cleaned off the truck. Wastewater was then dumped into a pond and moved into a treatment pond and treated. Then, it was sent to filter press and properly processed. After the trucks were cleaned out, we parked them in the yard, until they could be moved to the original parking area. 7. From there, we organized the trucks to be moved to our West Marginal Way location to be parked. All of the Mechanics moved the trucks. Those are all tasks that our mixer drivers are supposed to perform. 8. There was no way of stopping the concrete from hardening in our yard, and in the bunkers. By the end 84 of this mad scramble, every one of our bunkers was filled with concrete. All of the concrete had hardened. We had to bring in an excavator one week later to break up all of this concrete . We rented trucks to haul it away. 9. The entire process of dealing with the trucks and concrete and wastewater on August 11, 2017 took approximately 5 hours and 15 employees to complete. 10. I had never seen anything like it in my 34 years at this Company. I have read the foregoing 4 pages and declare under the penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington that the foreg oing is true and correct.

If I could please have counsel identify themselves for our record. I will begin with plaintiff's counsel please, Marcy. MR. LUNDGREN: Brian Lundgren, Davis Grimm Payne & Marra for Glacier Northwest, the plaintiff. THE COURT: All right. Thank you, counsel. And for the defense? MR. IGLITZIN: Dmitri Iglitzin, Schwerin Campbell Barnard Iglitzin & Lavitt for defendant Teamsters Local 174. THE COURT: All right. Very good. Thank you, counsel. Counsel, as you know, I heard oral argument on this motion a few weeks ago. I reviewed the submissions again as well as the case law and am prepared to make the following ruling. This will be an oral ruling only with orders to be submitted by prevailing parties. Thank you. This matter is before the Court on defendant 91 Page 75 Teamsters Local 174, which will be referred to as the Union, motion for 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) dismissal of plaintiff's claims. Plaintiff, Glacier, brought this state court action alleging inter alia sabotage, property destruction, misrepresentation, fraud, and intentional interference with contract. The defendant Union has moved for dismissal pursuant to Civil Rule 12(b)(1) on jurisdictional grounds and Civil Rule 12(b)(6) grounds that all plaintiff's tort claims are preempted by either or both Sections 7 and 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, the NLRA. The effect of this claim preemption prevents state tort claims for damages caused by actions that are actually or arguably regulated by the NLRA as well as those that Congress intended to leave unregulated to allow the parties relative economic power to dictate resolution of labor disputes. Additionally, the NLRA grants the National Labor Relations Board, NLRB, exclusive jurisdiction over labor disputes and related conduct, and state courts must defer ot the exclusive competence of the Board where conduct is arguably protected or prohibited by the Act. Both sides have cited extensively to the Garmon principle in outlining the issues to be analyzed by this Court. The Garmon preemption doctrine preempts state regulation, including the award of damages for state tort 92 Page 76 claims, when the conduct at issue is actually or arguably protected by Sect ion 7 of the NLRA or prohibited by Section 8 of the NLRA. State causes of action are preempted by federal law if they concern conduct that is actually or arguably protected or prohibited by the NLRA or if they concern conduct that Congress intentionally left unregulated so that in the context of labor disputes, the parties may resolve their labor dispute issues relative to their economic powers. And, again, that's San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon at 356 U.S. 236. This has further been a pplied in analyses by the Washington state courts. Under Garmon, federal law preempts state regulation of conduct arising from a labor dispute even where th e conduct is only arguably protected or prohibited by the Act. Walmart Stores Inc. v. UFCW International Union, 190 Wn.App at 21, citing Garmon. To be preempted, a cause of action need only be potentially subject to Section 7 or 8 of the NLRA. A party asserting preemption, in this case the Union, must put forth sufficient evidence for the Court to conclude that the conduct at issue is potentially subject to the NLRA. International Longshoremen's Association AFL CIO v. Davis, 476 U.S. 380 at 397. The, quote, critical inquiry in determining whether the conduct at i ssue is arguably prohibited by the NLRA and 93 Page 77 hence within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB is whether the controversy presented to the state court is identical with that which could be presented to the Board. And that's from B elknap Inc. v. Hale at 463 U.S. 491, cited by Walmart Stores Inc. v. UFCW International Union at 190 Wn.App at 21. As stated in Amalgamated Association of Street Electronic Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America v. Lockridge, 403 U.S. 274, 1971 case, it is the conduct being regulated that must be the focus of the preemption analysis. Glacier's reference to NLRB v. Marsden, 701 F.2d 238, 2nd Circuit 1983, is instructive. The Marsden case involved a work stoppage by unorganized construction employees who walked off the job due to light rain. The NLRB found that the conduct did not involve protected exercise of Section 7 concerted rights, and accordingly, the employer did not commit unfair labor practice in discharging the employee who led the other workers off th e job. The Board found that where the employees decided on an ad hoc basis to cease work during the rain without communicating any demand regarding any desired change in terms of conditions of employment, that there was no protected concerted effort. The lack of any demand for change in Marsden's policies was not a trivial matter. Once a load of concrete was delivered, it cannot be returned, saving for Page 78 another day or simply left to harden. Once poured, it must be finished. It is c lear, therefore, that if the weather issue is not to be at Marsden's discretion, a 94 specific policy must be negotiated which accommodates employee desires with business imperatives. If Marsden mu st bear the burden of a walkout, he is at least enti tled to some notice of the employees' grievances so that he may attempt to respond with a proposal of his own. A walkout here expressed no such grievance but was merely an ad hoc reaction to one day's weather. It is therefore not protected by the Act. In United Construction Workers v. Laburnum Construction Corporation, 347 U.S. 656, 1954 Supreme Court case, the Court held that damages were restricted to those directly and proximately caused by wrongful conduct chargeable to the defendant. Similarly in International Union United Automobile Aircraft and Agriculture Implement Workers v. Russell, 356 U.S. 634, 1958 Supreme Court case, the Supreme Court noted that the damages must have a proximate relation between the violence and threats of force and violence complained of in the loss of wage s allegedly suffered. When the object of a Union's conduct is protected but the tactics used to attain that end are not, damages should be awarded only for those losses resulting from the Page 79 unlawful activity. See Rainbow Tours Inc. v. Hawaii Joint Council of Teamsters, 704 F.2d 1443, 9th Circuit 1983, and Perry v. Inter national Transport Workers Federation, 750 F.Supp 1189, 1990 case. A strike such as occurred here characteristically causes inconvenience and economic loss to the employer. Striking employees are under no general 95 duty to minimize the destruction by, for example, notifying the employer in advance of the strike to enable the employer to prepare for the strike. Johnnie Johnson Tire Company, 271 NLRB 293, Go-Lightly Footwear Inc., 251 NLRB 42. If the striking employees take reasonable precautions to avoid imminent danger to the employer's physical plant, the effect of a work stoppage does not preclude the NLRA protection. Striking employees may lose the NLRA's protection, however, if the abandonment of their job poses a foreseeable risk of damage to their employer's plant and equipment, also from Johnnie Johnson. Additionally, the NLRA does not protect striking employees who commit acts of vandalism or sabotage against their employer. Clea r Pine Moulding Inc., 268 NLRB 1044 and Columbia Portland Cement Company versus NLRB, 915 F.2d 253, 6th Circuit, 1990. With respect to the alleged property damage claim, this court concludes that the conduct regulated here was a Page 80 protected work stoppage. Although the unfortunate consequences of that stoppage may well have been economic loss, it is not such that the regulated activity touches an interest so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility, such as vandalism or violence, that it clearly falls outside the protection of NLRA. Rather, as noted above, damages are restricted to those directly and proximately caused by wrongful conduct chargeable to the Union. United Construction Workers versus Laburnum Construction Corporation, 347 U.S. 656. And 96 damages should only be awarded for the losses directly resulting from the unlawful activity. Rainbow Tours Inc., v. Hawaii Joint Council of Teamsters. Based on this Court's finding that an underlying conduct of work stoppage was arguably protected activity, the Court concludes that the claims for alleged property damage resulting from the arguably protected conduct is preempted. A similar analysis is applied with respect to plaintiff's complaints of intentional interference with contractual relationships, fraud, and misrepresentations as set forth in Paragraphs 3.32.to 3.53 of plaintiff's factual allegations in its complaint and plaintiff's second cause of action, Paragraphs 4.8 to 4.14 and 4.19 to 4.40 in the Third and Fourth causes of action. With respect to the civic claims of fraud, this Page 81 court considers the 9th Circuit reasoning in Operating Engineers Pension Trust v. Wilson, 915 F.2d 535\u2014 Is everyone still there? Or did we get\u2014did we lose someone? MR. LUNDGREN: Brian Lundgren still here, Your Honor. THE COURT: Okay. I think someone may be calling in. MR. IGLITZIN: No, I'm here, Your Honor. THE COURT: Mr. Iglitzin, are you there? MR. IGLITZIN: Yes, I am. THE COURT: Okay. We've got Mr. Lundgren and Mr. Iglitzin. I was getting bad elevator music. Okay. 97 I was citing to Operating Engineering Pension Trust v. Wilson, 915 F.2d 535, 1990. In that case, plaintiff's fraud and inducement claim was found not to be preempted under Section 301 because the Court did not need to reference a collective bargaining agreement itself. Now, I realize this is not in and of itself a Section 301 claim, but I'm using this case by analogy. In that case, the Court noted, we hold the plaintiff's state court claim for fraud and the inducement is not preempted by Section 301 because it does not require reference to a collective bargaining agreement. Similar holdings in Kroger v. Consolidated Freightways at 255 F4d 695. Plaintiff's Page 82 violation of privacy claim was not preempted because the Court was required only to look at the agreement rather to interpret it, and similarly in Burnside v. Hewitt, Pacific Corp, 491 F.3d 1077, because the Court there held that the plaintiff's claim was not granted because the claim was to be resolved by at most merely looking to the CBAs. Now, this is a 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) analysis. And under that analysis, this Court is dutybound to consider the allegations of plaintiff's complaint as truth. This Court would determine that if the factual allegations involved ongoing collective bargaining and ongoing negotiations, and the alleged misrepresentations and fraud were part of economic leverage, then this Court wo uld find such conduct was arguably protected as part of the collective bargaining negotiations, and, therefore, it would fall under Sections 7 and/or 8 of the NLRA. 98 On the other hand, if the complaint were to be read that the new labor agreement had been ratified and the Union's agent made these alleged misrepresentations independen t of negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement, then such activity would not be arguably prote cted and, accordingly, not preempted. Based on a broad liberal reading, the plaintiff's complaint for damages, which is required by this Court under CR 12(b)(1) and a 12(b)(6) analysis, this Court concludes Page 83 that the allegations putati vely assert that such conduct occurred after the labor negotiations were completed and the new labor agreement had been ratified. As such, this co urt concludes that if true, resolution of the state law claim does not require either construction of the collective bargaining agreement or consideration of negotiations of labor negotiations subject to Section 7 or 8 of the NLRA. Citing to Lingle v. Norge Division of Magic Chef Inc., 486 U.S. 407. And that thes e claims were allegedly not part and parcel of the labor negotiations which are claimed by the plaintiff to have been completed. Accordingly, the alleged tortious conduct would not be arguably protected and therefore not preempted by the NLRA. For the foregoing reasons, defendant Union's motion to dismiss pursuant to 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) is granted in part with respect to the alleged property damage and denied in part with respect to the alleged tortious conduct involving GLY. 99 Counsel, it's a split decision, so we need an order granting and denying. I suppose the Court\u2014maybe it would be best if I just prepared one, unless counsel would prefer to. Mr. Iglitzin? MR. IGLITZIN: I'm fine with having the Court prepare one, Your Honor. THE COURT: Okay. Page 84 MR. IGLITZIN: (indiscernible) THE COURT: I will incorporate by reference my oral ruling of today. Mr. Lundgren, is that acceptable to you? MR. LUNDGREN: Perfectly acceptable, Your Honor. THE COURT: All right. Are there any questions? MR. IGLITZIN: Your Honor, (indiscernible) THE COURT: Go ahead, Mr. Iglitzin. MR. IGLITZIN: Yes. (indiscernible) designate in your oral ruling exactly which of the six counts fall under which part of your order. If you could do that in the final order, that would be convenient for the parties. THE COURT: All right. I'm not exactly sure I'll be able to do that, and the reason for that is I think that some\u2014and I need to grab the complaint here\u2014but I think some of the allegation s overlap\u2014I'm sorry. I believe some of the causes of action overlap the factual allegations. Mr. Lundgren, is that true? MR. LUNDGREN: No, Your Honor. I can just tell you right now. The Fourth, Fifth and Sixth causes of action are related to\u2014 100 THE COURT: Only\u2014 MR. LUNDGREN: \u2014the co nduct involving GLY. THE COURT: Okay. So Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth is just GLY. MR. LUNDGREN: That's right., Your Honor. Page 85 THE COURT: Okay. MR. LUNDGREN: And the First, Second and Third are related to the property damage. THE COURT: Okay. Okay. That makes it easy. So thank you, Mr. Iglitzin, for raising that issue and Mr. Lundgren for clarifying that. So, for the record, the Court grants the defendant Union's motion to dismiss the First, Second, and Third causes of action and denies without prejudice dismissal of the Fourth, Fi fth, and Sixth causes of action. And it's without prejudice because this is just 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), and I am relying upon the factual assertions as true. That doesn't preclude any further motions practice. All right. Mr. Iglitzin, any\u2014 MR. IGLITZIN: Your Honor, the defendant does not have any further questions. THE COURT: Mr. Lundgren, any questions? MR. LUNDGREN: No, Your Honor. THE COURT: Very good. Thank you all for being available this afternoon. You'll probably get that order in about ten days because I'll be on leave the next week. Thank you. I hope the rest of your week goes well. Be well. Thank you. Court is in recess. 101 IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON IN AND FOR KING COUNTY GLACIER NORTHWEST INC., Plaintiff, v.

INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL , A.C.J. \u2014 Glacier Northwest Inc., who employs drivers represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local Union No. 174 (Union), filed this lawsuit against the Union for intentional destruction of property, misrepresentation, and tortious interference with a business relationship, relating to the Union's conduct during and immediately after an August 2017 strike. The trial court initially dismissed Glacier's property destruction claims, concluding they were federally preempted. It subsequently dismissed the misrepresentation and tortious interference claims on summary judgment, concluding Glacier failed to present a genuine issue of material fact on the elements of justifiable reliance or proximate cause. 111 We reverse the dismissal of Glacier's claims for intentional destruction of property because those claims are based on conduct neither actually nor arguably protected under section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.1 We affirm the dismissal of Glacier's remaining claims. FACTS Glacier sells and delivers ready-mix concrete throughout Washington State.2 Its 80 or 90 truck drivers, who work out of Glacier's facilities in Seattle along the Duwamish River, and in Kenmore and Snoqualmie, are represented exclusively by the Union. Glacier's lawsuit wa s based on two instances of alleged Union misconduct at the beginning of a strike on August 11, 2017, and on the day the strike ended on August 18, 2017. August 11 Work Stoppage Glacier alleged that in the early morning hours of August 11, 2017, Glacier and its drivers began the process of batching and delivering concrete to Glacier customers. \"Batching\" is the process of preparing concrete for the immediate delivery to a customer, and generally requires measuring and mixing different ingredients (cement, sand, aggregate, admixture, and water) pursuant to a cust omer's specifications. Glacier places these raw materials into a hopper and blends them together. On ce it is batched, Glacier discharges the concrete into a ready-mix truck for immediate delivery to a cust omer's project site. The trucks are specifically designed to maintain the 1 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. 2 Glacier Northwest Inc. does business as CalPortland. 112 integrity of the batched concrete in a revolving drum during transport. Glacier further alleged that concrete is a perishable product because once at rest, it begins to harden immediately and can begin to set within 20 to 30 minutes. Once the raw materials are batched, the concrete cannot be saved for another day and must be delivered, poured, and finished. As a result, Glacier's drivers have a limited amount of time in which to deliver and pump the concrete or it becomes useless. If the drivers do not deliver the concrete within this short time period, the concrete is rendered unusable because the concrete's physical condition materially changes, and it eventually hardens. And if the batched concrete remains in the revolving drum of the ready-mix truck beyond its useful life span, the concrete will harden inside the revolving drum and cause significant damage to the truck. Once concrete starts to set, it begins to thicken, placing pressure on the hydraulic system of the rotating barrel of the truck. If a driver stops the rotation of the drum, the setting process commences and the concrete starts to harden inside. Glacier alleged the Union representatives and Glacier's drivers all knew of this perishable nature of batched concrete. Glacier alleged that shortly before 7:00 a.m., on the morning of August 11, 2017, Union agents were physically present at Gl acier's Seattle facility and observed drivers loading batched concrete onto its trucks. Glacier's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the Union had expired as of July 31, 2017, and the Union was in the process of negotiating a replacement CBA with Glacier and other concrete companies. Glacier further alleged that once the 113 Union representatives knew there was a substantial volume of batched concre te in Glacier's barrels, hoppers, and ready-mix trucks, they called for a work stoppage. Glacier alleged that the Union intentionally timed this cessation of work to ensure the destruction of all of the batched concrete. According to Adam Doyle, Glacier's dispatch coordinator, at the time th e Union called the strike, Glacier had mixer trucks already on job sites delivering concrete, drivers on the road with fully loaded trucks, drivers in the yard waiting to have their trucks loaded from Glacier barrels and hoppers, and drivers in the yard with fully loaded trucks ready to depart. Doyle notified the drivers that they were obligated to finish any job that Glacier had started. Normally, when drivers return to the yard after delivering concrete, they offload any leftover concrete into a \"reclaimer\" or into a form to make ecology blocks. They then rinse out the drum and return to the line to take on another load. But on August 11, the drivers all brought their mixer trucks back to the yard between 7:00 a.m. and 7:45 a.m. Justin Denison, Glacier's ready-mix concrete manager, testified that some of the drivers, who were on their way to jo bsites with trucks loaded with 9 to 10 cubic yards of concrete when the Union called the strike, returned their trucks to Glacier's Duwamish facility without delivering the concrete. He testified that at least 16 drivers came back with fully loaded trucks, and 9 drivers abandoned them in Glacier's yard without notice to Glacier. Seven drivers parked their trucks, notified Glacier of their return, and sought instructions for dealing with the concrete. Denison described the scene: 114 I was present in the yard when the loaded trucks came rolling back in on August 11. . . . It was complete chaos. We had to offload the concrete from the barrels before it \"set up.\" We had to dispose of the concrete in a timely manner to avoid costly damage to the mixer trucks and in a manner so as not to create an environmental disaster. We had to reorganize material storage bunkers into which we offloaded the concrete. We had to deal with settling ponds, treatment of material and filter presses to handle hundreds of cubic yards of concrete. It took us 5 hours to properly handle and clean-up the mess created by the drivers. Glacier contended it took emergency measures to offload the hardening concrete into hastily constructed bunkers in an environmentally safe manner, and quickly washed out the trucks to prevent damage to them. But it wa s unable to save any of the concrete. Glacier had to subsequently bring in excavation equipment and trucks to break up the fully hardened concrete and haul it to a disposal site. Glacier initially issued disciplinary letters to the 16 drivers who returned their loaded trucks to Glacier's facility for abandoning the trucks and violating Glacier's work rules and sa fety rules by deliberately putting Glacier's business in imminent harm. When Glacier's management learned that 7 of the drivers had given Glacier advance notice of the strike and their intent to return loaded trucks to Glacier's facility, Glacier withdrew th e warning letters to these drivers. 115 August 19 Mat Pour GLY Construction, a general contractor, had subcontracted with Glacier to supply concrete for a commercial project in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle (the Vulcan Project). When the Union called the Augu st 11 strike, GLY had a large mat pour, 3 as part of the Vulcan Project, scheduled for Saturday, August 12, 2017. Glacier canceled this job due to the strike. In the early morning hours of August 18, 2017, the Union and Glacier agreed to a successor CBA covering August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2021. Around 11 a.m. that morning, the Union called a meeting with the drivers, during which they voted to approve the CBA (August 2017 CBA). 4 Immediately after the August 18 ratification vote, the Union drafted a press release announcing the vote, and posted it on the Union's website and Facebook page within a couple hours of the meeting. This release sa id that the Glacier strike was over and \"everyone is now back to work.\" That same day, GLY Construction employee Dane Buechler called Ted Herb, the president of the 3 A \"mat pour\" involves the delivery of concrete by several trucks, one after another, to pour a concrete foundation for a large commercial building. The work requires a substantial labor force including dispatchers, laborers , batch plant personnel, truck drivers, GLY personnel, and City of Seattle inspectors and police. Because a mat pour requires street closures, having a sufficient number of drivers to deliver concrete is essential. 4 Union Secretary-Treasurer Ri ck Hicks signed the formal agreement on September 19, 2017, and Glacier Director of Industrial Relations Brian Sleeper signed on November 20, 2017. But the parties do not dispute that the drivers approved it before noon on August 18, 2017. 116 company, to inform him that the Union had ratified a new CBA with Glacier. Buechler wanted to proceed with the Vulcan Project mat pour after midnight that night but was unsure if the Glacier drivers would respond to work that night. Glacier managers had heard rumors that the drivers had been instructed not to answer phones for Saturday work. Glacier's vice president and general manager, Melanie O'Regan, was unwilling to mobilize fo r the mat pour without reason to believe the drivers would show up because Glacier would then be responsible for both Glacier's losses and GLY's mobilization costs and potentially liquidated damages. Buechler asked Herb to ca ll the Union's agent, Rick Hicks, with whom Herb had previously discussed the complexities of this concrete job, to find out if the rumors were true. Greg Mettler, Glacier's ready-mix sales manager, also spoke to Herb that afternoon and learned Herb intended to call Hicks to discuss the concerns about whether drivers would show up for the mat pour. Herb called Hicks around 12:35 p.m. that afternoon, and Hicks confirmed the Union had approved the successor CBA. Herb told Hi cks that GLY wanted to reschedule the Vulcan Project mat pour for shortly after midnight that night, on August 19. He recounted his conversation with Hicks: I told Mr. Hicks: \"Dane is trying to reschedule the mat pour for tonight and there's some concern about whether it will be properly serviced. So, I have been asked to call and get a response and some information on what will happen.\" I asked: 117 \"I've been asked by Dane to call you and get verification; will you service the mat pour or not?\" Herb testified that Hicks responded to his question by stating that \"the drivers have been instructed to respond to dispatch.\" He rb asked the same question a second time and Hicks \"responded exactly the same way both times.\" Hicks denied making this statement to Herb. Herb communicated the contents of this conversation to O'Regan and Mettler around 1 p.m. They interpreted Hicks's statement that \"the drivers have been instructed to respond to dispatch\" to mean that the Union had instructed the drivers to show up to work the mat pour. O'Regan testified that she reasonably relied on Hicks's statement in making the decision to proceed that nigh t to mobilize to the job. But no one from Glacier spoke to Hicks directly. Glacier decided to proceed with the mat pour. Glacier dispatcher Dirck Armitage testified that generally, for weekend work, he will call drivers individually to inform them of their start time and to tell them to check a \"call-out recording\" listing all drivers' start times for t hat weekend work. On August 18, Armitage began calling drivers around 1:22 p.m. By 3:42 p.m., he had posted the call-out recording with start times. Armitage testified that he listened to the call-out recording to ensure it was functional, per standard practice, at 3:47 p.m. The last round of first calls ended at 4:01 p.m., and dispatchers called each driver a second time, beginning at 4:15 p.m. Armitage and a second dispatcher spoke to some drivers personally and left voice mail messages with 118 others. According to Armitage's dispatch notes, 12 of the drivers answered this phone call, and the majority of those drivers indicated they would work the mat pour. Approximately 39 drivers did not answer. The earliest assigned start time for the mat pour was at 12:30 a.m., and the la test start time was at 7:00 a.m., with the majority of drivers scheduled to arrive between 12:30 a.m. and 1:05 a.m. At 12:45 a.m. on August 19, Glacier employees realized they had a problem. By 1:00 a.m., only 11 or 12 drivers had arrived for the mat pour. Shortly before 1:15 a.m., only 17 of the 40-50 drivers ne eded showed up for the mat pour, while another 5 drive rs indicated they were on their way. Knowing they could not complete the mat pour with only 22 drivers, Glacier cancelled the pour at 1:15 a.m. On August 23, 2017, Glacier sent disciplinary warning letters to the 39 drivers who did not show up for the August 19 mat pour, contending the failure to report to work violated Glacier's work rule prohibiting the participation \"in any interruption of work or production.\" Procedural History Glacier commenced this su it on December 4, 2017, alleging six separate causes of action. Glacier's first three claims related to the August 11 work stoppage: (1) wrongful sabotage and de struction of concrete, (2) intentional interference of Glacier's performance of its business relationships, and (3) civil conspiracy to commit sabotage and to destroy Glacier's concrete. Glacier's remaining claims related to the August 19 mat pour: (4) fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment, (5) negligent misrepresentation, and (6) 119 intentional interference with Glacier's performance of the GLY contract. On December 15, 2017, the Union filed a grievance against Glacier with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), alleging Glacier had violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157-158, by retaliating against the Union drivers for engaging in a lawful strike, retaliating against drivers for not showing up for work in August 19, and filing \"an objectively baseless federally preempted lawsuit\" against the union in state court. In January 2018, the Union moved to dismiss Glacier's claims under CR 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), arguing that all of Glacier's claims were preempted under San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon , 359 U.S. 236, 245, 79 S. Ct. 773, 3 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1959). It maintained that under the Garmon preemption doctrine, state courts may not adjudicate any claims where the conduct at issue is actually or arguably protected under section 7, or actually or arguably prohibited under section 8 of the NLRA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157-158. 5 It argued the August 11 work stoppage was lawful concerted activity and any alleged misrepresentations that workers would return to work were arguably covered by section 8(b)(3) of the 5 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 provides in pertinent part, \"Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection . . . .\" And 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(3) makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor union or its agents \"to refuse to bargain collectively with an employer\" when that union is the certified representative of that employer's employees. 120 NLRA, which prohibits dishonesty by a labor union during the bargaining process. The trial court dismissed the three claims arising from the August 11 events. It concluded that the strike, in which Glacier drivers returned their loaded trucks to Glacier's Seattle facility, was protected work stoppage activity. The court acknowledged that while the economic losses from th e strike were unfortunate, such losses did not \"touch[] an interest so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility, such as vandalism or violence, that it clearly falls outside the protection of [the Act].\" The trial court, however, declined to dismiss the three claims related to the August 19 mat pour. Accepting Glacier's factual allegations as true, the tri al court concluded the alleged misrepresentations did not arguably fall within the scope of section 8 of the NLRA. In October 2018, after conducting discovery, the Union moved to dismiss Glacier's remaining claims on summary judgment. The Union asked the court to dismiss the fraud and neg ligent misrepresentation claims, arguing that Glacier unreasonably relied on Hicks's alleged statement because Hicks did not say drivers would work the mat pour and only a handful of drivers actually answered the dispatch call before Glacier chose to proceed wi th it. The Union also maintained Glacier's reliance was unjustified because the Union could not require any drivers to work that night because Glacier had not given the drivers sufficient notice as required by the August 2017 CBA. The Union sought the dismissal of the remaining tortious interference claim, arguing GLY did not end its contractual relationship with Glacier after the drivers failed to show for the mat pour. GLY 121 rescheduled and completed the mat pour later in August 2017. Finally, the Union argued the trial court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate these claims because they were preempted by section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185. 6 On November 16, 2018, the trial court granted the Union's motion and dismissed Glacier's remaining claims. Glacier appeals the dismissal of two of its claims arising from the August 11 work stoppage and all three claims arising from the August 19 mat pour. 7 ANALYSIS Glacier raises three main arguments on appeal. First, it argues that the trial court erred when it concluded that Glacier's intentional destruction of property claims arising from the August 11 work stoppage were preempted under Garmon . Second, it argues that the trial court erred in its alternate conclusion that Glacier's misrepresentation claims 6 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a) provides: Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties. This provision of the LMRA has been held to preempt state law claims based directly on rights created by a CBA as well as claims that are \"substantially de pendent on an interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement.\" Beals v. Kiewit Pac. Co., 114 F.3d 892, 894 (9th Cir. 1997). 7 Glacier does not appeal the dismissal of its tortious interference claim arising out of the August 11 work stoppage. 122 were preempted by section 301 of the LMRA. Third, it maintains that the trial court erred when it dismissed its misrepresentation and tortious interference claims on summary judgment, contending there are issues of fact needing to be resolved at a trial. We conclude the trial court erred in dismissing Glacier's August 11 work stoppage claims but did not err in dismissing the claims relating to the August 19 mat pour. A. Garmon Preemption of Glacier's Property Destruction Claims Glacier contends the trial court erred in concluding Glacier's intentional destruction of property claims were preempted under Garmon . We agree. 1. Standard of Review This appeal arises out of a dismissal on the Union's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under CR 12(b)(1 ) and failure to state a claim under CR 12(b)(6). A motion to dismiss under CR 12(b)(1) may be either facial or factual. Outsource Servs. Mgmt., LLC v. Nooksack Bus. Corp. , 172 Wn. App. 799, 806, 292 P.3d 147 (2013). In a facial challenge, the sufficiency of the pleadings is the sole issue. Id. at 806-07. In a factual challenge, the trial court may weigh evidence to resolve disputed jurisdictional facts. Id. at 807. In this case, the Union's challenge to the trial court's jurisdiction appears facial, in that it relied on the allegations in Glacier's complaint but it also submitted evidence relating to the unlawful labor practice complaint it filed with the NLRB. In re sponse, Glacier submitted, with the trial court's permission, declarations filed 123 with the NLRB. Although the Union did not concede any factual allegations made by Glacier in these pleadings, it did not offer ev idence to dispute them. Thus, although the trial court reviewed evidence in addition to the complaint, in rendering its determination it does not appear it had to resolve any disputed jurisdictional facts. We thus assume for our analysis that the Union's motion was a facial challenge to subject matter jurisdiction. When a court rules on a facial challenge, based on the complaint alone or the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts gleaned from the record, the existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo. Id.; see also Ricketts v. Bd. of Accountancy , 111 Wn. App. 113, 116, 43 P.3d 548 (2002) (motion to dismis s for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is review ed de novo). The party asserting subject matter jurisdiction bears the burden of proof on its existence. Outsource Servs. , 172 Wn. App. at 806. The Union's motion also invoked CR 12(b)(6). We review dismissals under CR 12(b)(6) de novo. FutureSelect Portfolio Mgmt., Inc. v. Tremont Grp. Holdings, Inc. , 180 Wn.2d 954, 962, 331 P.3d 29 (2014). Dismissal for failu re to state a claim is appropriate only if it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that no facts exist that would justify recovery. Cutler v. Phillips Petrol. Co. , 124 Wn.2d 749, 755, 881 P.2d 216 (1994). Under this rule, the plaintiff's allegations are presumed to be true and a court may consider hypothetical fact s not part of the formal record. Id. 124 In this case, the trial court concluded as a matter of law that Glacier's state law claims were preempted by federal law. Whether a claim is preempted is a question of law reviewed de novo. McKee v. AT&T Corp. , 164 Wn.2d 372, 387, 191 P.3d 845 (2008); Wal- Mart Stores, Inc. v. Un ited Food & Commercial Workers Int'l Union , 190 Wn. App. 14, 21, 354 P.3d 31 (2015). 2. Garmon Preemption In Garmon , a union sought recognition as the representative of nonunion employees of lumber suppliers. 359 U.S. at 237. The suppliers refused to recognize the union, and the employees began a peaceful picket at the suppliers' places of business. Id. A California state court enjoined the picketing and awarded damages for losses sustained by the companies. Id. at 237-38. The United States Supreme Court held that the suppliers' state law claims were preempted by federal labor law. Id. at 245. Under what has become known as the Garmon preemption doctrine, when an activity is arguably subject to section 7 or section 8 of the NLRA, \"the States as well as the federa l courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted.\" Id. And it held that state courts should not determine whether conduct is arguably protected by the NLRA. Id. at 244. The court stated, \"In the absence of the Board's clear determination that an activity is neither protected nor prohibited or of compellin g precedent applied to essentially undisputed facts, it is not for this Court to 125 decide whether such activi ties are subject to state jurisdiction.\" Id. at 246. Here, we have a clear determination from the NLRB that the intentional destruction of property during a lawful work stoppage is not protected activity under section 7 of the NLRA. \"Policing of actual or threatened violence to persons or destruction of property has been held most clearly a matter for the States.\" Lodge 76, Int'l Ass'n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers v. Wis. Emp't Relations Comm'n , 427 U.S. 132, 136, 96 S. Ct. 2548, 49 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1976) (emphasis added); see also Cranshaw Constr. of New England, LP v. Int'l Ass'n of Bridge, Structural & Ornamental Ironworkers , 891 F. Supp. 666, 674 (D. Mass. 1995) (vandalism or the intentional destruction of property during a strike is not protected activity under the NLRA). Moreover, the NLRB, as well as reviewing federal courts, has explicitly stated that workers who fail to take reasonable precautions to prevent the destruction of an employer's plant, equipment, or products before engaging in a work stoppage may be disciplined by an employer for this conduct. In Marshall Car Wheel & Foundry Co. , 107 N.L.R.B. 314, 315 (1953), the Board stated: [T]he right of certain classes of employees to engage in concerted activity is limited by the duty to take reasonable precautions to protect the employer's physical plant from such imminent damage as foreseeably would result from their sudden cessation of work. We are of the opinion that this duty extends as well to ordinary rank-and-file employees whose wo rk tasks are such as 126 to involve responsibility for the property which might be damaged. Employees who strike in breach of such obligation engage in unprotected activity for which they may be discharged or subjected to other forms of discipline affecting their employment conditions. The Fifth Circuit affirmed this general statement of the law. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd. v. Marshall Car Wheel & Foundry Co. , 218 F.2d 409, 413 (5th Cir. 1955). The court agreed with the NLRB that the workers' conduct was unprotected activity because \"the striking employees inte ntionally chose a time for their walkout when molten iron in the plant cupola was ready to be poured off, and . . . a lack of sufficient help to carry out the critical pouring operation might well have resulted in substantial property damage and pecuniary loss\" to the employer. Id. at 411 (footnote omitted). The e mployer was able to prevent this damage from occurring by using employees who refused to honor the strike and its supervisory staff. Id. The court held that because the union \"deliberately timed its stri ke without prior warning and with the purpose of causing maximum plant damage and financial loss\" to the employer, the NLRB had no authority to compel the employer to reinstate the employees who participa ted in, authorized, or ratified the illegal activity. Id. at 413. The NLRB's decision in Marshall Car Wheel has been recognized by federal courts and the NLRB for decades. See Int'l Protective Servs., Inc., 339 N.L.R.B. 701, 702 (2003) (striking employees' failure to take reasonable precautions to protect the employer's plant, equipment, or products from foreseeable harm 127 is not protected activity).8 In Boghosian Raisin Packing Co., 342 N.L.R.B. 383 (2004), the NLRB determined that the employees , who walked off the job without protecting the employers' perishable products from spoilage, had engaged in unprotected activity under the NLRA: The Union apparently decided on the evening of September 30 to strike the next day, however rather than having employees not report for work, the Union did the opposite. The employees reported and began working, then at 7:15 a.m. word was passed to strike . While the employees did a mini cleanup, of the type required when they went on a short break, there is no question that by leaving for the day, there was product damage. . . . And there can be little question that the product damage was intentional. In such a situation, the action of employees is unprotected. The Board has long held that employees have the duty to take reasonable precautions when striking in order to avoid damage to the 8 The NLRB said: Both the Board and the courts recognize that the right to strike is not absolute, and section 7 [of the NRLA] has been interpreted not to protect concerted activity that is unlawful, violent, in breach of contract, or otherwise indefensible. The Board ha s held concerted activity indefensible where employees fail to take reasonable precautions to protect the employer's plant, equipment, or products from foreseeable imminent danger due to sudden cessation of work. Int'l Protective Svcs. , 339 N.L.R.B. at 702 (a lteration in original) (quoting Bethany Med. Ctr. , 328 N.L.R.B. 1094, 1094 (1999)). 128 company's property. Necessarily a strike will cause some economic loss to an employer, as well as to the employees. But damage to the company's property goes beyond such loss and where strikers deliberately time their strike to cause product damage, then their activity is unprotected for which they can be disciplined or discharged. Id. at 396-97 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Glacier's allegations are similar to those of Boghosian Raisin . Glacier alleged that \"[o]n August 11, 2017, the Union and some or all of its officers, employees, and members consciously acted together . . . to sabotage, ruin and destroy Glacier's batched concrete.\" It furth er alleged the Union failed to take reasonable precautions to protect Glacier's equipment, plant, and batched concrete from \"foreseeable imminent dang er\" resulting from the Union's sudden cessation of work. Glacier also claimed the Union drivers \"knew their August 11, 2017 conduct was certain to, or substantially certain to, destroy or so materially alter the physical condition of Glacier's batched concrete as to deprive Glacier of possession or use of the batched concrete.\" Because the trial court dismissed Glacier's claims on a CR 12(b)(1) and (b)(6) motion, we accept these allegations as true. And if we assume the Union ordered Glacier's truck drivers to wait to stop work until Glacier had batched a large amount of concrete and loaded it into the drivers' waiting trucks, and the Union did so with the intention of causing maximum product loss to Glacier, this conduct was clearly unprotected under section 7 of the NLRA. Because 129 the conduct Glacier has alleged here is neither actually nor arguably protected activity, there is no Garmon preemption. The trial court erred in concluding to the contrary. B. LMRA Preemption of Glacier's Remaining Claims Glacier next contends the trial court erred in dismissing Glacier's fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims relating to the August 19 mat pour, concluding the claims were preempted by section 301 of the LRMA. 1. Standard of Review We review summary judgment rulings de novo. Rhoads v. Evergreen Utils. Contractors, Inc. , 105 Wn. App. 419, 423, 20 P.3d 460 (2001). 2. Section 301 Preemption Section 301 of the LMRA provides exclusive federal court jurisdiction over claims that an employer or union violated a CBA. Hisle v. Todd Pac. Shipyards Corp., 151 Wn.2d 853, 863, 93 P.3d 108 (2004). \"LMRA supremacy 'ensure[s] uniform interpretation consistent of labor-management Id. (alterations in original) (quoting Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U.S. 399, 404, 108 S. Ct. 1877, 100 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1988)). Section 301 preem ption occurs when the state claim is \"'inextricably intertwined with consideration of the terms of the labor contract,'\" id. (quoting Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck , 471 U.S. 202, 213, 105 S. Ct. 1904, 85 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1985)), and application of state law \"'requires the interpretation 130 of a collective-bargaining agreement,'\" id. (quoting Lingle , 486 U.S. at 413). Glacier's claims are no t based on the CBA but instead arise in tort. Our Supreme Court has recognized that \"[a] different issue arises . . . when a plaintiff brings a claim that does not sound in breach of contract, but nevertheless arguably implicates the CBA.\" Commodore v. Univ. Mech. Contractors, Inc. , 120 Wn.2d 120, 126, 839 P.2d 314 (1992). The Union contends Glacier's tort claims implicate the CBA because its defense is based on specific provisions of that agreement. The Supreme Court, however, held in Commodore that such an indirect connection to a CBA does not trigger section 301 preemption. Id. at 139. In Commodore, the trial court concluded a union member's claims for defamation, outrage, racial discrimination, and tortious interference with a business relationship against his employer were preempted by section 301 of the LMRA. Id. at 123. On review, our Supreme Court adopted the \"Marcus model,\" 9 which states that \"[a] state statutory or common law claim is independent of the CBA\u2014and therefore should not be pr eempted by section 301\u2014if it could be asserted without reliance on an employment contract.\" Id. at 129 (emphasis omitted). The court held that section 301 preemption occurs 9 The \"Marcus model\" was based on a 1989 law review note in the Yale Law Journal by Stephanie Marcus, which interpreted the 1988 Supreme Court decision in Lingle . Commodore , 120 Wn.2d at 126; see also Stephanie R. Marcus, The Need for a New Approach to Federal Preemption of Union Members' State Law Claims , 99 Y ALE L.J. 209 (1989). 131 only in cases involving clai ms of breach of contract, claims of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and claims based directly on violation of the CBA. Id. at 129-30. The court concluded that the union member's tort claims were not based on any violation of the CBA and thus not preempted by section 301. Id. at 139. Here, Glacier alleged that the Union fraudulently or negligently misrepresented the Union's directive to its members regarding reporting to work for the mat pour. Glacier's claim is based on Hicks's statement to Herb that the drivers would \"respond to dispatch.\" This claim is not directly bas ed on any violation of the August 2017 CBA\u2014that CBA did not define the phrase \"respond to dispatch.\" Determining whether Hicks's statements were misrepresentations would not have required the trial court to interpret the August 2017 CBA. Although the Union raised provisions of the August 2017 CBA to undercut the reasonableness of Glacie r's reliance on Hicks's statement, there was no disp ute as to the meaning of these provisions. Under Commodore, Glacier's fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims can be resolved by tort law, and the trial court did not need to resolve any disputes in interpreting the August 2017 CBA's provisions. Cf. Joy v. Kaiser Alum. & Chem. Corp. , 62 Wn. App. 909, 816 P.2d 90 (1991) (court affirmed dism issal of plaintiff's tort claim against employer because claim required court to interpret employer's promis es to plaintiff in CBA). The trial court erred in concluding otherwise. 132 C. Glacier's Misrepresentation and Tortious Interference Claims Although the trial court erred in holding that Glacier's claims for misrepresentation were preempted by the LMRA, it also addressed the merits of these claims, concluding Glacier failed to present a genuine issue of material fact. We conclude the trial court correctly dismissed these claims on their merits but do so on alterative grounds. See Jenson v. Scribner , 57 Wn. App. 478, 48 0, 789 P.2d 306 (1990) (appellate court can affirm the dismissal claims on any ground established by the pleadings and supported by the evidence). 1. Fraudulent and Negligent Misrepresentation A claim of fraudulent misrepresentation requires proof of a representation of an existing fact. Cornerstone Equip. Leasing, Inc. v. MacLeod , 159 Wn. App. 899, 905, 247 P.3d 790 (2011).10 It is well established in Washington that a promise of future performance is not an actionable representation of existing fact required for a fraud claim. Adams v. King County, 164 Wn.2d 640, 662, 192 P.3d 891 (2008) (\"a false promise does not constitute the representation of existing fact\"). A false representation of presently existing fact is also a 10 The nine elements of fraud are (1) representation of an existing fact; (2) materiality; (3) falsity; (4) the speaker's knowledge of its falsity; (5) intent of the speaker that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff; (6) plaintiff's ignorance of its falsity; (7) plaintiff's reliance on the truth of the representation; (8) plaintiff's right to rely upon it; and (9) damages suffered by the plaintiff. Stieneke v. Russi , 145 Wn. App. 544, 563, 190 P.3d 60 (2008). 133 prerequisite to a negligent misrepresentation claim. Donald B. Murphy Contractor s, Inc. v. King County, 112 Wn. App. 192, 197, 49 P.3d 912 (2002). Hicks's alleged statement that \"the drivers will respond to dispatch\" is a promise that the drivers will do something in the future. As such, it is not an actionable statement of existing fact. Summary judgment dismissal of Glacier's fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claim was appropriate on this alternative ground. 2. Tortious Interference Glacier next maintains the trial court erred in dismissing its claim that the Union tortiously interfered with its perform ance of the GLY contract. Glacier argued below that the Union interfered with its performance of its contractual obligations to GLY by falsely stating that drive rs would show up for the mat pour. The trial court concluded that there was no evidence that Hicks's statement \"intended to breach or terminate Glacier's relationship with GLY\" or that the alleged representation caused Glacier's injury because the drivers had the discretion to refuse to work under the August 2017 CBA. While we agree with Glacier that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard, we nevertheless affirm the trial court's conclusion that Glacier's evidence failed to establish a question of fact on the element of proximate cause. The trial court relied on Brown v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 94 Wn.2d 359, 374, 617 P.2d 704 (1980), for the proposition that Glacier had to prove that the Union caused a breach or terminat ion of Glacier's business relationship or cont ract with GLY. While Brown correctly set out the necessary elements of a claim 134 under Restatement (Second) Torts Section 766 (Am. Law Inst. 1979) (tortious interference causing a breach of contract with a th ird person), that case did not address a claim arising under Restatement (Second) Torts Section 766A (tortious interference preventing plaintiff from performing under a contract with a third person). Se ction 766A provides \"One who intentionally and improperly interferes with the performance of a contract . . . between another and a third person, by preventing the other from performing the contract or causing his performance to be more expensive or burdensome, is subject to liability to the other for pecuniary loss resulting to him.\" Washington recognizes claims under section 766A. Eserhut v. Heister 52 Wn. App. 6 (1988); see also Pac. Typesetting Co. v. Int'l Typographical Union , 125 Wash. 273, 216 P. 358 (1923) (union coerced employees to strike to render it impossible for employer to complete printing contract with other companies). Under section 766A, Glacier did not have to prove the Union caused it to breach its contract with GLY or that GLY terminated the contract with Glacier as a result of the mat pour cancellation. It only had to establish that the Union used improper means to make Glacier's performance of its contract with GLY more expensive or burdensome. Glacier present ed evidence to establish this element of its tortious interference claim. However, the trial court correctly concluded that Glacier failed to establis h that the Union, through Hicks's statement, proxima tely caused the losses associated with canceling the mat pour on August 19. Although causation is usually an issue for the jury, where inferences from the facts are remote or 135 unreasonable, factual causation is not established as a matter of law. Sea-Pac Co. v. United Food & Commercial Workers Local Union 44 , 103 Wn.2d 800, 805, 699 P.2d 217 (1985) (affirmed dismissal of tortious interference claim). The undisputed evidence in this case showed that Glacier's truck drivers had no contractual obligation to show up for work that night, regardless of any instruction to do so from Hicks. Although the August 2017 CBA gave Glacier the exclusive power to make work assignments, it was required to follow a specific procedure for doing so. Article 3.02 of the August 2017 CBA provided that Glacier was required to advise drivers by noon on Thursday before the weeken d whenever it anticipated weekend work. CP 569, 1677. This notice permitted drivers to volunteer for su ch jobs. CP 1678. Article 3.02 gave Glacier two options for enlisting volunteers. First, it could offer the weekend job by seniority to employees paid for 32 or fe wer hours that week. CP 569, 1678. Or if it could not recruit enough volunteers through this process, it could offer the job by seniority to employees paid that week for more than 32 hours. Id. If, by 5 p.m. on Friday, Glacier did not obtain a sufficient number of volunteers, it could force a driver to work by using a third option of assigning work by inverse seniority to e mployees. CP 569, 1679. But the mandatory assignment process in Article 3.02 remained subject to Article 3.10, which provides that the employer must noti fy drivers by 9 a.m. each workday if they would be scheduled for work some time that day. CP 570, 1679. If work became available after 9 a.m., the employer \"may call drivers\" but it could not discipline any employee who declined to report for work. Drivers have no contractual 136 obligation to take dispatch calls after 9:00 a.m. and, if they do, they may accept or decline work without repercussion. CP 570, 1679. Finally, any driver who is scheduled to begin work between 12:00 a.m. and 4:59 a.m. must be given at least 10 hours' notice. CP 570, 1679. It was undisputed that Glacier did not notify drivers of the midnight mat pour by noon on Thursday, August 17, or by 9:00 a.m. on Friday, August 18. Glacier also ca lled drivers by seniority, rather than by inverse seniority. CP 1680. And because Glacier did not begin contacting drivers until approximately 1:30 p.m. on Friday afternoon, for report times beginning that night at 12:30 a.m., many did not receive the mandatory 10 hours' notice. CP 1703-07. Thus, under the unambiguous terms of the August 2017 CBA, the workers had no obligation to perform work on the night of August 18 or the early morning of August 19. Glacier concedes the August 2017 CBA did not require any of its drivers to report to work for the mat pour. Glacier argues, however, that the terms of the August 2017 CBA are irrelevant because the Union representative promised the workers would come to work. Even if we accept this assertion as true, there is nothing in this record to support the notion that the Union had any authority or ability to order drivers to work when the August 2017 CBA did not require them to do so. Even had Hicks instructed the drivers to show up to work that nigh t, Glacier has no evidence the drivers had any duty to comply with such an instruction. Under these circumstances, no reasonable jury could conclude that Hicks's statement caused Glacier's losses. For this reason, summary 137 judgment dismissal of the tortious interference claim was appropriate. CONCLUSION We reverse the dismissal of Glacier's property destruction claims arising out of the August 11 work stoppage. Glacier alleged conduct by the Union\u2014 sabotage and the intentional destruction of property\u2014 that the NLRB has clearly h eld is not protected under section 7 of the NLRA. We affirm the dismissal of the tort claims arising out of the August 19 mat pour. Affirmed in part, reversed in part. WE CONCUR 138 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON GLACIER NORTHWEST, INC., d/b/a CalPortland, Respondent/ Cross Petitioner v. INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION NO. 174, Petitioner/ Cross Respondent. NO. 99319-0 EN BANC Filed: December 16, 2021 STEPHENS, J.\u2014This case asks us to decide whether an employer's state tort claims against its truck drivers' union are preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) 1 and whether any claims that are not preempted were properly dismissed below. Glacier Northwest Inc. 2 claims the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local Union No. 174 (Local 174) is liable for concrete product loss during a strike and for an alleged misrepresentation by a union 1 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-169. 2 Glacier does business as \"CalPortland.\" Clerk's Papers at 1. We refer to the company as \"Glacier,\" following the lead of the parties and the Court of Appeals. 139 representative that Glacier claims interfered with its ability to service a concrete mat pour. The trial court ruled the strike-related claims were preempted by the NLRA and granted summary judgment for Local 174 on the misrepresentation claims. Glacier appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed on the preemption issue but affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the misrepresentation claims. We granted review and accepted amicus curiae briefing from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Today we affirm in part and reverse in part, remanding this case to the trial court with instructions to dismiss Glacier's claims consistent with this opinion. We conclude the NLRA preempts Glacier's tort claims related to the loss of its concrete product because that loss was incidental to a strike arguably protected by federal law. We also affirm the dismissal of Glacier's mi srepresentation claims because the union representative's promise of future action was not a statement of existing fact on which those claims can be properly based and because the statement was not a proxima te cause of Glacier's losses. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY Glacier is a Washington co rporation that sells and delivers ready-mix concrete to businesses in Washington. According to its complaint, Glacier creates custom batches of concrete for each job, mixing various materials to customer specifications. The materials are first mixed in a hopper or a barrel, then moved into a ready-mix truck that continues to mix the materials until the concrete is delivered to the 140 customer. Concrete begins to harden as soon as 20 to 30 minutes after the mixing stops, so Glacier must deliver the concrete on the sa me day it is mixed or else it becomes useless. And if the concrete remains in the ready-mix trucks long enough, it will eventually harden and damage the truck's revolving drum. Glacier employs approximately 80 to 90 truck drivers to deliver concrete, and Local 174 is the exclusive union representative for Glacier's truck drivers in King County. Gl acier's lawsuit stems from Local 174's conduct both before and after the ratification of a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between Glacier and Local 174 on August 18, 2017. On August 11, 2017, du ring negotiations for the new CBA, Glacier truck drive rs went on strike by stopping work, and this strike resulted in the loss of some of Glacier's concre te. Just after the CBA was ratified and the strike en ded on August 18, 2017, a Local 174 representative allegedly misrepresented whether Glacier drivers would service a job that was rescheduled to August 19 after the August 11 strike. We examine each claim in turn. I. August 11, 2017: Work Stoppage and Concrete Loss On August 11, 2017, Glacier had a number of scheduled deliveries. Around 7:00 a.m. that morning, drivers at Glacier's Seattle, Kenmore, and Snoqualmie facilities engaged in what Glacier describes as a \"sudden cess ation of work.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 6. Glacier alleges this work stoppage occurred with truck drivers at every stage of the delivery process, including tru cks waiting to be loaded, being initially loaded with concrete, driving en route to delivery sites, and alread y at sites delivering the 141 concrete. A declaration of Adam Doyle, a dispatch coordinator, stated that drivers were scheduled to start work that day between 2:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. After learning of the strike, Doyle announced over the radio that \"'I've just been informed to advise you that we are obligated to fini sh any job that we have started.'\" CP at 208. Doyle further explained the normal process for drivers who return their trucks after making a concrete delivery, stating that the driver \"offloads his leftover concrete into a reclaimer or into an ecology block form. He then rinses out his drum, and he gets back in line for his next load.\" CP at 208. But on that day, Doyle explained that drivers all brought their trucks back between 7:00 a.m. and 7:45 a.m., and he noted that many of the trucks were left with partial or full loads of concrete. Justin Denison, the ready-mix concrete manager for all facilities in Washington, was present at the Duwamish facility when th e strike occurred. He stated that at least 16 drivers returned to the site with trucks fully loaded with concrete. While 7 of these drivers gave Glacier notice of the return of the trucks, 9 drivers left trucks without notice to Glacier. Glacier alleges Local 174 had coordinated with truck drivers to purposely time the strike when concrete was being batched and delivered in order to cause destruction of the concrete. Glacier further alleges its drivers and Local 174 were fully aware that the concrete was perishable. As a result, Glacier had to take mitigation measures to dispose of the batched concrete on site through \"constructed bunkers\" and to clean out the trucks to prevent any damage to the trucks or to its plant, e quipment, and wastewater 142 system. CP at 8.3 Glacier alleges the concrete was destroyed when it was left to harden, and Glacier had to hire trucks, br eak up the concrete, and haul it off- site. Glacier was unable to complete its deliveries that day. None of the trucks carrying the concrete were damaged because Glacier was able to take the concrete out of the trucks before it hardened. Based on this conduct, Glacier wrote warning letters to 16 drivers, citing violation of Glacier's work and safety rules. However, Glacier withdrew the letters issued to 7 of the drivers who had given notice of their abandonment or who took steps to avoid damage to the trucks. II. August 19, 2017: Mat Pour Cancellation The second set of claims in Glacier's complaint involves a statement by Local 174 Secretary Treasurer Rick Hicks concerning the \"Vulcan Project,\" a construction project in Seattle's South Lake Union for which GLY Construction Inc. was the general contractor. CP at 10. Glacier was scheduled to 3 As the Court of Appeals noted, Denison elaborated on what the strike looked like at the Duwamish facility: I was present in the yard when the loaded trucks came rolling back in on August 11. . . . It was complete chaos. We had to offload the concrete from the barrels before it \"set up.\" We had to dispose of the concrete in a timely manner to avoid costly damage to th e mixer trucks and in a manner so as not to create an environmental disaster. We had to reorganize material storage bunkers into which we offloaded the concrete. We had to deal with settling ponds, treatment of material and filter presses to handle hundreds of cubic yards of concrete. It took us 5 hours to properly handle and clean-up the mess created by the drivers. CP at 202-03. 143 perform a mat pour at the Vulcan Project on August 12, 2017.4 However, due to the strike on the morning of August 11, Glacier was forced to postpone the mat pour.5 While Glacier rescheduled the mat pour for August 19, it did not schedule drivers for work that day because it was unclear how long the strike and bargaining for the new CBA would last. On August 18, Glacier and Local 174 agreed to the terms of the new CBA, which was ratified after a vote by the drivers at approximately 11:00 a.m. The new CBA was retroactive, encompassing the period of August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2021. As the result of the CBA ratification, the strike ended and Local 174 sent out a press release, appearing on Facebook and Local 174's website, stating that the stri ke was over and the drivers were back to work. In light of the ratification of the agreement, Glacier and GLY discussed scheduling the Vulcan Project mat pour early the next day, Saturday, August 19. 4 A mat pour involves delivery of a large amount of concrete to pour a concrete slab that acts as the foundation for a commercial building. Mat pours are a substantial undertaking. They require a significant labor force to batch the concrete, move it into ready-mix trucks, and deliver the concrete to the site. They further require personnel at the delivery location, including subcontractors to pump the concrete into the foundation and inspect the foundation, as well as police officers. Mat pours require a permit from the city of Seattle, and they usually take place on Saturday nights to minimize traffic disruption. 5 Local 174 had initially considered a plan to strike on August 12. But after a conversation between Ted Herb and Rick Hicks, Local 174 decided to strike on August 11 instead to avoid unintentional harm to GLY. 144 But there were rumors that drivers would not work on August 19. Because of these rumors, both Glacier and GLY wanted assurances from the union that the mat pour would be serviced if scheduled. At Glacier's request, Ted Herb, GLY president, called Hicks around 12:35 p.m. on August 18 to discuss whether the drivers would be available that night and early the next morning to service the mat pour. Herb alleged that Hicks told him that \"'[t]he drivers have been instructed to respond to dispatch'\" and that \"'[w]e have specifically instructed the drivers to respond to dispatch.'\" CP at 1648. After Herb told Glacier of Hicks's assurances, Glacier remained concerned about drivers servicing the mat pour, and it requested that Herb call Hicks again. Herb refused this request, as he was confident in Hicks's response because Hicks had given him the same answe r twice. Glacier never spoke directly with Hicks, and Hicks denies making these statements. 6 Glacier and GLY allege they reasonably relied on Hicks's statement that the drivers would service the mat pour to dispel the rumors that drivers were not working that night. Glacier and GLY decided to move forward with the mat pour. Apparently consistent with Glacier's past practi ce in calling drivers for weekend work, Glacier's disp atch team called drivers 6 In Hicks's depo sition, he denied providing any instructions to drivers about when to return to work and specifically denied telling Herb that he had told drivers to report to work on Saturday, August 19. A driver testified that Hicks told the members to go back to work on Monday, August 21. For purposes of summary judgment, we view the facts in the light most favorable to Glacier as the nonmoving party and thus accept as true that Hicks made the alleged statements. 145 before 5:00 p.m. to tell them of their work assignments and that they would be in v iolation of their contract if they failed to report; Glacier left voice mail recordings for those who did not answer the phone. It also provided a \"call-out recording\" with start times. Just before the job was due to be serviced that night, however, Glacier found out that not enough drivers were reporting for the mat pour. While 40 to 50 drivers were needed to complete the job, only 22 reported. By 1:00 a.m., only 11 drivers were on-site ready to deliver concrete. Glacier was forced to cancel the mat pour at 1:15 a.m., and it incurred losses in labor costs and approximately $100,000 paid to GLY for the cancellation. Glacier issued disciplinary warning letters to the 39 drivers who were called but did not report, citing failure to service the mat pour and thereby \"engaging or participating in any interruption of work or production.\" See, e.g. , CP at 1696. Glacier was able to reschedule the mat pour, which was completed the next week. III. Procedural History On December 4, 2017, Glac ier filed a complaint for damages in King County Superior Court against Local 174, alleging six claims. Ba sed on the work stoppage on August 11, Glacier sued Local 174 for conversion and trespass to chattels, to rtious interference with contract, and civil conspiracy to destroy its concrete. Glacier also sued Local 174 for negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent misrepresentation, and intentional interference with contract based on Hicks's statements to Herb. Soon after, Local 174 filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (Board), alleging 146 Glacier committed unfair labor practices under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) and (3) by retaliating against Local 174 members for engaging in a protected strike; threatening to file, and th en filing, an \"objectively baseless federally preempted lawsuit\"; and abusing the discovery process to obtain information about protected activity. CP at 136. Local 174 moved to dismiss all of Glacier's tort claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted, arguing the claims were all preempted by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157, 158 (sections 7 and 8). The trial court agreed with Local 174 as to the three claims arising from the events on August 11, concluding that while those claims involved some economic harm when the concrete was destroyed, the drivers' conduct did not \"touch[] an interest so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility, such as vandalism or violence, that it clearly falls outside the protection of [the] NLRA.\" 2 Verbatim Report of Pr oceedings (VRP) (Apr. 19, 2018) at 79-80. But the court refused to dismiss the remaining claims arising from the August 19 events because they involved conduct occurring after the ratification of the CBA on August 18, and were therefore not subject to the protections and prohibitions federal law provides during the collective bargaining period. In light of the trial court's ruling on the motion to dismiss, Local 174 moved for summary judgment on the claims arising from the August 19 events. The trial court granted summary judgment dismissal of those claims primarily on state law grounds. First, as to the merits of the misrepresentation claims, the trial court ruled that the undispu ted facts showed Glacier 147 could not have reasonably relied on Hicks's statements about drivers responding to dispatch; the drivers were not required to respond to dispatch under the terms of the CBA because Glacier had not provided the requisite notice nor had it complied with seniority requirements. For the intentional interference with contract claim, the trial court concluded Hicks's statement was not intended to breach or terminate Glacier's contract with GLY, and the statement did not proximately cause interference because the drivers were not obligated under the CBA to service the mat pour. As an alternative basis for dismissal, the trial court ruled that these claims were preempted by section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a), because the trial court would have to interpret the CBA in analyzing the three claims. Glacier appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of the destruction of property claims but affirmed the dismissal of the misrepresentation claims. Glacier Nw., Inc. v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters Local Union No. 174, 15 Wn. App. 2d 393, 475 P.3d 1025 (2020). The Court of Appeals recognized the applicable preemption standard from the leading case, San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon , 359 U.S. 236, 246, 79 S. Ct. 773, 3 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1959). The court concluded that while the state claims involving conduct arguably protected by the NLRA are preempted, there was a \"'clear determination'\" from the United States Supreme Court and the Board that the destruction of concrete was unprotected conduct under section 7. Glacier , 15 Wn. App. 2d at 408 (quoting Garmon , 359 U.S. at 246). The Court of Appeals therefore reversed the trial 148 court and concluded the claims arising from events on August 11, 2017 were not preempted. Next, the Court of Appeals affirmed the summary judgment dismissal of the th ree claims arising out of Hicks's alleged misrepresentation. The Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial court's alternative ruling that these tort claims were preempted by section 301 of the LMRA, holding the claims did not necessarily require analysis of the CBA. Id. at 412- 14 (citing Commodore v. Univ. Mech. Contractors, Inc ., 120 Wn.2d 120, 126, 839 P.2d 314 (1992)). Nonetheless, the court affirmed summary judgment dismissal on the merits of ea ch of these claims on state law grounds, though its reasoning differed from the trial court's ruling. The Court of Appeals first analyzed Hicks's statement, which it recite d as \"'the drivers will respond to dispatch.'\" Id. at 414. It concluded this was a promise of future performance, which is not actionable for a fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation claim. Id. (citing Adams v. King County , 164 Wn.2d 640, 662, 192 P.3d 891 (2008)). Because both claims require a statement of existing fact, the Court of Appeals affirmed summary judgment dismissal without reaching the issues of reasonable reliance or proximate cause, as the trial court had. The Court of Appeals also affirmed the summary judgment dismissal of Glacier's intentional interference with contract claim. The Court of Appeals noted that Glacier did not have to prove a breach or termination of contract as a result of the misrepresentation because Washington cases 149 recognize a section of the Restatement (Second) of Torts allowing recovery for tortious interference that causes a performance to be more expensive or burdensome. Id. at 415 (citing R ESTATEMENT (SECOND ) TORTS \u00a7 766A (A M. LAW INST. 1979)). But it nonetheless concluded that factual causation was not met as a matter of law because the undisputed terms of the CBA showed Glacier had not complied with the notice requirements for weekend work or the listed seniority requirements. Id. at 416-17. As a result, Glacier drivers had no obligation to service the mat pour when called by dispatch. The Court of Appeals concluded that \"[e]ven had Hicks instructed the drivers to show up to work that night, Glacier has no evidence the drivers had any duty to comply with such an instruction.\" Id. at 417. Local 174 petitioned for discretionary review in this court, seeking review of the Court of Appeals holding that Glacier's claims were not preempted by the NLRA. In its answer to Local 174's petition for review, Glacier cross petitioned for review of the Court of Appeals holding affirming the summary judgment dismissal of Glacier's misrepresentation claims and intentional interference with contract claim. We granted review of both Local 174's petition for review and Glacier's cross petition for review. Glacier Nw., Inc. v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters Local Union No. 174 , 197 Wn.2d 1001 (2021). 150 ANALYSIS I. Glacier's strike-based claims are preempted because the conduct at issue is at least \"arguably protected\" by section 7 of the NLRA The trial court dismissed Glacier's three claims based on the August 11 work stoppage for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under CR 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim under CR 12(b)(6). This court reviews whether a state court has subject matter jurisdiction de novo. Dougherty v. Dep't of Labor & Indus. , 150 Wn.2d 310, 314, 76 P.3d 1183 (2003). A court may grant a motion to dismiss for the failure to state a claim under CR 12(b)(6) when \"'the plaintiff can prove no set of facts, consistent with the complaint, which entitle the plaintiff to relief.'\" Orwick v. City of Seattle , 103 Wn.2d 249, 254, 692 P.2d 793 (1984) (quoting Corrigal v. Ball & Do dd Funeral Home, Inc ., 89 Wn.2d 959, 961, 577 P.2d 580 (1978)). We accept the factual allegations in the complaint as true, but we need not accept any legal conclusions stated in the complaint. Haberman v. Wash. Pub. Power Supply Sys., 109 Wn.2d 107, 121, 744 P.2d 1032 (1987). 7 7 As the Court of Appeals recognized, both Local 174 and Glacier submitted evidence relating to Local 174's separate complaint to the Board. \"While the submission and consolidation of extraneous materials by either party normally converts a CR 12(b)(6) motion to one for summary judgment, if the court can say that no matter what facts are proven within the context of the claim, the plaintiffs would not be entitled to relief, the motion remains one under CR 12(b)(6).\" Haberman , 109 Wn.2d at 121. We may consider hypothetical facts supporting the complaint. Kinney v. Cook , 159 Wn.2d 837, 842, 154 P.3d 206 (2007). Because we dismiss the proper ty destruction claims as preempted as a matter of law, Local 174's motion to dismiss 151 A. Garmon holds that state law claims are preempted when they involve conduct \"arguably\" protected under section 7 Congress has the power to preempt state law based on the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution. U.S. C ONST . art. VI, cl. 2. In preemption cases involving federal labor law, we have noted \"our general prejudice against preemption. Federal preemption can often produce a harsh result, and we are hesitant to find no state jurisdiction absent clear congressional intent.\" Hume v. Am. Disposal Co., 124 Wn.2d 656, 664, 880 P.2d 988 (1994). Nonetheless, we have recognized that federal labor legislation may preempt state law, and the United States Supreme Court has established theories of preemption when the federal legislation does not define the precise contours of when state law is preempted. Beaman v. Yakima Valley Disposal, Inc. , 116 Wn.2d 697, 702-03, 807 P.2d 849 (1991). Because Local 174 characterizes the work stoppage by truck drivers as a strike, the preemption theory of Glacier's property destruction claims asserted by Local 174 in this case derives from Garmon , 359 U.S. 236. Garmon concerns preemption based on sections 7 and 8 of the NLRA, protecting concerted activities in collective bargaining and prohibiting unfair labor practices respectively. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157 (\"Employees shall have the right to . . . engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\"), 158(a)(1) (\"It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer . . . to under CR 12(b)(6) is not conv erted into a summary judgment motion. 152 interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guar anteed in section 157 of this title.\").8 \"Collective bargaining, with the right to strike at its core, is the essence of the federal scheme.\" Div. 1287, Amalg. Ass'n of Coach Emps. v. Missouri ., 374 U.S. 74, 82, 83 S. Ct. 1657, 10 L. Ed. 2d 763 ( 1963). And a walkout generally is a type of strike possibly protected by section 7. E. Chi. Rehab. Ctr., Inc. v. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd. , 710 F.2d 397, 402-03 (7th Cir. 1983); see also Bob Evans Farms, Inc. v. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd. , 163 F.3d 1012, 1023 (7th Cir. 1998). The Court's recognition of preemption of state claims for damages based on sections 7 and 8 stems from the need to avoid ev en the potential risk of interference with the development of national labor policy under the expertise of the Board. Garmon , 359 U.S. at 243-44. In Garmon , the Supreme Court considered whether sections 7 and 8 preempted an employer's state law claim for injunction and damages resulting from a union pick eting the employer's place of business. Id. at 237-38. The state court had 8 The Supreme Court has recognized two other types of preemption under federal labor law that are potentially implicated in this case. First, state claims are preempted when they involve conduct occurring during labor disputes that Congress intended to be left unregulated and \"'to be controlled by the free play of economic forces.'\" Lodge 76, Int'l Ass'n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers v. Wis. Emp't Relations Comm'n , 427 U.S. 132, 140, 96 S. Ct. 2548, 49 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1976) (quoting Nat'l Labor Relations Bd. v. Nash-Finch Co ., 404 U.S. 138, 144, 92 S. Ct. 373, 30 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1971)). Second, Section 301 of the LMRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a), provides federal courts with exclusive jurisdiction over lawsuits involving the violation of collective bargaining agreements. 153 awarded damages, but no injunction, based on unfair labor practices under state tort law. Id. at 239. The Court noted that its role in deciding whether a state law claim is preempted is to limit the \"potential conflict\" between differing results of the Board and state courts in recognition that \"Congress has entrusted administration of the labor policy for the Nation to a centralized administrative agency, armed with its own procedures, and equipped with its specialized knowledge and cumulative experience.\" Id. at 242. Respecting the expertise of the Board in interpreting national labor law, the Court highlighted that courts are not the proper forum for deciding whether particular conduct is subject to section 7 or section 8 in the first instance. Id. at 244-45. The Court therefore ruled that \"[w]hen an activity is arguably subject to [section ] 7 or [ section ] 8 of the Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted.\" Id. at 245 (emphasis added). Because the state lawsuit alleged that the union's picketing was an unfair labor practice, and because that conduct was at least arguably prohibited under section 8, the Court held that the state lawsuit was preempted by federal law. Id. at 246. And the Court noted it was irrelevant that the Board had declined to exercise jurisdiction over the case; as long as there was not a \"clear determination\" from the Board that the conduct was protected by section 7 or prohibited by section 8, a state lawsuit is preempted to avoid any state adjudication of conduct that would potentially conflict with the development of federal 154 labor law. Id. The Court further highlighted that the Board's ability to grant only injunctive relief\u2014rather than damages\u2014was irrelevant and, indeed, possibly weighed in favor of preemption: \"since remedies form an ingredient of any integrated scheme of regulation, to allow the State to grant a remedy here which has been withheld from the National Labor Relations Board only accentuates the danger of conflict.\" Id. at 247. Pursuant to the principles announced in Garmon , labor conduct is \"arguably protected\" under section 7 when the party asserting preemption \"advance[s] an interpretation of the Act that is not plainly contrary to its language and that has not been 'authoritatively rejected' by the courts or the Board.\" Int'l Longshoremen's Ass'n v. Davis , 476 U.S. 380, 395, 106 S. Ct. 1904, 90 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1986) (quoting Marine Eng'rs Beneficial Ass'n v. Interlake S.S. Co., 370 U.S. 173, 184, 82 S. Ct. 1237, 1243, 8 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1962)). Following Garmon , this court has stated the preemption standard in terms of whether the activity is \"'potentially subject to federal regulation.'\" Beaman , 116 Wn.2d at 704 (quoting Garmon , 359 U.S. at 246). Regardless of the precise formulation, the principle animating Garmon preemption is the avoidance of potential conflict with the Board's development of federal labor law. B. The Court of Appeals erred by characterizing the conduct here as unprotected intentional destruction of property subject to the \"local feeling\" exception to preemption Garmon preemption is not absol ute. The Supreme Court recognizes two exceptions to its preemption 155 analysis: (1) where \"the a ctivity regulated was a merely peripheral concern of the Labor Management Relations Act\" or (2) \"where the regulated conduct touched interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, we could not infer that Congress had deprived the States of the power to act.\" Garmon , 359 U.S at 243-44. The second exception is potentially at issue here. The \"local feeling\" exception involves state jurisdiction over claims to \"grant compensation for the consequences, as defined by the traditional law of torts, of conduct marked by violence and imminent threats to the public order.\" Id. at 247. This exception recognizes that \"the compelling state interest, in the scheme of our federalism, in the maintenance of domestic peace is not overridden in the absence of clearly expressed congressional direction.\" Id. (citing Int'l Union, United Auto., Aircraft & Agric. Implement Workers v. Russell , 356 U.S. 634, 78 S. Ct. 932, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1030 (1958); Youngdahl v. Rainfair, Inc ., 355 U.S. 131, 78 S. Ct. 206, 2 L. Ed. 2d 151 (1957); United Auto., Aircraft & Agric. Implement Workers v. Wis. Emp't Relations Bd., 351 U.S. 266, 274, 76 S. Ct. 794, 100 L. Ed. 1162 (1956); United Constr. Workers v. Laburnum Constr. Corp ., 347 U.S. 656, 74 S. Ct. 833, 98 L. Ed. 1025 (1954)). The Supreme Court has observed that the focus of this exception is on whether the conduct involved \"'intimidation and threats of violence.'\" Id. at 248 (quoting Russell , 356 U.S. at 640). In a footnote in Garmon , the Court further elaborated on the type of intimidating or violent conduct warranting a preemption exception. Id. at 248 n.6. While it did 156 approvingly cite a case that briefly mentioned destruction of property as warranting state jurisdiction, Wis. Emp't Relations Bd. , 351 U.S. at 274 (noting \"[t]he dominant interest of the State in preventing violence and pro perty damage cannot be questioned\"), the Court framed the state interest as applying to conduct involving some sort of violence or danger that undermines public order. Garmon , 359 U.S. at 248 n.6 (describing the conduct Laburnum , 347 U.S. at 666-68, as \"violent conduct\" and \"involving violence or threat s of violence\" and noting that the Court had limited damages to the \"the violent nature of the conduct\" of mass picketing in Russell , 356 U.S. at 638-42). The Court has further described this exception to Garmon preemption as creating a category of conduct that is not protected under section 7: \"The Court has held that state jurisdiction to enforce its laws prohibiting violence, defamation, the intentional infliction of emotional distress, or obstruction of access to property is not pre-empted by the NLRA. But none of those violations of state law involves protected conduct.\" Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. San Diego County Dist. Council of Carpenters , 436 U.S. 180, 204, 98 S. Ct. 1745, 56 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1978) (footnotes omitted). If the wo rk stoppage in this case fits within this category of unprotected conduct, then it is clearly not preempted and the state law claims may go forward. The Court of Appeals concluded that intentional destruction of property was within the category of unprotected conduct covered by the \"local feeling\" exception in Garmon . See Glacier , 15 App. 2d at 408 (citing Lodge 76, Int'l Ass'n of Machinists & 157 Aerospace Workers v. Wis. Emp't Relations Comm'n , 427 U.S. 132, 136, 96 S. Ct. 2548, 49 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1976)). Glacier argues th is is the proper analysis based on the United States Supreme Court's description of the type of claims states may exercise jurisdiction over. It is co rrect that the United States Supreme Court and some Washington Court of Appeals cases have included the destruction of property in describing matters over which states may exercise jurisdiction. Lodge 76 , 427 U.S. at 136 (\"Policing of actual or threatened violence to persons or destruction of property has been held most clearly a matter for the States.\"); Nat'l Labor Relations Bd. v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp. , 306 U.S. 240, 253, 59 S. Ct. 490, 83 L. Ed. 627 (1939) (\"The employees had the right to strike but they had no license to commit acts of violence or to seize their employer's plant. . . . But in its legal aspect the oustin g of the owner from lawful possession is not essentially different from an assault upon the officers of an employing company, or the seizure and conversion of its goods, or the despoiling of its property . . . .\"); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. United Food & Commercial Workers Int'l Union , 190 Wn. App. 14, 26, 354 P.3d 31 (2015) (stating that \"property damage\" could possibly have provided a basis for the \"local feeling\" exception). But Garmon 's reference to destruction of property was articulated primarily in terms of the violence of the labor conduct, which in turn implicated the State's interest in the domestic peace. 359 U.S. at 248 n.6. The Supreme Court has also allowed state claims to proceed for conduct that is considered \"outrageous.\" Farmer v. United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners, Local 25, 430 U.S. 290, 301, 97 S. Ct . 1056, 51 L. Ed. 2d 338 158 (1977) (intentional inflict ion of emotional distress claim not preempted when based on outrageous conduct, threats, and intimidation); see also Linn v. United Plant Guard Workers, Local 114 , 383 U.S. 53, 61-62, 86 S. Ct. 657, 15 L. Ed. 2d 582 (1966) (malicious libel). Properly understood, the \"local feeling\" exception links the State's interest in awarding damages for conduct arguably covered by the NLRA to violent or outrageous conduct. Garmon , 359 U.S. at 248 n.6 (emphasizing that in Laburnum \"there is nothing in the measure of damages to indicate that state power was exerted to compensate for anything more than the direct consequences of the violent conduct\"). If Glacier's claim could be characterized as based solely on the intentional destruction of property, the drivers' conduct may be the sort of tortious conduct marked by violence or outrageousness that invokes the State's interest in the maintenance of the public peace and that is categorically unprotected under the NLRA. See Moore v. Gen. Motors Corp. , 739 F.2d 311, 316 (8th Cir. 1984) (concluding that the \"local feeling\" exception did not apply to claims of fraud and misrepresentation because the complaint did \"not involve outrageous or violent conduct\"). This claim would be stronger if Glacier's trucks or facilities had been intentionally destroyed. But the incidental destruction of products during a strike, as opposed to property damage for its own sake, has not been sufficient to invoke the \"local feeling\" exception in any United States Supreme Court case. If viewed as product damage incidental to the strike, the drivers' conduct is closely tethered to the exercise of their section 7 rights and, at the same time, is attenuated 159 from the State's general interest in regulating violent conduct, such as vandalism, which is the core concern of the \"local feeling\" exception. While the complaint alleges that the drivers \"willfully and intentionally interfered\" with Glacier's right to property by returning concrete trucks with perishable product inside, the description of this conduct as willful and intentional is not controlling of the preemption question. CP at 14. Even th ough we must accept the facts stated in the complaint as true, Garmon emphasizes that the \"'type of conduct'\" involved is what determines the preemption analysis. 359 U.S. at 247-48; see also Amalg. Ass'n Ry. & Motor Coach Emps. v. Lockridge , 403 U.S. 274, 292, 91 S. Ct. 1909, 29 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1971) (\"It is the conduct being regulated, not the formal description of governing legal standards, that is the proper focus of concern.\"). The description of conduct as \"intentional\" does not equate to violent or outrageous conduct that is contemplated by the \"local feeling\" exception. Moreover, the concrete product damage caused by the drivers' conduct cannot be viewed in isolation; viewed in the context of the strike, it does not clearly come within \"local feeling\" exception, so it is not clearly or categorically unprotected conduct under section 7 of the NLRA. We disagree with the Court of Appeals that the conduct here is clearly and categorically unprotected. The appeals court's discuss ion of when intentional destruction of property invokes the \"local feeling\" exception is too expansive, and we must look further to Board precedent to assess whether the protected nature of the work stoppage and resulting concrete destruction has been \"'authoritatively rejected' by the 160 courts or the Board.\" Int'l Longshoremen's Ass'n , 476 U.S. at 395 (quoting Marine Eng'rs, 370 U.S. at 184). As will be discussed, if the conduct surrounding the work stoppage is arguably protected under the NLRA then the Act preempts Glacier's state law claims. C. The work stoppage is arguably protected under section 7 because it involves two competing principles recognized in Board precedent The Court of Appeals misread Board precedent in concluding the drivers' conduct was clearly unprotected under section 7. Specifically, the court improperly \"harmonized\" two competing principles recognized in the cases: (1) employees must take reasonable precautions to protect an employer's plant, property, and products and (2) economic harm may be inflicted through a strike as a legitimate bargaining tactic. Because it is unclear where the strike in this case falls on the spectrum between these two principles, the strike is, at least, arguably protected conduct under section 7. In analyzing preemption of Glacier's conversion and trespass to chattels claims, the Court of Appeals correctly noted that under Board precedent, \"employees [must] take reasonable precautions to protect the employer's plant, equipment, or products from foreseeable imminent danger due to sudden cessation of work.\" Bethany Med. Ctr., 328 N.L.R.B. 1094, 1094 (1999). In Marshall Car Wheel , for example, the Board considered whether an employer's discharge of employees v iolated 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (3) for firing employees as a result of protected strike activity. Marshall Car Wheel & Foundry Co ., 107 N.L.R.B. 314, 315. In that case, the employer used a 161 cupola furnace to melt me tals to make car wheels, pipe, and other products. Id. About half of the employees walked out on a strike during a time when the cupola was particularly active. While there was no damage to the property, the Board concluded that the strike was unprotected because the employees failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the plant from imminent danger resulting from the cupola being unattended at a busy time. Id. The other competing principle involved here is that employees are allowed to cause some economic harm to effectuate a strike and gain leverage in bargaining. Johnnie Johnson Tire Co ., 271 N.L.R.B. 293, 294-95 (1984); see also Falls Stamping & Welding Co. v. Int'l Union, United Auto. Work ers, Aerospace & Agric. Implement Workers of Am., Region II, 744 F.2d 521 (6th Cir. 1984) (\"Federal labor law clearly permits employees to inflict economic harm on an employer for purposes of collective bargaining. \"). In the context of a work stoppage, the Board stated in Johnnie Johnson that \"[t]he effect of such a work stoppage on production is incidental and does not preclude protection of the Act so long as the employees involved take reasonable precautions to avoid eminent danger to the employer's physical plant which foreseeably would result from the work stoppage.\" 271 N.L.R.B. at 295. Moreover, the Board has confirmed that the possible loss of perishable product from a work stoppage does not render the strike unprotected as long as the strike is done for bargaining purposes. Lumbee Farms Coop., Inc . 285 N.L.R.B. 601, 606- 07 (1968) (diminution in the quality of cheese as a result of walkout did not render strike unprotected); 162 Cent. Okla. Milk Producers Ass'n , 125 N.L.R.B. 419, 435 (1959) (\"No unusual ci rcumstance, such as aggravated injury to pers onnel or premises, was created by the fact that th e milk handled is perishable and loss might be sustained; loss is not uncommon when a strike occurs.\" (footnote omitted)). Glacier attempts to distinguish these cases because none of them involved act ual or proven product loss. Instead, it points to the Board decision the Court of Appeals relied on and quoted from at length in its application of these principles. Boghosian Raisin Packing Co., 342 N.L.R.B. 383 (2004). According to the Court of Appeals, in Boghosian , the Board ruled that an employee work stoppage was unprotected because the employees failed to take reasonable precautions to protect a produ ct from spoiling in order to intentionally damage that product. Id. at 396-97. The Court of Appeals reasoned that Glacier's allegations similarly involved unprotected conduct because the drivers allegedly failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the equipment, plant, or batched concrete and intentionally stopped work at a time when the concrete was being loaded. Glacier, 15 Wn. App. 2d at 411. In Boghosian , the Board reviewed an administrative law judge's (ALJ) decision that an employer violated section 8 of the NLRA by not reinstating employees who went on strike and by withdrawing its recognition of the union as a collective bargaining representative. 342 N.L.R.B. at 384. The employer owned a raisin plant, and it fired certain employees after a work stoppage resulted in the spoilage of some of the employer's raisins. Id. The ALJ stated that in addition to the employees losing 163 protected status under section 8(d), the strike was unprotected\u2014and the employer therefore could take adverse action against the striking employees\u2014 because the employees failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the raisins and \"deliberately time[d] their strike to cause product damage.\" Id. at 397. However, given the ALJ's initial conclusion that the employees had lost protected status for failure to comply with other parts of section 8(d), the ALJ noted that this finding was not \"cri tical to this decision.\" Id. at 396. On review, the Board agreed that no violation occurred because the strikers lost their protected status under section 8(d). Id. at 385. As a result, the Board found it \"unnecessary to pass on the judge's alternative finding that the discharge of the strikers was lawful because they had intentionally walked out in the middle of their shift in order to damage the Respondent's product.\" Id. at 387 n. 13. The analysis quoted by the Court of Appe als is dicta from the ALJ that was also not adopted by the Board; it is therefore of limited value and not persuasive here. More persuasive are the other Board decisions holding that incidental product damage does not render a strike unprotected. Glacier points to one federal Court of Appeals case and one Illinois state case to argue that abandonment of concrete during a strike is unprotected. Resp't/Cross-Pet'r Glacier's Suppl. Br. at 5 (citing Nat'l Labor , n.4 (2d 1983); Rockford Redi-Mix, Inc. v. Teamsters Local 325 , 195 Ill. App. 3d 294, 551 N.E.2d 1333, 1334-41, 141 Ill. Dec. 805 (1990)). In Marsden , the Second Circuit held t hat a work stoppage was unprotected because the employees failed to associate 164 the work stoppage with a specific demand related to the conditions of employment . 701 F.2d at 242-43. In a footnote, the court hypothesized that the strike probably would have been unpro tected had it occurred during a delivery of concrete even if a proper demand were made. Id. at 242 n.4. This dicta is unpersuasive as it merely cites to Marshall Car Wheel without recognizing or fully analyzing the competing principle that strike activity generally will, and must be allowed to, inflict some economic harm including product loss. And in the other case, Rockford , an intermediate appellate court in Illinois concluded that a work stoppage by concrete delivery drivers was unprotected because it caused destruction of the trucks and bankrupted the company. Rockford , 551 N.E.2d at 1334-40. Although we are not bound by an out-of-state decision, this authority is also unpersuasive because Glacier's trucks were not destroyed during the strike and the loss was more in line with other cases involving merely incidental product damage. The Board has concluded in the context of strikes involving concrete business losses that the fact that conduct brings \"inconvenience and economic loss\" does not render it unprotected. ABC Concrete Co ., 233 N.L.R.B. 1298, 1304 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted). Given the importance of viewing the work stoppage conduct in its full context, the Board is the proper place to balance the competing principles. Read together, the relevant Board decisions show that economic harm due to the possibility of a product perishing does not render a strike clearly unprotected under section 7. These decisions further recognize that when a strike is done for collective bargaining 165 purposes\u2014which Glacier does not contest occurred in this case\u2014the Board must balance the competing principles in context and \"[t]he economic pressure flowing from such a strike must be weighed against the goals sought to be achieved by the strikers.\" Lumbee Farms , 285 N.L.R.B. at 506; see also Labor Relations Bd. v. A. Lasaponara & Sons , 541 F.2d 992, 998 (2d Cir. 1976) (stating that a work stoppage was a protected strike because, unlike extreme cases of economic coercion like Marshall Car Wheel , \"the economic pressure . . . clearly failed to reach a degree so grossly disproportionate to the goal sought to be achieved t hat it renders the conduct unprotected\"). To fully analyze whether the conduct is unprotected under section 7 in this case , we would need to engage with the facts as a matter of first impression, balancing the economic pressure against the strikers' legitimate interest. Based on a full factual analysis, we might determine that the strike activity was unprotected because the drivers did not take reasonable precautions to protect Glacier's product or trucks. On the other hand, the strike could also be viewed as protected because the concrete loss was incidental damage given the perishable nature of the concrete. In any event, Garmon makes clear that this kind of fact-specific determi nation is a function of the Board in the interest of the uniform development of labor policy. See Columbia Portland Cement Co. v. National Labor Relations Bd. , 915 F.2d 253, 257-58 (6th Cir. 1990) (balancing these competing principles and fully evaluating the facts to conclude that a work stoppage was protected activity when the employees took reasonable precautions to protect equipment 166 even though the equipment was damaged).9 State court adjudication would potentially interfere with important federal interests. Because it is debatable whether the work stoppage resulting in concrete loss was a protected strike, the drivers' conduct is at least arguably protected under sect ion 7. Therefore, we conclude that the NLRA preempts Glacier's tort claims. D. Glacier's inability to obtain damages in a Board proceeding supports, rather than undermines, the argument for preemption Glacier argues preemption of its state tort claims is unwarranted because this would leave it with no remedy for its losses. But Garmon rejected the notion that an employer's inability to obtain a remedy undermines a finding of preemption, noting that \"[e]ven the States' salutary effort to redress private wrongs or grant compensat ion for past harm cannot be exerted to regulate activities that are potentially 9 At oral argument, Glacier appeared to acknowledge that the balancing of relevant principles is fact specific. For example, when posed with a hypothetical about a grocery store employee walkout that resulted in the foreseeable loss of perishable fish, Glacier suggested such a walkout might be protected activity because it merely caused \"produ ction loss\" rather than being intentionally timed to cause the concrete loss as alleged by Glacier. Wash. Supreme Court oral argument, Glacier Nw., Inc. v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters Local Union No. 174 , No. 99319-0 (Sept. 21, 2021), at 32 min., 14 sec. through 34 min., 18 sec., audio recording by TVW, Washington State's Public Affairs Network, http://www.tvw.org. This distinction does not rest on any categorical or legal difference between the hypothetical facts and the present facts. Instead, Glacier's argument highlights why factual distinctions should be drawn by the Board and not by state courts. 167 subject to the exclusive federal regulatory scheme.\" 359 U.S. at 247. In fact, the Court in Garmon concluded that the inability of the Board to grant a remedy for losses flowing from arguably protected conduct supports preemption of that claim in state court: \"to allow the State to grant a remedy here which has been withheld from the National Labor Relations Board only accentuates the danger of conflict.\" Id.; see also Wis. Dep't of Indus., Labor & Human Relations v. Gould, Inc ., 475 U.S. 282, 286, 106 S. Ct. 1057, 89 L. Ed. 2d 223 (1986) (stating that \"the Garmon rule prevents States not only from setting forth standards of conduct inconsistent with the substantive requirements of the NLRA, but also from providing their own regulatory or judicial remedies for conduct prohibited or arguably prohibited by the Act\"). This court has expressly recognized that the failure to obtain a remedy is not determinative of Garmon preemption. Beaman, 116 Wn.2d at 710-11 (citing Garmon and noting that \"the fact that a given remedy cannot be granted by the [Board] does not necessarily mean his claim is not preempted\"). Again, Garmon emphasized that it is the \"'type of conduct'\" involved, rather than the remedy, that is controlling for the preemption analysis. 359 U.S. at 247-48. Relatedly, Glacier argues that preemption is unwarranted because it has no means of bringing its claim to the Board, insisting that this case is similar to Sears. In Sears, the Court considered whether a trespass claim for a union's peaceful picketing was preempted because it was either arguably prohibited or protected under the N LRA. 436 U.S. at 190. Because the Board's consideration of the union's picketing would have focused on the objective of the 168 picketing, rather than the location of the picketing and whether a trespass occurred, the Court concluded that the controversies presented to the Board and the state court were different. Thus, the Court held that the state trespass claim was not preempted under the \"arguably prohibited\" prong of Garmon . Id. at 198. However, the Court in Sears emphasized the important values preserved by the preemption doctrine in deciding whether the picketing was arguably protected under sect ion 7. Because state courts should not interfere with conduct actually protected by the act, the Court observed that \"[c]onsiderations of federal supremacy, therefore, are implicated to a greater extent when labor-related activity is protected than wh en it is prohibited.\" Id. at 200. The Court highlighted the potential overlap in what the state court wo uld consider and what the Board may eventually consider: Prior to granting any relief from the Union's continuing trespass, the state court was obligated to decide that the trespass was not actually protected by federal law, a determination which might entail an accommodation of Sears' property rights and the Union's [section] 7 rights. In an unfair labor practice proceeding initiated by the Union, the Board might have been required to make the same accommodation. Id. at 201. Nonetheless, the Co urt concluded that this potential for overlapping jurisdiction did not exist in that case, in part because the employer was unable to have the Board decide whether the trespass was protected. Id. The Board's determination of whether the trespass constituted protected conduct would have 169 occurred only if the union had filed a complaint with the Board that the employ er had engaged in unfair labor practices. But becaus e the union responded to the employer's demands to leave by stating that it would not cease picketing unless it were forced to do so by legal process, the Court concluded the employer had no \"reasonable opportunity to either invoke the Board's jurisdiction . . . or else to induce his adversary to do so.\" Id. The Court therefore held preemption of a state claim was not warranted \"over arguably protected conduct when the party who could have presented the protection issue to the Board has not done so and the other party to the dispute has no acceptable means of doing so.\" Id. at 202-03. Sears is distinguishable from this case because Local 174 has filed a complaint with the Board alleging retaliation for the exercise of Local 174 drivers' section 7 rights, and the Board has deferred action pending the outcome of this litigation. 10 Amicus correctly points out that this complaint accentuates the possible conflict with the Board. Br. of Amicus Curiae at 10-14. Local 174's Board complaint alleges retaliation by Glacier in response to conduct protected by section 7, in part based on the 10 The Board's deferral of a complaint is typical while the outcome of a concurrent or underlying state action is pending in state court; deferral does not suggest the Board intends for the state court to exercise jurisdiction over a case involving arguably protected conduct. Instead, it serves the orderly administration of justice. In Garmon , for example, the Court concluded that the state court action was preempted even though the Board had completely declined to exercise jurisdiction, rejecting the California state court's conclusion that the Board declining jurisdiction showed that state jurisdiction was proper. 359 U.S. at 238. 170 lawsuit, so the Board will likely need to address the protected section 7 conduct in its decision. While Glacier argues that a state court must first decide the merits of its claims, the summary judgment motion pertains only to the misrepresentation claims, not the property loss claims possibly preempted by the NLRA. See Resp't/Cross-Pet'r Glacier's Answer to Br. of Amicus Curiae at 18-20; Bill Johnson's Rests., Inc. v. Bd. 731, 737 2161, 76 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1983) (noting the Board may enjoin suits that are preempted by federal law). The sole basis for dismissal of the property loss claims is federal preemption, without a merits determination. We hold that those claims involve arguably protected labor activity and are therefore preempted under section 7 of the NLRA. Having found NLRA preemption of Glacier's claims arising from the August 11 events, we now turn to the three tort claims arising out of the alleged misrepresentation by Local 174's representative, Rick Hicks, following the union 's approval of the CBA on August 18. II. The trial court properly dismissed Glacier's state claims alleging misrepresentation and intentional interference with contract The trial court dismissed Glacier's three remaining claims for negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent misrepresentation, and intentional interference with contract at the summary judgment stage. We review summary judgment rulings de novo. Binschus v. Dep't of Corr. , 186 Wn.2d 573, 577, 380 P.3d (2016) Wn.2d 337, 341, 883 P.2d 1383 (1994)). 171 \"Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Id. We view the facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to Glacier as the nonmoving party. Id. 11 A. Glacier's misrepresentation claims fail because the alleged misrepresent ation was a promise of future performance, rather than a statement of existing fact Glacier's claims for ne gligent and fraudulent misrepresentation should be treated together because they share a requirement in common that forms the basis of the dismissal for both claims. A fraudulent misrepresentation claim 12 and a negligent 11 As noted, the trial court's ruling was based both on state and federal law. At this stage of the proceedings, no party challenges the Court of Appeals's conclusion that section 301 of the LMRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a), does not preempt the tort claims based on Hicks's statements. Moreover, because these claims must be dismissed on their merits under state law, we avoid any possible conflict with section 301 regardle ss of whether that section may preempt these tort claims. 12 To prove fraudulent misreprese ntation, the plaintiff has the burden by clear and convincing evidence to prove the following elements: (1) representation of an existing fact; (2) materiality; (3) falsity; (4) the speaker's knowledge of its falsity; (5) intent of the speaker that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff; (6) plaintiff's ignorance of its falsity; (7) plaintiff's reliance on the truth of the representation; (8) plaintiff's right to rely upon it; and (9) damages suffered by the plaintiff. Stiley v. Block , 130 Wn.2d 486, 505, 925 P.2d 194 (1996). 172 misrepresentation13 claim both require the misrepresentation to be one of existing fact; a promise of future performance is therefore not an actionable statement. See Adams, 164 Wn.2d at 662 (future promise or agreement for the scope of a surgery was not a statement of existing fact for a fraud claim); see also Havens v. C&D Plastics, Inc ., 124 Wn.2d 158, 182, 876 P.2d 435 (1994) (statement of existing fact is a prerequisite to a negligent misrepresentation claim). The Court of Appeals recognized that Hicks's statement was a promise of future performance. But the court did not precisely identify Hicks's statement to GLY President Ted Herb about whether the drivers would respond to dispatch and service the mat pour on August 19. Specifically, the court misquoted Hicks's response to Herb's inquiry as saying, \"'the drivers will respond to dispatch.'\" Glacier , 15 Wn. App. 2d. at 414. The Court of Appeals may have been quoting Herb's deposition testimony describing how he relayed Hicks's statement to another GLY employee: \"I said that I asked him the question on would drivers respond to the pour and was told that 13 The elements for negligent representation are similar and must also be proved by cl ear and convincing evidence: (1) the defendant supplied information for the guidance of others in their business transact ions that was false, (2) the defendant knew or should have known that the information was supplied to guide the plaintiff in his business transactions, (3) the defendant was negligent in obtaining or communicating the false information, (4) the plaintiff relied on the false information, (5) the plaintiff's reliance was reasonable, and (6) the fa lse information proximately caused the plaintiff damages. Ross v. Kirner , 162 Wn.2d 493, 499, 172 P.3d 701 (2007). 173 the drivers will respond to dispatch.\" CP at 713. But Herb actually quoted Hicks's statement slightly differently. In response to Herb's question about servicing the mat pour, Herb alleged that Hicks responded in a similar way twice: \"'[t]he drivers have been instructed to respond to dispatch'\" and \"'[w]e have specifically instructed the drivers to respond to dispatch.'\" CP at 1648. Glacier claims the Court of Appeals's misquote carries legal significance because Hicks's actual statement was a statement of existing fact\u2014that the drivers were instructed to respond to dispatch\u2014rather than a promise of future co nduct. From a purely grammatical standpoint, this may be a fair interpretation, but in context Hicks's alleged statement still expresses a promise of future action, namely that the drivers would service the mat pour. Herb was asked by Glacier to contact Hicks because there were rumors that drivers would not work on August 19, the day after the new CBA was ratified. Both Glacier and GLY wanted assurances that the mat pour would be serviced if it were scheduled. In his declaration, Herb stated he told Hicks that Glacier was \"'trying to reschedule the mat pour for tonight and there's some concern about whether it will properly be serviced. So, I have been asked to call and get a response and some information on what will happen.\"' CP at 1647. Herb's ultimate question to Hicks was \"'will you service the mat pour or not?'\" CP at 1647. Both Glacier and GLY sought an assurance from Hicks as to whether drivers would service the mat pour the next day, not whether he had in fact instructed them to do so. Herb's understanding of Hicks's statement as a promise for future performance 174 was expressed in his deposition in which he stated that Hicks told him the drivers would respond to dispatch. And Glacier's ready-mix sales manager, Greg Mettler, said, \"Responding to dispatch means reporting to work. Mr. Herb stated specifically that he had asked Mr. Hicks if the drivers were going to report to work the mat pour, and he was told that they were instructed to do so.\" CP at 1611. Therefore, considered in context, Hick s's response was a promise for future performance by th e drivers to report to work, not a statement of presently existing fact. Absent any false or misleading representation of present fact, Glacier's claims fail as a matter of law. B. The intentional interference was not a proximate cause of Glacier's losses With respect to Glacier's claim for intentional interference with its contract rights, the Court of Appeals correctly recognized that any misrepresentation by Hicks was not a proximate cause of Glacier's losses relating to the cancellation of the mat pour. Generally, br each or termination of the contract is an element of an intentional interference claim. Leingang v. Pierce County Med. Bureau, Inc ., 131 Wn.2d 133, 157, 930 P.2d 288 (1997). 14 However, Washington has recognized that an interference 14 The elements of such a claim include: (1) the existence of a valid contractual relationship or business expectancy; (2) that defendants had knowledge of that relationship; (3) an intentional interference inducing or causing a breach or termination of the relationship or expectancy; (4) that defendants interfered for an improper purpose or used improper means; and (5) resultant damage. Leingang, 131 Wn. 2d at 157 . 175 resulting in a more expensive or burdensome performance of a contract may form the basis of an intentional interference claim, and this is what Glacier alleged in its complaint. See Eserhut v. Heister , 52 Wn. App. 515, 518, 762 P.2d 6 R ESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF TORTS \u00a7 766A)); CP at 19 (Glacier's complaint alleges that the intentional interference made Glacier's performance \"more expensive or burdensome.\"). We agree with the Court of Appeals that Glacier cannot show proximate cause in this case. Whether an alleged misrepresentation was a proximate cause of Glacier's losses requires Glacier to show both factual and legal cause. Schooley v. Pinch's Deli Mkt., Inc., 134 Wn.2d 468, 478, 951 P.2d 749 (1998) . Factual cause is met if \" but for\" the defendant's actions, the injury would not have occurred. Id. The legal causation analysis asks \"whether, as a matter of policy, the connection between the ultimate result and the act of the defendant is too remote or insubstantial to impose liability. A determination of legal liability will depend upon '\"mixed considerations of logic, common sense, justice, policy, and precedent.\"'\" Id. at 478-79 (quoting King v. City of Seattle , 84 Wn.2d 239, 250, 525 P.2d 228 (1974) (quoting 1 T HOMAS ATKINS STREET , FOUNDATIONS OF LEGAL LIABILITY 100, 110 (1906))). The section of the Restatement (Second) of Torts discussing legal causation in the context of an interference claim provides further guidance, focusing on whether the alleged losses were within the foreseeable risk of harm created by the misrepresentation. R ESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF TORTS \u00a7 548A cmt. a (A M. LAW INST. 1977) (\"In general, the misrepresentation is a leg al cause only of those 176 pecuniary losses that are within the foreseeable risk of harm that it creates.\"). While proximate cause is generally left to the jury, \"where the facts are not in dispute, legal causation is for the court to decide as a matter of law.\" Schooley , 134 Wn.2d at 478. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Glacier, as we must in reviewing Local 174's motion for summary judgment, there is some evidence that Glacier would not have scheduled the mat pour for August 19 \"but for\" Hicks's misrepresentation and assurance that the drivers wo uld respond to dispatch. But even assuming Hicks falsely communicated to Herb that the drivers woul d respond to dispatch, the causal relationship between Hicks's statements and Glacier's losses remains too attenuated as a matter of law. Given the context of the work stoppage and the CBA, the losses due to the canceled mat pour were not a foreseeable result of Hicks's statements. First, under the terms of the CBA, the losses were not a foreseeable result of Hicks's statements because the drivers were not require d to service the mat pour even if they had been instructed to respond to dispatch. Glacier failed to comply with a number of the CBA provisions that would allow it to require the drivers to work a weekend job, 15 and Hicks's statement about instructing the drivers to respond to 15 The Court of Appeals correctly analyzed the terms of the CBA at length, specifically the CBA's requirements for advance notice and seniority call-out order to force drivers to work weekends. Glacier , 15 Wn. App. 2d. at 416-17. Glacier does not dispute the Court of Appeals's conclusion that it failed to comply with the CBA by not providing the requisite notices or calling in the correct seniority order to force dr ivers to work the mat pour on August 19. 177 dispatch did not mention the terms of the CBA, which were known to both Glacier and the union. Second, the losses were not a foreseeable result of Hicks's statement because the union representative lacked the authority to bind the employees to work without regard to the CBA conditions. 16 While Glacier could have required its employees to work, there is no allegation it took any steps to do so consistent with the CBA. Glacier relies solely on Hicks's alleged statement as the basis for the drivers to report to work, but as recognized this statement could not obviate compliance with the CBA. We affirm the lower court's summary judgment dismissal of Glacier's intentional interference claim. CONCLUSION We reverse in part and affi rm in part the decision of the Court of Appeals. Specifically, we hold that the NLRA preempts the property destruction claims because the concrete damage occurred incidental to a work stoppage and was th erefore at least arguably protected under the NLRA. Summary judgment of dismissal is therefore appropriate as to those claims. Dismissal is also appropriate as to the remaining claims for misrepresentation and intentional interference because Hic ks's statements were a 16 Melanie O'Regan, vice president of Glacier, stated in her declaration that Local 174, thro ugh Hicks, has control over whether drivers will return to wo rk following a work stoppage. Accepting as true that Hicks had control over when the strike ended, Local 174 did not control the conditions under which drivers would be offered jobs or would take jobs once the strike had ended because that is governed by the CBA. It appears that at least some of drivers also had the understanding that they were not required to report to the mat pour that night. 178 promise for future perfo rmance, and Glacier cannot show that Hicks's statemen ts proximately caused its losses. We remand this case to the trial court with instructions to dismiss Glacier's claims consistent with this opinion.

(f) Agreement covering employees in the building and construction industry It shall not be an unf air labor practice under subsections (a) and (b) of th is section for an employer engaged primarily in the building and construction industry to make an agreement covering employees engaged (or who, upon their employment, will be engaged) in the building and construction industry with a labor organization of which building and construction employees are members (not established, maintained, or assisted by any action defined in subsection (a) as an unfair labor practice) because (1) the majority status of such labor organization has not been established under the provisions of section 159 of this title prior to the making of such agreement, or (2) such agreement requires as a condition of employment, membership in such labor organization after the seventh day following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of the agreement, whichever is later, or (3) such agreement requires the employer to notify such labor organization of opportunities for employment with such employer, or gives such labor organization an opportunity to refer qualified applicants for such employment, or (4) such agreement specifies minimum training or experience 191 qualifications for employment or provides for priority in opportunities for employment based upon length of service with such employer, in the industry or in the particular geographical area: Provided , That nothing in this subsection shall set aside the final proviso to subsection (a)(3): Provided further, That any agreement which would be invalid, but for clause (1) of this subsection, shall not be a bar to a petition filed pursuant to section 159(c) or 159(e) of this title. (g) Notification of intention to strike or picket at any health care institution A labor organization before engaging in any strike, picketing, or other concerted refusal to work at any health care institution shall, not less than ten days prior to such action, notify the institution in writing and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service of that intention, except that in the case of bargaining for an initial agreement following certification or recognition the notice required by this subsection shall not be given until the expiration of the period specified in clause (B) of the last sentence of subsection (d). The notice shall state the date and time that such action will commence. The notice, once given, may be extended by the written agreement of both parties. "}
