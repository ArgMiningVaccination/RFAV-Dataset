This emphasis was later translatedinto a rather simplistic formula, TULIP, which stoodfor total depravity, unconditional election, limitedatonement, irresistible grace, and perseverance of thesaints. Karl Barth (1886-1968) did more than anyother Reformed theologian to interpret the centralityof the Word, i.e., Jesus Christ as the savior and trans-former of the world and the source of absolute truthas found in scripture, the Word of God. Presbyterianintellectualism stems from an ethos in which eachperson is accountable for understanding his or herfaith in Jesus Christ. Hence, it is not surprising thateducation is prized among Presbyterians. Presbyterian polity is based on representative democ- racy\u2014a unique feature of this tradition. The name\"Presbyterian\" comes from a New Testament Greekterm meaning \"elders\" (\"presbyters\"). Elders, deacons,and clergy are all ordained and have different functions,but not in a hierarchical sense. Elected governing bod-ies for the Presbyterian Church (USA) are the GeneralAssembly (G.A.) on the national level; the Synods onthe regional level (16 total); and the Presbyteries (173total), which are statewide or cover smaller areas. 1The Presbyterian Church (USA) Tradition Religious Beliefs and Healthcare Decisions By Abigail Rian Evans Contents The Individual and the 4 Patient-Caregiver Relationship Family, Sexuality, and Procreation 5 Genetics 7 Organ and Tissue Transplantation 8 Mental Health 8 Medical Experimentation 9 and Research Death and Dying 10 Special Concerns 11 Part of the \"Religious Traditions and Health- care Decisions\" handbook series published by the Park Ridge Center for the Study of Health, Faith, and EthicsAbigail Rian Evans, M.Div., Ph.D., L.H.D., is Charlotte W. Newcombe Professor of Practical Theology and Academic Coordinator of Field Education at Princeton Theological Seminary.THEPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH (USA) T RADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS\"Decently and in order\" is the byword of Presby- terian governance, including that of local congre-gations (11,333 total). Presbyterian polity isreflected in the way Presbyterians address healthissues at every level. No stance taken by a govern-ing body is binding on its members\u2014\"God alone isLord of the conscience\"\u2014but positions are offeredfor members' instruction and serious consideration. The connectionalism of the Presbyterian Church is not parochial and has motivated it totake leadership in ecumenical movements thatinclude the student Christian movement, WorldCouncil of Churches (WCC), World Alliance ofReformed Churches, National Council ofChurches (NCC), and Churches Uniting in Christ. FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS CONCERNING HEALTH CARE A 1988 statement by the Presbyterian Church (USA) summarizes the importance of health thisway: \"Good health\u2014physical, mental, and spiritual\u2014is both a God-given gift and a social good of spe-cial moral importance, one that derives its impor-tance from our biblical and theological heritageand from its effect on the opportunities available tomembers of society. Good health is a basic needand an essential purpose of human and societaldevelopment\" (PC (USA) 1988, 524). TheReformed tradition holds that God alone has thepower to heal, and that [God's] instruments encom-pass the medical sciences, including nursing, phar-macy, surgery, and psychiatry (Vaux 1984, 121).This perspective is firmly rooted in the thought of John Calvin, who championed community hospitals and criticized those who taught that physicians andmedicine were instruments of evil: \"Anyone with an'ounce of brains,' even a pagan,\" he wrote, \"knowsthat these are gifts of God\" (Smylie, 212). 2 Although the major emphasis of Presbyterians related to health is educational, they have redis-covered liturgical resources for healing andadded a healing service to the 1993 Book of Common W orship . Since the Presbyterian Church is connection- al, positions taken on each level of governanceare generally reflective of Presbyterians views,but individuals may offer different positions on various health issues. In addition, there arenational organizations such as the PresbyterianHealth, Education and Welfare Association(PHEWA), which has ten different health net-works. National offices of the denomination thataddress these topics are the Office of HealthMinistries, Social Justice & Witness, Theology &Worship, Ecumenical Mission Agencies, Board of Pensions, Medical Benevolence Fund, and theWashington Office. In addition, local congrega- tions are often in partnership with communityagencies and may develop collaborative stanceswith them on controversial health issues. The PC(USA) ecumenical partnerships also influence its positions on various issues. TheNCC, WCC, and World Alliance of Reformed Churches all develop positions, study papers,and programs on health issues. Given this vastarray, it is not possible to claim that G.A. papersalone are representative of this denomination. Infact, there is some doubt about how representa-tive they are, since the majority of the presbyter-ies may not even be aware of G.A. positions and,when they are, many may disagree with them. In any case, it would be difficult without years of dedicated research to assemble all the rele-vant materials from the many presbyteries andother denominational groups. 3Moreover, infor- mation on Presbyterian program initiativesthrough the Office of Health Ministries (see\"Presbyterian organizations that address healthissues,\" below) reflects a broader and moreaccurate picture of Presbyterian commitment,theology, and involvement in health care. Thesummary of positions on various health issuesthat follows is based on materials received fromall of the aforementioned sources. It is impor-tant to note, as well, that the G.A. monitorsmajor health issues, and Presbyterian responsesto them, in order to keep the denomination 2accountable. The excellent educational materials produced by PC(USA) keep these health issuesin the forefront of the denomination's aware-ness. The Office of the General Assembly reviewed its minutes of overtures that the G.A. adoptedfrom 1988 through 1997 and noted all references to addictions (except gambling), alcohol and alcoholism, drugs and drug use,HIV/AIDS, \"Life Abundant,\" and other relevant papers and reports, health, tobacco, medical costs,ecology and environment, population, hunger,contraception, mental illness, genetics, child andchildren, disability, organ donation, aging and older adults. The themes which appeared in thesedocuments are: Health education and the empowerment of indi- viduals and communities who use health-careresources; Health-care delivery systems and health systems reform; Church employee health; Child health; Health of older adults; Alcohol, tobacco, and other drug abuse; HIV/AIDS; International health; Advocacy for persons with disabilities (including serious mental illness) and disability prevention; Environmental health; Spirituality, worship, and health; Congregational health ministries; Coordination of health ministries. 4 The Presbyterian Church has also focused on health education and empowerment of individu-als and communities. Life Abundant strongly encourages individual Presbyterians to take per-sonal responsibility for their health throughlifestyle choices and to assume responsibility forhealth care by asking questions of providers andusing health resources prudently. It also urgesG.A. agencies to develop educational and pro-grammatic resources to help the people, congre- gations, and middle governing bodies \"under-take [these] mission responsibilities.\" 5 The 1999 G.A. monitoring report also urged colleges and seminaries to reflect on healthissues and health ministries in their curriculaand encourage health promotion for their stu-dents and their entire communities. PRESB YTERIAN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS HEAL TH IS SUES ThePresbyterian Health, Education and W elfare Association (PHEW A) is a voluntary member- ship organization created by the G.A. of aPC(USA) predecessor denomination in 1956. PHEWA is dedicated to the enactment of socialjustice and welfare ministries. Its Board ofDirectors consists of a representative to eachsynod, a representative from each of its networks(see below), and ex-officio members from theNational Ministries Division of PC(USA). TheExecutive Director, who has an office in thenational offices of the Presbyterian Church(USA), also serves as the Associate for SocialWelfare Organizations in the Social Justice Pro- gram Area of the PC(USA). PHEWA has ten net- works that address particular concerns; some ofthe networks are organized around advocacy andsupport of persons with specific health-relatedconcerns. PHEWA's purpose is to provide 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTER4 THEPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH (USA) T RADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSresources for Presbyterians involved in social justice ministries, which reach out to and advo-cate for those who have been marginalized orexcluded by society. (The work of individualnetworks is discussed at various points in thisbooklet.) ThePresbyterian W ashington Office is the public policy, information, and advocacy officeof the General Assembly of the PC(USA). Itstask is to advocate, and help the church to advo-cate, the social witness perspectives and policiesof the Presbyterian G.A. in relation to legislationand legislative deliberations. The WashingtonOffice \"leads the work of the PC(USA) in advo-cating for national health systems reform.\" 6It holds periodic briefings concerning issues facingCongress. TheOffice of Health Ministries (OHM) was established in the 1980s to initiate programsand administer grants generated from a large bequest, given decades earlier, which had been used for medical mission work overseas. In theearly 1980s, the office began to address bothinternational and domestic healthcare issues.Later, domestic priorities became the responsi-bility of a new office of health ministries. Theemphasis shifted from national to regional andlocal health programs, and the office functionedmore like a foundation, giving seed grants. OHMis also a resource agency that produces videos,study guides, and materials for use by local con-gregations, presbyteries, and seminaries. In addi- tion, it trains consultants to work with localgroups in initiating health ministries programs. OHM started a Health Ministries in Theological Education program in collaboration with eightPresbyterian seminaries. Since Reformed theology is a covenantal the- ology, this emphasis becomes the basis for defining the patient-healthcare professional rela-tionship as well as the relationship between thepastor and the individual. Paternalism is to beavoided; patient choice and autonomy are pre- eminent. Informed consent and confidentialitymark these relationships in such a way thataccountability and responsibility rest with boththe client/patient and the healthcare profession- al. Many Presbyterian bioethicists, includingKenneth Vaux and William F. May, have dis- cussed these issues. Extensive material in mybook, Redeeming Marketplace Medicine , addresses these concerns, and James Smylie alsoalludes to them in his book chapter on healthcare and the Reformed faith.THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE PATIENT -CAREGIVER RELATIONSHIP5 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERThe two major issues that have dominated debate in the PC(USA) since the late 1970s have been abortion and homosexuality. Theseissues have evoked the greatest disagreementamong individual Presbyterians, as well asbetween the hierarchy of the church and its constituents. With regard to homosexuality, Presbyterians generally take a moderate position on sexualconduct, seeing sexual relations within the con-text of monogamous marriage. Yet, ironically,PC(USA) has been very ambiguous in its stance towards homosexuals. It has opposed their ordi-nation to church office, while claiming to acceptas church members allpeople who profess Jesus Christ as Lord. In point of fact, celibate homo-sexuals may be ordained. Recent debates overhomosexuality have reaffirmed these views. The1999 \"fidelity and chastity\" amendment toPC(USA)'s Book of Order (or constitution) requires all ordained ministers and officers ofthe church to remain faithful within heterosexu-al marriage and chaste if they are not married.Thereby it excludes practicing homosexuals from holding office in the church. Amendment(A), passed by the 2001 G.A., would haverescinded this position and left the ordinationstandards regarding sexual practice to each pres-bytery; but it was defeated by the presbyteries inFebruary 2002. (Changes to the Book of Church Order require approval by two-thirds of the presbyteries.) CLINICAL I SSUES Contraception In 1960, contraception was affirmed as a right of married couples. In 1983 the G.A. stated thatfamily planning constituted good stewardship ofglobal resources and that means of contracep-tion should be available to all. 7Abortion and the status of the fetus Official G.A. papers have referred to abortion as a tragic choice or act of last resort that requiresjustification; they have not treated it as aninherent right. Between 1970 and 1992, therehas been a series of G.A. resolutions concerningabortion. \"Presbyterians have struggled with theabortion issue for more than 25 years, beginningin 1970 when a G.A. statement declared that'the artificial or induced termination of pregnan-cy is a matter of the careful ethical decision ofthe patient, . . . and therefore should not berestricted by law.'\" 8 The Presbyterian Church (USA) 1983 report, \"Covenant and Creation: Theological Reflectionson Contraception and Abortion,\" adopted by theG.A., reflects a strong \"pro-choice\" position. It affirms that \"the decision to terminate a pregnan- cy may be an affirmation of one's covenantresponsibility to accept the limits of humanresources.\" . . . In 1992, the General Assemblymoderated its policy toward abortion (Vaux, 1993,282-3). The report of the Special Committee onProblem Pregnancies and Abortion stated that \"abortion ought to be an option of last resort\" (PC(USA) 1992, 368) but that \"no law or administra-tive should limit access to abortions\" (p.372). . . . In 1994, the General Assembly failed to adopt a resolution opposing the abortion of viablefetuses; instead, the General Assembly affirmed itspast abortion-related actions (Kearns, 3). 9 The 209th G.A. (1997), while refusing to call for a ban on the late-term abortion procedureidentified by some as of counsel to the church and ourculture that the procedure known as intact dila-tion and extraction (commonly called 'partialbirth' abortion) of a baby who could live outsideFAMILY , SEXUALITY , AND PROCREATIONthe womb is of grave moral concern and should be considered only if the mother's physical life is endangered by the pregnancy.\"10The Advisory Committee on Litigation and the Advisory Com-mittee on Social Witness Policy will make thisrecommendation to the 214th G.A. (2003): \"Theending of a pregnancy after the point of fetalviability is a matter of grave moral concern to usall, but may be undertaken only after prayer,and when necessary, to save the life of thewoman, to preserve the woman's health in cir-cumstances of a serious risk to the health of thewoman, to avoid fetal suffering as a result ofuntreatable life-threatening genetic anomalies,or in cases of incest or rape.\" 11 Surprisingly, a scientific sample of Presbyter- ian pastors, elders, and specialized ministers in2001 showed the following results: \"Few pan-elists oppose post-viability abortions (abortionsafter the fetus has developed to where it could,with medical help, live outside the womb) underall circumstances, ranging from 25% of elders to16% of specialized clergy. Circumstances inwhich the most panelists would permit post-via-bility abortions include: to save the mother's life(elders, 96%; the mother's health(63%; if would have [if] the physician soadvises (45%; 50%).\" 12 Individual presbyteries have issued position papers and resolutions on abortion. For exam-ple, the Presbytery of Baltimore adopted a Free-dom of Choice Resolution in 1978. It also sup-ported \"continuation of freedom of choice inmatters of pregnancy for the Medicaid patient inMaryland.\" 13 One of the PHEWA networks, Presbyterians Affirming Reproductive Options (PARO), \"wel-comes those who support the full range ofreproductive options that ensure that every childis loved and wanted. [The network is] commit-ted to ensuring that the policy of the PC(USA) isarticulated, understood, and preserved for futuregenerations,\" 14and has taken liberal positions supporting women's choice on abortion. At theother end of the Presbyterian spectrum, Presby- terians Pro-Life, as its name implies, has takenconservative positions. Sex selection None of the G.A. resolutions on abortion sup-port abortion for sex selection (PC(USA) 1992,368). (Of course, a couple may fail to divulgethat the sex of the fetus is their reason for seek-ing an abortion.) New reproductive technologies All currently available reproductive technologies and therapies, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF),surrogate motherhood, and artificial insemina-tion by donor (AID), are considered acceptable,though individual Presbyterians may opposethem. Presbyterians are encouraged to engage infurther study of the issues posed by these tech-nologies. 15 Cloning Heretofore, human cloning has not been consid-ered a reproductive choice. Presbyterian schol-ars such as Nancy Duff and I have slightly dif-ferent perspectives on this controversial proce-dure, though the G.A. has not yet taken an offi-cial position. \"The Presbyterian Church (USA)has never affirmed human cloning for eitherreproductive or therapeutic purposes. In fact thechurch to this point has not taken a position on human cloning, although past policies on relatedissues would direct extreme caution in suchendeavors.\" 16 Presbyterian minister Nancy Duff, Associate Professor of Theological Ethics at Princeton Theological Seminary and a Reformed scholar and ethicist, has testified on human cloningbefore the National Bioethics Advisory Commis- sion. For Duff, the question is whether cloning isa gift from God or an attempt by humans to playGod. In any event, no matter how successful we become at putting together the right biological material to replicate life, it is God, not we, whocalls life into being. 17She advises caution, cites the importance of examining the reasons for 6 THEPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH (USA) T RADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS7 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERThe General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) supports 'the discovery of new genetic knowledge that can improve thetreatment and eradication of disease andincrease the quantity and quality of food sup-plies' and has committed itself to exploring 'thetheological and ethical issues involved in suchresearch and development' (PC (USA) 1990,776). A report received by the General Assembly in 1983 said, 'In the area of medical genetics,priority should be given to the prevention ofdisease via family planning, genetic counselingand fetal diagnosis . . . The pursuit of \"superior\"human beings through genetic manipulationshould be explored only with great caution, if atall' (PC (USA) 1983a, 26).\" 23human cloning, and concludes that there shouldbe no ban on research into human cloning but rather a moratorium until its benefits areknown. 18As Duff points out in an essay, \"Seek- ing the Significant in the Factual,\" we need torecognize what is morally significant in thedetails. 19To avoid pitting science against religion is paramount. Even if we attempt to play God,we cannot usurp God's place; by whatever means any child is born, he or she is a child ofGod. 20 I agree totally that we need not fear where truth and scientific research will lead, and thatGod is the source of all truth. However, in two book chapters I have categorically opposed human cloning while rejecting several misguid-ed reasons for opposing it: 1. \"Let nature take its course.\" We already modify nature, consuming genetically engineered milkand soybeans, and many other such foods. 2. \"Knowledge is dangerous\u2014it opens Pandora's box.\" The pursuit of knowledge is good; its appli-cation may not be. Knowledge is neutral and can be used for good or evil; we need not fear it. 3. \"Cloned humans would not be unique.\" Cur- rent genetics indicates that the adult clone may bea physical replication, but is psychologically anentirely different person. The genotype is identicalbut the phenotype is different. 21 I oppose cloning for these reasons: (1) it is not a necessary solution to any human tragedy;(2) it fosters a reductionistic rather than a holis-tic view of human nature, while treating peopleas means rather than ends; (3) it threatens thevalue placed on our individuality; (4) it createspressure to use this technology and make it agod; (5) it may undermine the nuclear family byredefining human relationships; (6) it may bedone for morally wrong motives; (7) it may fur-ther separate us from God the Creator; and (8)it may cause a loss of genetic diversity and areduction of genetic sturdiness\u2014changes thatcould adversely affect the human race. 22 GENETICS8 THEPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH (USA) T RADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSBecause 'transplantation of donor organs and tissues uniquely makes possible the saving of lives, the improvement of health, theimprovement of the quality of life, and the giv-ing of sight; and [because] organ and tissuedonation may be perceived as a positive out-come of a seemingly senseless death and is ofcomfort to the family of the deceased . . . the[General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church(U.S.A.)] endorses the donation of organs andtissues in keeping with Christian faith' (PC (USA) 1989, 625).\" 24 Individual congregations have conducted adult education classes on the importance oforgan donation, and have worked to promotedonation in cooperation with the SouthwestOrgan Procurement Foundation and state-basedkidney foundations. For decades Presbyterians, especially throughthe efforts of PHEWA's Presbyterian Serious Mental Illness Network (PSMIN), have advocat-ed for full acceptance and support of those withmental health problems. Individual Presbyteri-ans and denominational judicatories haveworked with agencies and groups such as theNational Alliance for the Mentally Ill on bothlocal and national levels, and with Pathways to Promise, the Northern Virginia InterfaithConference Unit on Mental Illness, and numer-ous other groups. The aim of these efforts hasbeen to eliminate prejudice toward and exclu- sion of those with mental health problems,which affect Presbyterians in about the sameproportion as the general population. As part ofits stance on healthcare reform, the PresbyterianChurch pushed for parity in insurance coverageof mental illness and physical illness. The 200th General Assembly (1988) of the PC(USA) approved a report and resolution that addressed the call of the church to ministry andmission with those affected by serious mentalillness, and with their families and friends. Thereport stated, \"The church is called to an aware-ness of the scope of mental illness, to a strategyfor opening doors of understanding, and to a uniquely significant ministry of health andhealing. It has powerful resources of faith andpresence in that calling.\" The report added,\"The religious community is in a unique posi- tion to be the bridge between the clinical settingand life in the home community. Congregationsexist in every American county and urbanneighborhood.\" A comprehensive strategy for the church, according to the report, should involve the communal life of the church in healing fellow-ship, at study, and in worship. It should includeservice and advocacy in the wider life of society,where the church seeks equity, justice, and thepreservation of humane values in health mattersgenerally and in response to mental illnessspecifically. In fulfilling this ministry and mission, the church, at all levels, is called to . . . Seek heightened awareness and visibility for the presence and needs of the severely mentally ill,exploring possibilities for collaborative effort inconsciousness-raising with other denominations aswell as public social service agencies and secularorganizations . . . Develop and implement innovative approaches and programs for ministry and mission with theseverely mentally ill . . . ORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATION MENTAL HEALTH9 THEPARKRIDGE CENTER Support increased understanding and the devel- opment and training of leadership, through ecu-menical effort and utilizing societal programs, [and]through education and training in seminaries . . .

Get involved in public policy processes, actively advocating in behalf of the mentally ill at all levelsof government for adequate support for servicesand for legislation on housing, nutrition, job train-ing and placement, as well as for increased fund-ing for research. 25In addition, the 211th PC(USA) General Assembly (1999) \"directed the Advisory Commit-tee on Social Witness Policy, in consultationwith appropriate entities, to develop a compre-hensive serious mental illness policy, includingjustice issues and full participation in the life ofthe church, and report to the 217th GeneralAssembly (2005).\" 26 To implement its agenda of advocacy and support, PSMIN has a newsletter, holds periodicmeetings, and offers educational opportunitiesacross the country to raise awareness of mentalhealth. PSMIN makes available informational,educational, and liturgical resources. The General Assembly of the PresbyterianChurch (USA) has urged that scientific research and development be guided by the val-ues of survival, life enhancement, justice, andequal access, and that the basic 'life possibilitiesand needs of everyone' take precedence overprolonging or beautifying 'the lives of a few' (PC(USA) 1983a, 27). The Assembly advocates that'human subjects be given the strongest humanprotections, including full information about theresearch, and that their consent be obtainedwithout coercion' (PC (USA) 1983a, 27).\" EMBRYON IC STEM CELL RESEARCH \"The General Assembly 'discourages develop- ment of human embryos and their use forexperimentation except in those cases of clearlydemonstrable benefit where no . . and embryonic research[should] with caution and sensi-tivity' (PC (USA) 1983a, 27).\" 27 The debate about stem cell research in the Presbyterian Church has not yet reached the mag-nitude of the abortion issue. However, those who oppose abortion usually oppose embryonic stemcell research as well. Believing abortion of fetus-es to be immoral, they fear that embryonic stemcell research would be used to justify it. Somewho hold this perspective believe the embryo is a potential person warranting full protection. The ethical acceptability of deriving stem cells from the tissue of aborted fetuses is closely con-nected to the morality of abortion. Some of thosewho oppose using stem cells derived from abortedfetuses argue that abortion for any reason iswrong. Those who so believe also fear that thepossibility of donating the fetus for stem cellresearch will encourage women to have moreabortions or justify abortions that otherwise couldnot be justified. They believe that researcherswould be complicit in an immoral act. In addition,they may believe that a woman seeking an abor-tion should not have the right to give consent tothe use of the tissue because she has forfeited hermaternal trusteeship by aborting the fetus. 28MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION AND RESEARCH10 THEPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH (USA) T RADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSThose who support embryonic stem cell research believe that the benefits to those withParkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injuries, stroke, burns, heart disease, anddiabetes outweigh the objections and costs. The 213th G.A. (2001) of the Presbyterian Church (USA) approved a policy that affirmedthe use of fetal tissue and embryonic tissue forvital research; however, the G.A. noted thatrespect for life includes respect for the embryoand fetus, and decisions about embryos andfetuses need to be made with responsibility andextensive education. With careful regulation, the G.A. affirmed, the use of human stem cell tissue for research mayresult in the restoring of health to those suffer-ing from serious illness. Together with its affirmation of the possibilities of stem cell research, the policy [of PC(USA)] raisesmoral concerns about stem cell research. It there-fore states three limitations on stem cell researchusing embryonic sources: [1] \"The interests orgoals to be accomplished by using human embryos[must] be compelling and unreachable by other means\" . . . [2] Embryos should be created forthe express purpose of research. \"Embryos result-ing from infertility treatment [that are] to be usedfor such research must be limited to thoseembryos that do not have a chance of growing intopersonhood because the woman has decided todiscontinue further treatments and they are notavailable for donation to another woman for per- sonal or medical reasons, or because embryonic tissue should be legallyprohibited.\" 29 Within this framework the G.A. affirmed its support of stem cell research, recognizing thatthis research moves into a new and challengingfrontier such that informed public dialogue andequitable sharing of information on the resultsof stem cell research are imperative. It is onlywith such public dialogue and information shar-ing that our diverse society can build a founda-tion for responsible movement toward this fron-tier that offers enormous hope and challenge. 30 The Reformed faith proclaims God as thebeginning, center, and end of our existence. We die, not to oblivion, but to God's presence. Death is the announcement that our work isdone, that we have completed our earthly min-istry. Though fighting disease and prematuredeath is noble, our faith asks us to receive deathas if entering a new life established by God whois faithful' (Vaux 1991:203).\" 31These over lifeand death. The PC(USA) acknowledges the real-ity of pain, suffering, illness, and death, andinvites Presbyterians to look for meaning inthese experiences and live in an attitude of hopein and connection with God's ultimate power. 32 In 1995 the Christian Faith and Life Associa- tion, Congregational Ministries Division ofPC(USA), produced an eleven-session study guide, In Life and Death W e Belong to God: Euthanasia, Assisted Suicide, and End of LifeIssues . 33After its publication, responses to this document were collected, and the 2001 G.A.asked for a six-year study on end-of-life issuesand, when the budget permits, a public policystatement. SUICIDE, ASSISTED SUICIDE , AND ACTIVE EUTHANASIA In Active Euthanasia and Health Care Reform: Testing the Medical Covenant , Presbyterian min- ister and ethicist William F. May picks up someof the central issues around death and dyingDEATH AND DYING11 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERthat have troubled the Presbyterian Church. Although carving out a Reformed theologicalposition is not May's express intent, that doesseem to be what in fact he is doing. A centralquestion is whether the medical covenantrequires active euthanasia. May's answer is no. 34 His principal theological argument is that nei-ther life nor the quality of life are the centralissues, for God is the ultimate good. Hence, bothpositions are wanting; circumstances should dic-tate whether sustaining physical life at all costsor allowing to die is more fitting. The right todie under certain circumstances echoes themotif of compassionate care, as well as a fear ofabuses resulting from active euthanasia, foundin earlier PC(USA) \"Covenant of Life\" docu-ments. As May points out, \"active euthanasia goes beyond the middle course of the right to die and insists upon the right to be killed; therefore, theduty or privilege to kill.\" 35Although the recent Oregon law allowing physician-assisted suicide(PAS) has numerous protective side constraints,nevertheless an exploitation of the practice mayresult in undue pressures on patients to endtheir lives. While May has argued broadly against active euthanasia, I argue that suicide is self-killingand oppose voluntary active euthanasia on thatground. 36I summarize the arguments for and against PAS, but would agree with May that PASshould be opposed. What is rather remarkableabout the PC(USA)'s stance on active euthanasiais its disapproval of this practice from a moder-ate position, whereas its stance on abortionwould be considered a liberal one. This church,unlike the Roman Catholic Church, does notadhere to Cardinal Bernardin's view of life as a\"seamless garment\" from conception to death. SPECIAL CONCERNS HEALTHCARE PR OMOTION AND REFORM The Presbyterian Church is concerned about healthcare reform on both national and locallevels. As the challenges of healthcare deliveryhave grown, the PC(USA) is responding to thechanging sociopolitical healthcare environment from within the framework of the Reformedfaith. The goal is \"shalom\" for all people, evenin the face of changes, barriers, and frustrationsthat exist in the healthcare system. Such docu-ments as Life Abundant , \"Resolution on Christ- ian encourage churchwide health min- istry and healthcare advocacy, and call on thechurch to reclaim its heritage of healing and wholeness. 37 Although the Health Care Access Campaign38 represented a broad set of aims, denominationssuch as PC(USA) were concerned that health-care reform be grounded in a broad definitionof health as a value. From their perspective, good health includes physical, mental, and spiri-tual well-being. It is both a gift of God and asocial good of special moral importance. Itsvalue derives from the Hebrew and Christianscriptures. Good health is viewed as a basicneed and an essential purpose of human andsocietal development; it allows us to fulfill ourrole in society. We have personal moral respon-sibility for our health and concern for thehealth of others. We are stewards of God's cre-ation and need to adopt healthier lifestyles. Inaddition, society as a whole and its constituentpublic, private, and voluntary organizations havea moral obligation to promote a healthy envi-ronment and to ensure the availability of health-giving resources for everyone. The free-market system is insufficient to provide an adequatesupply and equitable distribution of theseresources. We are responsible to work towardthe best achievable standards for, and the most12 THEPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH (USA) T RADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSeffective performance of, the healthcare system. The G.A. has long been a strong advocate of comprehensive healthcare reform. In 1999 itreaffirmed the need for a healthcare system thatprovides physical and mental health care that isadequate, affordable, and accountable: \"Thechurch needs to continue to raise the issue of comprehensive, systemic health-care reform insupport of the key values of access, quality, andaffordability set forth in the Resolution onChristian Responsibility and a National MedicalPlan (G.A. Minutes 1991).\" 39PC(USA), along with others, embraced the principles of aNational Medical Plan that would encompasseligibility, benefits, financing, reimbursement,resource development and delivery system struc-ture, policy and administration, assessment andassurance of quality, management of utilization,cost containment, choice, and linkages, and thatwould include a plan for the transition from theold system to the new. 40 The 1999 pronouncement is full of specifics. It directs the Office of Health Ministries and theBoard of Pensions to develop resources that will help individuals make informed choices aboutthe use of \"complementary\" medical practices.The Washington Office is instructed to continue public policy advocacy for a national healthcaredelivery system, as proposed in Life Abundant (1988), and for the development of guidelinesthat will lead to the provision of culturally rele-vant health care for people of color. 41 The pronouncement further instructs the church to \"develop a comprehensive serious mental illness policy, including justice issues andfull participation in the life of the church . . .\" 42 Citing 1991 G.A. Minutes, it also advocates\"[p]rotection of uninsured persons by expandingMedicare and Medicaid benefits and engaging intort reform.\" 43 Individual presbyteries have also advocated healthcare reform. Addressing New Mexico'sU.S./Mexico Border Health Advocacy Initiative,Sierra Blanca Presbytery highlighted problemsand needs that include disease, immunization,potable water and sewage disposal, the economy,and effective action. 44Baltimore Presbytery has worked with the Maryland healthcare initiativeto advocate universal health care for all. 45 TREATMENT OF WOMEN AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE The Presbyterian Church has taken a strong leadership role in confronting domestic violenceagainst, and the objectification of, women(though domestic violence may be violenceagainst men as well as women). One of its firstposition papers was the report of various specialtask forces and the Council on Women, \"Viola-tions against the Image of God,\" submitted tothe 1986 G.A. As the people of God, committed to love, justice, and service in the world, members of the Presby-terian Church (USA) are challenged to demon-strate a new concern for women in the U.S. and inother countries who are being sexually exploitedthrough prostitution, tourism, military presenceand through some of the activities of transnationalcorporations. Tourism in the Third World oftenreinforces racist, sexist and imperialistic stereo-types which destroy the family of God, encourag-ing some people to feel and act superior to peoplein countries visited. 46 On the basis of this report, the G.A. approved a series of recommendations: to put an end toall the practices listed above; to promote respon-sible tourism; to advocate change in theexploitive policies of transnational corporations;and to \"affirm and continue the church's com-mitment to study and provide funds for econom-ic justice and self development projects forwomen inasmuch as the roots of exploitation areoften found in economic injustice.\" 47 In 1991, the Church focused on another aspect of violence against women in \"Con-fronting Violence Against Women: The Church's13 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERCalling.\" In response Family Violence,\" \"[t]he 203rd G.A. (1991)urged the churches to study the paper ondomestic violence and establish programs torespond to domestic abuse in their communi-ties.\" 48There were two reasons for addressing the issue of violence against women. The first reason is pastoral. People are hurting. People need to know that they can come to their church for support and information, and when they come, they need to find church leaders pre-pared to assist them. The second reason is moral.In many previous statements and programs, thePC(USA) has addressed issues of war and peace and opposed violence in many forms, including[violence in] the family. However, we have toooften been silent and have lacked the courage todo all we can do to prevent violence againstwomen. We must strengthen our commitment toaddress violence against women. The ReformedBiblical tradition gives the church a clear mandateto address violence against women. 49 In 2001, the 213th G.A. approved a policy statement on healing domestic violence, Turn Mourning Into Dancing! The statement defines \"the many types of relationships in whichdomestic violence is used as an inclusive term tobroadly encompass the abuse found in each ofthese familial relationships as well as violencethat occurs in sibling and dating relationships.\" 50 \"Domestic violence has several manifesta- tions. Domestic violence is always a violation ofthe power God intended for good. It is a patternof assaultive and coercive behavior, includingphysical, sexual, and psychological attacks aswell as economic coercion, that adults or adoles-cents use against their intimate partners or vul-nerable family members. In abusive relation-ships, perpetrators use their power in ways that inflict harm on others for the perpetrator's ownneed for power and control.\" 51 This comprehensive report, which covers every area of domestic violence, recommendsthat the church confront the tragedy of domesticviolence through education and training,research, and advocacy. It recommends trainingfor local church members and judicatories onevery level as part of the effort to eradicatedomestic violence. 52 ADDICTION Gambling In 1936, the G.A. of a denominational predeces-sor of the PC(USA) spoke out against the evil ofgambling in one of its early statements on healthissues, and the Presbyterian denominations havecontinued to issue statements and policy paperson this problem ever since. Including gamblingamong healthcare issues reflects PC(USA)'swholistic definition of health. Gambling is con-sidered an addiction, and addictions are consid-ered diseases with spiritual, psychological, socio-logical, and physiological dimensions. Of the twogeneral types of addiction\u2014process or behavioraladdiction and substance addiction\u2014gambling isthe former. Twenty-eight states now allow gambling. 53 Often the growth of casinos leads to prostitution. The life of those who work the casinos is very difficult. Perfection is expected; every moment ismonitored on closed circuit TV. Gambling doesnot create new jobs, but rather forces peopleinto debt. 54 One of the main difficulties with gambling is that some people lose, while others win withouthaving earned their winnings. The study paperon gambling points out that the basic principleat the heart of gambling is dishonesty: you getsomething for nothing. It goes on to say that weshould not become rich at someone else'sexpense. 14 THEPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH (USA) T RADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSOpposition to gambling is based on a theolo- gy of stewardship in which the fruits of labor yield a response of gratitude to God, not a hopefor gain. Gambling dulls conscience and powersof reason and leads to more gambling. Risk-taking is part of the spirit of adventure, which can bring us to new heights of discovery.Yet, as with many other virtues, its dark side can be a vice. In gambling, risk is for the sake of unearned rewards. It becomes a way of life forthose who gamble consistently\u2014it promises athrill, the bonus of great rewards, but yields thedevastation to self (and family) of huge losses. 55 Alcoholism The Presbyterian Church has given major atten- tion to substance addictions, especially addictionto alcohol. In fact, as of 1986 the G.A. hadaddressed alcohol problems twenty-five times,and it has revisited the problem at least twicesince then. 56Its major 1986 report was born of the recognition that \"alcohol-related problemscontinue to be viewed as a social and healthissue of major concern to the PresbyterianChurch (USA).\" 57 Historically, the Presbyterian Church often reflected society's views towards alcohol. It was astrong supporter of the temperance movement;later, with the founding of Alcoholics Anony-mous in 1935, it accepted the view of alco-holism as a disease rather than a moral weak-ness. 58The Presbyterian Church considers alco- holism a disease with spiritual, psychological,and sociological dimensions, and has recognizedalcoholism as a major health problem that caus-es 100,000 deaths annually. The G.A. adopted the following general principles which should guide . . . personal and corporate choices aboutthe use of alcohol: Abstention in all situations should be supported and encouraged.Moderate drinking in low-risk situations should not be opposed. Heavy drinking in any situation should be vig- orously discouraged. Any drinking in high-risk situations (e.g., dur- ing pregnancy or before driving an automobile)should be vigorously discouraged, as should allillegal drinking (G.A. Minutes 1986). 59 The recognition of alcohol as a drug is reflected in the name of a PHEWA network: thePresbyterian Network on Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse (PNAODA). The network distributesa newsletter linking individuals and families,provides individual support to persons affectedby addictive illnesses, sponsors education andawareness events for clergy and for the public, and advocates for treatment resources. PNAODA used the study guide, Alcohol Use and Abuse , to ground its programs in a sound theology. 60The programs, in turn, gave impetus to further overtures and study papers, as well ascurricula on the prevention of substance abuse.One such project was a values-based preventioncurriculum for youth, The Circle of Wholeness . 61 In addition, the National Capital Presbytery developed a policy for local churches on the useof alcohol. In summary, the PC(USA) approach to alco- hol advocates proper use rather than abstinence.For those in recovery, and those seeking recov- ery, the 12-step program, Alcoholics Anonymous,is considered most effective. The PresbyterianChurch has also examined the systemic natureof the problem, not simply its impact on individ-ual lives. The church has focused on the publicpolicy issues of pricing, availability, and promo-tion of alcohol. It is concerned about the sale ofalcohol to minors, the need for higher liquortaxes, the sale of alcohol in certain high-riskoutlets (e.g., gas stations), saturation of themedia by alcohol advertising, marketing ofalcohol in the two-thirds world.15 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERHIV/AIDS PC(USA) regards AIDS as an infectious disease, not a curse or punishment from God. From theoutset of the AIDS epidemic, PC(USA) hasadvocated for the rights and dignity of personswith AIDS and those infected with HIV, espe-cially in employment practices. One of thePHEWA networks, Presbyterian AIDS Network(PAN), is a national network of clergy and laypeople. Its mission is to educate members ofPC(USA) about HIV/AIDS and to provide sup- port, pastoral care, and advocacy, and it pro-duces educational materials and a newsletter. The 1986 G.A. stated that \"AIDS and ARC (AIDS-related complex) are illnesses, not pun-ishments for behavior deemed immoral.\" 62\"To Meet AIDS with Grace and Truth was . . . adopted in 1988. It mandates health educationfor the prevention of AIDS and for the develop-ment of HIV/AIDS-related ministries. It calls forprograms that support independence and self-determination for persons with AIDS. It urgesthe implementation and enforcement of policiesand legislation to protect the civil rights of per-sons affected by HIV/AIDS (G.A. Minutes1988).\" 63 G.A. policies have been echoed by presbyter- ies. A statement by Maumee Valley Presbytery(covering parts of Michigan and Ohio) includedas central concerns the right to continue work;confidentiality; needs for compassion and under-standing, both for healthy employees and forcritically ill colleagues; non-use of HIV testingas a job prerequisite; and needs for education. 64 Baltimore Presbytery, as well, has taken a lead-ership role in seeking to eliminate any discrimi-nation against persons with AIDS and hasworked with local interfaith AIDS networks. 65 OTHERPHEWA NETWORKS Several PHEWA networks have been discussed in connection with specific areas of health-related concern that they address. The remain-ing networks deserve mention as well. Presbyterian Health Network (PHN) encour- ages the Presbyterian Church (USA) at all itslevels to develop and sustain a wide variety ofhealth programs and ministries. PHN promoteseducation through curricula that propose modelstructures and congregational policy for use inthe local church, and for use in health seminarsand retreats for clergy and church professionals.PHN advocates for better public health policy atlocal, state, and federal levels; works to interpretthe needs of the marginalized; and raises ethicalissues involving health and medicine. Presbyterian Disabilities Concerns (PDC) \"welcomes those who affirm, support and advo-cate for the gifts, rights and responsibilities ofpersons with disabilities in the total life of thechurch.\" 66 Community Ministries and Neighborhood Organizations (COMANO) \"welcomes thoseinvolved in community ministries, communityorganizing, neighborhood houses, and socialaction ministries.\" 67 Presbyterian Association of Pas- \"welcomes thoseinvolved in institutional chaplaincies and pas-toral counseling. They represent the PC(USA)[in] the various national professional organiza-tions and work to ensure that the church recog-nizes their ministries.\" 68 Presbyterian Child Advocacy Network (PCAN) advocates for access to affordable health care,and develops and distributes educational materi-als. This network emphasizes the prevention ofchild sexual abuse. It encourages the observance of Children's Sabbath and promotes affordablechild care, including after-school programs. The Urban Network of Congregational Lead- ers (UNCL) \"welcomes those lay and clergy per-sons who work side by side to carry out the taskof ministry in our urban areas.\" 6916 THEPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH (USA) T RADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS1. These figures and other citations reflect the gover- nance of the PC(USA), a denomination formed in1983 by the reunion of the United PresbyterianChurch USA and the Presbyterian Church US, whichhad divided during the Civil War. There are 215 mem-ber churches in 107 countries of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and approximately 45 Reformeddenominations in the U.S. (Jean-Jacques Bausweinand Lukas Vischer, eds., The Reformed Family W orld- wide: A Survey of Reformed Churches, TheologicalSchools, and International Organizations [Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1998]).This booklet focuses on PC(USA)\u2014the largest Presby- terian denomination in the U.S. and the one withwhich I am most familiar. The positions cited in thetext are from PC(USA) or her predecessor churches. In most instances this booklet presents the major issues addressed by PC(USA) with reference to thedenomination's core commitments to health andhealth care. Wherever possible, official papers anddocuments passed by the highest governing body, i.e.,General Assembly, are referenced. Where official posi- tions (for example, positions on end-of-life issues) arein the process of formulation, study documents orbooks by Reformed theologians and ethicists are used. 2. Ronald P.

Increasingly,healthcare workers face the challenge of provid-ing appropriate care and services to people of dif-ferent religious backgrounds. Unfortunately,many healthcare workers are unfamiliar with thereligious beliefs and moral positions of traditionsother than their own. This booklet is one of aseries that aims to provide accessible and practi-cal information about the values and beliefs ofdifferent religious traditions. It should assistnurses, physicians, chaplains, social workers, andadministrators in their decision making and caregiving. It can also serve as a reference for believ- ers who desire to learn more about their own tra-ditions. Each booklet gives an introduction to the his- tory of the tradition, including its perspectives onhealth and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Final-ly, each booklet offers information on specialconcerns relevant to the particular tradition. The editors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated by authorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The editors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral deci-sions about clinical issues to individualconscience. We would therefore caution the read-er against generalizing too readily. The guidelines in these booklets should notsubstitute for discussion of patients' own reli- gious views on clinical issues. Rather, they should be used to supplement information com-ing directly from patients and families, and usedas a primary source only when such firsthandinformation is not available. We hope that these booklets will help practi- tioners see that religious backgrounds and beliefsplay a part in the way patients deal with pain, ill-ness, and the decisions that arise in the course oftreatment. Greater understanding of religious tra-ditions on the part of care providers, we believe,will increase the quality of care received by thepatient.
