To qualify, undocumented students must: :: Have attended a Minnesota high school for three years and have graduated from high school or attained the equivalent of high school graduation in Minnesota; :: Provide documentation of having complied with selective service requirements; and :: Provide documentation of having applied to obtain lawful immigration status, if a process for obtaining such status has been established by the federal government. (Note: At the present time this federal process has not been established, therefore such documentation is not currently required) In addition to resident tuition, undocumented students who meet the conditions above may also be eligible to receive a Minnesota State Grant and/or private scholarships from Minnesota State College and University foundations.

Below are four different financial aid scenarios that outline 2015-2016 net college costs for full-time (30 credits) MnSCU students with different circumstances and family income levels. Part-time MnSCU students (enrolled in fewer than 15 credits per term) can receive Pell Grants pro-rated to their enrollment credit level. HOW FINANCIAL AID CAN Offset College Costs For all four scenarios above, federal and state grants (which do not need to be paid back) cover a significant part of the cost. Tuition and fees are the only costs paid directly to the college or university. The total costs are estimates that could be much lower, depending on your circumstances. Some families take out a bank loan to pay some costs of college. Costs are for average full-time tuition and fees (30 credits) per year for Minnesota residents. When comparing college costs, financial aid estimates need to be figured into the equation. www.mnscu.edu 8Technical Course Options Students who are interested in technical courses may take one technical college level course taught on a college campus as early as grade 10. To be eligible to do so, they must be enrolled in a public school, and meet requirements for reading proficiency and any other assessment requirements related to the course they wish to enroll in. If a student successfully completes the technical course with a C or higher, the student can take additional technical courses as long as he or she meets the assessment requirement for those courses. AP and IB Options Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses are offered at many high schools and provide a rigorous curriculum that prepares students to take college level courses. Students who pass an Advanced Placement test or the International Baccalaureate examination with acceptable scores will be awarded college credit at any MnSCU college or university.Post-Secondary Enrollment Options The PSEO program allows high school students to earn college credits while still in high school. Students can take college courses on a college or university campus. Students can even take PSEO classes online. Students interested in taking PSEO courses on the college or university campus should contact the campus they are interested in attending to find out more about the application process and deadlines. Another form of PSEO is concurrent enrollment. This option allows high school students to remain on the high school campus and earn college credits by enrolling in college courses offered at the high school. To be eligible to take PSEO and concurrent enrollment courses within the Minnesota State Colllege and University system, high school juniors must be in the upper one-third of their class or earn a score at or above the 70th percentile on a test such as the ACT or SAT. Seniors must be in the upper half of their class or score at or above the 50th percentile on a test such as the ACT or SAT. Students who do not meet these requirements may still be eligible if they can meet other college readiness standards determined by the college or university. Students in 9th or 10th grade may also be eligible to take concurrent enrollment courses. If you are interested in PSEO, talk to your high school guidance counselor and college/university admissions staff or go to www.mnscu.edu/pseo.Earn College Credit IN HIGH SCHOOL POST-SECONDARY ENROLLMENT OPTIONS (PSEO): Students can get a jump start on earning college credits by taking college courses while they are still in high school through Minnesota's PSEO program. This program allows students to take col-lege courses tuition free, saving both time and money on completing a college degree. PSEO courses may also fulfill high school course requirements and count toward a high school diploma.

Minnesota State Colleges and Universities work together to make transferring as easy as possible. All of our 31 state colleges and universities offer all or part of the Minnesota Transfer Curriculum, a 40-credit package of general education courses accepted for transfer to other state colleges and universities, the University of Minnesota, and some private colleges and universities. Plan Ahead to Transfer Successfully Any course has the potential to transfer; however, general education (Minnesota Transfer Curriculum) courses are the most commonly accepted. Credits will transfer from one institution to another, however, they may not fulfill the specific requirements of your new degree program. When enrolling at a two-year college with the intention to transfer to a four-year university, it is important to know which degree path is right for you, and to talk with an advisor about how to make your path as smooth as possible. Associate degree programs vary in transferability. :: Associate of Arts (AA) degrees are designed to transfer most readily into most baccalaureate (four-year) majors; however, some baccalaureate majors may require specific pre-major courses to be taken as part of this degree. :: Associate of Science (AS) degrees often transfer into a specific four-year degree major at partnering universities through articulation agreements. :: Associate of Fine Arts (AFA) degrees transfer into a specific four-year degree major at partnering universities through articulation agreements. :: Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees, technical diplomas and technical certificates are designed for immediate entry into the workplace and may have more limited transferability. AAS degrees are not designed for transfer to baccalaureate (four-year) degree majors. Note: Transfer occurs without articulation agreements. Please keep in mind that an articulation agreement usually states how an AS or AFA degree transfers into a specific university's major. Make sure to find out what university major accepts the college program covered by the agreement as soon as possible. An articulation agreement database is maintained on MnTransfer.org: www.mntransfer.org/students/plan/s_agreements.phpSeek Advice Transfer specialists at each campus can help you with course selection and transfer plans. Talk to a transfer specialist and your academic advisor as early as possible and every semester about your degree plans and about where you wish to transfer. Also be sure to review your degree audit report (DARS) every semester. It will help you track your progress towards completing your current program or major. Visit Transferology www.transferology.com to see how courses at one participating institution are accepted into specific programs or majors at other participating institutions. Transferology also lets you know how standardized exams and military credit transfers into programs or majors. public community, technical and comprehensive colleges of MN residents pursuing an undergraduate credential attend a MnSCU college or university65% 24 Your 2015-2016 Guide To MnSCU11 Choosing a State College Minnesota state colleges offer associate degrees, the Minnesota Transfer Curriculum (MnTC), certificates and diplomas. The state community and technical colleges have an open admissions policy. This means all you need to enroll is a high school diploma or a GED. If you don't have a high school diploma or GED, you may take a standardized test to be admitted. You can complete two years at a state college and transfer to another college or university, or you can complete a one-year or two-year career program and go to work right away. Either option is a great value. MnSCU tuition costs are the lowest in the state, and community and technical college tuition rates will remain frozen through the 2015-2016 academic year. $5,399 Average annual MnSCU college tuition and fees for a full- time student 42,000 degrees, certificates, and diplomas awarded each yearwww.mnscu.edu 12AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD INDUSTRIES Agribusiness Service Technician Agricultural Business and Production Agricultural Science and Technology Culinary Arts and Food Service Farm Business Management Floral Design Food Processing Safety Food Sciences Golf Course/Turf Management Horse Husbandry/Equine Business Management Horticulture, Landscaping and Greenhouse Taxidermy Veterinary Technology ARCHITECTURE AND CONSTRUCTIONBuilding Inspection Building/Property Maintenance Cabinetmaking and Interior Finishing Carpentry and Building Trades Concrete/Masonry/Bricklaying Construction Management Drafting - Architectural Electrician and Electrical Maintenance Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Heavy Equipment Operation Interior Design Plumbing/Pipefitting Sheet Metal BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENTAccounting Administrative Assistant and Support Banking and Finance Business Administration and Management Computer Software Specialist Customer Service/Call Center Entrepreneurship Fashion Merchandising Hotel, Restaurant and Casino Management Human Resources Management Insurance International Business Marketing and Sales For a complete list of programs, visit www.mnscu.edu.
