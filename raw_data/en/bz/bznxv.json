Use insect bite prevention strategies to prevent malaria, dengue, and other vector-borne diseases. 3. Recognize which vaccines are necessary for the young pediatric traveler. INTRODUCTION Traveling with a child can be emotionally and educationally rewarding but chal- lenging as well. Children are traveling from North America and Europe to most parts of the world, including Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Central and South America. The most common reasons to travel are for leisure and to visit friends and relatives. (1) Children also accompany their families for pilgrimages, study abroad experiences, and parental work. Older children and adolescents travel as part of educational tours and humanitarian mission trips. Similar to adults, childrentraveling to potentially high-risk regions of the world expose themselves to risks of acquiring malaria, dengue, and diarrheal diseases. These diseases, followed by dermatologic conditions such as cellulitis, bites, and cutaneous larva migrans, are among the most common problems observed in pediatric travelers. Travelers visiting friends and relatives are at a greater risk because most do not visit travelclinics for advice or immunizations. (2)(3) They also tend to visit more remote parts of high-risk countries and stay for longer durations. Although at-risk children may not visit a travel clinic, they may be seen by their primary care health provider. Pediatricians, through setting expectations for parents and answering their ques- tions, play an important role in providing a safer and more comfortable travelexperience. Those who attend a specialized travel medicine clinic may do so too close to departure to receive necessary immunizations or may refuse recommended vaccines. Because of this possibility and not having enough time to visit a travelAUTHOR DISCLOSURE Drs Chehab, Fischer, and Christenson have disclosed no nancial relationships relevant to this article.

This review articleprovides a comprehensive summary of pediatric travel medi- cine recommendations and resou rces as useful for primary care providers. SAFETY AND COMFORT Setting expectations and educating parents can greatlycontribute to a safer and more comfortable flight for the whole family. Air travel is generally safe for healthy term infants and children. Special counseling should be given to parents of preterm infants and children with chronic pul- monary or cardiac diseases. Infants with ongoing respiratory ailments such as lower respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations should consider rescheduling travel. Travel to higher altitudes may place these infants at harm. Fitness-to- fly assessments (to simulate in- flight hypoxia) may be needed before departure, especially in infants and chil-dren with known cardiac and pulmonary conditions. (4)(5)(6)These are generally performed in pulmonary function lab- oratories by pediatric pulmonary specialists in children' s hospitals. Unrestrained children, especially during meal service or turbulence, are at risk for in- flight injuries. This is especially so for children occupying aisle seats because they are vul- nerable to falling objects, aisle traf c, and burns from hot objects. (7)(8) Although incidents are rare, parents need to beinformed of these risks so that they can take precautions. It is imperative that parents and caregivers childproof dwellings where they will reside during travel while also looking forsmall objects and needles left in bed linen or covers as well as under beds and chairs. Small children may swallow or as- pirate these objects and cause a medical emergency. Tele- visions and heavy objects on dressers and tables need to be examined carefully for stability, especially when drawers are open. Glass doors to balconies need to be securely closed to avoid entry onto the balcony. Child restraint is an important component of air travel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rec-ommends placing children in Federal Aviation Administration - approved car seats, rear-facing if their age is younger than 1year and they weigh less than 20 lb (9 kg) and forward-facing f o rt h o s e1y e a ra n do l d e ra n d2 0t o4 0l b( 9 -18 kg). (9) Chil- dren who weigh more than 40 lb (18 kg) can use an airplaneseatbelt. Sedation of a child on a flight is not usually recommended, but diphenhydramine is used by some parents. Parents are advised to try a test dose at home rst because some childrenwill experience a paradoxical reaction with agitation andexcitement. Benzodiazepines have the potential to cause respiratory depression, especially with inaccurate dosing in children, so they should not be used in children. Although recommended by some specialists, many experts suggest that chloral hydrate should also be avoided due to unpre- dictable responses and potential adverse effects in children. Ear pain is a problem that some children may encounter on aflight, especially during descent and to a lesser extent on takeoff. Parents are advised to have their baby suck on a bottleor paci er during these times and to have older children chew, swallow, yawn, or do the Valsalva maneuver if needed. A question frequently asked by parents to pediatricians is whether it is safe for a child with an ear infection to travel in an airplane. Unfortunately, studies to answer this question are lacking. Some have recommended delaying travel if possible. If travel dates are not flexible and the child is di- agnosed as having a recent episode of otitis media, providingthe child with proper analgesia may be warranted. At the same time, a middle ear that is full of fluid (whether infected or not) may be less likely to expand and contract with air pressure changes than an air- lled middle ear and, thus, less likely to become painful with ascent and descent. Motion sickness can occur in children during travel. Children younger than 5 years may develop gait abnor-malities, especially ataxia. Older children have signs and symptoms similar to those seen in adults with motion sickness, including generalized discomfort, pallor, drowsi- ness, headache, epigastric discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Potential interventions to prevent motion sickness include eating a light meal a few hours before travel time, sitting in the front seat of a car if age permits, stabilizing the head, andfocusing on a stable object. Antihistamines such as di- phenhydramine and dimenhydrinate can be tried when preventive measures fail. Scopolamine is an option in chil-dren older than 12 years. High-altitude illness (HAI) is a term that includes a variety of syndromes: acute mountain sickness, pulmonary edema are usually associated with ascent to altitudes of 8,200 to 11,500 feet (2,500 -3,500 m) or more. Symptoms can be subtle and nonspeci c, especially in younger children, who may present with irritability or changes intheir sleep pattern, activity, or appetite. Some children might experience HAPE, but the more life-threatening HACE is extremely rare in children. The risk of developing HAI is decreased by slow ascent to high altitudes. Mild symptoms are managed with rest, proper hydration, and analgesics such as ibuprofen. If symptoms are severe, immediate descent is advised. Acetazolamide is a medication that can be used for 190 Pediatrics in Review at Stony Brook University on May 14, 2021 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from prevention of acute mountain sickness. It is relatively safe and used in other conditions, but it has not been studied in children for the prevention of HAI. The dose is 5 mg/kg divided twice daily, with a maximum dose of 125 mg orally twice daily. It is usually started 1 day before ascent and continued for 2 days during a high-altitude stay once the desired altitude is reached. Children who develop HAPE should descend immediately and then subsequently be evaluated for structural heart disease and pulmonary hy- pertension. (10) TRAVELER 'SD I A R R H E A Traveler 's diarrhea (TD) in children is associated with sig- nicant morbidity. Young children are most susceptible and frequently require replacement fluids and at times medical attention. (11)(12) TD in children can sometimes result in changes in travel itineraries. Although mostly used to de ne TD in adult travelers, TD in children can be de ned as a twofold or greater increase in the frequency of unformed stools for at least 2 to 3 days. (13)(14) Additional symptomsmay include abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, tenes- mus, or fecal urgency during travel or on return. Dysentery, an in flammation in the intestinal mucosa secondary to in- vasion by a pathogen, is usually associated with fever and/orbloody stools. TD may be graded as mild (tolerable, not interfering with activities), moderate (distressing, interfering with activities), or severe (debilitating, preventing any ac- tivity, or dysentery). TD often starts in the rst week of travel. Symptoms resolve within 48 hours in approximately half ofaffected patients. TD is one of the most frequently encountered illnesses among travelers from high-income to middle- or low-incomecountries. The incidence is variable by destination, with the highest rates in North and Tropical Africa, Western and South Asia, and Central America. (15) Type of travel and duration of stay play a role in the rates of TD. The rates of TD are usually 50% or less if the stay is shorter than 2 weeks. Backpackers tend to consume more street food and unsafe water and, thus, have higher rates. Travelers visiting friends and relatives are at risk because they often travel withoutseeking pretravel advice and are more likely to ingest un- treated contaminated local foods and beverages. Preventing TD is essential when traveling with young children. Ice and street vendor food need to be avoided. Emphasis on hand hygiene is a must. Breastfeeding should be continued throughout the trip in infants who are breastfeeding. Foods should be well-cooked. Raw vegetables and fruits should be avoided, unless fruits can be peeled. Bottled or previously boiled beverages should be consumedand also used to take pills and to brush teeth. Bottled watershould be purchased from established stores and not from street vendors. Carefully examining the seal before opening the bottle is essential to ensure that the plastic seal is intact. TD is usually caused by bacterial pathogens. Bacteria encountered most frequently in TD are diarrheagenic strains ofEscherichia coli ; the most common are enterotoxigenic E coliand enteroaggregative E coli, followed by spp. (13) and rotavirus. Parasites such as Giardia intestinalis are responsible for protracted diarrhea. Crypto- sporidium spp usually cause a self-limited diarrheal illness. Most episodes of TD are self-limiting and do not need diagnostic testing. Although standard stool cultures can be useful in detecting some enteric bacteria, such as Salmonella , Shigella merase chain reaction (PCR) are needed to distinguish be- tween pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains of Ec o l i . Syndromic panel multiplex PCRs have higher sensitivitythan standard stool cultures for common enteric pathogens and are useful in diagnosing viral and protozoal entericinfections. (16) PCRs are of greater utility when travelers have severe or persistent diarrhea and negative cultures. However, diagnostic testing is expensive and not readily available during travel, but it could be useful in the returned traveler with persistent gastrointestinal symptoms. Adequate hydration should be provided to every child with TD. Commercial oral rehydration solutions with adequate amounts of glucose and electrolytes are administered fre- quently in small amounts, with a teaspoon if necessary.A ppropriately made homemade solutions can also be used. Intravenous solutions are necessary in cases of severe de- hydration when oral rehydration is not tolerated or not sufcient to correct the de cits. Breastfeeding should be continued if possible. Use of undiluted fruit drinks, sodas,and sport drinks should be discouraged. These fluids contain large amounts of glucose, which is likely to worsen the di-arrhea, and contain too few electrolytes for appropriate re- hydration and replacement of losses. Oral rehydration solutions can be part of a travel medical kit for parents with small children. Antibiotics have been used effectively to treat TD in adults, but studies in children are lacking. Antibiotics are notroutinely used in children with mild TD but are reserved for moderate to severe cases. Antibiotics play a role in reducing the severity and duration of TD, which, in turn, decreases the need for intravenous fluids and hospitalization. Azi- thromycin, 10 mg/kg per dose, is the rst-line antibiotic to u s ei nc h i l d r e nw i t hT D .I ti sg e n e r a l l ys a f ea n dw e l l - t o l e r a t e d . It also works for fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter Vol. 42 No. 4 APRIL 2021 191 at Stony Brook University on May 14, 2021 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from infections that are common in South and Southeast Asia. Fluoroquinolones are frequently prescribed for adults with TD, except for travel to South and Southeast Asia, where resistance is an issue. A single dose of antibiotic is generally sufcient for adults with TD, especially when administered with loperamide. If symptoms persist, a daily dose of anti-biotic can be given for up to 3 days. There is no evidence that similar antibiotic dosing would not work in children with TD. Because of the potential of adverse reactions in chil- dren, fluoroquinolone use should be limited to circumstances when an alternative agent is not available and a suspectedsusceptible pathogen is likely. (17) In recent years, studies intravelers returning from South Asia who have received an- tibiotics for treatment of TD have found a high colonization rate with multiply-resistant Enterobacteriaceae,o r g a n i s m st h a t have led to other infections after returning home. (18) Someof the antibiotics commonly prescribed for diarrheal illness during travel and pediatric and adult dosing are listed in Table 1. Antidiarrheal agents such as loperamide are used in adults to decrease the amount of stool output associated with TD.Use of loperamide for TD in children remains controversial. Although it is licensed for use in children 2 years and older, loperamide has signi cant adverse effects, including central nervous system depression and toxic megacolon and isgenerally not recommended. Children with bloody stool or fevers should not use loperamide. Probiotics have not been proven to be ef cacious for TD, thus are not recommended. Zinc supplementation, despite its bene t in diarrheal illness in children in developing countries, is not recommended fortreating TD in children who are less likely to have pre-illness zinc de ciency. Dehydration with electrolyte imbalances can occur in children with TD. Long-term complications of TD includepostinfectious irritable bowel syndrome, as well as reactive arthritis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and Guillain-Barr \u00b4e syndrome. Chemoprophylaxis is not routinely recommended. How- ever, it could be considered for a child with a preexistinggastrointestinal condition such as in flammatory bowel diseaseor a malabsorption disorder. Such use should consider the risks of acquisition of multidrug-resistant organisms and the potential for developing an infection caused by Clostridioides difcile. No vaccine is available in the United States to protect from TD. An inactivated oral Vaccin AB, Stockholm, Sweden), which is licensed in Canada, may offer some protection against heat-labile enterotoxin -producing E coli in travelers. INSECT BITE PREVENTION The use of insect repellents is an important and simple measure to reduce the risk of insect bites and prevent insect- borne illnesses. Insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, and flies are responsible for spreading illnesses such as malaria, Zika, Chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, and rickettsialdiseases. picaridin are the most effective repellents against mosquito bites. Products with less than 10% concentration are effective for approxi-mately 1 to 2 hours, and a concentration of approximately 30% may last for approximately 5 hours. Concentrations between 25% and 30% are frequently recommended for visits to tropical regions. Concentrations of DEET higher than 50% do not confer greater protection. DEET is also effective against ticks and some flies. Use of concentrations of 20% or greater on exposed skin is recommended to protectagainst tick bites. DEET is safe in children older than 2 months when properly applied. (19) Rashes have been reported. Toxic encephalopathy has been seen with improper use or ingestion of DEET in children. DEET may damageclothes and eyeglasses. Picaridin at a concentration of at least 20% protects well against mosquitoes but less so against ticks, fleas, chiggers, andflies, and it is equivalent to DEET. It is odorless and causes less skin irritation than DEET. At 20% it protects for approximately 8 hours. Oil of lemon eucalyptus is found in the lemon eucalyptus plant. It is minimally effective against mosquitoes and flies, TABLE 1.

It is not to be used in children younger than 3 years. Citronella provides short-lived (~20 minutes) protection against mosquito bites and is not effective for ticks. It is not recommended for use in the tropics. The use of combination products containing an insect repellent and sunscreen is not recommended. Sunscreen needs to be applied more frequently. Use of a combination product may lead to greater exposure to DEET, especially at times when insect repellents are not needed. Separate products can be used together. It is recommended to apply sunscreen before insect repellents, keeping in mind that thisreduces the effective sun protection factor of sunscreen. Application of insect repellents before sunscreen is not recommended because it may increase absorption of the repellent. Wristbands with chemical repellents and backyard bug zappers are not recommended because of limited ef cacy. Permethrin , a contact insecticide, can be applied on cloth- ing, bed nets, and sleeping bags. Travelers should sleep inscreened or air-conditioned dwellings at night. Permethrin- impregnated mosquito nets are effective in preventingmalaria. Caution is recommended with the use of repellent coils as they can be a re hazard and the smoke can be harmful to young children. Electric coils may be available insome countries. There is no strong data that electric coils prevent malaria. MALARIA CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS Medications should be prescribed to children for chemopro- phylaxis when traveling to areas with malaria. It is important to explain to families that medication chemoprophylaxis doesnot prevent infection but rather works to prevent disease by killing the parasite after it leaves the liver. Thus, compliance to complete the period of prophylaxis is vital. Factors such as weight, age, ability to swallow tablets, and medication fre- quency and availability in fluence the choice of medications selected for pediatric travelers. The choice of antimalarialchemoprophylaxis agent is determined mostly by the pres- ence of resistance to chloroquine. In addition, frequency of dosing and potential for adverse effects are major determi-nants. Unfortunately, these agents are not available in liquid form. Tablets need to be cut and crushed for young children. At times, smaller doses for younger infants need to be compounded by a pharmacy and placed into small sachets or gel caps for easier and more precise dose delivery These medications are known to cause gastrointestinal discomfort when taken on an empty stomach. Although most children tolerate these medications well, additional adverse effects have been reported. (20) Abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia,and depressed mood may be disturbing to some parents andchildren receiving me floquine. The weekly dosing of this agent makes it an attractive choice for prophylaxis. Personswith a history of depression, anxiety, seizures, and cardiac conduction problems should avoid the use of me floquine. Agents such as atovaquone-proguanil may be preferred, evenwhen they require daily administration. It is rare that a child has to stop an agent because of adverse effects. Medications used for malaria prophylaxis are summarized in Table 2. Up- to-date information on recommended malaria prophylaxis for at-risk countries and regions can be found at the CDC Travel Health (Yellow Book) website (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/). IMMUNIZATIONS Vaccine-preventable illnesses are highly prevalent in inter- national destinations, thus it is important to ensure that traveling families, especially children, are up-to-date in their routine immunizations. Some children may bene t from an accelerated schedule depending on the risk in the destination area. The most recent recommendations on routine im- munizations and catch-up schedules are accessible on the American Academy of Pediatrics and CDC websites. Routine immunizations against illnesses such as measles-mumps- rubella (MMR), hepatitis A, and meningococcus require special attention. Additional destination-speci c immuni- zations may be needed, (21) including typhoid fever, rabies,yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis virus vaccines. Table 3 summarizes most immunizations needed before travel. Measles is still epidemic in many countries, including several in Europe. Monovalent measles vaccine is notavailable in the United States. In the current immunization schedule, MMR vaccine is routinely administered at 12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years. Traveling children who received their rst MMR vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age should receive a second MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart from therst vaccine to ensure vaccine effectiveness because 7% of children might not respond after 1 dose. The second vaccinewill complete their MMR series and they will not need ad- ditional doses at 4 to 6 years. Children 6 to 11 months of ageshould receive the MMR vaccine if traveling outside the United States. This early dose does not replace the subse- quent routinely scheduled doses of MMR vaccine. Hepatitis A is a viral illness that is highly prevalent in lower-resource countries. Hepatitis A vaccine is routinely given in the United States at 1 year of age, with a second dose 6 months later. Children are known to easily transmit the virus to older individuals, in whom the disease could be more serious. Infants 6 months and older should be vaccinated Vol. 42 No. 4 APRIL 2021 193 at Stony Brook University on May 14, 2021 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from with hepatitis A virus vaccine. Immune globulin injections would interfere with MMR vaccination. Some experts do notbelieve that immune globulin injections are warranted in young infants because hepatitis A is a relatively mild and usually asymptomatic infection in younger children. However, immune globulin injections can be used as protection. (22)(23) Meningococcal quadrivalent conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) is routinely administered to adolescents in the United States at 11 to 12 years old, with a booster dose at age 16 years. Children traveling to high-risk destinations such as the meningitis belt in sub-Saharan Africa during the dry season (December -June) should receive the vaccine at an earlier age. The meningo- coccal vaccine is also required for entry to Saudi Arabia for religious visits such as Hajj or Umrah. MenACWY-tetanus toxoid and MenACWY-CRM are conjugate meningococcal vaccines that can be administered to children as young as 2years and 2 months of age, respectively. MenB vaccine is notroutinely recommended for children traveling to themeningitis belt region or other countries because menin- gococcal B disease is not prevalent in this region. Typhoid vaccine is recommended for children traveling to areas with increased risk of exposure to Salmonella enterica serotype typhi. Travelers should be informed that the vaccine is not 100% protective and advised to follow proper hygiene and food and water precautions even when vaccinated. (24)(25) The vaccine is available in 2 formulations in the United States: the oral live attenuated vaccine and the in-tramuscular capsular polysaccharide vaccine. Rabies virus, which causes a rapidly progressive fatal encephalomyelitis, is prevalent in many areas worldwide. It is important to educate travelers on the importance of preexposure vaccination, avoidance of animal bites, andTABLE 2.

Children have a higher risk of rabies exposure because theytend to be more attracted to animals, and the bites might involve higher-risk areas such as the face and head. Avail- ability of rabies immune globulin and vaccines is limited in many countries, making preexposure vaccination more de- sirable when considering travel to high-risk regions. (26) Yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine recommended for all children 9 months and older traveling to endemic regions. Proof of vaccination is required for entry to some countries. It is sometimes advised to postpone travel if possible if a child is younger than 9 months. Yellow fever vaccine is contraindicated inchildren younger than 6 months because it has a higher risk of neurologic complications, such as vaccine-associated encephali-tis. The vaccine should be considered, with precautions, in children 6 to 8 months old traveling to areas with yellow fever. For most travelers a single dose of yellow fever vaccine provides long-lasting protection, and a booster dose is not necessary. However, travelers to regions with ongoing out- breaks should consider receiving a booster dose if it has been 10 years or more since last being vaccinated. Japanese encephalitis vaccine is recommended for all children, 2 months and older, who are traveling to areas endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus during the transmissionTABLE 4. General Recommendations for Travelers \u0081Safety and injury prevention: Use car seats, seat belts. Sit in the back seats. Never leave children unattended. Childproof all rooms. Inspect sliding doors and balconies. Inspect under beds and chairs. \u0081Pack a rst aid kit. Keep all prescription medications in their original containers. Bring printed copies of pharmacy-provided information with generic names. Place all medications in carry-on hand luggage. \u0081Bring photocopies or digital photos of passports and birth certi cates (especially for US-born children of expatriates): This makes replacement easier if original passport is lost or stolen. \u0081Avoid boredom: Bring cards, favorite books, games, movies, and snacks. \u0081Be careful crossing streets: Watch out for bikes, motorcycles, people, and vehicles in the left lane. Look both ways! \u0081Best seats for children on planes: Bulk head (more leg space). Bassinettes may be available. Your child will not bother anyone in the front. \u0081Ear discomfort: Provide child with something to drink or eat during ascent and descent. \u0081Avoid cutaneous larva migrans, other parasitic infections (hookworms): Do not walk barefoot on ground or dry sand. Use a towel at the beach orlay in the turf. \u0081Avoid swimming in fresh water in the tropics: this prevents schistosomiasis, intestinal parasitic infections, traveler 's diarrhea, and hepatitis. Chlorinated pools are ne. \u0081Get medical and evacuation insurance (such as from International SOS, SafeTrip, Travelex, others). \u0081During long flights, get out of walk: \"economy-class \"thrombosis. \u0081Prevent high-altitude as prophylaxis. Consult someone familiar with acutemountain sickness. \u0081Waterfalls, rivers, streams (rafting, kayaking) in the tropics: High risk for leptospirosis. Doxycycline could be used as prophylaxis.

(27) It is also recom- mended to give the Japanese encephalitis vaccine to individuals staying less than 1 month if they have plans for high-risk activities or itineraries or travel occurring during rainy seasons. The vaccine is safe and immunogenic in young children. (28)(29)(30) ILLNESSES AFTER TRAVEL Diarrheal and skin infections are among the most common travel-related ailments affecting pediatric travelers. Children with febrile infections such as malaria and typhoid fever are frequently severely ill, requiring hospitalization. (31)(32)(33) Most of these children did not receive proper antimalarial prophylaxis or appropriate vaccines or had not followed proper health and safety precautions. Clinicians must be attentive to the development of fever, skin lesions, and ex- anthems in returned travelers. Incubation periods in relation to duration of travel and time of return from travel have to be considered when evaluating the sick pediatric traveler. (13) CONCLUSIONS Preparing families with children for travel can result in safer, healthier, and more comfortable trips for the whole family. General travel recommendations are summarized in Table 4. Special advice should be given to traveling families on insectbite prevention, management of TD, malaria prophylaxis, and immunizations. Table 5 provides a list of some of the available resources for preparing travelers. Summary \u0081Based on strong research evidence, diarrhea is acommon problem in travelers visiting countries withlower economic resources and poor sanitary infrastructure.
