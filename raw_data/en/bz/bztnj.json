Left untreated, addiction and substance use disorders can destroy lives before individuals even attempt to recover. When you are ready to face addiction, you will want to seek out professional addiction treatment, which consists of detox and rehab. While treatment, rehab, and detox are closely related, they aren't synonyms. Detox and rehab are two separate processes with different purposes. Detox focuses on preparing an individual for treatment while rehabilitation focuses on treating your body, mind, and behavior. Together, they help you regain control of your life. If you try to overcome addiction by going through one process without the other, you're likely to relapse. Detox without rehabilitation does not provide critical therapy and support, which can lead to further substance abuse. Rehabilitation without detox, on the other hand, is rarely successful. Even though detox and rehab work together to provide successful treatment, you'll need to participate in both processes. The more you understand the differences between both rehab and detox, the more you'll understand why successful recovery typically includes both. Detox is the first phase of addiction treatment. The goal is simple: to prepare the body and mind for treatment. The most important way to do this is to rid the body of any toxic substances. Most detox programs last anywhere from 3 to 10 days and help: But that's not all. Drug and alcohol detox also helps to establish the foundation of your sobriety. During detox, you regain control of your body while your brain starts to function optimally again. Without detox, addictive substances can continue to cause your body to malfunction, making rehabilitation a distant dream. Luckily, after your body and brain are free of drugs and alcohol, you're in the perfect position to remain sober. That's where rehab comes in. There are some best practices for detox that you should keep in mind when seeking a treatment program: Drug and alcohol rehab, unlike detox, focuses on the health of your mind. In fact, the ultimate goal of rehabilitation is to develop a new lifestyle with new habits that [encourage sobriety](https://devgenesisr.wpengine.com/rehab-what-to-expect/). When your body is free of drugs and alcohol, you're able to start working toward your new life. That process takes longer than detox does. The average rehab program lasts for 30 to 90 days. But you might need treatment for up to 120 days depending on your history of substance abuse. In rehab, your focus will shift from physical symptoms to coping skills that will help reduce your chance of relapse. You'll participate in a range of activities designed to help you regain control of your mind, including: Rehab will also help you focus on your holistic health. Most programs have activities that focus on your health, spiritual well-being, social needs, and creativity, as well. In rehab, you're not defined by the substances you once used, you're identified by the person you're becoming. Rehab also helps equip you for life [beyond the treatment program](https://devgenesisr.wpengine.com/life-after-rehab/) by providing you with aftercare services and alumni program activities. If you're serious about overcoming your addiction, you'll need to undergo both detox and rehab. Detox clears your body of toxic substances, but you can't stop there. You need to address the mental, emotional, relational, and psychological effects of substance abuse, as well. Rehab can help you do that. Detox doesn't explore why you started using substances in the first place. Eliminating drugs and alcohol from your system won't teach you how to avoid them in the future, either. That's why successful recovery consists of detox and rehabilitation. Here at Genesis Recovery, we believe in comprehensive care. Our mission is to help rebuild lives broken by addiction.
