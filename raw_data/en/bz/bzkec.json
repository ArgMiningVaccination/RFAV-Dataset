According to the story, county residents are being tested at a rate three times the national average. UTMB's Chris Toomes explains it was a big effort early in the year to acquire supplies needed for testing. \"We put two of our own buyers in the lab to work directly with the lab team to scour the planet for supplies,\" Toomes said. \"We knew everybody at some point was going to want these materials.\" The story was published on U.S. News & World Report, The Guardian, Swissinfo, Yahoo! News, MSN News and other media outlets. "}
