Naturopathic medicine is a traditional style of medicine that is deeply rooted in both philosophy and practice. Naturopathic medicine is guided by the following principles: - The body has an innate capability to heal itself and will do so when under the right conditions. - Identifying and treating the root cause of disease is essential to long-term health. - The doctor should teach his/her patients how to care for and heal themselves. - The doctor should look at his/her patients from a holistic perspective, taking into account all aspects of the individual which contribute to health, including physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, social and environmental health. - Preventative medicine should be practiced, including encouragement of healthy living, in order to mitigate future health issues. - Above all else, use the least-invasive therapies possible to achieve maximum healing and, with that, do no harm. In their quest to help patients heal, Naturopathic Doctors will utilize various therapies, including lifestyle counseling such as addressing diet, exercise, sleep habits and stress management, along with natural interventions such as botanical medicine (herbs), nutritional supplements and homeopathic remedies. Depending on which state the ND is practicing in, he or she may also utilize additional therapies like physical medicine, IV therapy and pharmaceutical medicines, when necessary. Naturopathic Doctors are trained as primary care physicians (PCPs) in a 4-year post-graduate medical school program. [These programs](https://aanmc.org/) are extensive, as they include learning not only the conventional methods of diagnosis and treatment, but also all the various ways to utilize natural medicine for health and healing. Upon graduation, many NDs will complete a residency in their area of interest. Some NDs choose to practice as PCPs, but most will practice in private clinics, practicing traditional naturopathic medicine as outlined above. "}
