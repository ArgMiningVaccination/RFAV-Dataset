There is no cure and he, like many sufferers, has resorted to all sorts of remedies. Here, Guy describes how he discovered a treatment that really helped - nearly 20 years after he first developed the condition. My sister was born with a birthmark on her right cheek. A bluey-brown blob, slightly raised. In my family this was considered a blessing. This was because my mum had informed us that Emma's birthmark 'made her more attractive' and gave her face 'character' - apparently a good thing. This was the manner of our family; even when something was as plain as the nose on your face, it could be denied out of existence. The Kennaway first aid box was empty but for a bit of paper that said: 'STOP FUSSING AND GET ON WITH IT.' When I developed a rash on my face in my mid-20s, I took the family line and simply denied anything was wrong. On first seeing the red blotches around my mouth and nostrils, I had no idea of the hell I was descending into. I declared that they were 'a shaving rash'. Sounded manly and, I hoped, almost enviable, the consequence of my virility and hirsuteness. Treatment was sponging my face in scalding water. I had been brought up to think of my body as something to be bashed and punished into obedience. The marks - red patches no bigger than postage stamps - came and went; I didn't like them, but I began to accommodate them. Some things I did, such as drink red wine and party late into the night, my skin disapproved of, and it would be waiting in the morning to reprove me at its most blotchy. Psoriasis made many choices for me. It kept me from swimming and made me instead take up scuba diving with its concealing suit and mask and skiing. And it drew me towards other people with bad skin out of sheer sympathy with their pain. I eventually married a woman who had suffered from acne. It was two years from the first appearance of my 'shaving rash' before I went to a doctor. 'This is nothing to worry about,' he reassured me, 'just a spot of dermatitis.' It was the first of many names I was given for my skin condition. I went to the chemist with my prescription for Betnovate, a trade name for cortisone, a substance that was to be my constant companion for the next eight years. The blotches on my face still came and went, and from time to time disappeared on my torso too, though I now believed it to be the cream that was making them go. When I returned to see the doctor, I wanted to give him the good news that he had cured me, but the truth was his ointment couldn't control the 'dermatitis'. I eked out each prescription for as long as I could, to put off having to go back for a morale-sapping inspection. Over the years I became obsessive about the state of my skin. A good day became a day when my skin wasn't as angry as usual; a bad day became one of those many days when I saw - in mirrors, in cutlery, in any reflective surface I could find - a red-faced, blotchy, scabby man looking back at me. The only way I could feel any kind of happiness was through an improvement in my skin. Even on the day my beautiful son was born I remember seeing myself in the plate glass of the delivery room and feeling all that happiness slide through and leave me empty. I withdrew from the world, going out only occasionally. At a rare party I sat next to a friend and chatted about people's nicknames. A stranger sat down beside us and joined in. 'Who's that person everyone calls the Lizard?' he said. 'I don't know,' I replied, 'I've never heard of him.' 'Apparently he sheds skin everywhere,' he beamed at my friend, who was looking down at his feet slowly. The Lizard. Me. On the Tube train home I looked at my reflection in the glass and despaired. Where had my face gone? Where had my identity gone? Where had my life gone? There are three levels of conventional medical treatment for psoriasis. The first is topical, involving ointment which is applied to the skin. The second is ultraviolet light therapy, and the third is systemic, involving pills or injections. One bleak fact is that psoriasis grows resistant to all treatments. When conventional medicine failed me, I launched myself into a search for alternative therapies. But I discovered no herbs, mineral extracts, tonics, strange diets, acupuncture, hypnotherapy, magnetic field therapy, oxygen therapy or any other therapy that was a match for the smartest disease of them all. But from time to time I tried again and thus I found myself at a hotel on the barren shore of the Dead Sea in Israel, amid the most incredible collection of florid, seeping, streaked, pocked and cracked skins I had ever seen. It was now official: I was a member of the ugliest community in the world. Sunlight is renowed for being good for skin conditions - but here the sunshine was said to be unique. Apparently the Dead Sea has its own ozone layer, filtering out more damaging rays that cause skin cancer, burning and ageing. This, in turn, enables people to get the benefits of the sun for far longer than they would normally. I had a brief consultation with a dispiriting Russian doctor, but he prescribed no drugs. All therapy consisted of exposing myself to the sun on the hotel roof. Out of the corner of my eye I noticed guys so raw they looked like they'd been dipped in boiling oil. On the fourth day I detected some changes. Where there had been long-established patches of dry skin, below my eyes and on my cheeks and nose, new healthy shiny skin appeared. Please do not think I am about to claim that this therapy was in any way some kind of a cure. But for me and some of my fellow inmates - you couldn't call them guests in that place - there was a distinct improvement. It was not just about my skin, it was also about the way I thought about myself. We were all rejects at the Dead Sea Hotel and during the long, hot hours on the roof we talked of all the many disappointments and humiliations in our lives, and savoured each other's triumphs. It was during a blazing midday session that Fritz, round faced German and fellow flaky, gave me a master-class in using moisturiser. I had been issued with a plastic tub of what was called Eucerin cream that I thought would last me about two months. 'Nein, nein!' called Fritz. 'Use three fingers to extract the cream.' 'That's far too much,' I exclaimed. 'Zat is sufficient for one leg maybe. One pot - one day,' Fritz said. 'Understand?' I used the whole pot then and there and my skin drank it in. It consumed ridiculous volumes and over a course of a week transformed from papery and brittle into supple and fresh. At home, months went by with no sign of our old friend reappearing, and I was now drunk on joy. I didn't think I was just healed, I thought I was gorgeous. But I am afraid things were still not quite right about me. It's hard to describe exactly what was going on in my head. Maybe because I had denied myself any pleasure in my appearance for so long, I now went to the other end of the scale. Suffice to say my idiotic shenanigans were destructive. I tried to drink and drug away my mixed-up emotions, but nothing worked. For ten years my wife had raised our children, supported me, helped me and loved me in her fine and brilliant manner. But one afternoon, the weight of everything pressed down on me. Two weeks later I was being driven along a desert road to The Meadows, a rehab centre in Arizona. The Meadows' treatment comprised of finding the source of my emotional problems and learning new techniques to deal with them. I've also realised psoriasis is part of me. And if I can accept its imperfections, rather than perceive it as a disease that must be overcome, then I am cured. Not of psoriasis, but of my war with my skin and myself.
