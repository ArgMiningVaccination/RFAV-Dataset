I started it because I needed to make some changes in my life since I was having some of the same health problems my mother had.... So many things I already knew and had ignored for years. Now I'm on a healthy path and am amazed by how quickly my body has adjusted to the changes, as well the pounds I've shed and how energized I feel.\" - Terri, Food Matters Nutrition Certification Program Graduate Are You Ready to Take the Next Step on Your Wellness Journey? Studying nutrition changed my life.It helped me cut through the confusion of paleo, veganism, plant-based, intermittent fasting, and more to experience lasting energy, vitality, and improved immunity. It gave me the tools and knowledge to help heal my father, successfully getting him off six medications, losing over 50lbs, and completely recovering his life and health. Being a part of this transformation also gave me the inspiration and confidence to start Food Matters. This laid the groundwork for starting an online movement that has inspired millions worldwide. Unfortunately,we aren't taught about real nutrition in school. We have a medical profession that is rarely trained to use food as medicine, and the multi-billion dollar fast-food and pharmaceutical industries thrive on misleading consumers. Now it's time to take our power back! James Colquhoun Co-Founder of Food Matters and The Food Matters Institute and Chief Operating Officer of Gaia Are You Tired of Feeling Like This? - You're overwhelmed by the amount of conflicting 'evidence' online on the best diet for you. - You're struggling with uncomfortable bloating, hormonal imbalances, constant digestive issues, and unexplained weight gain even though you live a healthy lifestyle. - You're spending lots of time and money on specialist appointments, only to be sent off to get tests that cost you hundreds more. - You have no option but to live with an illness because you've tried every option out there and still find yourself unwell and unhappy. - You don't have the credibility to be taken seriously by friends and family when it comes to health and wellness. - You're ready to say goodbye to persistent sickness and pain, and transform your life using nutrition. This is why we created the Food Matters Nutrition Certification Program. To alleviate the overwhelm and hours spent seeking support, to help you transform your health and life, and help others do the same. The Food Matters Nutrition Certification Program Is for You If: - You are looking to improve the health of yourself and your family naturally. - You're looking for solutions to digestive issues, hormone issues, inflammation, heart issues, and aging. - You want to learn practical solutions on how food plays a key role in gut health, weight, mood, energy levels, sleep, and more. - You want to become your own health coach and formalize your knowledge so that you can feel confident to take your health into your own hands, and help loved ones do the same. - You want to study with an institution that provides multidimensional support so that you can successfully complete the program despite not having prior nutrition knowledge or previous study experience. - You are open to exploring and learning about new modalities that you can use to improve your health. - You have a busy schedule and are looking for a program that you can complete in your own time around your lifestyle. \"I took the program because I had a lot of gut issues and \"Dr. Google\" was just confusing me.

I was blown away by the amount of information that was provided and have discovered so many ways to improve my health. One thing that has surprised me the most is where my studies have taken me! I have used the knowledge I have gained to create Chronic Illness Healing Workbooks for mental and physical health, and I hope to help and inspire others struggling with their health to make changes and see improvements. Anastacia I studied medicine in the 1980s and took 36 courses until I graduated, but none of it was about nutrition. It was not by chance but by purpose. As we know, often behind governments (including universities and medical schools) are the big pharmaceutical companies trying to promote their poisons. I got invaluable knowledge from this course, much of which I assimilated immediately... It helped me reinforce the knowledge I already had and also added some extremely important new information so that I could heal myself and my loved ones with natural methods. The study does not stop here. In fact, now it begins... Karon For anyone thinking about this but feeling hesitant, I took the leap last November and joined the first ever class. Next to being a mother, this is the best thing I've ever done in my life (and I have a fulfilling life!) But the Food Matters Nutrition Coach journey is OUTSTANDING and we learn so much, all the time. I rave about this program to everyone I meet. Caron Huck To the Food Matters Team and especially Laurentine and James - thank you for making this program possible! I've learned so much and will continue to explore all the additional resources within each module. I loved every minute! Now onto the Bonus Module. Sarah When I started the Food Matters Nutrition Certification Program, I was doing so to heal my own chronic illness. I was blown away with the amount of information that was provided and have discovered so many ways to improve my health. I love the printed workbook and find studying from reading very helpful. One thing that has surprised me the most is where my studies have taken me! I have used the knowledge I have gained to create Chronic Illness Healing Workbooks, for mental and physical health. I hope to help and inspire others struggling with their health to make changes and see improvements. I'm so grateful I decided to take the course and highly recommend it to everyone! Kasia I loved every minute of the training, and am grateful for the support of the Food Matters tribe: the awesome, responsive staff, and the savvy, passionate students. The experience was like a fire hose of information, so I'm really happy that all of the course materials are available for me to go back and review again and again. All of the Resources at the end of each module are also really helpful. I'm eager now to jump into the Bonuses and learn how to parlay my newfound knowledge into a business so I can help others live their healthiest, most vibrant lives possible. Thank you!!! Janelle I'm so pleased to have participated in, and finished this wonderful course! It took a bit longer than I initially planned, however as I began each module it seemed very timely with family members' health issues. I thoroughly enjoyed sharing what I learned and hope/plan to do more of this in the future. Thank you so much! With appreciation to everyone involved in the Food Matters Program.

We're just making it a little bit easier for you to access. We can't wait to welcome you to the Food Matters Nutrition Certification Program. In good health, James Colquhoun & Laurentine ten Bosch Founders of Food Matters and The Food Matters Institute Frequently Asked Questions The program is made up of ten modules and we recommend dedicating approximately 5 hours to completing each module, making the program easy to complete in less than 6 months. Because the program is 100% online and accessible 24/7 with no lecture commitments, you can start when you're ready, and complete it around your own schedule or downtime after work. The Food Matters Nutrition Certification Program is recognized by the International Approval and Registration Centre (IARC), and is an approved training provider with the International Institute for Complementary Therapists (IICT). This means our graduates qualify for membership and insurance through IICT under the Nutrition Consultant modality. The content within this program doesn't adhere to any one specific diet or way of eating, and this is because we believe in bio-individuality and that there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to nutrition and health. The program emphasizes consuming a primarily plant-based diet because there is strong evidence for the benefits of consuming a large variety of plant-based foods. There is content discussing how to ethically include quality animal products in your diet for those who choose to (or for those who find themselves coaching clients who choose to). Ultimately we focus on giving students a deep understanding of the foundations required for optimal health and nutrition and the science behind food, nutrition, and many of the key systems in the body. We believe that once you have this foundational knowledge, it's much easier to interpret and implement information on health and nutrition! Yes. The Food Matters Nutrition Certification Program is designed to be completed at your own pace, from the comfort of your own home.

Generally, Nutrition Consultants do not require a state license to practice and can be certified through private credentialing bodies such as Food Matters. However, it is recommended that you check with licensing authorities in your country and locality before offering any service to the public. The Food Matters Nutrition Certification Program is designed to provide in-depth knowledge and understanding of nutrition, natural healing, and the mind-body connection. You will earn the Food Matters Nutrition Consultant certificate by completing our program, confirming that you have completed our program. Our program does not make you a state-registered dietician or licensed nutritionist. To determine applicable licensing requirements, you will need to check with state and local agencies where you conduct your business and where your clients reside. Lifetime access to the programs means that you will always be able to access your account and the program.
