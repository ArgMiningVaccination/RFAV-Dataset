(US-FDA / UK-MHRA compliant) Vaccines needed across all age groups Need of pre-birth vaccination Mothers transfer fewer protective antibodies to their infants because of less exposed to infectious agents, breast feeding is less common & of shorter duration. Also, as current schedules starts @ 11/2 - 2 months of age, there is period of vulnerability during 4-6 months of life with significant mortality & morbidity In 21st century vaccines will be needed across all age groups Source: Rappuoli R. Nature reviews. Immunology, Vol 11, Dec 2011, pp. 865-872. Vaccines Concept of Vaccine` - Training of immune system to face various existing disease agents - Generate memory cells. Prophylactic treatment against disease. Most effective treatment against any disease so far. Vaccines-success stories so far Made eradication of many life threatening diseases possible. - Smallpox - Eradicated in1979 - Polio - Significant elimination - Measles - Significant elimination - Rubella - Significant elimination Still in progress - Hepatitis-B: 260,000 in the 1980s to about 60,000 in 2004. - Diphtheria: No case reported in USA after 2003. Vaccines - Limitations Limited production capacities Failure to protect immuno-compromised patients. Instability issues - Heat and freeze degradation. - Unfolding of structure. - Hydrolysis, oxidation, deamidation. - Inherent instability of large molecules. Additional costs of cold chain logistics and storage. Temperature sensitivity of vaccines Vaccines lose potency over time and the rate of potency loss is temperature-dependent. Both, high temperature as well as (freeze) low are detrimental to vaccine quality - Most aluminum salt adjuvant containing vaccines are freeze-sensitive (Require Freeze stabilization) - Live attenuated vaccines are sensitive to heat (Require Heat Stabilization) Cold-chain have been established to ensure that the potency of vaccines is maintained until the point of use. Cold Chains- Risks associated Drawback : Costly and complex distribution logistics. - In the developed world, maintaining the cold chain is estimated to cost up to $200 million a year and increases the cost of vaccination by 14-20% (World Health Organization) 75-100% of vaccines at some stage of transportation experience \"temp excursions\" . Usually occurs in the tail end of the cold chain. Risk of vaccine wastage and associated costs. - 50% losses in emerging nations (GAVI report). - 10% losses in established markets (Australian MoH report). Need more space for storage and transport. What we are looking for ??? Thermo-stable vaccine which can be stored at room temperature (Reformulation) Redefining the thermal stability of existing vaccines for relaxing the cold chain requirements Developing new strains with inherent thermostability. Vaccine transported or stored at room temperature ?? Thermo stable vaccines Vaccines neither requiring refrigeration nor affected by freezing. Thermostable vaccines will help in - Decreasing the cost of vaccine stockpiling. - Improving the efficacy of vaccine. - Energy cost saving (due to cold chain) - Reducing wastage of vaccines. Will ensure vaccine stability in remote areas of the world with limited or no access to electricity for cold chain. Thermostable vaccines represent a better opportunity to increase the outreach of global immunization program. Ambient storage condition-WHO Measured mean annual data Long-term stability testing conditions Zone Climate/Definition Temperature (Open air, \u00b0C) Partial vapor pressure (hPa) I Temperate climate 15 11 21\u00b0C/45% II Subtropical and Mediterranean >15-22 >11 to 18 25\u00b0C/60% III Hot and dry >22 15 30\u00b0C/35% IVa Hot and humid >22 >15 to 30\u00b0C/65% IVb Hot and vary humid >22 >27 30\u00b0C/70% How to overcome these problems? Explore genetically modified strains that address specific stability issues. Apply novel formulation concepts and processing technologies - Spray drying, foam drying, and lyophilization, etc. Employ computational analysis of protein structure to inform formulation design. Thermostable vaccines - ongoing research Use of silk protein biomaterial matrices for stabilization of MMR vaccine (Tufts University, USA). Use of lipid particle vaccines platform (VBI ). Use of osmolytes for Hep-B vaccines (PATH, USA). ThermoVax platform (RiVax, Velothrax). HydRIS technology platform (Oxford University Bio-Pharma ) Use of Glycerin, PEG-300, Propylene glycol for freeze sensitive formulation. Coated microneedle Patches (influenza virus by University of Queensland). Oral tablets (E-coli by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health & PATH, Polio vaccines). Flu vaccine by Powderject, USA Sugar Glass Technology A joint effort by Durer Chemical corporation USA, CSIR Australia Utilize stabilizing abilities of sugars is used for stabilizing vaccines. Measles , DTaP vaccines successfully stabilized. Pre-clinical investigations have demonstrated the immunogenicity and potency of the trehalose-dried vaccine candidate. ThermoVax Technology A proprietary vaccine formulation platform from Soligenix, thermostable properties to aluminum adjuvanted vaccines. Makes alum vaccines resistant to freeze/thaw and Heat excursions. Delivers long-term stabilization of labile antigen-adjuvant combinations Maintains native structure US bestowing - Applicable to many types of commercial vaccines Polysaccharide conjugates, VLPs, recombinant subunit proteins and peptides - Complex vaccines utilizing \"secondary adjuvants\" - Combination as well as multivalent vaccines Scientific merit of ThermoVax technology validated through $9.4M grant award Grant provides for stabilization of its proprietary ricin vaccine (RiVax) and anthrax vaccine (Velothrax) Preservation by Vaporization (PBV) Under study for YF-VAX 17D by Universal Stabilization Technologies, US Higher activity titer after drying and thermostability during subsequent storage (increased shelf-life). Allows subsequent particle size reduction (micronization). Allows short-term stability at 60\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C that could be used for encapsulation of dry powders for buccal and transdermal delivery avoiding a need of reconstitution with water. Challenges in thermostable vaccine development Commercial - - Patents rights are in hand of very few companies and individuals. - High cost and time associated with development and licensure of thermostable vaccines Higher Product Cost would impact the immunization programs in developing world Regulatory - Addition of novel stabilizer/adjuvant/excipient/process require huge data and cost involved. - Choice of excipients/stabilizer to achieve limited Target population (Infants) have extremely low regulatory tolerance for adverse effects. - Stability indicating markers and correlates of protection should be identified. Better clarity on the stability targets from the policy makers is desired. - Thermostable vaccines without cold chain require new regulations, policies, and logistic systems in additional to new formulation technologies. Thermostable Vaccine - industry Perspective Cost vs. benefit has to be evaluated by industry. - Funding model for bearing the developmental cost should be identified - Developmental cost vs. saving by cold chain should be evaluated - Priority development of vaccine candidate e.g. Pentavalent, MMR,Polio. Wider and open view of regulatory agencies - Relaxation of transportation guideline for already stable vaccines (e.g. D, T & Hep-B). - Separate transport and storage conditions for individual vaccines. Developmental initiatives Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Measles vaccine project to Dr. Paul Duprex , TransForm Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Massachusetts, United States - US PATH (Freeze and heat stable Liquid HepB Formulation). BARDA (Awarded US$2.5 million funding to advance the development of thermostable influenza vaccines) Summary Integrate stabilization approaches in early vaccine development. Many vaccines are more stable than we assume e.g. Human rotavirus vaccine, HepB & tetanus toxoid. New supply chain model (combination of cold chain and controlled temperature chain), distribution policies and logistic system need to developed for them Funding model to take-care the developmental cost and the risk associated with them needs to be developed.

Use of reference preparation (not like to like) Science: based on models developed > 50 yrs ago Ethical Aspects Practical : Extensive animal use aspects : Costs, time required The Relevance Of Biological Assays Ligand/receptor assays (not cell based) SPR Variability Relevance Modern cell based bioassays (early read out) Receptor binding KIRA PACE Reporter gene assay ? Classical cell based bioassays (late read out) Proliferation assay Death of cells as read out In vivo bioassays Includes in vivo clearance event 63 Speed Species Difference Can Be Unpredictable For humans the circulating leukocyte profile is 50-70% neutrophils but for rodents it is 50-100% lymphocytes. (Haley, 2003) - Relevance of measuring leukocyte related changes (immunogenicity) in alternate species? *********************************************************************** Mouse spleens are major sites for lifelong hematopoietic activity while humans have little hematopoietic activity in embryonic spleens and virtually none in adult spleens. (Haley,2003) - Relevance of using mouse spleen cells as target cells in immunotoxicity assays? *********************************************************************** TCDD (a Dioxin derivative) causes a dose-dependent suppression of the T-cell Dependent Antibody Response in adult female B6C3F1 mice, but enhances the TDAR in F344 and Long-Evans rats even at high doses. (Smialowicz et al., 1994) - Relevance to humans? Animal Usage In Human And Veterinary Vaccines Used in: Vaccine development (research, validation of efficacy) Production (sometimes in animals, primary cell cultures, eggs) Batch control testing (safety and potency testing) Routine batch control testing is responsible for 80% of animal use in vaccine industry and regulation Batch control testing of vaccines accounts for ~10% of all animal use in biomedical research, using 10 million animals every year Biologicals testing has the highest proportion and number of experiments causing severe pain and distress to animals out of various types of experiments (basic research, toxicity testing, etc.) Sadhana Dhruvakumar, PETA, Feb 2005 The 3R's Approach Replacement: - Substitution of insentinent material for conscious living higher animals Reduction: - Reduction in the number of animals used to obtain information of given amount of precision Refinement: - Decrease in the incidence of severity of inhumane procedures applied to those animals which still have to be used Russell and Birch Overview Current approaches to vaccine manufacturing and testing - The dependency on in vivo methods Regulatory acceptance of in vitro methods Opportunities for advancement of alternate methods Demonstrating product quality, safety and efficacy using the consistency approach Conclusions European Center For The Validation Of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) - Selected Examples Replace: Validated commercially available ELISA kits for rabies potency testing (1999) Validated human-blood-based pyrogenicity test (2005) Validated Vero cell test for specific toxicity testing of diphtheria toxoid Refine: Sponsored development of humane endpoints for rabies, pertussis, and erysipelas challenge tests (1999) Validated ELISA and ToBI test for batch potency testing of human tetanus vaccine (2000) Validated ELISA test for swine erysipelas vaccine Reduce: Validated ELISA and ToBI test for batch potency testing of human tetanus vaccine (2000) Validated ELISA test for swine erysipelas vaccine European Directorate for Quality Medicine(EDQM)/European Pharmacopeia (Ph. Eur.) - Selected Examples Replace: Refine: Accepts vaccination-serology tests for tetanus, diphtheria, and cholera vaccines (in lieu of vaccination-challenge) Recommends use of humane endpoints in vaccination-challenge procedures Reduce: Accepts antigen quantification test for rabies (1998) Deleted Abnormal Toxicity Test (in favor of production consistency approach) Deleted guinea pig test for diphtheria (residual toxin and irreversibility of diphtheria toxoid) Deleted in vivo test for polio (for some manufacturers*) Deleted residual pertussis toxin test for acellular pertussis (for some manufacturers*) Accepts single dilution assays for diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccines (in lieu of multiple dilution assays) Accepts vaccination-serology tests for tetanus, diphtheria, and cholera vaccines (in lieu of vaccination-challenge) *A licensing authority can waive tests in monographs if it is assured of production consistency WHO Animal Use Alternatives Example: Polio Neurovirulence Testing Transgenic mouse test introduced as alternative to monkey NVT (TRS 904, 2002) Future direction: can transgenic mice be considered as fully equivalent to monkey NVT? Future challenges: (a) independent testing by National Regulatory Authority in Tg mouse test, (b) maintenance of competence for testing as polio nears / beyond eradication, (c) need for NVT to control Sabin-IPV?; (d) Need for other molecular tests such as nonisotope method, MALDI-TOF, microarray hybridization, Massively Parallel Sequencing -the ultimate solution for monitoring molecular consistency of live viral vaccines? International Workshop on Alternate Methods-J Shin, WHO, Sept 2010 WHO Reduction And Refinement Examples: DTP Vaccines Reduction of animal testing during the lot release of DT vaccines Addendum to Recommendations for potency of DT vaccines (TRS 927, 2003) -Introduces possibility to use (a) serological assays or (b) challenge assay with a single dilution, both involving reduced number of animals, as an approach for lot release. -Conditionality; consistency in production and quality control has been confirmed on a continuous basis. Recommendation for the use of validated humane end points in recording results of potency testing -Revised recommendations for whole cell pertussis vaccines (TRS 941, annex 6, 2007) International Workshop on Alternate Methods-J Shin, WHO, Sept 2010 WHO Reduction And Refinement Examples: T Containing Vaccines \"The innocuity test on the final lot may be omitted for routine lot release once consistency of production has been demonstrated, subject to the approval of the NRA.\" WHO Reduction and Refinement Examples: T Containing Vaccines \"The innocuity test on the final lot may be omitted for routine lot release once consistency of production has been demonstrated, subject to the approval of the NRA.\" WHO Reduction And Refinement Examples: Rabies Vaccines Recommendation for the use of validated humane end points in recording results of potency testing -Revised recommendations for rabies vaccines (TRS 941, annex 2, 2007) -plus possibility to use single dilution assay for NIH test Statement that there is no additional value in performing an accelerated stability test for the purpose of lot release. -Since this test is based on the NIH test for potency after exposure to the elevated temperature, this statement led to discontinuation of this test on a lot-to-lot basis in a number of countries. International Workshop on Alternate Methods-J Shin, WHO, Sept 2010 WHO Reduction And Refinement Examples: Yellow Fever Vaccines -Amendment of requirements for yellow fever vaccine potency assay (TRS 872, 1998): 2008 -recent establishment of WHO IS for yellow fever potency * allows possibility to qualify the cell culture assay in place of the mouse potency assay with improved interlaboratory comparison International Workshop on Alternate Methods-J Shin, WHO, Sept 2010 WHO Continues To Evaluate Additional Opportunities Lot release guidelines Recommending mutual recognition of animal tests in exporting and importing countries Mumps vaccine neurovirulence tests Repository of mumps vaccine seed strains being established to facilitate evaluation of alternatives to monkey NVT and international collaborative study under development International Workshop on Alternate Methods-J Shin, WHO, Sept 2010 US FDA Perspective on Potency 610.10 Potency \"Tests for potency shall consist of either in vitro or in vivo tests, or both, which have been specifically designed for each product so as to indicate its potency in a manner adequate to satisfy the interpretation of potency given by the definition in 600.3(s)....\" International Workshop on Alternate Methods-T. Finn, US-FDA, Sept 2010 US FDA Perspective On Vaccine Safety And Potency Testing Tests performed on final bulk/container sample(s) to assure safety.... - e.g.: general safety sensitization test, endotoxin...etc ....and potency - e.g.: D-antigen ELISA test for polio types 1, 2 and 3, ELISA for pertussispotency, diphtheria and tetanus potency... etc. Lot-release testing 610.1: Test prior to release... \"No lot of any licensed product shall be released...prior to the completion of tests for conformity with standards applicable to each product....\" International Workshop on Alternate Methods-T. Finn, US-FDA, Sept 2010 US FDA Perspective On Alternative Safety And Potency Tests CBER encourages alternatives to reduce, refine and replace the use of animals in safety and potency testing Relevance Data to support use Validation Goal: Safe, pure and potent vaccines International Workshop on Alternate Methods-T. Finn, US-FDA, Sept 2010 US FDA Process On Changing A Potency Or Safety Test Supplement to the License 601.12: Changes to an approved application - Potency: Rationale and data to support proposed alternative - Safety: Rationale and data to support proposed alternative or demonstration of lack of need International Workshop on Alternate Methods-T. Finn, US-FDA, Sept 2010 US FDA Conducts Research On 3Rs Active research - One of CBER's Research Priorities: Evaluating, developing and integrating novel scientific technologies and preclinical models for use in product regulation, including development and analysis of novel approaches that reduce, refine, or replace (3R's) the use of animals high resolution novel technologies for their potential to improve product characterization, e.g.: molecular-based assays (microarray and high throughput sequencing) - alternative to lethal test for anthrax vaccine potency - alternative to monkey neurovirulence test for polio vaccine International Workshop on Alternate Methods-T.

Based on this information, specify the profile of the vaccine (fingerprint) based on clinical, manufacturing and testing criteria. Set alert and acceptance criteria and criteria for deviations from consistency. Subsequent vaccine lots produced should have the same profile as the clinical lot. The consistency in profile is monitored by non-animal techniques. If so, the vaccine lot can be released for use. Consistency Based Testing Is A Paradigm Shift Traditional concept of vaccine lot release testing New paradigm: Consistency testing Each lot produced by a Each lot produced by a manufacturer is considered to be a unique product manufacturer is one of a series and is NOT unique Use of Reference preparation Use of clinical lot Emphasis in quality control of each vaccine lot is on final product Makes use of : - strict application of quality systems (GMP, QA) - quality by design - extensive in-process testing - new innovative analytical tools Quality control includes several animal models and is animal demanding Testing of D and T Vaccines-Potential Parameters For Consistency Based Testing Production parameters Optical density pH Flocculation titre Endotoxin Protein Nitrogen Protein Residual formalin In vitro safety test (Vero) Reversion (Vero) Osmolarity etc. Product quality parameters Kf (flocculation time) purity various physico-chemical tests Moab binding (biacore) DAFIA (Direct Alhydrogel Formulation Immunoassay) etc. Parameters can be used to set alert criteria and acceptance criteria Consistency Approach Offers Benefits Scientific Benefits: More meaningful batch release as quality is linked to a clinical lot and better understanding of your product Ethical Benefits: Apart from clinical lot (first few lots) NO animal use is required for lot release testing Practical Benefits: Quality control will be less time consuming (a few days instead of 2 months) Consistency Approach Also Has Its Challenges Tests: what set of tests is needed and will this be the same for every vaccine. Product specific ?? 'Risk assessment': what products are ready for implementing the consistency principle. Consistency is NOT a one-for-all strategy! blending: adjuvant and antigen - antigen interaction. Vaccine Validation: how to compare fundamentally different approaches. Conclusions Current paradigm for lot release testing is based on extensive testing of final antigen/final vaccine Reliance on in vivo testing has poses challenges With introduction of cGMP/QA/in-process testing in vaccine production, consistency based release testing can be considered All major international bodies such as EDQM/EU/WHO/USP/IP/US-FDA have all embraced the transition from in vivo to in vitro methods Researchers and manufacturers need to pursue development and implementation of alternate methods Diverse Techniques Can Be Used In-process And Final Lot Testing Physico-chemical Application circular dichroism secondary & tertiary structure proteins fluorescence spectrometry protein conformation, protein modifications colourimetric assays free proteins quality, antigen-antibody kinetics ELISA (with Mabs) peptide mapping, ag quantification electrophoresis purity, protein modification, stability In vitro functional binding assays Immune cells antigen binding antigen processing, B/T cell responses, cytokine Outline of Presentation Overview of vaccine adjuvants Novel Vaccine adjuvants: Mechanistic aspects. Preclinical Evaluation of Novel Adjuvants Novel adjuvant development at SIIL- A case study of SIIL-3 Vaccine Adjuvant - Definitions and Guidelines 1) Adjuvants are the substances that are intended to enhance relevant immune response and subsequent clinical efficacy of the vaccines (WHO guidelines on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines, WHO Technical Report Series, No. 927, 2005) 2) A vaccine adjuvant is a component that potentiates the immune responses to an antigen and/or modulates it towards the desired immune responses. (EMEA guideline on adjuvants in vaccines for human use. 2005) 3) New Draft Guidance on Preclinical Evaluation of Vaccine Adjuvants is currently being developed by WHO aiming towards harmonization of requirements. (Available at WHO website for comments and discussion). Novel Vaccine Adjuvants Previously, Adjuvant development was largely based on approaches focusing largely on humoral immune responses. Advances in basic sciences, immunology and vaccinology per se, have led to better understanding of host immune response against infection. These advances also impacted antigen discovery and adjuvant development. Vaccines such as HIV. Malaria, HPV, cancer have brought cellular immunity and its induction in focus Novel adjuvants targeting cellular immunity are currently being sought. Immunomodulation is becoming the central principle of preclinical assessment of adjuvants Regulatory frameworks to support such adjuvant development are currently in development.

Synthetic routes to synthesize withanolides with correct conformations. Encouraging Global Trends WHO comprehensive regulatory guidance document on development of newer adjuvants in under publication. (For the first time, immunomodulatory adjuvants are included in ambit of adjuvant definition). Nanoparticles based delivery systems needs immunomodulation for efficient mucosal delivery especially at distant sites. (examples of alum and QS-21 recently published with tetanus and malaria antigens). WHO have launched a Global Adjuvant Development Initiative with a focus on identifying newer vaccine adjuvants for vaccines such as HIV, Malaria, tuberculosis, HPV, etc. Summary Newer advances in antigen discovery brings newer hopes for adjuvant adjuvant. Immunomodulation emerging as central mechansim for adjuvant activity and Immunopharmacology based approaches will be important for newer adjuvant development and assessment Safety assessment of immunomodulatory adjuvants will be challenging especially autoimmunity, preganancy. Regulatory framework and science needs to be developed in order to cater to newer adjuvant development WHO have taken an excellent initiative in this direction and guideline will play an important role in harmonization. Indian Industry look forward to regulatory support on newer adjuvants. Issues and Challenges for Development of Combination Vaccines: DPT Based Combination Vaccines as a Case Study Sunil Gairola, Ph.D. Serum Institute of India Limited Guiding Principles for Introduction of Newer Vaccine - Disease burden - Quality of available vaccine - Affordability - Cost effective - Existence of a robust delivery system Rationality Practical way to overcome the constrains of multiple injections to infants and less distress to parents Improve timely vaccination coverage and less visits to health facilities. Reducing the cost of stocking and administering separate vaccines. Reducing the cost for extra health care visits. Facilitating the addition of new vaccines into immunization program. May simplify transportation and storage problems (logistics) Considerations for Combination Vaccines During Development Product should be stable, each component of the combination vaccine should be given at the same age, and the requirement of booster for each component should be similar. New combinations cannot be less immunogenic, less efficacious, or more reactogenic than the previously licensed uncombined vaccines. Free from Immunological, physical, and/or chemical interactions between the combined components have the potential to alter the immune response to specific components. Many advantages of combination vaccines should not be achieved at the cost of reduced product stability. From supply standpoint, uncommon transport and storage conditions and complicated bedside mixing could hamper the development of a combination vaccine. Challenges During Product Development Formulation development Immunological interferences- case studies Manufacturing (scalability) Analytical methods Clinical Regulatory Formulation Development Development of combination vaccine formulation may need consideration of following: - Antigen-Antigen or Antigen-adjuvant interaction antigens Displacement of antigen from adjuvant leading to reduced immunogenicity. - Differential requirement of each antigen with respect to achieving consistent adsorption -- - pH, selection of excipients and stabilizers adjuvants Similarly buffers, stabilizers and similar components may interfere with the components of the other vaccine. - Scalability of the process - pH preservatives excipients stabilizers Scalability Choice of preservatives Any decision on the considerations is based on impact on Quality aspects including stability and shelf life , Safety (reactogenicity), Efficacy, Finally scalability of the process Immunological Interferences Candidate Formulations are studied for appropriate immunogenicity in an animal model. Immunogenicity induced by the combination vaccine was compared with that induced by the separate but simultaneously administered individual vaccines. If there was an already licensed combination, then the current licensed formulation has to be used in the control group for comparisons of immunogenicity The immune response to each of the antigens in the vaccine is assessed, including - the quality of response, - the potential interference and - Incompatibilities between combined antigens. Case study 1: Immune Interference of Hib antigen with Acellular Pertussis and Tetanus Antigens Reduction in antibody titers to the Hib component of the vaccine polyribosylribitol phosphate antigen. This has been reported for many DTaPbased vaccines, including the hexavalent vaccine DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib. The interference has not been reported to the same extent for DTwP-based combination vaccines. It has been suggested, due to the adjuvant effect of the whole-cell pertussis (wP) component, this effect is masked in DTwP based vaccines. Studies in a rat model looking at the interference of Hib and different aP antigens - Reduced anti-PRP response with FHA is in line with the finding that it is a potent suppressor of IL-12 and IFN- production in vivo and in vitro, suppressing immune responses to co-injected antigens. - Another explanation for the reduced Hib response when combined with DTaP vaccines is incompatibility with the alum adjuvant (aluminum hydroxide). Experiments in the rat model with Hib alone have reported 5- to 11-fold lower levels of anti-PRP antibodies when adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. Challenges of Combination Vaccines-formulation When different antigens are combined into one vaccine, chemical incompatibility or immunological interference can be seen. Case study 1: Immune suppression Case study 2: Immune enhancement Impact of Antigen Concentration on Potency Parameter (Product: DTPHBHIB) High Survival B 25 37.1323 (22.3396 - 53.0642) 7.5 High Survival C 25 75.745 (52.485 - 105.195) 5.0 High Survival D 25 74.140 (48.525 - 116.125) 5.0 High Survival E (65.565 - 152.885) Tetanus antigen when added at 5 to 7.5 Lf/dose resulted in high survival leading to absence of end point in potency assay (WHO challenge method for tetanus component). Tetanus antigen when added at 7.5 Lf/dose also resulted in suppression of immune response against diphtheria component resulting in lower potency estimates. Tetanus antigen at 2.5 Lf/dose showed borderline conformance to 95 % CI Tetanus at 4.0 Lf/dose concentration for tetanus antigen produced optimum results and hence selected.

This might be due to Hib-TT conjugates which contributed up to conjugate in presence of other antigens (wP) in rats Sr. No 1 2 Formulation Hib monovalent vaccine (Reconstituted with Non-adjuvanted diluent) DTPHBHib Hib Titres (ELISA) 1007.9 5971.40 The presence of adjuvant and a stabilized formulation demonstrate a significant difference in IgG response in pentavalent vaccine with Hib-TT component. Role of Adjuvants Method of adjuvant preparation - Insitu or preformed Method of adsorption - Sequential or simultaneous Adsorption profile -Kinetics and maturation of adsorption process Studies on desorption: - Stability of adsorbed antigens Antigen Adjuvant Interactions During Different Stages of Formulation Adjuvant can be readymade gel or insitu preparation of adjuvant. Adsorption of antigens can be significantly change during the process of blending. It is generally noted that every antigen have special requirements for adsorption for instance at lower pH, D and T antigens are tightly adsorbed. Monovalent Hepatitis B is 99% adsorbed whereas, in combination vaccines, the adsorption is decreased due to competition. Addition of Hib to combination blend needs to be monitored for stability of conjugate. Manufacturing Challenges / Vessels Combination vaccine can be blended in variety of blending vessels such as - Vessels with vibromixer Amplitude of operation? - Vessels with magnetic stirrers - Vessels with magnetic stirrers and baffles. RPM? Careful assessment has to be done so that the antigens are not denatured based on the vessel type due to shear forces. Challenges-Regulatory Case example: Suppose a manufacturer has licensed and qualified DTPHepB and also have monovalent Hib vaccine qualified. What will be regulatory implications if manufacturer decides to develop pentavalent vaccine(DTPHibHepB) formulation: If a manufacturer has monovalent vaccines licensed, the combination is considered as new product. As a new product, the combination vaccine has to undergo preclinical and clinical trials. Each stage is governed by regulatory submission (preclinical, phase I, II and III tials). Inspection of manufacturing facilities by national regulatory authorities and license to manufacture is provided. Separate regulatory pathways if one of the antigen is recombinant This escalates into huge development costs and big increase in time lines. If manufacturer decides to keep monovalent, quadra or penta combinations, product efficacy equivalence needs to be proven. Analytical Challenges The assays that are developed for determining the potency in monovalent vaccine may not work for combination vaccine. New assay methods have to be developed and validated. For eg,In DTPHBHibTetanus Lf cannot be determined by flocculation methods. ELISA has to be developed for same. The free polysaccharide assay in monovalent Hib is done by Orcinol. In DTPHBHib, the same assay cannot be adopted, instead, an alternate instrumental assay is used, making the assay more expensive. WHO is conducting a collaborative study to harmonize Hib assay in pentavalent vaccine, wherein, Serum institute is one of the participant. In meningococcal conjugate vaccines, the individual polysaccharide or conjugates can be analyzed by either phosphate or sialic acid assays (colorimetric methods). In combination of Men ACYW, the colorimetric assay does not help. An alternate instrumental assays are employed making the assays more complicated and expensive (Dionex AEC-PAD). Challenges - References International or National references are not available for combination vaccines, though combinations are available for more than 50 years. For determining potency assays, monovalent standards are used, which may be responsible for enhanced or suppressed results due to interference of antigens. Way to create an in-house reference is to chose the clinical trial vaccine with proven efficacy, can be calibrated as internal reference std. New standard can be generated by calibrating against the clinical std. Criteria of adsorption is informative but adsorption of all subsequent lots should not be less than the clinical trial lot. Clinical Immunogenicity Regulatory expectations Immunogenicity induced by the combination vaccine was compared with that induced by the separate but simultaneously administered individual vaccines. If there was an already licensed combination, then the current licensed formulation has to be used in the control group for comparisons of immunogenicity For each component of a combination vaccine, non-inferiority had to be demonstrated against the licensed combination. Challenges Such studies had to have sufficient power to rule out clinically meaningful differences in GMTs and/or seroconversion rates Intrinsic variability in assays and subjects, the regulators may not take them into account Case example-Selection of Concentration of Antigens DTP-HB-Hib with 2.5 mcg Hib Compared for immunogenicity against licensed DTP-HB-Hib vaccine. (A multi-centric, randomized Phase III clinical trial) 100 % seroconversion was observed with respect to Hib ( 0.15 ug/ml of IgG). The non-inferiority criteria was met for all components except Hib at 1ug/ml of IgG (87 % versus 93 % in 10 mcg/dose comparison to comparator. Hence long term protection could not be established. Another clinical trial was taken with new formulation with increased concentration of Hib antigen (10 mcg/dose). LABELLING: Primary Container REQUIREMENTS Product generic name and brand name if applicable. Total number of ml in container (liquid) and number of doses in container (freeze-dried). Units/dose or per ml or minimum titer. Dose and route of administration. Nature and amount of any preservative present. Storage condition.

Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM) if applicable on label for liquids. Visual cue if any. Overprinting / additional information if any. Barcodes if any. CHALLENGES Label size/space constraint. Font size/text legibility. VVMs: 7 x 7mm minimum area required, Visual cues: 5 x 5 mm. Barcodes: 12 x 12 mm (2D barcode). To accommodate all the above is difficult on the primary label Summary Combination vaccines offers opportunities, however development path is complex and challenging. Increased reactogenicity of combination vaccines is not accepted. Suitable preclinical correlates for toxicity assessment is not available for most of the antigens. In other words, prediction of toxicity or reactogenicity during preclinical assessment is challenging. Immune interference is a phenomenon in combination vaccines. Needs excellent study designs to predict the same. Analytics of final lot especially detection and quantification of antigens in combination vaccine is challenging. Several technologies such as label free ELISAs, platforms such as Gyros, MSD, Luminex offers oppurtunities.
