This goal is being accomplished by gaining better understanding of the biology underlying lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms and applying this knowledge to improve the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. Program Aims: - Discover the Genetic and Cellular Origins of Lymphomas and Leukemias - Develop Novel Methods of Diagnosis and Biomarker Monitoring of these Diseases - Develop New Therapies Program Directors Program Directory Testing the Combination of Two Experimental Drugs MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) and Interferon-gamma for the Treatment of Mycosis Fungoides and S\u00e9zary Syndrome and Advanced Synovial Sarcoma This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and interferon gamma-1b work in treating patients with stage IB-IVB mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome that has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Interferon gamma-1b may boost the immune system activity. Giving pembrolizumab and interferon gamma-1b together may work better in treating patients with stage IB-IVB mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome. Stanford is currently accepting patients for this trial. Stanford Investigator(s): Intervention(s): - biological: Interferon Gamma-1b - Criteria: - MYCOSIS I) - Stage IB-IVB Mycosis Fungoides or Sezary syndrome, and who have relapsed, are refractory, or progressed after at least one standard systemic therapy; maximal stage since diagnosis will determine eligibility; current disease stage at time of entry will also be documented but will not be used for eligibility - Subjects must have the following minimum wash-out from previous treatments and without treatment between documentation of relapse/progression and enrollment: - >= 2 weeks for local radiation therapy - >= 8 weeks for low dose (12 Gy or less) Total Skin Electron Beam Therapy (TSEBT) - >= 4 weeks for systemic cytotoxic anticancer agents, anticancer investigational agents that are not defined as immunotherapy, or for tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the exception of alemtuzumab for which the washout is at least 16 weeks - >= 15 weeks for anti-CD137 or anti-CTLA-4 (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways) - >= 2 weeks from resolution (i.e., < grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse event (AE)s due to procedures performed or therapeutic agents administered - >= 2 weeks for retinoids, interferons, vorinostat, romidepsin and denileukin - >= 4 for doses of systemic corticosteroids greater than 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; patients who are on physiologic doses of corticosteroids (prednisone equivalent 10 mg/day or less) may participate, however, they must be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before enrollment; patients who are on low or moderate potency topical corticosteroids may participate if they are on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before enrollment; inhaled corticosteroids are acceptable; local injections of corticosteroids are acceptable; all corticosteroids will be reported as concomitant medications - >= 2 weeks for phototherapy - >= 1 week for topical therapy (including retinoid, nitrogen mustard, or imiquimod) - Patients with prior treatment with IFN-gamma will be eligible, if they previously tolerated IFN-gamma, however patients must be off of IFN-gamma for at least three weeks before initiation of therapy on this trial - Age >= 18 years - Have measurable disease based on modified severity-weighted assessment tool (mSWAT);

for this reason and because anti-PD-1 agents and interferons may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) before to study entry and for the duration of study participation - Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours before receiving the first dose of study medication; if the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required - Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication; Note: abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the patient - Male patients of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy; Note: abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the patient - Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately;

exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or in situ cervical cancer - Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events; patients with carcinomatous meningitis should also be excluded; patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging using the identical imaging modality for each assessment, either magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT] scan, for at least 4 weeks before the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days before trial treatment - History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) and interferon-gamma;

because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab); these potential risks may also apply to Interferon-gamma; MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) and Interferon-gamma may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero; furthermore, it is not known if MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) or Interferon-gamma have transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm;
