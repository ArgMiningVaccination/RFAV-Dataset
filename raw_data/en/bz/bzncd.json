BMJ Qual Saf. 2012 Apr Supplement Oral PREVENTION OF THROMBOSIS, 9TH ED: ACCP GUIDELINES on laboratory and clinical monitoring and on rever- sal strategies. More recently, new oral anticoagulant drugs, namely the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate and the direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, have been approved for clinical use in several countries. A growing body of laboratory and clinical data is becoming avail-able to better understand the mechanisms of action and the optimal management of these new compounds. In this article we summarize the published literature con-cerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of all oral anticoagulant drugs that are currently avail-able for clinical use and other aspects related to their management. For many decades, the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the only oral anticoagulant drugs available for clinical use for the primary and secondary prevention of venous and arterial throm-boembolic events. VKAs have been consistently shown to be highly effective in many settings and are now used by millions of patients worldwide. Laboratory and clinical studies have contributed to understanding of the complex pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of VKAs, their interac-tions, antithrombotic effects, and the risks associ-ated with their use. Several studies have addressed the practical issues related to the management of patients on VKAs treatment, with particular focus Background: The objective of this article is to summarize the published literature concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral anticoagulant drugs that are currently available for clinical use and other aspects related to their management. Methods: We carried out a standard review of published articles focusing on the laboratory and clinical characteristics of the vitamin K antagonists; the direct thrombin inhibitor, The antithrombotic effect of each oral drug, the interactions, and the mon- itoring of anticoagulation intensity are described in detail and discussed without providing spe- ci c recommendations. Moreover, we describe and discuss the clinical applications and optimal dosages of oral anticoagulant therapies, practical issues related to their initiation and monitoring, adverse events such as bleeding and other potential side effects, and available strategies for reversal. Conclusions: There is a large amount of evidence on laboratory and clinical characteristics of vitamin K antagonists. A growing body of evidence is becoming available on the rst new oral anticoagulant drugs available for clinical use, dabigatran and rivaroxaban.

Warfarin is highly water soluble, is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, has high bioavailability, 15,16 and reaches maximal blood concentrations about 90 min after oral administration. 15,17 Racemic warfarin has a half-life of 36 to 42 h 18 (R-warfarin 45 h, S-warfarin 29 h), circulates bound to plasma proteins (mainly albumin), and accumulates in the liver where the two enantiomers are metabolically transformed by dif-ferent pathways ( Fig 18 The S enantiomer of warfa- rin (2.7-3.8 times more potent than the R enantiomer) undergoes approximately 90% oxidative metabolism, primarily by the CYP2C9 enzyme of the cytochrome P450 system and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. 19 The less potent R enantiomer undergoes approximately 60% oxidative metabolism, primarily by two cyto-chrome P450 enzymes, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. The remainder of the metabolism of both enantiomers involves reduction to diastereomeric alcohols. The relationship between the dose of warfarin and the response is modi ed by genetic and environmental factors that can infl uence the absorption of warfarin, its pharmacokinetics, isomers, but with different stereochemical character-istics. R-acenocoumarol has an elimination half-life of 9 h, is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, and is more potent than S-acenocoumarol because of faster clearance of S-acenocoumarol, which has an elimination half-life of 0.5 h and is pri-marily metabolized by CYP2C9. 20 Phenprocoumon is a much longer-acting agent, with both the R- and S-isomers having elimination half-lives of 5.5 days. Both are metabolized by CYP2C9, and S-phenprocoumon is 1.5 to 2.5 times more potent than R-phenprocou-mon. 21 Finally, fl uindione is an indandione VKA with a mean half-life of 31 h. 22 Unlike warfarin, fl uindione is not a chiral compound. 22 1.3 1.3.1 Genetic Factors: A number of point muta- tions in the gene coding for the CYP2C9 have been identi ed. 23 These polymorphisms, the most common of which are CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, are associ-ated with an impaired ability to metabolize S-warfarin, resulting in a reduction in S-warfarin clearance and, 1.0 Vitamin K Antagonists 1.1 Pharmacology VKAs produce their anticoagulant effect by inter- fering with the cyclic interconversion of vitamin K and its 2,3 epoxide (vitamin K epoxide), thereby modulating the g -carboxylation of glutamate residues (Gla) on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent 1 ). 1-8 The vitamin K-dependent coagula- tion factors II, VII, IX, and X require g -carboxylation for their procoagulant activity, and treatment with VKAs results in the hepatic production of partially carboxylated and decarboxylated proteins with reduced coagulant activity. 9,10 Carboxylation is required for a calcium-dependent conformational change in coagu-lation proteins 11-13 that promotes binding to cofactors on phospholipid surfaces. In addition, the VKAs inhibit carboxylation of the regulatory anticoagulant proteins C, S, and Z and thereby have the potential to be procoagulant. 14 Although the anticoagulant effect of VKAs is dominant, a transient procoagulant effect may occur when baseline protein C and protein S levels are reduced due to the start of VKA therapy and the acute phase of a thrombotic event and before the balanced decrease of vitamin K-dependent clot-ting factor levels is achieved. Carboxylation requires the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH 2 ), a g -glutamyl carboxylase, molecular oxygen, and CO 2 . 1 Vitamin K epoxide can be reused by reduction to VKH 2 . The oxidation-reduction reaction involves a reductase pair. The rst, vitamin K epoxide reduc-tase, is sensitive to VKA, whereas vitamin K reduc-tase is less sensitive. 1-3 Therefore, the anticoagulant Revision accepted August 31, 2011 .

Subsequently, mutations in this gene have been identi ed leading to enzymes with vary-ing sensitivities to inhibition by warfarin, 38-43 thereby affecting the pharmacodynamics of warfarin. The mutations occur with differing frequencies in various ethnic populations and account, in part, for the dif-ference in warfarin doses required to maintain a ther-apeutic international normalized ratio (INR) (Table S1) (tables that contain an \"S\" before the number denote supplementary tables not contained in the body of the article and available instead in an online data supplement; see the \"Acknowledgments\" for more information). 39-41,44,45 Genetic mutations in the gene coding for the VKORC1often involve several mutations leading to various haplotypes that cause greater resistance to warfarin therapy. Harrington et al 43 found a warfarin- resistant individual who had high serum warfarin as a result, an increased S-warfarin elimination half-life. 24 Mutations in this gene occur with different frequencies in various ethnic groups (Table S1). 25,26 In comparison with patients who are homozygous variant allele require lower doses of warfarin, as determined by a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of studies that assessed the infl uence of CYP2C9 polymor-phisms on warfarin dose requirements (Table S2). 27 Several investigations 25,28,29 have shown that these mutations, as well as others, 30-32 are also associated with an increase in bleeding complications associated with warfarin therapy. Mutations in CYP2C9 also affect acenocoumarol, although to a lesser degree because the anticoagulation potencies of the R and S enantiomers are comparable. 33,34 The effects of CYP2C9 polymorphisms are least pronounced with the use of phenprocoumon. 33,35 The target for warfarin's inhibitory effect on the vitamin K cycle is the vitamin K oxide reductase Figure 1. [Section 1.1] Vitamin K 1 is reduced to vitamin KH2. The major warfarin-sensitive enzyme in this reaction is the vitamin K oxide reductase mainly inhibited by the S-enantiomer of warfarin. S-warfarin is metabolized by the p450 cytochrome enzyme, CYP2C9.

The inhibition of S-warfarin metabolism is more important clinically, because this enantiomer is more potent than the R-enantiomer as a VKA. 50,51 Phenylbutazone, 52 sul npyrazone, 53 metro- nidazole, 54 and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole 55 inhibit the clearance of S-warfarin, and each potentiates the effect of warfarin on the prothrombin time (PT). In contrast, drugs such as cimetidine and omeprazole, which inhibit the clearance of the R-isomer, poten-tiate the PT only modestly in patients who are treated with warfarin. 51,54,56 Amiodarone is a potent inhibitor of the metabolic clearance of both the S-enantiomer and the R-enantiomer and potentiates warfarin anti-coagulation. 57 The anticoagulant effect by drugs like barbiturates, rifampin, azathi-oprine, and carbamazepine, which increase its clear-ance by inducing hepatic metabolism. 58 Azathioprine also reduces the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, pre-sumably through a potentiating effect on hepatic clearance. 59 Long-term alcohol consumption has a similar potential to increase the clearance of warfarin, but ingestion of even relatively large amounts of wine had little infl uence on the PT in normal volunteers who were given warfarin. 60 The effect of enzyme induction on warfarin therapy has been analyzed in a critical review. 58 Ten hepatic microsomal enzyme agents were assessed. Enzyme by rifampin and barbiturates interaction with carbamazepine, griseofulvin, aminoglutethimide, nafcillin, and diclox-acillin was considered also infl uence the pharmacodynamics of warfarin by inhibiting the synthesis of or increas-ing the clearance of vitamin K-dependent coagula-tion factors or by interfering with other pathways of hemostasis. The anticoagulant effect of warfarin is of vitamin K; by thyroxine, which increases metabolism of coagulation factors; 63 and by clo brate through an unknown mechanism. 64 Doses of salicylates of . 1.5 g per day 65 may augment the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Acetaminophen potentiates the effect of warfarin when used over prolonged periods of time, as demonstrated in a recent randomized, blinded trial. 66-68 Acetaminophen possibly potentiates the anticoagulant effect warfarin through inhibi-tion of VKOR by a toxic metabolite of the drug, 69 although the accumulation of this metabolite may vary among individuals, thus accounting for a variable potentiating effect. 70 Heparin potentiates the anti- coagulant effect of warfarin, but in therapeutic doses produces only a slight prolongation of the PT.

D'Andrea et al, 39 studying 147 patients, found that those with a 1173CC genotype required a higher mean maintenance dose compared with those with a CT or TT genotype, as did Quiteineh et al, 46 who found that a 1173 C . T poly- morphism was signi cantly associated the of overdose. By identifying a number of noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms, Rieder et al 40 were able to infer that there are ve major haplotypes associated with different dose requirements for maintaining a therapeutic INR. The maintenance dose ranged from a low of 2.7 mg warfarin per day for the sensitive haplotypes up to a high of 6.2 mg per day for the resistant haplo-types. Asian Americans had the highest proportion of sensitive haplotypes, whereas African Americans more frequently exhibited the resistant haplotypes (Table S1). 1.3.2 Drugs: VKAs are highly susceptible to drug-drug interactions. For warfarin, for example, manufacturer-provided product information lists . 200 speci c agents that may interfere with this agent. 47 Unfortunately, there seems to be little concordance among commonly used drug compendia and product labels with respect to interactions involving warfarin. Indeed, a major problem with the literature on this topic is that many reports are single-case reports and are not well documented. Anthony et al 44 recently reviewed three drug information compendia, Clinical Pharmacology, ePocrates, and Micromedex, and the warfarin sodium (Coumadin) product label approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, for listings of interactions between warfarin and drugs, biologics, foods, and dietary supplements and found that of a total of 648 entries from the four sources, only 50 were common to all the sources. 44 As in the previous edition of this article, 8 Table 1 summarizes a compre- hensive list of drugs that potentiate, inhibit, or have no effect on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin based on the results of a systematic review of available evi-dence completed in 2005, which rated warfarin drug interaction reports according to interaction direc-tion, clinical severity, and quality of evidence, and developed lists of warfarin drug interactions consid-ered highly probable, probable, possible, and highly improbable. 48 Drugs such as cholestyramine can reduce the anti- coagulant effect of warfarin by reducing its absorp-tion. Other drugs potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin by inhibiting its clearance, whereas some drugs may inhibit the anticoagulant effect by enhancing its clearance. 49 These latter effects may be through stereoselective or nonselective pathways, 50,51 (stereoselective interactions may affect the oxida- \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e48S Oral Anticoagulant Therapy Table 1\u2014 [Section 1.3.2] Drug, Food, and Dietary Supplement Interactions With Warfarin by Level of Supporting Evidence and Direction of Interaction Level of Causation Anti-infectives CardiovascularAnalgesics, Antiinfl ammatories, and Immunologics Drugs Potentiation Highly probableCiprofl Voriconazole amounts) Ribavirin Rifampin (Continued) \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e49Swarfarin are unknown. Sulfonamides and several broad- spectrum antibiotic compounds may augment the anti-coagulant effect of warfarin in patients consuming diets that are de cient in vitamin K by eliminating bac-terial fl ora and aggravating vitamin K de ciency. 73 Drugs such as aspirin, 74 nonsteroidal antiinfl am- matory drugs, 75,76 penicillins in high doses, 77,78 and moxalactam 62 increase the risk of warfarin-associated bleeding by inhibiting platelet function. Of these, aspi-rin is the most important because of its widespread use and prolonged effect. 79,80 Aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinfl ammatory drugs can also produce gastric ero- sions that increase the risk of upper GI bleeding. This can occur even with COX-2 inhibitors, which were originally believed to be less likely to predispose to gastric bleeding than nonsteroidal antiinfl ammatory drugs. 76 In rofecoxib were associated with a 1.7- or 2.4-fold increased risk of GI hemorrhage, respec-tively. 76 The risk of clinically important bleeding is heightened when high doses of aspirin are taken dur-ing high-intensity warfarin therapy (INR, 3.0-4.5). 74,81 However, low doses of aspirin (ie, 75 to 100 mg daily) combined with moderate-intensity and low-intensity warfarin anticoagulation therapy are also associated with increased rates of bleeding. 82,83 The effect of sta- tins or brates on the risk of bleeding in patients on VKAs is controversial. The initiation of a brate or statin that inhibits CYP3A4 enzymes was recently reported to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleed-ing in warfarin-treated patients, whereas other statins that are mainly excreted unchanged were not found to be associated with such an increased risk. 84 Con- versely, other authors reported that long-term statin use is associated with a decreased risk of bleeding complications in patients with atrial brillation (AF) on warfarin therapy. 85 The most effective method to avoid adverse out- comes associated with drug interactions is to try to avoid, when feasible, concurrent use of potentially interacting drugs and to use noninteracting alterna-tives instead. When noninteracting alternatives are not available, adverse outcomes can be avoided by increasing the frequency of monitoring and adjusting warfarin doses based on INR response. Prospective dosing adjustments are inappropriate because of the unpredictable nature of patient response to drug interactions (see Holbrook et al 86 in this supplement ). 1.3.3 Environmental Factors: Nutritional supple- ments and herbal products are particularly problem- atic in that warfarin-treated patients often fail to inform physicians that they are using such products and physicians rarely ask. In one survey of 1,200 patients from four large anticoagulation clinics (ACs) in the Table 1\u2014Continued CardiovascularAnalgesics, Other Drugs Probable Dicloxacillin Bosentan Teicoplanin Data from Holbrook et al. 48 \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e50S Oral Anticoagulant Therapyof coagulation factors. 104 These patients may appear to be \"auto-anticoagulated\" with baseline elevated INRs, but the degree of suppression of clotting fac-tors does not mimic that of patients treated with warfarin and is not suf cient to prevent thromboem-bolism. 105 Hypermetabolic states produced by fever or hyperthyroidism increase warfarin responsiveness, probably by increasing the catabolism of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. 70,106 Certain com- ponents of cigarette smoke may induce CYP1A2, and warfarin dosing requirements have been observed to decline after smoking cessation. 107,108 Chewing tobacco contains high quantities of vitamin K that can increase warfarin dose requirements. 109 Exacer- bations of heart failure can increase responsiveness to warfarin therapy, likely in response to the effect of hepatic congestion on warfarin metabolism. 110 End- stage renal disease is associated with reduced activity of CYP2C9, leading to lower warfarin dosing require-ments in these patients. 111 Warfarin dosing require- ments decline with advanced age as a result of reduced availability of vitamin K stores and lower plasma concen-trations of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. 112-114 In fact, age may be the single most important easily obtained predictor of warfarin dosing requirement. 115 1.4 Antithrombotic Effect The antithrombotic effect of VKAs is attributed to their anticoagulant effect, which in turn is medi- ated by the reduction of four vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. The experiments of Wessler and Gitel 116 . 40 years ago using a stasis model of throm- bosis in rabbits showed that the antithrombotic effect of warfarin requires 6 days of treatment and requires the reduction of prothrombin (factor II), which has a relatively long half-life of about 60 to 72 h, compared with 6 to 24 h for other vitamin K-dependent factors. In a rabbit model of tissue factor-induced intravas-cular coagulation, the protective effect of warfarin mainly resulted from lowering prothrombin levels. 117 Patel and associates 118 demonstrated that clots formed from umbilical cord plasma containing about half the prothrombin concentration of plasma from adult control subjects generated signi cantly less brino- peptide A than clots formed from maternal plasma. The view that warfarin exerts its antithrombotic effect by reducing prothrombin levels is consistent with observations that clot-bound thrombin is an important mediator of clot growth 119 and that reduc- tion in prothrombin levels decreases the amount of thrombin generated and bound to brin, thereby reducing thrombogenicity. 118 The suggestion that the antithrombotic effect of VKAs is refl ected in lower levels of prothrombin forms the basis for overlapping the administration of United States, one-third of the patients used dietary supplements and one-third of all patients surveyed indicated that their provider failed to discuss potential interactions with them. 87 There is also little or no standardization of the content of such products, espe- cially herbal remedies, and reports of interactions are often anecdotal or single-case reports, without good substantiation. 88-91 Of the higher-quality studies, ginkgo and ginger were shown not to have an effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacody namics of warfarin in healthy subjects in a randomized, open- label, crossover, study, 92 and coenzyme Q 10 (and ginkgo) was shown not to have an effect on warfarin dosage in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. 93 Ginseng was shown to reduce the effect of warfarin in a ran- domized, placebo-controlled trial. 94 Not surprisingly, products such as green tea, with a high content of vitamin K, were shown to reduce the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. 48 Subjects receiving long-term warfarin therapy are sensitive to fl uctuating levels of dietary vitamin K, 95,96 which is derived predominantly from phylloquinones in plant material. 96 Sadowski and associates 97 have listed the phylloquinone content of a wide range of food, and the list can be found on the Internet (http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/cc/coumadin1.pdf). Phyllo-quinones act through the warfarin-insensitive path-way. 98 Important fl uctuations in vitamin K intake can occur in both healthy and sick subjects. 99 A n increased intake of dietary vitamin K that is suf - cient to reduce the anticoagulant response to warfa- rin occurs in patients consuming green vegetables or vitamin K-containing supplements, during weight-reduction diets, and in patients who have been treated with vitamin K supplements. 100 Reduced dietary vitamin K intake potentiates the effect of warfarin in ill patients who have been treated with antibiotics and IV fl uids without vitamin K supplementation and in patients who have states of fat malabsorption. In general, a consistent intake of vitamin K- containing foods is advisable, but neither speci c restrictions nor additions seem necessary in patients with stable anticoagulant control. Patients should be informed of possible changes in INR, in particular in response to the use of dietary supplements or herbs, or alcohol used chronically or ingested in large quantities. 101,102 More frequent monitoring of the INR should be proposed if dietary habits have substan-tially changed in response to weight reduction diets, periods following hospitalization, treatment with chemotherapy, sustained diarrhea or vomiting, or in case of anorexia. 103 A number of other conditions and disease states have been observed to infl uence anticoagulation with warfarin. Hepatic dysfunction potentiates the response to warfarin through the impaired synthesis \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e51Snormal plasma. A calibration model, 121 which was adopted in 1982, is now used to standardize reporting by converting the PT ratio measured with the local thromboplastin into an INR, calculated as follows: INR 5 (patient PT/mean normal PT) ISI or log INR 5 ISI(log observed PT ratio) where ISI denotes the ISI of the thromboplastin used at the local laboratory to perform the PT mea-surement. The ISI refl ects the responsiveness of a given thromboplastin to the reduction of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors compared with the primary World Health Organization (WHO) inter-national reference preparations, so that the more responsive the reagent, the lower the ISI value. 121 It is proposed that patients' samples for calibration should be selected by rejecting samples beyond the 1.5 to 4.5 INR range. 122 Outliers, de ned as points with a perpendicular distance greater than three residual SDs from the line of relationship, should be rejected. Selection of patients' samples and rejec-tion of outliers results in a reduction of the between- laboratory variation of calibration. 122 As the INR standard of reporting was widely adopted, a number of problems surfaced. These are listed in Table 2 and are reviewed briefl y here. The INR is based on ISI values derived from the plasma of patients who had received stable antico-agulant doses for at least 6 weeks. 123 As a result, the INR has not been validated and should be viewed with some skepticism early in the course of warfarin therapy, particularly when results are obtained from different laboratories. Even under these conditions, a parenteral anticoagulant with warfarin until the PT or INR is prolonged into the therapeutic range during the treatment of patients with thrombosis. Since the half-life of prothrombin is about 60 to 72 h, at least 5 days of overlap is necessary. 1.5 Monitoring Anticoagulant Intensity: the INR The PT test 120 is the most common test used to monitor VKA therapy. The PT responds to a reduc- tion of three of the four vitamin K-dependent proco-agulant clotting factors (ie, II, VII, and X) that are reduced by warfarin at a rate proportional to their respective half-lives. Thus during the rst few days of warfarin therapy the PT refl ects mainly a reduc-tion of factor VII, the half-life of which is approxi-mately 6 h. Subsequently, the reduction of factors X and II contributes to prolongation of the PT. The PT assay is performed by adding calcium and throm-boplastin to citrated plasma. Thromboplastins vary in responsiveness to a reduction of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. An unresponsive thromboplastin produces less prolongation of the PT for a given reduction in vitamin K-dependent clotting factors than a responsive one. The responsiveness of a thromboplastin can be measured by assessing its international sensitivity index (ISI) (see later discus-sion in this section ). Highly sensitive thromboplastins (indicated by an ISI of approximately 1.0) are now available that are composed of human tissue factor produced by recombinant technology and de ned phospholipid preparations. PT monitoring of VKA treatment is not standard- ized when expressed in seconds, or as a simple ratio of the patient plasma value to that of plasma from a healthy control subject, or as a percentage of diluted Table 2\u2014 [Section 1.5] Potential Problems With the INR (Causes of Erroneous INR) 8 Problems Description 1.

Thus, starting doses of /H11349 5 mg might be appropriate in the elderly, in patients with impaired nutrition, liver disease, or congestive heart failure, and in patients who are at high risk of bleeding. 112,115,147,148 An initial dose of 2 to 3 mg seems to be appropriate for patients who have undergone heart valve replacement, given their higher sensitivity to VKAs probably caused by the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and concomi-tant therapies. 149 Recommendations are provided in Holbrook et al. 86 As described in section In response to these observations, numerous investigators have attempted to assess the combined infl uence of patient factors on warfarin dos-ing requirement, with a goal of developing models to predict warfarin dose requirements based on assess-ment of various environmental and genetic factors. Sconce et al 42 found that a combination of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes plus height produced the best predictive model for estimating warfarin dose, whereas Vecsler et al 150 reported that CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes together with age and body weight could explain as much as 63% of the dose var-iance, and Herman et al 151 could attribute 60% of dose variability to CYP2C9 and VKORC1polymor-phisms, age, and body surface area. Limdi et al 152 found that CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms accounted for 30% of the variability in warfarin dose among European Americans but only for 10% among African Americans. In a prospective cohort study of 48 consecutive patients starting warfarin for pos-torthopedic surgery prophylaxis, the patients with a variant CYP2C9 allele had a greater than fourfold increase in the risk of the INR exceeding 4.0. How-ever, this substantial increase in the risk of suprather-apeutic INR was observed despite the fact that all patients had their warfarin dose selected using a com-plex algorithm that considered CYP2C9 genotype. 153 Gage et al 154 developed a dosing algorithm based on CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms along with clinical and demographic factors. In the deriva-tion cohort of 1,015 patients on warfarin therapy, body surface area, age, target INR, amiodarone use, smoker status, race, current thrombosis, G . A, CYP2C9(* )2 were all independent predictors of warfarin therapeutic dose. Three prospective studies have compared the time in therapeutic range (TTR; see section 1.6.2 \"Evalu-ating the Quality of Monitoring: TTR\" ) of patients using a pharmacogenetics-based dosing strategy with the TTR achieved when patients were managed however, the INR is more reliable than the uncon-verted PT ratio, 124 and its use is thus recommended during both the initiation and maintenance of VKAs. The validity of the INR in other conditions of impaired coagulation has been less frequently evalu-ated. Some authors have recently challenged the use of the INR in patients with liver disease and in par-ticular in prognostic scores such as the Model for End-stage Liver Disease. 125,126 Thus, a new INR spe- ci c for liver diseases has been proposed, derived by using plasma from patients with liver diseases to cali-brate thromboplastins instead of plasma from patients on oral anticoagulant treatment with VKAs. 125,126 The accuracy of the INR can be infl uenced by reagents with different sensitivities 127 and also by the automated clot detectors now used in most labo-ratories. 128-135 In general, the College of American Pathologists has recommended 136 that laboratories should use thromboplastin reagents that are at least moderately responsive (ie, ISI , 1.7) and reagent/instru- ment combinations for which the ISI has been estab-lished and validated. ISI values provided by the manufacturers of throm- boplastin reagents are not invariably correct when applied locally, 137-139 and this adversely affects the reliability of measurements. Local calibrations can be performed using plasma samples with certi ed PT values to determine the instrument-speci c ISI. The mean normal plasma PT is not interchangeable with a laboratory control PT. 140 Therefore, the use of other than a properly de ned mean normal PT can yield erroneous INR calculations, particularly when less-responsive reagents are used. The mean normal PT should be determined for each new batch of thrombo-plastin with the same instrument used to assay the PT. 140 The concentration of citrate that is used to antico- agulate plasma may affect the INR. 141,142 In general, higher citrate concentrations (eg, 3.8%) lead to higher INR values, 141 and under lling the blood collection tube spuriously prolongs the PT because excess citrate is present. Using collection tubes containing 3.2% concentrations of citrate for blood coagulation studies and adequately lling tubes can reduce this problem. 1.6 Practical Issues Related to Initiation and Maintenance 1.6.1 Approaches to the Induction of VKAs: Following the administration of VKAs, an initial effect on the INR usually occurs within the rst 2 or 3 days, depending on the dose administered, and an antithrombotic effect occurs within the next several days. 143,144 There is room for fl exibility in selecting a starting dose of warfarin. The results of clinical studies suggest that initiation doses between 5 and 10 mg \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e53S 1.6.2 Evaluating the Quality of Monitoring: TTR: The relationship between the intensity of treatment and the risk of an adverse event has been evaluated by examining the frequency of such events as a func-tion of the TTR. 161-163 A strong relationship between TTR and the rates of bleeding or thromboembolic events has been observed across studies 161-173 with dif- ferent patient populations, different target ranges, different scales for measuring intensity of anticoagu-lation (ie, PT, PT ratio, and INR), different methods of measuring TTR, and different models of dose man-agement. In a large, retrospective analysis of patients with mechanical heart valves, Cannegieter et al 164 found that risks of major bleeding or thromboembo-lism were greatly increased during the times when patients were above or below the therapeutic range of INR compared with times when they were within range. A similar relationship has been demonstrated for other groups of patients. 169,174 A recent substudy examined the infl uence of TTR on the relative effec-tiveness of warfarin and dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel in patients with nonval- vular AF, in which the overall result favored warfa-rin. 165 In this large retrospective analysis, the TTR during warfarin therapy appeared to be a major deter-minant of its ef cacy, since the advantage of warfarin over antiplatelet therapy was lost below a threshold TTR of between 58% and 65%. 165 The percentage of INRs or TTR is highly dependent on the quality of dose management as refl ected in studies that report TTR. Poor quality of dose management results in a high proportion of low INRs during the rst 3 months of treatment following an acute DVT, which in turn predicts a higher rate of subsequent recurrence. 161,175 The TTR refl ects the quality of dose adjustment in studies of patients managed in a usual care (UC) set-ting, by an anticoagulation management service (AMS), by patient self testing (PST) or patient self manage-ment (PSM), or in the setting of a randomized trial. TTR can be determined in different ways, so com- parisons between studies may be dif cult. 176 TTR is most commonly estimated by using one of three methodologies: calculating the fraction of all INR values that are within the therapeutic range (ie, the number of INRs in range divided by the total number of INR tests); using the \"cross-section of the les\" methodology, which assesses the fraction of patients with an INR in range at one point in time compared with the total number of patients who had an INR measured at that point in time; or applying the linear interpolation method of Rosendaal et al, 177 which assumes that a linear relationship exists between two INR values and allocates a speci c INR value to each day between tests for each patient. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages. 176 Furthermore, the results of all these methods depend on whether without knowledge of genotype. 155-157 Two of these studies showed no difference in TTR, whereas one study reported increased times in range for the phar-macogenetic group but had signi cant design fl aws. More recently, Klein et al 158 developed two dosing algorithms: one based on clinical variables only and one based on both clinical variables and genetic infor-mation. The ability of these two algorithms to predict subsequent warfarin doses was then compared in a validation cohort of . 1,000 patients. The pharmaco- genetic algorithm more accurately identi ed patients who required /H11349 21 mg weekly warfarin doses and patients who required weekly doses of /H11350 49 mg in comparison with the clinical algorithm and to a xed- dose approach, whereas no difference was detected in the prediction of intermediate doses. A few studies have suggested that certain geno- types are associated with adverse events. Thus, Higashi et al 29 studied 185 patients, 58 with at least one variant genotype of CYP2C9, and found an increased risk of having INRs above range (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.03-1.90) and of a serious or life-threatening bleeding event (HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.18-4.86) in those with variant genotypes. The latter hazard estimate was based on a few events in a very small number of patients with the variant genotypes. Joffe et al, 159 also studying CYP2C9 single nucleotide polymorphisms, found a trend toward increased rates of an INR . 6.0 and of bleeding in patients who were categorized as heterozygotes, or compound heterozy-gotes/homozygotes, compared with those categorized as wild type, as did Veenstra et al. 30 A similar increased risk of bleeding was seen in patients with these poly-morphisms who were taking acenocoumarol but not phenprocoumon. 32 On the other hand, neither CYP2C9 nor VKORC1infl uenced the risk of bleeding in a more recent study by Limdi et al. 160 Likewise, the only high-quality, randomized, con- trolled trial performed to date showed that use of a pharmacogenetic-based dosing strategy did not sig-ni cantly reduce the risk of adverse events (34.7% in pharmacogenetic group vs 42.4% in control group; OR 5 0.72; 95% CI, 0.41-1.28]). 155 This issue is fur- ther discussed and recommendations are provided in Holbrook et al. 86 When rapid anticoagulant effect is required, a rap- idly acting parenteral anticoagulant should be started together with the VKA and discontinued after at least 5 days of concomitant therapy and once the INR has been in the therapeutic range for at least two mea-surements approximately 24 h apart. This allows fac-tors X and II to be reduced to levels suf cient to treat VTE. If there is no urgent need for an immediate anticoagulant effect (eg, in chronic stable AF), warfa-rin administration can be commenced without the concurrent use of a rapid-acting anticoagulant. \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e54S Oral Anticoagulant Therapyboth arms of the study. More recently, Witt et al 186,187 found that patients with very stable INR levels de ned by extremely high TTR rates required fewer visits for INR control and had signi cantly fewer hemorrhagic and thromboembolic events than patients with a less-stable INR; they suggested that many warfarin-treated patients whose INR values remain within the therapeutic range over time could be safely treated with INR recall intervals . 4 weeks. In this study, advanced age predicted stable anticoagulation . 1.6.4 Factors Associated With INR Stability in Long-term Management: Two recent studies have assessed factors associated with very stable INR control during treatment with VKAs. 186,187 In the rst study, 2,504 patients with INR values entirely within the INR range for 6 months were compared with 3,569 patients with at least one INR value outside the INR range. 186 In the second study, 533 patients with INR values within the therapeutic range for 12 months were compared with 2,555 control subjects. 187 Inde- pendent predictors of stability were age . 70 years, the absence of chronic diseases, and (in one study only 187 ) male gender. Congestive heart failure, dia- b etes, and a target range for INR /H11350 3.0 were associated with instability. Physical activity also seems to play a role in the sta- bility of the response to warfarin. A reduction in the anticoagulant effect has been found to be correlated with a sudden increase in physical activity. An increase in warfarin requirements associated with an increase in physical activity (represented by a daily exercise such as walking) has been described both in patients and in healthy subjects. 188,189 Changes in dietary vitamin K intake may infl uence the stability of the INR in patients on VKAs, and a few trials have assessed its impact on therapeutic stability. Sorano et al 190 showed that controlling the intake of dietary vitamin K can achieve a more stable anticoagulant response. Sconce et al, 191 by comparing the daily vitamin K intake in 26 unstable patients and in 26 stable control patients, showed that unstable patients have poorer intake of vitamin K. Kurnik et al 192 showed that in vitamin K-depleted patients, very small amounts of vitamin K-containing vitamins will infl u- ence the INR to a greater extent compared with those with an adequate vitamin K status. Schurgers et al, 193 studying healthy volunteers on oral anticoagulation, found that a daily dose of vitamin K of at least 150 m g was needed to alter the INR response. Reese et al, 194 in a retrospective analysis, assessed the effect of a daily dose of 100 m g of vitamin K 1 in nine unstable patients. These patients experienced an increase in the percentage of INRs in range from 32% to 57% in response to the daily vitamin K. In a prospective, open-label, crossover study, Ford et al 195 found that an exact or an expanded therapeutic range is used, 178 whether INRs obtained during invasive procedures when warfarin therapy might be interrupted are included, and whether different oral anticoagulant preparations (eg, warfarin, phenprocoumon, aceno-coumarol, or fl uindione) are included. 179,180 Since clinical outcome studies have not compared one methodology with another and correlated their results with adverse events, no one method can be recom-mended, and the reader should be aware of these differences. 1.6.3 Frequency of Monitoring: In hospitalized patients, INR monitoring is usually performed daily until the therapeutic range has been achieved and maintained for at least 2 consecutive days. In outpa-tients starting VKA therapy, initial monitoring may be reduced to once every few days until a stable dose response has been achieved. When the INR response is stable, the frequency of testing can be reduced to intervals as long as every 4 to 6 weeks (or possibly longer in particularly stable patients). If adjustments to the dose are required, then the cycle of more fre-quent monitoring should be repeated until a stable dose response can again be achieved. The optimal frequency of long-term INR moni- toring is infl uenced by patient compliance, transient fl uctuations in the severity of comorbid conditions, the addition or discontinuation of other medica-tions, changes in diet, the quality of dose-adjustment decisions, and whether the patient has demonstrated a stable dose response. The dose required to main-tain a therapeutic range for patients . 60 years of age decreases with increasing age, 112,115,181,182 possibly because of a reduction in the clearance of warfarin with age. 183 Gender also infl uences dose, with women requiring less warfarin to maintain a therapeutic INR than men at an equivalent age. 115 To compare different intervals between measure- ments of INR in stable patients, Pengo et al 184 ran- domized 124 patients with prosthetic mechanical heart valves and at least 6 months of a steady dose requirement to INR monitoring at either 6-week or 4-week intervals. They found no differences of time in, above, or below range between the groups, although the actual monitoring intervals were 24.9 days in the 6-week group and 22.5 days in the 4-week group ( P , .0003). 184 In a retrospective study of . 4,000 patients with chronic AF and . 250,000 INRs, Shalev et al 185 found that time in range increased as the testing interval decreased from every 5 weeks or more to every 3 weeks (41% to 48%, P , .0005), and the investigators suggested that patients should be monitored at time intervals no longer than every 3 weeks. However, the strength of the recommenda-tion is reduced by the very poor TTR reported in \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e55SIn a case-control study on the most unstable patients from 35 Italian ACs, poor comprehension of the indications and mechanisms of VKAs was the most important predictor of instability among other fac-tors, including working status, type of VKA, and a poor score on a mental test. 161 In a single-center study carried out on outpatients attending an AC in the United States, perceived barriers to compliance with warfarin, marital status, living arrangements, and drug regimen played signi cant roles in warfarin noncompliance. 201 In a prospective cohort study of adults initiating warfarin at two ACs, independent risk factors for nonadherence were education level, employment status, mental health functioning, and cognitive impairment. 202 1.7 Data Management An obstacle to the safety and effectiveness of war- farin therapy is the poor quality of dose management in routine clinical practice. Adequate anticoagulant care with the VKAs requires a system of patient edu-cation and careful data management to record and track INR values and to ensure patients are treated with anticoagulants for an appropriate period of time. 1.7.1 The Role of Anticoagulation Clinics: Nonran- domized, retrospective studies have reported better outcomes in patients when anticoagulant therapy is managed by an AMS or an AC compared with man-agement by their personal physicians (ie, UC). Four such studies have reported major bleeding rates rang ing from 2.8% to 8.1% per patient-year of UC. 203-206 Rates of thromboembolism with UC were not reported except in two studies in which the event rates were 6.2% and 8.1% per patient-year. Similarly, retrospective and prospective cohort studies of care provided by an AMS reported rates of major hem- orrhage or thrombosis ranging from 1.4% to 6.3% patient-year of therapy, respec-tively. 164,170,207-210 Three retrospective comparative stud- ies using a before-and-after design of patients managed by UC or an AMS reported signi cant improvements in the outcomes of hemorrhage or thrombosis with AMS-directed care. 211-213 In contrast, however, two prospective, randomized controlled trials 214,215 com- paring UC with the care of an AMS failed to show a signi cant difference in major hemorrhage or thromboembolism. The study by Matchar et al 214 also failed to show a signi cant improvement in TTR, although the AMS performed modestly better than UC. Wilson et al 215 did observe a signi cant improve- ment in TTR in the AMS group compared with UC (82% vs 76% respectively, P 5 .034). They also noted more high-risk INRs with UC than with an AMS (40% vs 30%, P 5 .005). This latter study had a major ve of nine patients improved their stability with administration of low-dose vitamin K. As expected, the INR initially decreased in patients given vitamin K, and an increased dose of warfarin was needed to reestablish an INR within the therapeutic range, which took from 2 to 35 days to achieve. In a nested case-control study, Rombouts et al 196 assessed the effect of dietary vitamin K intake on the risk of subtherapeutic INR values and the interaction between usual and recent vitamin K intake. Patients with a high usual vitamin K intake had less risk of a subtherapeutic INR, an effect possibly mediated by a reduced infl u- ence on the INR of an incidental consumption of vitamin K-rich food when there is a high usual intake of vitamin K. In these last two studies, variable INR was de ned as requiring a minimum of three warfa-rin dose changes or three INRs outside of the thera-peutic range in the preceding 6 months, 195 or an INR SD . 0.5 with at least three warfarin dose changes during the previous 6 months. 196 Sconce et al 197 conducted the rst randomized, blinded trial in 70 unstable patients over a 6-month period. Vitamin K supplementation with 150 m g/d resulted in a signi cantly greater decrease in SD of the INR compared with placebo ( 2 0.24 /H11006 0.14 vs 2 0.11 /H11006 0.18; P , .001) and a signi cantly greater increase in percentage of time within (28% /H11006 et al 198 randomized 100 patients treated with phenprocoumon to receive daily doses of 100 m g of vitamin K and 100 patients to receive a placebo. Vitamin K improved the stability of anticoagulant therapy, with a relative risk of maximal stability (where all INR results were in range) in the vitamin K group compared with the placebo group of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1-2.7). De Assis et al 199 randomized patients with a recent INR value outside the therapeutic range to a conven-tional approach based on changes in anticoagulant prescription or to a strategy that adjusted the dietary intake of vitamin K. Patients in the latter group had signi cantly more INR values within the therapeutic range and signi cantly fewer episodes of minor bleeding as compared with patients in the former group. As with any other drug, a patient's nonadherence to prescribed dosing with VKAs is one of the most important causes of INR instability. In a prospective cohort study at three US ACs aimed to determine the effect of adherence on anticoagulation control, patients treated with warfarin were monitored with an electronic system that records each time they open their medication container. 200 There was a high pro- portion of missed tablets and, as expected, in multi-variable analyses there was a signi cant association between under-adherence and under-anticoagulation. \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e56S Oral Anticoagulant Therapyproved comparable to manual regulation in terms of the percentage of INR values maintained within the therapeutic range but required 50% fewer changes of dose. The rst multicenter randomized trial, in 285 patients, of one computerized dosage program in 1998 223 showed a 22% overall improvement of con- trol with the program compared with the perfor-mance of experienced medical staff. The computer program gave signi cantly better overall INR control across all target INR ranges. A slight improvement in TTR was also obtained by Italian investigators 224 using a different management program in . 1,200 ran- domized patients from ve centers. A total of 71.2% of patients were in range with computer dosing and 68.2% were in range by manual dosing during the maintenance phase. 224 In both of these studies, the computer's improved results were probably due, in part, to a reduced propensity to reduce warfarin doses when the INR was at the upper limit of the \"desired\" range. More recently, the European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation completed the rst international, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial aimed to compare the safety and effectiveness of computer-assisted dosing of VKAs, using two computer pro-grams in different centers (DAWN AC; 4S Information Sys, and PARMA; Instrumentation Laboratories), with conventional manual dosing. 225 A total of 13,052 patients treated with a VKA were followed for a total of 18,617 patient-years. Overall, there was a trend toward fewer clinical events with computer- assisted dosage. There was also a statistically signif- icant reduction in clinical events in the subgroup treated for VTE. A subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis found computer-assisted dosing cheaper than manual dosing. 226 The results of two small clinical trials suggest that computerized dose management can also be at least as effective as manual dosing by trained antico-agulation physicians or nurses during the initiation of anticoagulation therapy. 224,227 However, some com- puterized programs are unable to manage dosing during the induction phase. 1.7.3 Point of Care INR Testing: Point of care (POC) monitors measure a thromboplastin-mediated clotting time using a ngerstick sample of capillary whole blood or un-anticoagulated venous whole blood. 228 The result is then converted to a plasma PT equivalent by a microprocessor and is expressed as a PT and/or INR. Each manufacturer typically establishes the conversion formula by simulta-neously comparing ngerstick or venous whole blood results with an established laboratory method and reagent that is traceable to the international refer- ence thromboplastin. limitation in that all patients were initially managed in an AMS for 3 months until they were stable and then observed for only 3 months after randomiza-tion to either receive UC or to continue care by the AMS. 215 The other study 214 suffered from a high turnover of patients, the possibility of selection bias affecting the referral of patients to the AMS, the open nature of the study, and targeted ranges that were sometimes outside recommended guidelines. In a retrospective, multicenter, international cohort study, 1,511 patients were randomly recruited from clinics offering routine medical care (UC) in the United States, Canada, and France, and from ACs in Italy and Spain. 216 Major management differences were detected, especially between AC care and routine medical care, but also among countries. For patients managed by routine medical care, documentation of care was often inadequate. Finally, less time in thera-peutic INR range was noted in routine medical care. In a systematic review of 67 studies represent- ing . 50,000 patients managed by ACs (68%), during clinical trials (7%), or in community practices (24%), van Walraven et al 217 found that the practice setting had the greatest effect on anticoagulation control. TTR (days) varied from 56.7% in community prac-tices to 65.6% in ACs and 66.4% for randomized trials. Compared with randomized trials the abso-lute reduction of TTR for community practices was 2 12.2% (95% CI, 2 19.5 to 2 4.8). The difference between community practices and ACs was 2 8.3% (95% CI, 2 4.4 to 2 12.1). 1.7.2. Computerized Monitoring: Computer assis- tance by the use of dedicated programs may improve dose management and TTR. Although programs differ, they typically calculate whether a dose adjust-ment is necessary from a user-de ned table of trend rules for each therapeutic range. If dose adjustment is required, the current INR is compared with the target INR, and a proprietary equation calculates the new dose. The time to the next test is also set by the program using a set of variables comparing the cur-rent INR, the interval from the last test, the number of previous changes, and the number of previous INR values within the target range. A number of early studies 218-220 evaluated computer programs to improve warfarin dosing. The rst ran- domized study in 1993 221 showed that three contem- porary computer programs all performed as well as the experienced medical staff of an anticoagula-tion management service in achieving a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0, but the computer achieved signi cantly better control when more intensive therapy was required (ie, INR, 3.0-4.5). In another randomized study 222 of 101 patients receiving long-term antico- agulation, computerized warfarin dose adjustment \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e57SEuropean Concerted Action on Anticoagulation has recently tested 523 Coaguchek monitors at nine clinics and found that 20.3% of the monitors showed signi - cant deviations. 257 PST or PSM using a POC instrument represents another model of care with the potential for improved outcomes as well as greater convenience. 258 Several systematic reviews have shown improvements in the quality of anticoagulation control (TTR) and/or inci-dence of adverse events with PST and/or PSM. 259-261 Heneghan et al 261 pooled estimates from 14 random- ized trials of PST showing a signi cant thromboembolic events 0.65; 0.42-0.99) vs the comparator. For PST and PSM combined, there were signi cant reductions in thromboembolic events (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.12-0.59) and death (OR, not major hemorrhage (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.42-2.05). In a recent ran-domized study from France comparing monthly laboratory monitoring with weekly self testing and monitoring in patients with prosthetic heart valves, self monitoring improved INR stability and reduced the incidence of bleeding, although the study was underpowered to show a true difference in clinical outcomes. 262 Another recent randomized study from Germany compared INR monitoring by the primary care physician with self management in patients with prosthetic heart valves and found greater INR stability and a lower incidence of thromboembolic events in the group of self-managed patients but no differences in bleeding events. 263 PST and PSM require special patient training to implement. 264,265 This mode of therapy may not be suitable for all patients and may not be practical or cost-effective in certain settings. All participants in PST/PSM programs should participate in a recog-nized external quality assessment program. 1.8 Optimal Intensity Ranges The optimal target range for the INR is not the same for all indications. In general, because bleed- ing is closely related to the intensity of anticoagula- tion, 164,266-268 there has been interest in establishing the lowest effective therapeutic range for each indication. 268-276 Investigators have used various methodological approaches to establish the most appropriate range for different indications. These are as follows: (1) ran-domized trials in which patients are assigned to one of two different target ranges 270-274 ; (2) indirect com- parisons, in which outcomes are compared between separate randomized trials of VKA therapy that applied different target ranges of INR, and the control Numerous studies 229-248 have reported on the accu- racy and precision of these instruments and on the ability of patients, both adults and children, to obtain an INR and to use that INR to guide their anticoagu-lant therapy. However, limitations to the accuracy and precision of POC INR monitors have been documented. Problems identi ed with POC instruments include greater differences compared with a standard plasma-based methodology as INRs increase above the therapeutic range, 242,243 incorrect calibration of the ISI of the POC instruments, 244 the inability to cal- culate a mean normal PT, 249 and instrument-speci c inaccuracies of the INR in patients with antiphospho-lipid antibodies. 250 In a recent systematic review of the literature, Gialamas et al 251 concluded that there is still no robust evidence that the use of POC instru-ments in general practice improves health outcomes or is cost-effective compared with UC and that ana-lytical quality is comparable to laboratory testing. A major problem of comparative studies is the fact that there is a similar lack of correlation of INR results when anticoagulated plasmas are simultaneously com- pared using different instrument/thromboplastin combinations. 129-135 These differences may be clini- cally important in that they may lead to different dosing decisions. 128-134 Kaatz et al 252 compared two POC monitors and four clinical laboratories against a secondary reference thromboplastin preparation. They found that laboratories using a more sensitive thromboplastin showed close agreement with the standard, whereas laboratories using an insensitive thromboplastin showed poor agreement. The two POC monitors fell between these two extremes. Steps are still needed to ensure the conformity of POC PT monitors to the WHO INR PT standardi-zation scheme, but the WHO ISI calibration proce-dure is not practicable using the monitors. Simpler procedures for ISI calibration of POC monitors have recently been evaluated in a number of multicenter sites by the European Concerted Action on Anti-coagulation and the UK National External Quality Assessment Schemes. By using lyophilized plasma calibrants with independently certi ed INRs, Poller 253-255 have shown that veri cation or recalibration of the ISI of the instrument is possible. However, to obtain reliable ISI values for the two instruments tested they had to develop different ISI calibration methods. It is likely, therefore, that different types of POC monitor systems will require different ISI calibration methods. In a study of pro - ciency testing of three POC monitors over 6 years in . 10 centers, Kitchen et al 256 found in each survey that INR results in 10% to 11% of centers were . 15% different from results in other centers using the same monitors. This compared with a 12% difference for hospitals using conventional INR techniques. The \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e58S Oral Anticoagulant TherapyINR testing, changes in vitamin K intake, changes in the absorption of vitamin K or VKAs, changes in the metabolism of VKAs, changes in vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor synthesis or metabolism, other effects of concomitant drug use, or patient noncom-pliance. A number of studies have shown that adverse event rates rise sharply as the INR moves above or below the target INR interval. 163,164,174 A recent retro- spective analysis of . 3,000 patients with AF found that the one-third with the poorest INR control (48% of time in range) had twice the rate of stroke, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, and death as did the one-third with the best INR control (83% of time in range). 163 However, the risk of adverse events associated with a single INR outside the therapeutic range is probably low. For example, although excessively elevated INR values are clearly associated with an increased risk of bleeding, in particular for INR values of . 5.0, 164,169,170,268 data from a large registry of warfarin-treated patients suggest that the short-term risk for major bleeding is low for someone with a single INR value between 5.0 and 9.0 (0.96% at 1 month). 291 Similarly, in a ret- rospective, matched cohort study of 2,597 patients on warfarin therapy, the risk of thromboembolic events at 3 months in patients with stable INRs who experi-enced a single signi cant subtherapeutic INR value was low (0.4%) and was not signi cantly different from the risk observed in patients with persistently stable INRs. 292 Similar rates were reported in a popu- lation of 294 patients with mechanical heart valves experiencing a single subtherapeutic INR and in a large cohort of patients who required short-term dis-continuation of warfarin to undergo minor outpatient interventions. 293,294 Before executing a plan for managing an episode of altered anticoagulation effect, important factors relating to the collection and processing of the blood sample must be taken into consideration. For exam-ple, a spuriously elevated INR should be suspected when a patient with previously stable INR control presents with a very high INR result in the absence of any explanation for the loss of INR control. Spurious results might also be suspected when abnormalities were encountered during sample collection (eg, the phlebotomist had a dif cult time obtaining a sample or combined the contents of two collection tubes, and so forth). 295 Recommendations for the manage- ment of patients whose INR is outside the therapeutic range are provided in Holbrook et al. 86 1.10 Adverse Events 1.10.1 Bleeding Events: The rate of hemorrhagic events must be interpreted in the context of the clin- ical characteristics of the group studied. Factors that patients received no therapy or another antithrom-botic agent (usually aspirin) 277-280 ; (3) subgroup analyses of observational studies (including within treatment groups of randomized trials) relating the observed INR or time spent in an INR range at the time of the outcome to either a bleeding event or thromboem-bolic event 164,207,208,267,268,281 ; and (4) case-control studies in which the INR levels at the time of an event are recorded and compared with INR levels in appropri-ately selected control subjects. 174 When moderate-intensity INR (approximately 2.0-3.0) was compared with higher-intensity adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation, 269,272-274,278-280 the moderate treatment intensity was shown to reduce the risk of clinically important bleeding without reducing ef - cacy. Conversely, a lower treatment intensity (eg, INR range 1.5-2.0) appears to be less effective than moderate-intensity therapy. For example, a random-ized trial demonstrated that an INR of , 2.0 (INR target, 1.5-2.0) 270 reduced the recurrence of venous thrombosis after an initial 3 to 6 months of standard treatment when compared with placebo. A subse-quent clinical trial, 271 however, found that maintain- ing an INR intensity of 2.0 to 3.0 in the same clinical setting was more effective than a lower intensity of 1.5 to 2.0 and was not associated with a greater risk of bleeding. Likewise, in patients with AF, a ran-domized trial 282 reported that adjusted-dose warfarin therapy (INR, 2.0-3.0) was more effective than the combination of xed-dose warfarin (3 mg/d) and aspi-rin; other studies showed that the ef cacy of oral anticoagulant agents is reduced when the INR falls to , 2.0. 174,207,208,283-285 Warfarin targeted to an INR of , 2.0 has also been shown to be ineffective for pre- venting failure of dialysis access grafts. 286 The use of xed minidose warfarin (1 mg daily) has been evaluated in a number of clinical settings. A num-ber of these studies reported that xed minidose war-farin is ineffective when compared with dose-adjusted warfarin, in particular for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF and for the prevention of thrombo-sis of central venous catheters. 287-290 There is currently no evidence to support the use of xed mini-doses of either acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon in any set-ting. However, the data obtained with xed minidoses of warfarin cannot be extrapolated to other VKAs because of their different half-lives and the likelihood they would have different pharmacodynamic effects at similar doses. The optimal target range for each indication is discussed speci cally in other articles in this supplement pertaining to each indication. 1.9 Signi cance of Nontherapeutic INRs Fluctuations in INR may occur because of any one or more of the following conditions: inaccuracy in \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e59SOf these patients, 27 receiving anticoagulant therapy (84%) and eight control patients (73%) were found to have signi cant underlying disease, with three can-cers found in the combined group (7%). Other case series 301,302 have reported a higher likelihood of under- lying lesions in patients who develop hematuria while receiving anticoagulant therapy. 1.10.2 Factors Predictive of Bleeding Events: The most important factor infl uencing the risk of bleeding is the intensity of anticoagulant therapy. 162,164,169,170,174, 208,266-269,272-275,283-285 The likelihood of bleeding has been reported to rise steeply as the INR increases above 5.0. 164,169,170,268 The optimal target range for each indi- cation and the lowest effective range are discussed speci cally in other articles in this supplement per- taining to each indication. Several patient characteristics are associated with higher odds of bleeding during anticoagulation ther-apy. The patient factor most consistently predictive of major bleeding is a history of bleeding (especially GI bleeding). 162,208,273 Other factors associated with a higher risk of bleeding include advanced age; the presence of a serious comorbid condition, such as cancer, renal insuf ciency, liver disease, arterial hyper-tension, and prior stroke; alcohol abuse; and the use of concomitant therapies, in particular antiplatelet drugs. 162,203,204,207,303 A number of prediction models of bleeding risk have been proposed. Dahri and Loewen 304 performed a qualitative review of the published clinical predic-tion rules that estimated bleeding risk in patients starting on warfarin. The authors found seven studies, of which four presented distinct clinical prediction rules. Because none of these scores exhibited suf - cient predictive accuracy or evaluated the impact of their use on patient outcomes, the authors concluded that no existing clinical prediction rules can be rec-ommended for widespread use in practice at present. One prediction model that was prospectively vali-dated in different outpatient populations identi ed four independent factors associated with an increased risk of bleeding. These factors were age . 65 years, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, history of stroke, and at least one of following diabetes. 203 Another model, derived using registry data from patients with AF, identi ed prior bleeding, hepatic or renal disease, ethanol abuse, malignancy, age . 75 years, reduced platelet count or function, hypertension (uncontrolled), anemia, genetic factors (CYP2C9 polymorphism), an excessive risk of falls, and a history of stroke as risk factors for bleeding. 305 The impact of age on bleeding risk remains contro- versial, with older reports nding risk increasing with age, 162,163,181,267,306,307 whereas newer studies have failed infl uence the rate of bleeding include the following: the target INR range; whether patients are mostly new to therapy or have long-term experience with therapy; whether an INR or PT is used to manage therapy; the indication for anticoagulation; the type of VKA; patient-speci c risk factors, including con-comitant antiplatelet therapy; and the quality of dose management. It is also not appropriate to extrapolate the rates of adverse events from randomized con-trolled trials to everyday practice, because high-risk patients may be excluded from clinical trials, and moni-toring and management of anticoagulation are often better coordinated in clinical trials than in clinical practice. When bleeding occurs, especially from the GI or urinary tract, the presence of an underlying occult lesion should always be considered. This is important because the patient factor that most consistently pre-dicts major bleeding is a history of other bleeding, particularly from the GI tract. 207 A number of descrip- tive studies 296-298 have reported on the of occult lesions. Coon and Willis 296 identi ed occult lesions that were responsible for bleeding in 11% of 292 patients with hemorrhage. Jaf n et al 297 found a 12% prevalence of positive stool occult blood test results in 175 patients receiving warfarin or hep-arin compared with 3% in 74 control subjects. There was no difference between the mean PT or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in patients with positive and negative test results. Among the patients with positive stool occult blood test results, 15 of 16 patients had a lesion that had not been previously suspected, and four patients had neoplastic disease. Landefeld et al 266 found that 14 of 41 patients with GI bleeding had important remediable lesions, of which two were malignant. To perform endoscopy in these patients is an important choice, because endoscopy has been shown in prospective studies to identify the bleeding source in . 50% of patients managed with anticoagulant therapy who present with upper GI tract bleeding and because endoscopic therapy for nonvariceal upper GI bleeding achieves hemostasis in . 90% of patients. 299 This limited information sup- ports the need to investigate patients with occult GI bleeding, as it may herald the presence of an under-lying malignancy or other lesion that is frequently recti able. In a 2-year prospective study in which enrolled patients had monthly urinalysis, Culclasure et al 300 found microscopic hematuria in 3.2% of patients receiving oral anticoagulation compared with 4.8% in the control group not receiving anticoagulant therapy. There was no difference in the rate of hematuria with therapeutic or high INRs. Following a second epi-sode of hematuria, 43 patients (32 receiving anticoag-ulant therapy, 11 control patients) were investigated. \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e60S Oral Anticoagulant Therapyone) and blood derivatives such as fresh frozen plasma and prothrombin complex concentrates and recom-binant activated factor VII. 303,320 Interruption of VKAs may be suf cient in patients who need an elective invasive procedure or in asymp-tomatic patients with an elevated INR value and a low risk for bleeding. In this latter case, it must be noted that it takes approximately 2.5 days for an INR between 6.0 and 10.0 to decline to , 4.0. 321 Because acenocoumarol has a much shorter half-life than war-farin, the time required for an effective decline will be less and is probably no more than 1 day for most patients. 322,323 Conversely, the longer half-life of phen- procoumon will probably result in a much slower decline. Finally, the half-life of fl uindione is similar to that of warfarin, and thus a similar decline should be expected. Phytonadione (vitamin K 1 , a form of vitamin K derived from plants) has been used in clinical trials that assessed the usefulness of oral vitamin K for the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy. 324 Vitamin K 2 (menaquinone, which is synthesized by bacteria) and vitamin K 3 (menadione) are not widely available and have not been well studied in clinical trials. 324 Low doses of phytonadione can be adminis- tered orally in combination with warfarin interrup-tion in patients not requiring urgent reversal. When oral phytonadione is administered in conjunction with temporary interruption of warfarin therapy, approxi-mately 1.4 days are required for an INR between 6 and 10 to decline to , 4.0. 321 When administered intravenously, low doses of phytonadione produce sim-ilar reductions as oral phytonadione in the INR value at 24 h, whereas subcutaneous phytonadione appears to be less effective than low-dose oral phytonadione. 325,326 When administered at higher doses for the management of the bleeding patient, intravenously administered phytonadione works more rapidly than either oral or subcutaneous vitamin K 1 . 325,327,328 Reduction of the INR begins within 2 h, and a correction to within the normal range is gener-ally achieved within 24 h if hepatic function is normal and if a suf ciently large dose is given. 324 At 24 h, 5 mg of oral and 1 mg or IV vitamin K 1 produce sim- ilar effects on the INR. 325 IV phytonadione may cause anaphylactoid reactions. Although frequently reported, and likely more common in patients who receive large IV doses administered rapidly, the true frequency of this complication is about three per 10,000 doses administered, and it may be more likely to occur if formulations containing polyethoxy-lated castor oil are used to maintain the vitamin K in solution. 329 To minimize the risk of anaphylactoid reactions, vitamin K 1 should be mixed in a minimum of 50 mL of intravenous fl uid and administered, using an infusion pump, over a minimum of 20 min. to nd this association. 170,205,207,268,282,308-310 The discrep- ancy may be partly explained by the wide range in the mean age of the patients enrolled in the various studies, the relative lack of representation in most studies of patients . 80 years of age, and the selection and survi- vorship biases in noninception cohort studies. When investigators attempt to separate the effect of age from comorbid conditions associated with age, some have concluded that age in and of itself is not a major inde-pendent risk factor, 112,267,311 whereas others have found it to be an independent risk factor 266,268 even after con- trolling for the intensity of the anticoagulant effect. Some have suggested that older patients may have a lower risk of bleeding when managed by AMS. 312,313 Even if the overall risk of bleeding is not increased in the elderly, it is clear that the risk of intracranial hem-orrhage increases with age. 267,268,314,315 Warfarin is frequently used concurrently with other antithrombotic agents. A meta-analysis assessing clin-ical studies comparing warfarin alone and warfarin in association with aspirin found that the combination increased the risk of bleeding by almost one-half compared with warfarin alone (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.00-2.02 ). 316 A combined analysis of the SPORTIF (Stroke Prevention Using an Oral Thrombin Inhib-itor in Atrial Fibrillation) III and V trials involving 481 patients who received aspirin and warfarin com-pared with 3,172 patients who received warfarin alone demonstrated a signi cant 1.6% per year increase in major bleeding. 317 Although there are no randomized controlled trials that have compared bleeding rates in patients receiving \"triple therapy\" (usually warfa-rin, aspirin, and clopidogrel) with either warfarin alone or with a \"dual therapy,\" a systematic review identi ed 12 reports involving 3,413 patients treated with oral anticoagulants who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stent insertion and subse-quently received the combination of aspirin, clo-pidogrel, and warfarin. The rates of major bleeding in patients receiving triple therapy ranged from 0% to 21% (mean 7.4%) during up to 21 months of follow-up and 0% to 5.9% (mean 2.6%) during 30 days of follow-up. 318 In a Danish nationwide registry of patients with AF, all combinations of warfarin, aspi-rin, and clopidogrel were associated with an increased risk of nonfatal and fatal bleeding, whereas dual or triple therapy carried a more than threefold higher bleeding risk than warfarin alone. 319 1.10.3 Reversal Strategies: Strategies to reverse the effect of VKAs may be needed in patients who require urgent invasive procedures, in asymptomatic patients presenting with excessively elevated INR values, and in bleeding patients. Therapeutic options include interruption of VKA treatment as well as the admin-istration of vitamin K (usually vitamin K1, phytonadi- \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e61Sthe subcutaneous fat (in the case of skin necrosis) and massive outfl ow obstruction of the venous circulation of the limb (in the case of limb gangrene). The path-ogenesis of these complications and the reason for the localization of the lesions are not well understood. An association between warfarin-induced skin necro-sis and protein C de ciency 336-339 and, less commonly, protein S de ciency 339 has been reported, but this complication also occurs in nonde cient individuals. A pathogenic role for protein C de ciency is sup-ported by the similarity of the lesions to those seen in neonatal purpura fulminans, which complicates homozygous protein C de ciency. A variant of this syndrome also attributed to a severe warfarin-induced depletion of protein C is the occurrence of venous limb gangrene during warfarin treatment of cancer-associated DVT 340 and in some patients with heparin- induced thrombocytopenia started on warfarin after withdrawal of heparin. 341,342 The management of patients with warfarin-induced skin necrosis who require life- long anticoagulant therapy is problematic. Therapy with warfarin is considered to be contraindicated, and long-term heparin therapy is inconvenient and is associated with osteoporosis. A reasonable approach in such patients is to restart warfarin therapy at a low dose (eg, 2 mg), under the coverage of therapeutic doses of parenteral anticoagulants, and to gradually increase the warfarin dose over 1 or more weeks. This approach should avoid an abrupt fall in protein C levels before there is a reduction in the levels of fac-tors II, IX, and X, and it has been reported to not be associated with the recurrence of skin necrosis in a number of case reports. 337,338,342 The purple toe syndrome may very rarely occur in association with the initiation of VKA treatment. It is a nonhemorrhagic, cutaneous complication due to cholesterol emboli that usually develops 3 to 8 weeks after the start of warfarin therapy and is character-ized by the sudden appearance of bilateral, painful, purple lesions on the toes and sides of the feet that blanch with pressure. 343,344 The VKAs also interfere with the carboxylation of Gla proteins that are synthesized in bone. 345-348 Although these effects contribute to fetal bone abnor-malities when mothers are treated with a VKA dur-ing pregnancy, 349,350 it is unclear how they might affect children. There are two uncontrolled cohort stud-ies that describe reduced bone density in children on warfarin for . 1 year, but the role of the under- lying disorders in reducing bone density remains unclear. 351 Finally, by preventing the activation of G1a proteins and growth arrest-speci c gene 6 (Gas-6), VKAs may also induce vascular calci cation. 352 However, this relationship in humans is conjectural and is based on case reports. 352 Fresh frozen plasma remains the most widely used coagulation factor replacement product for urgent reversal of coumarin anticoagulation. 320 Plasma may be a potential carrier of infective agents, and its use is associated with an increased risk of volume overload. Furthermore, it requires a cross-match if group-speci c plasma is to be used, and it takes a prolonged period of time to thaw and administer. Given the long half-life anticoagulant effect of warfarin and the short half-life of infused coagulation factor concentrates, phytonadione must also be given to restore the ade-quate endogenous production of VKA-sensitive anticoagulant proteins. Urticaria occurs frequently with plasma transfusion; anaphylaxis is less common, occurring in about one in 20,000 transfusion epi-sodes. 330 Transfusion-related acute lung injury remains the most feared complication after transfusion and is estimated to occur in about one in 5,000 plasma-containing transfusions. 331 Nonactivated prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) are probably more effective than plasma in cor-recting INR. PCCs do not require a cross-match, are virally inactivated, do not pose a risk of volume over-load, and can be infused in 15 to 30 min. PCC may be classi ed as three-factor products (with adequate levels of factors II, IX, X, and low factor VII levels) and four-factor products, which contain adequate levels of factors II, VII, IX, and X as well as protein C and S. 319,331 Current PCCs are more or less devoid of activated clotting factors and are supplemented with heparin and antithrombin to minimize the risk of thrombosis. 332 Four-factor PCCs are currently not available in some countries (eg, United States). In patients with life-threatening bleeding, recom- binant activated factor VII has been used to control bleeding. 320 Recombinant activated factor VII is able to generate a consistent thrombin burst through both tissue factor-dependent and tissue factor-independent mechanisms and is able to trigger thrombin generation even in the presence of signi cant platelet dysfunc-tion. Evidence supporting its use in VKA-associated bleeding is currently limited, and its use cannot be recommended except in the setting of life-threatening bleeding when more effective agents are not avail-able. 333 As would be expected based on its potent pro- coagulant effect, this agent may cause thrombosis. Recommendations to guide the use of these strat-egies are provided in Holbrook et al. 86 1.10.4 Nonhemorrhagic Adverse Events: Other than hemorrhage, the most important side effects of warfarin are acute thrombotic complications, such as skin necrosis and limb gangrene. These uncommon complications are usually observed on the third to eighth day of therapy 334,335 and are caused by exten- sive thrombosis of the venules and capillaries within \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e62S Oral Anticoagulant Therapytion site (exosite 1). 356 Because the highly polar and lipophobic dabigatran molecule is not absorbed from the gut, its oral availability required the synthesis of an absorbable prodrug, dabigatran etexilate (BIBR and more lipophilic prodrug BIBR 951 CL). 357,359 As a thrombin dabigatran prolongs the thrombin clotting time (TCT), PT, aPTT, and ecarin clotting time (ECT) of plasma from humans, rats, rabbits, dogs, and rhesus monkeys and also inhibits thrombin generation in human plasma. 358 The ECT has been a preferred measure of anticoagulant effect for r-hirudin and other direct thrombin inhibitors; ecarin is a metallopro-tease viper oral etexilate or IV dab-igatran causes concentration-dependent reductions of thrombosis provoked in rats and rabbits by venous stasis plus tissue factor infusion or venous stasis plus endothelial damage. Thrombus inhibition peaks within 30 to 60 min of an oral dose, then persists for 2 to 3 h in rats and about 7 h in rabbits, and correlates well with prolongation of the aPTT. 362,363 In rats, the intravenous dabigatran dose required to prolong the tail bleeding time is 5 to 10 times greater than the maxi-mally effective antithrombotic dose of 0.1 mg/kg. 363 2.2 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Dabigatran etexilate is now formulated as a capsule containing multiple small pellets, each of which is composed of drug coated on a tartaric acid core to create an acid microenvironment that favors drug dissolution and preserves gut absorption even when the gastric pH is high (solubility is best at a low pH). 364 Systemic bioavailability of oral dabigatran etexilate has been measured at 7.2% in healthy young volun-teers and estimated at 6% to 7% in healthy older subjects. 359,364 Oral bioavailability of the capsules is comparable to that of tablets used in the phase 1 and early phase 2 evaluations. 365,366 Plasma dabigatran concentrations peak within 2 hours after a dose of dabigatran etexilate and then decrease by . 70% during an initial 4- to 6-h distribution phase that is followed by a much slower elimination phase. With repeated dosing, the terminal elimination half-life is 12 to 17 h, the peak and trough concentrations are dose-proportional, and it takes 2 to 3 days to reach 2.0 Direct Thrombin Inhibitors: Dabigatran Etexilate Dabigatran is a as dabigatran etexilate, an orally absorbable prodrug, since dabigatran itself is a strongly polar molecule that is not absorbed from the gut. Phase 3 clinical studies reported to date have evalu-ated the use of dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of VTE after elective total knee or hip arthroplasty, for therapy of VTE, and to prevent stroke or systemic embolism in nonvalvular AF. The drug is approved in many countries for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement surgery and in the United States and Canada for the preven-tion of stroke or systemic embolism in nonvalvular AF. Dosing schedules are 150 mg and 220 mg once daily when used to prevent VTE (starting with a half dose given soon after surgery) and 110 mg and 150 mg bid in patients with AF, although only the latter dose was approved for this use in the United States. The 150 mg bid dose was also used for the treatment of VTE. Dabigatran etexilate remains under evaluation for the secondary prevention of VTE and in the man-agement of acute coronary syndromes. Melagatran (given as its prodrug Ximelagatran) was the rst of the orally available direct thrombin inhibitors to be clinically evaluated and was effective for both the prevention and treatment of VTE and in AF but caused unacceptable liver toxicity. 353-355 2.1 Pharmacology Direct thrombin inhibitors, such as dabigatran, the hirudins, and argatroban, do not require a cofactor, which differentiates them from the indirect coagula-tion inhibitors like the heparins, other glycosami-noglycans, and the synthetic pentasaccharide that must form a complex with plasma antithrombin before they can accelerate inhibition of thrombin and/or factor Xa. 356 Clot-bound thrombin is relatively pro- tected from heparin-like anticoagulants in vitro but is freely accessible to direct thrombin inhibitors. 119 Dabigatran (initially referred to as BIBR 953) is a small synthetic molecule of 471.5 d with strongly basic functional groups that is a concentration depen-dent, competitive, highly selective and reversible direct thrombin inhibitor with a Ki of 4.5 /H11006 0.2 m M (which is comparable with that of melagatran). 357,358 The inhibitor prevents access to the active site of thrombin by forming a salt bridge between its ami-dine group and Asp 189 and through hydrophobic interactions. 357 Like melagatran and argatroban, dab- igatran is a univalent inhibitor that site of thrombin alone, whereas hirudin, lep-irudin, and desirudin also bind to a substrate recogni- \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e63Sand /H11349 30 mL/min) than in healthy control subjects. The corresponding levels of peak plasma concentra- tion (Cmax) were 109, 138, and 205 ng/mL, com-pared with 85 ng/mL when renal function was normal. The terminal half-life was doubled to 28 h in severe renal failure, from 14 h in control subjects. 370 Strong effects of renal function on drug concentrations were also demonstrated in patients having a hip or knee replacement, in whom dose-effect modeling pre-dicted a steady-state Cmax of 100 ng/mL during bid dosing with 150 mg if the creatinine clearance was . 90 mL/min, increasing to 140, 180, and 240 ng/mL as creatinine clearance diminished to 60 to 90, 40 to 60, and , 40 mL/min. 366,367 Moderately severe liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh classi cation B) appears to have little effect on dabigatran pharmacokinetics, since peak plasma concentrations were reduced by 15% after 150 mg dabigatran etexilate in twelve affected subjects, when compared with 12 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects, whereas time to Cmax, the elimination half-life, AUC, distribu-tion volume, and extent of glucuronidation remained unchanged. Effects on blood clotting test results were similar in the two study groups. 371 The effects on blood coagulation tests closely mirror plasma dab-igatran concentrations. Peak prolongation coincides with the Cmax, and clotting times decrease as dabiga-tran leaves the circulation. Unlike warfarin and other vitamin K inhibitors, which have long-lasting effects on the INR, the relatively short half-life of dabigatran means that time between dosing and blood sampling is a critical determinant of drug effect. Effects on the aPTT, INR, TCT, and ECT were studied in healthy volunteers and in patients having a hip or knee replacement. In the placebo-controlled volunteer study, wherein healthy men aged 18 to 45 years received one dose of 10 to 400 mg dabigatran etexilate or eight hourly doses of 50 to 400 mg for 6 days, the steady-state levels. The terminal half-life following a single dose is about 9 h in healthy volunteers. 359,361,364 The summary of pharmacokinetic parameters in Table 3 was derived from Stangier. 367 Rapid conver- sion of dabigatran etexilate to dabigatran ensures that plasma concentrations of the etexilate and two inter-mediate prodrugs barely reach detectable levels. 359 Approximately 35% of circulating dabigatran is protein-bound, regardless of concentration. After a 5-mg dose of IV dabigatran in healthy volunteers, the distribution volume was measured at 69 to 90 L, which exceeds the volume of body water, and plasma clearance was 149 mL/min. 359 About 15% of available dabigatran is conjugated to form pharmacologically active but unstable glucuronides that account for about 20% of the total drug exposure. 359 Eighty- ve percent of the dose is excreted by renal clearance, almost all as unchanged dabigatran. 359 Pharmacokinetic data from the phase 2 studies, together with population mod-eling, predict average steady-state peak and trough plasma dabigatran concentrations of 99 and 14 ng/mL after daily dosing with 150 mg dabigatran etexilate, 368 183 and 37 ng/mL after 220 mg/d, 369 and 184 and 90 ng/mL after 150 mg bid (Table S3). 369 Apart from dose, the systemic exposure to dabigatran is related to age and renal function. When older but apparently healthy volunteers aged 65 to 87 years received 150 mg dabigatran etexilate bid, the steady-state area under curve (AUC) was 1.7 to 2 times greater than that observed in a previous study of younger men aged 18 to 45 years. The increase in drug exposure was explained by reduced renal clearance and was more obvious in older women (in whom the AUC was 3% to 19% above that in older men). 364,367 In a separate parallel group volunteer study, the AUC \u00a5 after 150 mg dabigatran etexilate was 1.5, 3.2, and 6.3 times higher in people with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 51-80, \u00a5 , Healthy od 1.25-1.5 0.89 5.66 8.13 bid 1.5-2.0 1.16 0.36 7.4 11.3 tid 1.68 0.50 7.85 13.7Healthy elderly bid (men) 3.0 1.48 0.52 10.9 12.1 bid (women) 2.5 1.83 0.52 12.8 13.4Patients od 6.0 a 0.41 a 0.13 6.41 a bid 2.7 1.06 0.45 15.9 The results recorded for bid or tid dosing are at ss.

Dabigatran etexilate has a low that is further reduced by increased pH, 373 as is observed in patients taking the gastric proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole. Twice-daily pretreatment with 40 mg pantoprazole for 48 h in a crossover study reduced geometric mean levels of Cmax and AUC after 150 mg dabigatran etexilate by 40% and by 32% in healthy male volunteers aged 18 to 55 years. 365 Bioavailability (steady-state AUC) was also reduced by 20% to 40% in a parallel group study in which older volunteers, aged /H11350 65 years, took 40 mg pantoprazole with 150 mg dabigatran etexilate bid for 6 days; pantoprazole raised the gastric pH from 2.2 to 5.9, and pH correlated with AUC. Small corresponding changes in Cmax, ECT, and aPTT were not believed to have clinical importance. 364 Taking 150 mg dabigatran etexilate after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast prolonged the time taken to reach Cmax from 2 h to 4 h in the crossover study described above, although Cmax and total drug expo-sure remained unchanged. 365 Absorption of doses taken 4 to 8 h after a hip replacement was slowed and reduced, compared with 2 to 10 days later, such that time to reach the peak plasma concentration was delayed to 6 h and both Cmax and AUC were greatly diminished ( Table 3 ); the changes were attributed to early effects of surgery on GI motility and gastric acidity. 366 2.3.2 Other Drug-Drug Interactions: Important drug-drug interactions most often result from changes in drug metabolism that are due to induction or inhibition of CYP3A4 and other enzymes of the microsomal cytochrome P450 complex or from changes in drug bioavailability mediated by the adenosine diphosphate-dependent cell effl ux trans- porter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 374 Potential drug inter- actions with dabigatran etexilate have been explored in studies in which volunteers received dabigatran etexilate together with drugs known to provoke such mechanisms. Many drugs may interact through more than one pathway. Because cytochrome P450 enzymes have almost no role in the metabolism of dabigatran and are not affected by dabigatran in vitro, this becomes an unlikely mechanism for drug-drug interactions, 359 and volunteer studies con rm the lack of a clinically important interaction with atorvastatin (a substrate for CYP3A4 and substrate/inhibitor of P-gp) and diclofenac (a substrate for CYP2C9 and uridine drug was given as a dry powder dissolved in dilute tartaric acid results correlated with plasma dabigatran con-centration, the maximum clotting times coincided with Cmax, and effects persisted for 8 h or longer except for the aPTT and INR at the lowest doses. The peak clotting time ratios after 200 to 400 mg of dab-igatran etexilate were . 55 for the TCT, . 5 for the ECT, 1.5 to 1.9 for the INR, and 1.8 to 2.1 for the aPTT. The TCT, ECT, and INR increased in linear proportion with plasma dabigatran levels, but the aPTT concentration-response curve was curvilinear and attened above 200 ng/mL. 361,369 Plasma dabigatran levels also correlated closely with effects on the ECT and aPTT in the BISTRO trial, a safety study of dabigatran etexilate in patients having an elective hip or knee arthroplasty, wherein esca-lating doses of dabigatran etexilate were given for 6 days in tablet form after surgery. The doses were 12.5 mg rising to 300 mg bid or 150 mg to 300 mg once daily. 368 Bid dabigatran etexilate raised the peak aPTT and ECT ratios from 1.08 to 1.91 and from 0.96 to 5.17 as the dose increased from 12.5 mg to 300 mg, whereas the mean trough levels of aPTT ratio rose from 1.0 to 1.65. 368 Concentration-effect relationships were linear for the ECT but nonlinear for the aPTT, with better sensitivity and precision for the ECT. 366 A nonlinear dose-effect on the aPTT was also found in patients with AF taking bid doses of up to 300 mg. 372 Different aPTT reagents appear to have similar sen-sitivities to dabigatran, as does the activated clotting time. 369 The likely impact of reduced renal function on blood clotting test results in patients given 150 mg dabigatran etexilate bid was estimated through popu-lation modeling of data from the BISTRO I study. This predicted a maximum aPTT of 47.4 s with normal renal function, increasing to 54.2, 61.9, and 78.3 s in patients with mild, moderate, or severe reductions in creatinine clearance (the corresponding predictions for maximum ECT were 55.2, 77.4, 108, and 183 s). 367 The mod- eling is consistent with results when otherwise healthy volunteers with a creatinine clearance , 30 mL/min received INR, and TCT ratios were 3.45, 3.26, 4.14, and 12.5, compared with 1.85, 1.89, 1.4, and 6.87 in healthy control subjects. 370 This emphasizes the need to avoid dabigatran etexilate in patients with severe renal failure and the importance of renal function when considering the choice of dosing regimen. It remains possible that dabigatran may activate platelets in patients with AF, as urinary excretion of 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (an end product of throm-boxane A2 metabolism) was increased by roughly 20% during 12 weeks of treatment in a dose-ranging trial, and that effect was suppressed by aspirin. 372 \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e65Sigatran etexilate, there was little effect on the phar- macokinetics of either drug in a three-way crossover study of 23 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 65 years. 378 Drug interactions that may change the Cmax and AUC of dabigatran have not been correlated with clinical outcomes. Very large increases of Cmax and AUC, like those of quinidine and systemic ketocon-azole, are likely to raise the bleeding risk. Moderate increases, like those provoked by amiodarone or verapamil, may become important if combined with old age or reduced renal clearance. The concern about strong P-gp inducers like rifampicin is their potential to decrease drug exposure and therefore reduce ef cacy. 2.3.3 Dabigatran Etexilate and Antiplatelet Drugs: The added risk when platelet function inhibitors like aspirin and clopidogrel are taken during anticoagulant therapy is compounded for aspi-rin and other nonsteroidal antiinfl ammatory drugs by the increased likelihood of peptic ulceration due to interference with prostaglandin-mediated cyto-protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa. 379 These mechanisms are independent from any pharmacoki-netic drug-drug interactions (none was demonstrated between dabigatran etexilate and diclofenac). 376 Aspi- rin increased the bleeding rate when added to ximel-agatran in patients with AF and to warfarin in patients with AF, a prosthetic heart valve, coronary artery dis-ease, or peripheral vascular disease. 82,317,380 The added effects on bleeding when aspirin is combined with dabigatran etexilate were explored in the Prevention of Embolic and Thrombotic Events in Patients With Persistent Atrial Fibrillation (PETRO) trial, a phase 2, parallel-group, randomized, dose-ranging safety study in 502 patients with nonvalvular AF who also had coronary artery disease and/or one or more other risk factors for systemic embolism. The patients received 12 weeks of treatment with open-label warfarin alone (target INR 2-3) or with blinded 50 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg dabigatran etexilate bid plus daily aspirin (81 mg or 325 mg) or a placebo, using a 3 3 3 factorial design to allocate study treat- ments to patient groups of unequal size. Aspirin increased the chances of major or clinically signi - cant nonmajor bleeding in patients given a supra-therapeutic dabigatran dose of 300 mg bid, in whom the bleeding rate was 20% with an aspirin dose of 325 mg/d (six of 30), 14.7% if the dose was 81 mg/d ( ve of 34), and 5.7% (six of 105) in patients given the aspirin placebo. The trends reached statistical sig-ni cance when the two aspirin groups were pooled. Bleeding risk was not apparently raised when aspirin was added to 50-mg or 150-mg doses of dabigatran, but the sample size was too small to exclude clinically important effects. 372 glucuronyltransferase 2b7, and also a substrate and weak inhibitor of UGT1A). 367 When 22 volunteers aged 43 /H11006 15 years took 80 mg atorvastatin together with 150 mg dabigatran bid for 4 days in an open-label crossover study, the steady-state AUC of dab-igatran was 18%, whereas the and AUC of atorvastatin increased and 23%. 375 Cmax and AUC of dabigatran remained unchanged in a similar study of 24 volunteers aged 18 to 55 years who took one 50-mg dose of diclofenac after 4 days of bid dosing with 150 mg dabigatran etexilate, whereas Cmax of diclofenac and its main metabolite decreased by 11% to 17%. 376 The changes were believed to be small and clinically unimportant. In vitro studies nd that dabigatran etexilate (but not dabigatran) is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp, MDR1) with a medium af nity when tested using the Caco-2 cell-line1, which makes it a poten-tial target for P-gp-related drug interactions. 377 The bioavailability of P-gp substrates like dabigatran may be raised or reduced through inhibition or induction P-gp: ). 377 In formal interaction studies with amiodarone, a rst dose of 600 mg raised the AUC and Cmax of dabigatran by about 50% and 60%, an interaction that may persist for some weeks after stopping amio-darone due to the long half-life of this drug. 373 The effects of verapamil depend on its dosing schedule and drug formulation. 373 The rst dose of an immediate- release formulation, when given 1 hour before 150 mg dabigatran etexilate, increased the Cmax and AUC of dabigatran by about 180% and 150%, but these elevations were reduced to about 60% and 50% after repeated dosing and to about 90% and 70% when taking an extended-release formulation. The inter- action became negligible (increases of 10% in Cmax and 20% for AUC) if verapamil . 2 h after dabigatran etexilate when dabigatran absorption was essentially complete. Twice-daily coadminis-tration of 500 mg clarithromycin increased the AUC and Cmax of dabigatran by about 19% and 15%, The strong P-glycoprotein quinidine and ketoconazole are contraindicated when taking dab-igatran etexilate because they markedly increase exposure to dabigatran. 373 The approved product information advises caution when considering coad-ministration of strong P-gp inducers like rifampicin or St. John's Cmax and AUC. 373 The digoxin is used to probe P-gp mediated drug-drug interactions. After 4 days of dosing with once-daily digoxin plus bid 150 mg dab- \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e66S Oral Anticoagulant Therapyeffective), 383,384,387 but each was less effective after knee arthroplasty than 30 mg enoxaparin bid. 385 The rst dose of dabigatran etexilate was given 1 to 4 h after surgery in the comparisons with 40 mg/d enox- aparin, but delayed until 12 to 24 h after operation in the comparison with bid enoxaparin. It is likely the bid enoxaparin regimen was superior in part due to the higher daily dose (60 mg), but delaying the start of dabigatran etexilate after surgery may also have contributed to an inferior result. In a subsequent comparison, 220 mg/d dabigatran was again \"nonin-ferior\" to 40 mg/d enoxaparin in preventing \"total VTE\" after hip arthroplasty but appeared also to be more effective in preventing \"major VTE\" (a com-posite of proximal DVT, nonfatal PE, and death related to VTE). 386 It is now standard practice to start anticoagulant treatment after VTE with a heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) together with a VKA, overlap the two drugs for at least 5 days, and stop the heparin only after the INR exceeds 2.0 for . 2 consecutive days. Dabigatran etexilate noninferior to warfarin in a double-blind, placebo-controlled and randomized, phase III comparison in patients with deep leg vein thrombosis or PE (the RE-COVER trial) in which study treatment began with at least 5 days of an approved anticoagulant (predominantly unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin) plus daily warfarin placebo or warfarin. 382 This study design is unlike that of other (ongoing) evaluations of new oral anticoagu-lants for VTE, in which the new oral anticoagulant is given alone from the initiation of therapy. The pri-mary measure of ef cacy was the incidence of symp-tomatic and con rmed nonfatal recurrence, or death related to VTE. Randomization in RE-COVER was substrati ed for a clinical presentation with symp- tomatic PE (31% of the total) and subgroup analysis suggests this presentation had little or no effect on the relative ef cacy of dabigatran. Masking was pre-served by using coded POC machines to generate a real or sham INR. Once this exceeded 2.0 for 2 con-secutive days, they received dabigatran etexilate 150 mg or its placebo bid (ie, they continued warfarin or started dabigatran). Hence, all patients received at least 5 days of initial treatment with a heparin. How-ever, the median total duration of parenteral therapy before starting dabigatran was 9 days in both of the RE-COVER study groups, which seems longer than the usual clinical practice. INR was within its tar-geted range of 2.0 to 3.0 for 60% of study time in the warfarin-treated patients. VKAs are highly effective in preventing embolic stroke from AF, achieving risk reductions of almost 70% when compared with placebo and about 50% when compared with aspirin 387 ; their most feared complication is intracranial bleeding, with an added Low doses of aspirin ( /H11349 100 mg/d) were permitted in the Anti- coagulant Therapy (RE-LY) (VTE) phase 3 studies of dabigatran etexilate, which compared bid doses of 110 mg and/or 150 mg with warfarin, but subgroup analyses of bleeding risk are not yet available. 381,382 Product information recommends against the com-bination of dabigatran etexilate with clopidogrel and other thienopyridines, given alone or as dual antiplate-let therapy with aspirin. 2.4 Antithrombotic Effects: A number of recent phase III clinical trials have evaluated the use of dab- igatran etexilate for the prevention and treatment of VTE and to prevent systemic embolism in nonvalvu-lar AF. A phase II study explored its dose-response in acute coronary syndromes. The ef cacy and safety of anticoagulant prophy- laxis for VTE depends in any given patient popula-tion on the dose, timing, duration, and choice of drug therapy (ie, on the treatment regimen as well as the therapeutic agent). The VTE prevention trials of dabigatran etexilate have once-daily dabigatran dosing regimens having elec-tive hip or knee arthroplasty: 150 mg/d or 220 mg/d, beginning soon after surgery with a half-dose of 75 mg or 110 mg. In addition, these two dabigatran regimens were compared with one of two standard enoxaparin prophylaxis regimens: 40 mg/d starting on the evening before surgery, or 30 mg bid starting 12 to 24 h after surgery (worldwide, these are the low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis regimens most widely used for joint surgery; both are accepted as standard clinical practice). Two of the trials com-pared both of these dabigatran regimens with the 40 mg/d schedule of enoxaparin in hip or knee arthroplasty, 383,384 one compared both of the dabiga- tran regimens with 30 mg enoxaparin bid after knee arthroplasty, 385 and one compared only the 220 mg/d dabigatran etexilate regimen with enoxaparin 40 mg/d in hip arthroplasty. 386 In all prophylaxis studies, the primary measure of treatment effectiveness was the rate of \"total VTE\" (a composite of subclinical deep leg vein thrombosis detected with routine bilateral ascending venography done at the end of treatment, con rmed symptom- atic DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE), and death from any cause), an outcome that could be evaluated in 73% to 78% of patients. All recorded the presence of major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleed-ing, and any adjudicated bleeding. The \"noninferior\" to 40 mg/d in hip arthro-plasty and in knee arthroplasty (ie, statistically no less \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e67Spresence of dabigatran. TCT tests are available rou- tinely in many laboratories. 2.6 Practical Issues Related to Initiation and Maintenance Unlike other new oral anticoagulants, dabigatran etexilate offers a choice between higher and lower dosing regimens, since the schedules evaluated in phase III clinical studies to date were 150 mg and 220 mg once daily when used to prevent postopera-tive VTE, 150 mg bid for the treatment of VTE, and 110 mg and 150 mg bid in patients with AF. Dose was important during long-term therapy of patients with AF, in whom 150 mg bid was superior to warfarin and 110 mg bid was noninferior, whereas the rates of major bleeding were similar with 150 mg dabigatran and warfarin but signi cantly less with 110 mg dabigatran. However, only the 150-mg dose was approved in the United States, whereas in Can-ada both doses are approved. By contrast, there was less apparent effect of prophylactic dosing level on ef cacy or the likelihood of surgical bleeding after major joint replacement, when compared with 40 mg/d enoxaparin. Subgroup analyses of large clinical studies have provided little evidence to date for clinically impor-tant effects of age, gender, or renal function on ef - cacy or safety within any dosing level. Without such information, the choice between available dosing regimens must rest on individual decisions about the preferred balance between ef cacy and bleeding risk and on extrapolations about that risk from pharmaco-kinetics of this predominantly renally excreted drug. For example, a lower dose may be preferred for elderly patients with a mild to moderate decrease of renal function. In addition, the choice will be infl u- enced by known drug interactions (see section 2.3 \"Interactions\" ). At this time, the only product information approved by European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulators is for prophylactic dosing with dabigatran etexilate. Based on clinical study results and pharma-cokinetic evidence, EMA recommends a standard daily dose of 220 mg, reduced to 150 mg if patients are aged . 75 years, have a creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 mL/min, or need treatment with verapamil or amiodarone. Ensuring compliance with continued dosing will be a concern for dabigatran etexilate, as it is with any chronic therapy that does not require repeated measurement of drug effect. 2.7 Adverse Events 2.7.1 Bleeding Events: The major potential haz- ard from dabigatran etexilate is bleeding. After an risk of approximately 0.2% per annum during ongoing warfarin treatment. 388 Dabigatran dosing regimens of 110 mg and 150 mg bid were compared double-blind with open-label warfarin (target INR, 2.0-3.0) in the RE-LY trial where patients with nonvalvular AF received study treatment of at least 1 year and median of 2 years, and the primary study outcome was ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. 381 On average, the INR in patients taking warfarin was within its target range of 2.0 to 3.0 for 64% of study time. Both ef cacy and bleeding risk of dabigatran etexilate depended on the dose. Annual rates of ischemic stroke or embo- lism were 1.69% with 110 1.11% with 150 mg dabigatran ( P , .001 relative to warfarin, P 5 .005 relative to 110 mg dabigatran). The annual incidence of major bleeding was similar, with 150 mg dabiga-tran and warfarin, but signi cantly less with 110 mg dabigatran (see section 2.6 \"Practical Issues Related to Initiation and Maintenance\" ). A striking result was the reduced frequency of hemorrhagic stroke with dabigatran compared with warfarin ( P , .001), regard- less of dabigatran dose. 2.5 Monitoring Anticoagulant Intensity Ex vivo effects on laboratory tests after taking dabigatran etexilate were summarized in section 2.2 \"Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics.\" Simple widely used coagulation tests have limitations for measuring dabigatran effect: the PT and aPTT are relatively insensitive, the relation between aPTT and dabigatran concentration is nonlinear, and the usual form of TCT is oversensitive. Most promising is the ECT, which has a linear dose-response throughout the range of concentrations expected during pro-phylaxis or therapy; however, this test is not readily available. 369 There is no evidence relevant to the possible clin- ical bene ts from laboratory testing, since the phase 3 studies evaluated xed doses and their reports have not examined clinical outcomes in relation to drug levels or clotting test results. The intent has been to recommend standard doses for most patients; although rst principles suggest that laboratory-assisted dose adjustment of this mainly renally excreted drug could add clinical value in selected populations, as in elderly subjects with reduced renal function, 389 it seems unlikely that routine monitoring would yield any wide clinical bene t. 390 Perhaps the most likely role for laboratory testing may be in treated patients who bleed or develop thrombosis, need an acute invasive procedure, or could have taken an overdose. In the setting of major bleeding, or if urgent or emer-gent surgery is required, a normal TCT rules out the \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e68S Oral Anticoagulant Therapy It is essential to exclude liver toxicity when evalu- ating new oral anticoagulants, especially because the rst orally available direct thrombin inhibitor (ximel- agatran) caused unacceptable hepatic toxicity that remains unexplained. About 0.5% of the patients treated with ximelagatran for . 35 days developed laboratory evidence of severe liver injury: a greater than threefold elevation of serum alanine transami-nase level plus a greater than twofold increase in bil-irubin concentration, compared with upper normal limits. 355,391 In one 35-day VTE prevention study, severe hepatic injury with onset after the end of drug exposure was not predicted by regular liver enzyme monitoring during therapy. 392 It has been estimated that ximelagatran may have caused or contributed to fatal liver damage in about 1 in 2,000 patients. 355 No dabigatran study to date has recorded a dispropor-tionate increase of liver enzyme levels or clinically signi cant liver disease as an adverse effect. In some ximelagatran studies, short- or long-term treatment was also associated with trends or a statis-tically signi cant excess of adverse events related to coronary artery disease. 355 This raised concerns that other new oral anticoagulants might increase the risk from acute cardiac events. Adjudicated coronary events (unstable angina, myocardial infarction, car-diac death) were rare and evenly distributed between study groups in the orthopedic surgery studies of dabigatran etexilate and in the RE-COVER trial, but the RE-LY trial reported an excess of myocardial infarction among the patients treated with dabigatran. The relative risks, compared with warfarin, were 1.35 ( P 5 .07) with 110 mg and 1.38 ( P 5 .048) with 150 mg dabigatran (the corresponding absolute risks were 0.53%, 0.72%, and 0.74% per annum). 381 There are no ready explanations (although indirect evidence of platelet activation by dabigatran was reported from the PETRO study). 372 2.8 Reversal of Drug Effect There is insuf cient clinical experience to rmly guide the management of major bleeding, suspected overdose, urgently needed surgery, or urgent inva-sive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in patients who are taking this new drug. Pharmacokinetic mod-eling does, however, indicate how long it takes for drug effects to dissipate after stopping dabigatran etexilate before an elective intervention, although conclusions about the time taken before a return to normal hemostasis remain tentative pending well-documented information about clinical outcomes. The half-life of dabigatran suggests that drug levels and drug effects should decrease by about 50% at 12 to 18 h after the most recent dose, and the trough levels to 25% of their previous steady state by 24 h elective hip or knee replacement, the risks of major bleeding were small during VTE prophylaxis with dabigatran etexilate and similar to those with pro-phylactic enoxaparin. The rates were 0.6% to 1.3% in patients given 150 mg/d and 0.6% to 2.0% when the dose was 220 mg/d. These compared with 1.3% to 1.6% with 40 mg/d of enoxaparin and 1.4% with 30 mg of enoxaparin given bid. About 90% of the bleeding events were related to the surgical wound. Bleeding risk during 6 months of treatment after VTE was less with 150 mg dabigatran bid than with warfarin (target INR, 2.0-3.0). The 6-month of to 16.1% risk, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59-0.85), and that of \"major or clinically relevant but non-major\" bleeding was diminished from 8.8% to 5.6% (relative risk, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47-0.84; P 5 .002). Major bleeding was infrequent (1.9% with warfarin and 1.6% with dabigatran). 382 As indicated earlier, the bleeding risk was dose dependent in the RE-LY study of patients with AF: the annual incidence of major bleeding was 3.4% in patients taking warfarin, 3.1% with 150 mg bid dab-igatran (relative risk, 0.93; P 5 .31), and 2.7% if the dose was 110 mg (relative risk, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.93; P 5 .003); the P value of the difference between dabigatran dosing groups almost reached the conventional level for statistical signi cance ( P 5 .052). Both dabigatran regimens reduced the likelihood of intracranial bleeding by more than one-half compared with warfarin (annual incidence was 0.74% with war-farin, 0.30% with 150 mg dabigatran [ P , .001] 0.23% with 110 mg dabigatran [ P , .001]), whereas annual rates of major extracranial bleeding were little different between the study groups. 381 Dabigatran etexilate does cause a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of major GI bleeding. This was a statistically signi cant effect in the RE-LY study; annual rates were 1.02% with warfarin, 1.51% with mg dabigatran ( P , .001 compared with warfa- rin), and 1.12% with 110 mg dabigatran. 381 An excess risk was also reported in the RE-COVER trial, in which more patients treated with bid 150 mg dab-igatran etexilate had GI bleeding (53 events vs 35 with warfarin). 382 2.7.2 Nonhemorrhagic Adverse Events: Dys- pepsia is a reported adverse effect of dabigatran etexilate. In the RE-LY study, in which warfarin was open label, 11.8% and 11.3% of patients given 110 mg or 150 mg dabigatran complained of dyspepsia compared with 5.8% of patients taking warfarin. 381 Fewer patients reported dyspepsia in the wholly double-blind RE-COVER trial: 2.9% with 150 warfarin ( P , .001). 382 \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e69Sonce daily in major orthopedic surgery and 20 mg once daily in the long-term secondary prevention of VTE. 3.1 Pharmacology Rivaroxaban is a selective and Xa inhibitor trypsin-like 397 through electrostatic interaction with Asp189 in the S1 pocket of factor Xa. This interaction involves the chlorine substituent of the chlorothiophene moiety, which interacts with the aromatic ring of Tyr228 at the bottom of the S1 pocket. 398 Because rivaroxaban is a nonbasic, small molecule (the molecular weight is 436 g/mol) it can inhibit not only free factor Xa but also prothrombinase complex and clot-associated factor Xa. 399,400 This range of activities is unique to small, direct inhibitors because the factor Xa incor-porated in the prothrombinase complex is protected from inhibition by antithrombin and by antithrom-bin-dependent anticoagulants. Rivaroxaban is minimally soluble in organic solvents and nearly insoluble in water. 398 Binding to plasma proteins, mainly albumin, ranges between 92% and 95%. 398 Rivaroxaban is metabolized via oxidative and hydrolytic pathways involving different classes of enzymes. In humans, CYP3A4 and CYP2J2 are the two enzymes responsible for its oxidative metab- olism and contribute to a similar extent. 401 About 66% of rivaroxaban is excreted via the kidneys (36% unchanged), and 28% is excreted in the feces (7% unchanged). Inhibition of factor Xa activity by rivaroxaban is highly dependent on the concentration of the drug. Rivaroxaban induces prolongation of the PT, aPTT, and heparin clotting time, among other tests. 399,402 On the other hand, rivaroxaban does not affect the bleeding time or platelet aggregation. 399,403 Animal models demonstrated dose-dependent reduction of thrombus formation by rivaroxaban. 399 3.2 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics In healthy men aged 19 to 45 years, single doses of rivaroxaban administered after a fasting period of 10 h produced a median inhibition of factor Xa activity that ranged from 20% with the 5-mg dose to 61% with the maximum dose of 80 mg. 404 No signi - cant inhibition was observed with doses of , 5 mg. The maximum inhibition of factor Xa activity occurred between 1 and 4 h after drug administration, and the half-life of the biologic effect was 6 to 7 h. Factor Xa activities did not return to normal until after 24 h, when doses . 5 mg were administered. 404 The effect on PT prolongation had a similar pro le, as did effects after stopping dabigatran etexilate, so long as creati-nine clearance exceeds 50 mL/min. The level at which it is safe to undertake surgery or an invasive proce-dure is unknown. Moderately severe renal dysfunc-tion (creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/min) extends the half-life to about 18 h, in which case, or if the surgical bleeding risk is critically high (as with intra-cranial surgery), it may be better to delay elective procedures until 2 to 4 days after stopping the drug. Measuring the TCT or aPTT should help to estimate the residual level of dabigatran. 369 In addition to immediately stopping drug adminis- tration, the clinical management of major bleeding would require early volume and RBC replacement, urgent assessment for cause, and any local measures that may be required until the bleeding stops (pres-sure, cautery, suture, or other interventions). It is believed that maintaining an adequate diuresis could help to protect the renal excretion of dabigatran. Although product information for dabigatran etexi-late mentions the use of fresh frozen plasma to help control bleeding, this seems unlikely to infl uence the drug effects. Thus plasma should only be admin- istered in the setting of a documented dilutional coagulopathy. Dabigatran has no antidote, and the management of life-threatening bleeding remains empirical. Indi rect evidence from animal models and in vitro studies sug-gests that recombinant factor VIIa or a prothrombin complex concentrate may bypass the anticoagulant effects of high dabigatran concentrations. 369 It may also be relevant that hemodialysis removed 62% of circulating dabigatran within 2 h and 68% within 4 h in an open-label study of 12 subjects with end-stage renal failure who received 50 mg dabigatran etexilate. 369,370 In vitro mixing experiments suggest that early administration of activated charcoal might reduce the absorption of dabigatran etexilate. 369 3.0 Direct Factor a direct factor Xa inhibitor and is currently approved in many countries, including the United States, for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement surgery. The drug is undergoing an extensive clinical develop-ment program in other clinical settings, including the treatment of VTE and the prevention of acute ische-mic stroke in patients with AF. In phase III clinical trials, rivaroxaban was found to be more effective than the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin in preventing VTE after total hip or knee replacement surgery 393-396 and more effective than placebo when given to patients with previous DVT or PE after an initial 6- to 12-month course of standard oral antico-agulant treatment. The doses evaluated were 10 mg \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e70S Oral Anticoagulant Therapyapproximately 4 to 6 h on the rst day and of approx- imately 6 to 9 h on the last day of treatment. The correlation between plasma concentrations of rivar-oxaban and inhibition of factor Xa activity or PT pro-longation was linear, with an r of 0.950 and 0.958, respectively. 405 Data from this study were later used for population modeling that would predict the behavior of the drug in patients. 406 Results of this model showed that pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban were linear and dose proportional up to the 30-mg dose and con rmed a strong linear correlation between plasma concentra-tion and pharmacodynamic parameters. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban were also measured in a population of healthy elderly subjects and in patients with an extremely low or extremely high body weight ( Table 4 ). 407,408 In the rst study, healthy subjects aged /H11350 60 years received daily doses ranging between 30 mg and 50 mg after a standard breakfast. 407 It was intended to assess even higher doses of up to 80 mg, but dose escalation was stopped prematurely because of an apparent ceiling effect in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables. Maximum inhibition of factor Xa activity ranged from 68.4% after the 30-mg dose to 75.3% and 74.5% after the doses of 40 mg and 50 mg, respectively, and occurred 2 to 4 h after administration. No gender differences were observed. PT prolongation was also greater with the 40-mg dose than with the 30-mg dose, and was not different between the two highest doses, with a maximum effect 2 to 3 h after drug administration. Similar pro les were documented for the aPTT and the HEPTEST. Maximum concentration of rivaroxaban was reached after 4 h in all dose groups, and the half-life on the aPTT and HEPTEST (a low-molecular-weight heparin activity Conversely, rivaroxaban had no effect on thrombin and antithrombin activity. 404 Peak plasma concentration of the drug occurred at 2 h, and the terminal half-life was between 7 and 17 h. At doses . 10 mg, the increases in peak plasma con- centration and AUC were less than dose proportional. Approximately 40% of the administered dose was excreted unchanged via the kidneys when the 1.25-mg dose was administered; this proportion decreased to 10% with the highest doses tested (ie, 60-80 mg). Finally, inhibition of factor Xa activity and PT prolon-gation correlated strongly with plasma concentrations ( r 5 0.949 and r 5 0.935, respectively). 404 When mul- tiple doses were administered at mealtime in healthy male subjects aged 20 to 45 years, the maximum inhi-bition of factor Xa activity was documented after approximately 3 h and it was dose dependent, ranging from 22% after 5 mg to 68% after 30 mg ( Table 4 ). 405 Inhibition was maintained for 8 to 12 h after 5-mg doses and for approximately 12 h after doses of 10 mg to 30 mg. Daily rivaroxaban doses did not cause a fur-ther increase in the maximum inhibition of factor Xa activity. A very similar pattern was observed with PT, aPTT, and HEPTEST prolongation, which was dose dependent for all tests, reached maximum levels after 1 to 4 h, and was comparable after the rst and last administered dose. 405 When inhibition of factor Xa activity was compared after once, twice, or three times daily administration of the 5-mg dose, there was no detectable difference between the maximum effect on the rst and the last day of administration. The plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban were also dose dependent, with maximum concentrations at 3 to 4 h for all doses and regimens and a half-life of Table 4\u2014 [Section or AUC t , m g\u00b7h/L t 1/2 , h Healthy adults a 5 mg od 3.00 76.4 (18.3) 505.5 (19.7) 8.4 (32.6) 5 mg bid 3.00 85.3 (17.7) 458.5 (13.1) 7.0 (27.8) 5 mg tid 2.00 123.8 (19.7) 557.3 (20.4) 5.8 (35.5) 10 mg bid 2.98 158.0 (18.8) 863.8 (18.6) 7.6 (26.7) 20 mg bid 2.50 318.1 (18.7) 1,903.0 (24.5) 8.0 (40.7) 30 mg bid 3.02 451.9 (10.5) 2,728.0 (14.6) 9.2 (64.1)Healthy elderly 30 mg single dose 4.0 392.0 (23.0) 3,531.0 (20.0) 11.7 (63.7) 40 mg single dose 4.0 461.0 (16.8) 4,385.0 (24.1) 13.3 (31.9) 50 437.0 (32.0) 4,496.0 (33.9) 11.9 4.00 178.1 (16.6) 1,172.0 (42.1) . 120 kg 4.00 149.0 (20.4) 1,155 (15.6) 7.3 (25.4) Data are presented as geometric mean (geometric coef cient of variation).

Between 14% and 31% of rivaroxaban was excreted unchanged via the kidneys. The clear-ance of the drug was consistently affected only by renal function, with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min resulting in a 15% to 35% higher drug exposure in these two trials. 412 Based on the results of subsequent simulations of various scenarios for patients with dif-ferent extremes of covariates, it was estimated that plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban would have exceeded the 90% CI of the average patient only in a 90-year-old patient weighing 30 kg, suggesting that one dose of the drug could be administered to all patients regardless of their age, gender, and body weight. The second study compared data from two phase II clinical trials, both carried out in patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery, one assess-ing bid doses and the other assessing single daily doses. 413 Overall, the pharmacokinetics were similar after once-daily or bid dosing, since only the steady-state area under the plasma concentration-time curve over 24 h was higher with once-daily doses than with bid doses 413 (Table S4). PT prolongation strongly cor- related with plasma concentrations when rivaroxaban was given once daily or bid. 413 Simulations of plasma concentration expected after a 10-mg once-daily dose in model subjects with extreme demographic characteristics showed that plasma concentration-time pro les would fall within the predicted 90% CI of the average patient. 3.3 Interactions 3.3.1 Drugs: In humans, CYP3A4 plays a pivotal role in the oxidative metabolism of rivaroxaban. 401 Drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A4 have the poten- tial to interact with rivaroxaban. However, only drugs that act as strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and of P-glycoprotein, a transporter protein of which rivar-oxaban is a substrate, have been shown to cause important reduction of the clearance of the drug, thus provoking a signi cant increase in plasma con-centrations. These drugs include azole antimycotics and HIV protease inhibitors. The concomitant ad-ministration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole 400 mg once daily or with ritonavir 600 mg bid resulted in an approximately 2.5-fold increase in the mean AUC and 1.7-fold increase in the mean Cmax of rivaroxa-ban, together with signi cantly increased effects on clotting tests. 414 Thus, the use of rivaroxaban in patients receiving ketoconazole, itraconazole, vori-conazole, and posaconazole or any HIV protease inhibitor is currently not recommended. 414 Rivaroxa- ban should be used with caution when given together with other drugs that strongly inhibit only CYP3A4 or only P-glycoprotein. These drugs include clarithro-mycin, which at the dose of 500 mg bid leads to a ranged between 12 and 13 h ( Table 4 ). Excretion via the kidneys was similar among the dosing groups: although women had higher drug concentrations than men after the 30-mg and 40-mg doses, the authors considered that none of the pharmacokinetic param-eters showed clinically signi cant differences between females and males. Finally, the slopes of correlations between plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban and clotting tests were similar in this population of healthy elderly subjects and the population of healthy young men enrolled in a previous study. 407 Other studies have subsequently con rmed the absence of gender-based differences in the pharmacokinetics of rivar-oxaban. 409 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in young and elderly Chinese men and women are comparable to those previously reported in studies of healthy whites . 410,411 The effects of extreme body weight on a single 10-mg daily dose of rivaroxaban were assessed in a study carried out in men and women aged 18 to 55 years weighing /H11349 50 kg, between 70 and 80 kg, or . 120 kg ( Table 4 ). 408 Peak plasma concentrations were higher in the low body weight group than in the other two groups, with a Cmax value that was signi - cantly increased by 24% as compared with the nor-mal body weight group. On the other hand, there was no difference in plasma concentrations between sub-jects with a normal or high body weight, and the AUC was similar among all three groups. The half-life of rivaroxaban was increased by 2 h in the low body weight group. Inhibition of factor Xa activity was sim-ilar in the three groups, with a maximum effect that occurred after 3 to 4 h and was slightly lower in the group of patients weighing . 120 kg than in the other two groups. The maximum prolongation of PT, aPTT, and the HEPTEST decreased signi cantly with increas-ing body weight, although overall all these changes were small. 408 Finally, to de ne the pharmacokinetics and pharma- codynamics of rivaroxaban in a population of patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, blood samples were obtained from patients enrolled in phase II ran-domized trials. 412,413 The rst study analyzed data from two trials that assessed bid doses of rivaroxaban ranging from 2.5 mg to 30 mg administered at meal-times. 412 Exclusion criteria from these trials were body weight , 45 kg, creatinine clearance , 30 mL/min, and severely impaired hepatic function. The authors found substantial variability in the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban on the rst postoperative day for all doses, possibly attributed to the presence of \"slow\" and \"fast\" absorbers. Overall, absorption was fast, with a Cmax within 1 to 2 h. Absorption status was unrelated to gender, food, anesthesia, or the use of comedications. The variability at steady state was only moderate, and the increase of exposure was dose \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e72S Oral Anticoagulant Therapydrugs that alter the gastric pH, such as the histamine H2 antagonist ranitidine or the antacid aluminum-magnesium hydroxide, had effect the plasma con-centrations or pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban. 418 3.3.3 Environmental Factors: The effect of food on the absorption of rivaroxaban was tested in healthy male subjects aged 18 to 45 years. 418 After a single dose of 5 mg, the absorption of rivaroxaban was found to be slower in the fed state than the fasting state, with a delay in the median time to reach the peak plasma concentration from 2.75 h to 4.0 h. The AUC and the Cmax both increased with the concomitant administration of food, by 28% and 41%, whereas the terminal half-life remained unchanged. The fed state increased the time to maximum prolongation of the PT and maximum inhibition of factor Xa activ-ity and also the maximum effect on these clotting tests. Thus, absorption of rivaroxaban was moderately increased after the administration of food, with a resulting increase in pharmacokinetic and pharmaco-dynamic parameters. In addition, concomitant food intake reduced interindividual variability, whereas elimination remained unchanged. No pharmacokinetic differences were documented when high-fat, high-calorie meals were compared with high-carbohydrate meals. These food effects have been attributed to a prolonged length of stay in the stomach that is pos-sibly related to the lipophilicity and limited aqueous solubility of the drug. 418 3.4 Antithrombotic Effect Rivaroxaban acts as a competitive inhibitor of the amidolytic activity of factor Xa. In vitro, the inhibitory effect is concentration dependent, with an inhibitory constant against factor Xa of 0.4 /H11006 0.02 nM. 399 The selectivity of rivaroxaban for factor Xa is 10,000-fold greater than for other serine proteases, including factor Va, factor IXa, factor XIa, thrombin, and acti-vated protein C. The onset of action is rapid and reversible, as shown by the kinetic association rate constant of 1.7 3 10 7 mol/L -1 /s -1 and kinetic dissoci- ation rate constant of 5 3 10 2 3 /s -1 . 419 The inhibitory effect is maintained when factor Xa is complexed with factor Va and Ca 2 1 on a phospholipid membrane (prothrombinase bound) as shown by a concentra-tion-dependent inhibition of thrombin generation 399 and also when factor Xa is bound to the clot. 420 In plasma, endogenous human factor Xa is inhib- ited by rivaroxaban to cause dose-dependent prolon-gation of both the PT and aPTT, with the PT being more sensitive than the aPTT. 399 In whole blood and in platelet-rich plasma, rivaroxaban has a dose-dependent effect in prolonging the initiation phase of thrombin generation after activation of the tissue 1.5-fold increase in the mean AUC and to a 1.4-fold increase in the Cmax of the drug, and erythromycin, which at the dose of 500 mg three times daily causes a 1.3-fold increase in both the AUC and the Cmax. 414 On the other hand, reduced plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban can occur when strong CYP3A4 inducers are coadministered. These include rifampicin (which causes a 50% decrease in the AUC), phenytoin, car-bamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John's wort. 414 The concomitant administration of rivaroxaban with sub-strates of either CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein, such as atorvastatin, digoxin, or midazolam, did not result in clinically relevant interactions. 415,416 The concomitant administration of rivaroxaban and aspirin was tested in a randomized, two-way cross-over study. 403 Healthy men aged between 18 and 55 years were randomized to receive aspirin alone at the dose of 500 mg on the rst day and 100 mg on the second day, rivaroxaban alone at the dose of 15 mg, or aspirin and rivaroxaban at the same dos-ages. Patients receiving rivaroxaban alone were sub-sequently treated with rivaroxaban and aspirin and vice versa. Maximum levels of inhibition of factor Xa activity and maximum prolongation of the PT, aPTT, and the HEPTEST were similar in patients treated with rivaroxaban alone and in patients treated with rivaroxaban plus aspirin. Collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation was inhibited in the aspirin-alone group and in the aspirin plus rivaroxaban group but not in the rivaroxaban-alone group. Inhibition of platelet aggregation with aspirin was 89.3% greater than with rivaroxaban alone, and with aspirin plus rivaroxaban it was 97.4% greater than with rivaroxaban alone. Bleeding time was not affected by rivaroxaban alone, but was prolonged to 1.46 times the baseline by aspi-rin alone and to 1.96 times the baseline by adding aspirin to rivaroxaban. The combination of aspirin with rivaroxaban prolonged bleeding time more than aspirin alone. Pharmacokinetic parameters of rivar-oxaban were not altered by the coadministration of aspirin. The concomitant administration of rivaroxaban and a nonsteroidal antiinfl ammatory drug was also tested in a randomized two-way crossover study. 417 Healthy men aged between 18 and 45 years were randomized to receive 15 mg of rivaroxaban alone or 15 mg rivar-oxaban plus naproxen 500 mg. After 14 days all sub-jects crossed over. Maximum inhibition of factor Xa activity and maximum prolongations of the PT, aPTT, and HEPTEST were similar between the two groups. Bleeding time was signi cantly increased by the com-bined use of rivaroxaban and naproxen as compared with rivaroxaban alone. Plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban were slightly increased, by 10% for both the AUC and the Cmax after the coadministration of naproxen. Finally, the concomitant administration of \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e73Story assays that can be recommended to monitor rivar- oxaban or any recommendations for dose adjustments based on observed test results. For instance, the thromboplastins used for PT clotting assays have dif-fering sensitivities to factor Xa inhibitors, and the INR introduced to correct for differences in PT sen-sitivity when monitoring the VKAs does not ade-quately correct for differences in assay sensitivity to direct factor Xa inhibitors. Smith and Morissey 424 evaluated the effects of ve commercial thrombo-plastin reagents on sensitivity of the PT to rivaroxa-ban and its correlation with the INR. PT ratios (ie, PT with drug/PT without drug) were measured using normal human plasma to which rivaroxaban 1 m g/mL was added in vitro. PT ratios varied from 2.25 to 7.32 with the different thromboplastins; subsequent con-version to an INR further exacerbated the observed differences in sensitivities to rivaroxaban between the various PT assays. Recently, Samama et al 402 carried out a study that aimed to identify a clotting test suitable for moni-toring rivaroxaban activity by evaluating the effects on a number of different assays of increasing the drug concentration in pooled citrated normal human platelet-poor plasma. There was a concentration-dependent prolongation of the PT and aPTT, but the increases in clotting times varied depending on the thromboplastin reagent used. 402 The effect of rivar- oxaban on the aPTT was weaker than that on the PT. Rivaroxaban also prolonged the thromboelastograph parameters. Standard methods for the HEPTEST and the prothrombinase-induced clotting time resulted in paradoxical responses. Tests used to measure anti-factor Xa activity of the low-molecular-weight heparins showed dose-dependent effects but were associated with some degrees of variation. Finally, rivaroxaban also caused a dose-dependent increase of the diluted Russell viper venom ratio. Speci c calibration of some of these tests may lead to the availability of an appropriate assay to monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of the drug. Neither the PT (expressed either in seconds or as a ratio) nor the aPTT should be used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban. 3.6 Practical Issues Related to Initiation and Maintenance Rivaroxaban is currently approved in many coun- tries for the prevention of VTE in patients under-going total hip replacement surgery and total knee replacement surgery based on the results of four phase 3 clinical trials. 393-396 For this indication, the approved dose is 10 mg once daily. Treatment should be started between 6 and 10 h after surgery, and the duration of treatment should vary from 2 weeks in patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery factor pathway, reduces the maximum concentration of generated thrombin, and decreases the endoge-nous thrombin potential. 400 The effect on the initia- tion and propagation phases of thrombin generation is greater than the effect on the decay phase, expressed by the endogenous thrombin potential. High concen-trations of rivaroxaban are able to prevent thrombin generation almost completely, due to inhibition of factor Xa bound to the prothrombinase complex. 400 The effect of rivaroxaban on platelet-induced throm-bin generation in vivo was tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 12 healthy male subjects aged 27 to 37 years. 397 The prothrombinase- induced clotting time, a plasma clotting assay based on the activation of coagulation using factor Xa, phospholipids, and an enzyme that activates factor V , was prolonged dose dependently by rivaroxaban, with a maximum effect after 2 h. Thrombin genera- tion in platelet-rich plasma was markedly reduced by rivaroxaban, with an 80% to 90% decrease (by 5-mg and 30-mg doses, respectively) of the peak collagen-induced endogenous thrombin potential at 2 h. There was a close correlation between plasma concentra-tion of rivaroxaban and its effects on factor Xa inhibition, prothrombinase-induced clotting time prolongation, and endogenous 397 Rivaroxaban has no effects on tion induced by collagen, adenosine indirect effect on platelet aggre- gation induced by tissue factor, determined by the inhibition of thrombin generation, has been reported in de brinated plasma. 423 In venous thrombosis models and in arteriovenous shunt models, rivaroxaban was shown to cause dose-dependent reduction of thrombus formation, inhibi-tion of factor Xa activity, and prolongation of the PT. 399 The antithrombotic effective doses of rivaroxa- ban did not prolong bleeding time in animal bleeding models. 399 3.5 Monitoring Anticoagulant Intensity The predictable pharmacologic pro le of rivaroxa- ban allows the administration of the drug at xed doses without the need for routine laboratory moni-toring or dose adjustments. However, there may be rare situations, as in the case of overdose or unex-pected bleeding, assessment of compliance, evalu-ation of drug interactions, or assessment of drug accumulation in renal or hepatic impairment, when the availability of a quantitative clotting assay might be valuable. Despite the predictable, dose-dependent effects of rivaroxaban on the PT and (to a lesser extent) the aPTT, and on tests measuring thrombin generation, there are currently no validated labora- \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e74S Oral Anticoagulant Therapyban was noninferior to warfarin in the prevention of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, with a similar rate of major bleeding events but with fewer intracra-nial and fatal bleeding events. 426 Other recently completed phase III trials include a study on the prevention of VTE in medical patients (Multicenter, Randomized, Parallel Group Ef cacy and Safety Study for the Prevention of VTE in Hospi-talized Medically Ill Patients Comparing Rivaroxaban with Enoxaparin [MAGELLAN] study), in which rivaroxaban is administered at the same 10 mg once-daily dose used in the Regulation of Coagulation in Major Orthopedic Surgery Reducing the Risk of DVT and PE (RECORD) program; and the EINSTEIN PE study, in which patients with hemodynamically stable PE are treated for the rst 3 weeks with a 15 mg bid dose of rivaroxaban followed by a 20 mg once-daily dose. Finally, a phase III study in patients with acute coronary syndromes is assessing rivaroxa-ban doses of 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg bid. 427 3.7 Adverse Events 3.7.1 Bleeding Events: Data on the incidence of bleeding complications with the use of rivaroxaban are currently available from the results of phase II and phase III clinical trials only. As of yet, no pub-lished phase IV studies or reports from clinical prac-tice have been published. Reported rates must take into account the de nition of bleeding used in each study, given the variability of de nitions used among clinical trials assessing different compounds. The reported rates of any bleeding with rivaroxa- ban in the four phase III clinical trials carried out in patients undergoing total hip and total knee replace-ment surgery range from 4.9% to 10.5% 393-396 and are comparable to the rates observed in patients treated with enoxaparin. Rates of major bleeding events vary from , 0.1% to 0.7%, and the rates of clinically rele- vant nonmajor bleeding events vary from 2.6% to 3.3%, again with no statistically signi cant differences between the rates observed in the rivaroxaban groups and the rates observed in the comparator groups (ie, the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin in all studies). 393-396 A pooled analysis of the four RECORD studies reported that the concomitant use of nonsteroidal antiinfl ammatory drugs, aspirin, or other antiplatelet agents was not associated with an increased rate of bleeding events. 428 The rate of any bleeding event in patients with a previous episode of VTE treated with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for 6 to 12 months after the ini-tial standard course of anticoagulant therapy was 23%; major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 0.7% and 5.4% of patients, respectively. 425 to 5 weeks in patients undergoing total hip replace-ment surgery, although approved durations may vary among countries. Rivaroxaban is currently not approved for use in patients with severe renal failure and a creatinine clearance of , 15 mL/min, in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy, and in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics or HIV protease inhibitors. 414 Rivaroxaban is also not approved for use in children or adolescents , 18 years of age because of the absence of clinical data, in pregnant women because of the potential for reproductive toxicity (observed in animals) and the evidence that the drug passes the placenta, and during breast-feeding because the drug is secreted into milk. 414 Future additional indications are expected following the results of recently published clinical trials. In par-ticular, more information on the long-term admin-istration of rivaroxaban now originates from studies carried out in patients with VTE or AF in whom the drug was administered for a minimum of 6 months and up to a maximum of 40 months. 425,426 To date, the results of a phase III clinical trials assessing the use of rivaroxaban in the treatment of DVT have been published. In the EINSTEIN study, . 3,400 patients with acute symptomatic prox- imal DVT were allocated to rivaroxaban 15 mg bid for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily or initial therapy with enoxaparin (1 mg/kg bid) and simulta-neous warfarin administered to a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0. 425 The primary outcome measure was symptomatic recurrent VTE, which occurred in 36 rivaroxaban-treated patients and 51 low-molecular-weight patients 0.44-1.04; P , .0001 for noninferiority). Patients who had completed 6 to 12 months of anti-coagulant treatment with either a VKA or rivaroxaban (if also enrolled in the acute-phase rivaroxaban treat-ment study) after an acute episode of VTE were ran-domized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily or matching placebo for additional 6 to 12 months. The study showed superior ef cacy of rivaroxaban over placebo in the prevention of recurrent venous throm-boembolic events, a nonsigni cant increase in major bleeding, and an increase in clinically relevant, non-major bleeding events. 425 More recently, the results of the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa inhibition Com-pared with Vitamin K Antagonist for the Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET) study comparing rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (15 mg once daily if patients had a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min) with warfarin in patients with AF and at least two additional risk factors for embolic events were published. In this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, rivaroxa- \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e75S Conclusion Over the last decades, a large amount of research has been addressed to improve the understanding of the mechanisms of warfarin, acenocoumarol, and phenprocoumon and to improve the management of patients treated with these VKAs. Several studies have in particular identi ed some genetic factors associated with the individual responses to VKAs and several drugs, foods, and environmental factors that can interact with these compounds. Several induction and maintenance strategies have been compared, and management studies have evaluated different approaches for the monitoring of patients on VKAs, including AMS and AC, computer programs, and POC for INR testing. The results of all such studies have greatly contributed to improve the ef cacy and safety of oral anticoagulant therapy and to increase the number of patients who can be deemed eligible for such treatment. Finally, a number of trials have also addressed the management of patients on VKA treatment who are at increased risk of bleeding or are actively bleeding, and a number of therapeutic strat-egies have been proposed, although additional research may be warranted in particular to further improve the management of the bleeding patient. The new oral anticoagulant drugs have the poten- tial to overcome several drawbacks of the VKAs. These drugs can be administered at xed doses and do not require laboratory monitoring, thus offering a clear advantage over the VKAs. It is hoped that new studies will provide us with further information on the role of speci c laboratory tests for the monitoring of the activity of these new classes of drugs, when requested, and on the optimal management of drug-related adverse events.

The incidence of cardiovascular events was low while on treatment with rivaroxaban, ranging between 0.1% and 0.7%, and was similar to that seen with enoxaparin. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 12% to 20% of patients in the four RECORD trials; these rates were similar to those observed with enoxaparin. The most frequent adverse events were nausea, vomiting, and constipation. 3.8 Reversal There is currently no speci c antidote available to antagonize the effects of rivaroxaban. In case of over- dose, the use of activated charcoal to reduce absorp-tion is suggested. 414 Because of the high plasma protein binding, rivaroxaban is unlikely to be dialyz-able. In case of active bleeding, possible strategies currently include discontinuation of treatment and administration of blood products or component trans-fusion if required to treat an identi ed de ciency. 414 However, there is currently no direct evidence in humans to support the ef cacy of blood product trans-fusion or other interventions in improving hemostasis when patients have received rivaroxaban. Recently, Perzborn et al 429 reported the results of a study car- ried out in rats treated with high-dose rivaroxaban, which aimed to assess the ef cacy of prothrombin complex concentrate. After determination of baseline mesenteric bleeding time, rats were initially treated with IV rivaroxaban and subsequently received four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates at 25 U/kg or 50 U/kg. Prolongation of the bleeding time was almost completely abrogated by higher dose of prothrombin complex concentrates, whereas the lower dose was ineffective. The use of recombi-nant factor VIIa is also suggested in the presence of life-threatening bleeding based on some preclinical data. 414 A reconstructed recombinant factor Xa has been recently proposed as a potential antidote for factor Xa inhibitors. 430 This is a catalytically inactive factor Xa that has no procoagulant or anticoagulant activity and does not interfere with the prothrombi-nase complex but maintains high af nity for factor Xa inhibitors. In plasma, the addition of the antidote dose-dependently reversed factor Xa inhibition as measured by anti-factor Xa tissue factor-initiated thrombin generation, and clotting assays. In vivo, the antidote completely reversed PT prolongation induced by intravenous infusion of rivaroxaban in rats. \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e76S Oral gamma-11. carboxyglutamic acid.

This study evaluated the validity of the Short Inventory of Problems\u2014Alcohol and Drugs modified for Drug Use (SIP-DU) among subjects recruited from a primary care clinic (n =106). SIP-DU internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alphas, convergent validity by correlating the total SIP-DU score with the DAST-10, and construct validity by analyzing the factor structure. The SIP- DU demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's al- pha for overall scale .95, subscales .72-.90) comparable with other SIP versions and correlated well with the DAST-10 (r=.70). Confirmatory factor analysis suggested an unac- ceptable fit of previously proposed factors; exploratory factor analyses suggested a single factor of drug use consequences. The SIP-DU offers primary care clinicians a valid and practi- cal assessment tool for drug use consequences.

Understanding drug use consequences is central to addressing drug use and can provide motiva- tion to the patient to address the problem. Understanding the severity of problems can also help a clinician determine what, if any, intervention is required (eg, a brief interven- tion in primary care for patients with milder symptoms or more intensive treatment for the dependent patient). Drug use instruments validated in a primary care setting are im- portant; most such instruments were developed in specialty care settings and may not be appropriate for use in primary care. One instrument that has been adapted to measure the consequences of alcohol and drug use combined is the Short Inventory of Problems (SIP). Originally developed and validated to measure alcohol consequences, the SIP has been modified to assess individual consequences related to substance (alcohol and other drug) use disorders (SIP- SUD), alcohol and other drug use (SIP-AD), drugs alone (SIP-D), and even bipolar disorder (SIP-BD).2-4None has been validated in primary care settings. The original SIP for alcohol is a 15-item instrument created by selecting representative items from the Drinker Inventory of Conse- quences (DrInC) to assess the self-attributed consequences of drinking in five domains (Physical, Intrapersonal, Social 257Responsibility, Interpersonal, and Impulse Control) using two time frames (lifetime and recent consequences).5The Physical domain assesses acute and chronic physical states resulting from heavy drinking. The Intrapersonal domain asks about personal states of feeling associated with drink- ing such as guilt or shame. The Social Responsibility do- main asks about consequences observable by others such as failing to do what was expected because of drinking. The Interpersonal domain assesses an individual's damage to or loss of personal relationships, including concern about drinking from family and friends. Finally, the Impulse Con- trol domain asks about impulsive actions, risk-taking, in- creased use of other substances, and legal problems.5,6 The Inventory of Drug Use Consequences (InDUC) rep- resented a next step in meeting the need for a standardized measure of both alcohol and other drug use consequences. The InDUC was created by taking the identical items used in the DrInC but modifying the wording from \"drinking\" to \"drinking or using drugs.\" The InDUC is available in two versions: one that assesses lifetime consequences of substance use and another that assesses the frequency of recent problems (ie, past 3 months).5Like the DrInC, the InDUC was subsequently shortened to 15 items (of which 12 items are the same as those used in the SIP for alcohol) to enhance its clinical utility and became known as the SIP for alcohol or drugs (SIP-AD).2 It is this version of the SIP that was modified for this study to focus on other drug problems, and we hypothesized that it would have similar properties of internal consistency and validity as its recently developed cousin instrument, the SIP for alcohol modified for other drugs (SIP-D).3How- ever, since the instrument used in this study is descended from a different branch of the SIP family tree than the SIP- D with three items that were not part of the SIP for alcohol, this instrument shall be referred to as the Short Inventory of Problems\u2014Alcohol and Drugs modified for Drug Use (SIP-DU) to distinguish it from the SIP-D (Figure 1). Since no previous versions of the SIP have been validated exclu- sively in a primary care sample, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the validity of the SIP-DU in a sample of primary care patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants The study was conducted between October 2006 and June 2007 in the waiting room of a primary care clinic at an urban safety net hospital. To help minimize biased selec- tion, subjects were systematically approached daily by one research associate according to a predetermined pattern based on waiting room seating, which was varied each day. Patients who were under the age of 18 were excluded, as were those who, in the judgment of the research associate, would be unable to complete the questionnaire because of limited English, cognitive impairment, or acute illness.People in the waiting room accompanying patients but who reported not themselves being patients of the clinic were also excluded. Eligible subjects were interviewed either be- fore or after their primary care visit, or were scheduled to return at a later time for a research interview conducted in a private setting. All data were recorded anonymously without any unique identifiers. Assessments Subjects were first asked the single screening question validated in primary care to detect drug use, \"How many times in the past year have you used an illegal drug or used a prescription medication for non-medical reasons?\"7 A cross-sectional assessment of alcohol and drug use was then conducted including the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10), a computerized version of the Composite In- ternational Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) Substance Abuse Module and the SIP-DU.8,9The questions included in the DAST-10 ask about possible involvement during the past 12 months with drugs by drug class, not including alco- hol (eg, the use of prescribed or over-the-counter drugs in excess of the directions, any nonmedical use of drugs). As part of the CIDI, subjects were asked about past year use of illicit drugs (marijuana, cocaine, heroin, stimulants, or hallucinogens) and about past year non-medical use of pre- scription drugs. The SIP-DU asked questions about lifetime consequences of drug use (1 =Ever/0 =Never); subscale scores and the total score were then calculated by sum- ming the item responses. All interviews were conducted by trained research staff (author PS trained the research associate by role play and by using the CIDI materials) in a private setting and data were recorded anonymously. All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Boston University Medical Center. Informed consent was given by all subjects before participating in the research. Data Analysis All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Scores were calculated for the total SIP-DU and each of the five subscales using the ques- tions that asked about drug use consequences over the past 3 months. Cronbach's alpha ( ) was used to assess internal consistency, or how closely related the set of ques- tions are, and to evaluate how well the SIP-DU subscales measured distinct underlying constructs of drug use con- sequences. Internal consistency estimates were compared with published results from other SIP instruments.4,5,10,11 The non-parametric Spearman's rho ( )w a su s e dt o assess correlation of the SIP-DU with the DAST-10, a mea- sure of drug involvement that is conceptually related (con- vergent validity). To evaluate whether the SIP-DU ques- tions correspond to the previously proposed five concepts of Physical, Social, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal, and Im- pulse control consequences (construct validity) a confirma- tory factor analysis was performed.

If the analyses suggested an unacceptable model fit, an exploratory factor analysis was planned to further evaluate the possible underlying con- structs of the SIP-DU. For the exploratory factor analysis, the number of factors to retain was determined based on the scree plot and the interpretability of the resulting fac- tors. The exploratory factor analysis was performed using oblique rotation to allow for possible correlation among factors. RESULTS Sample Characteristics Of 1,781 patients approached for screening 903 agreed to be screened and 394 were eligible for the study. Of the 394 eligible subjects, 303 arrived for the research interview and consented to participate in the study; 286 subjects com- pleted the research interview. The sample for this analysiswas limited ( n=106) to subjects who were identified as drug dependent based on their responses to the CIDI since they represent a relevant primary care population for assess- ment of drug use consequences (and the original SIP was derived from people with dependence). Study participants were predominantly male with a median age of 46 (range 22-74 years, Table 1). A majority was African American (58%), high school educated (73%), and reported English as their primary language (82%). Scale Internal Consistency and Convergent Validity Table 2 presents the scale internal consistency of the SIP-DU and, for comparison, those from the previously published DrInC and previous versions of the SIP, the SIP for alcohol use consequences, and the SIP for substance use disorders (SIP-SUD). These previous studies assessed ver- sions of the SIP in several different populations including outpatients diagnosed with substance use and bipolar dis- order, problem drinkers recruited from the community, and Emergency Department patients presenting with alcohol- related injuries.4,5,10,11Overall SIP-DU scale internal con- sistency 2012 259TABLE 1.

Social =.89; Interpersonal =.85; Intrapersonal =.86; Impulse =.82). Overall and across all five domains the SIP-DU internal consistency appeared as good as that previously reported for the related SIP measures by other studies. The total SIP-DU score had moderate-to-strong correlation with a conceptually related instrument, the DAST-10 (Spearman's =.71), demonstrating convergent validity. Construct Validity Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the five- factor structure did not provide an acceptable fit to the data based on each of the four fit indexes (chi-square p<.0001; RMSEA =.17; GFI =.74; AGFI =.58). analysis was therefore conducted to further evalu- ate the possible underlying constructs of the SIP-DU. Thescree plot suggested two underlying factors. In evaluating the two-factor model, each factor had multiple items with strong loadings and there was only one item that loaded on more than one factor. However, these factors were unable to be interpreted as distinct concepts of drug use consequences and did not correspond with the hypothesized subscales (Table 3). A three-factor model was then considered; how- ever, this model demonstrated poor loadings on the third factor (data not shown). A single-factor model was then fit; all items demonstrated acceptable loadings (.598-.855) and the single-factor model explained 82% of the variance. Cronbach's alpha was .95 for the single-factor model sug- gesting a high degree of internal consistency. These results suggested a single-factor model provided the best fit to the data. DISCUSSION Recent initiatives to promote screening and brief in- tervention have resulted in improved screening tools for drug use and dependence in a variety of patient popu- lations.7,12,13However, it is also important to assess the consequences of drug use once it is identified. Certainly reducing the negative physical, social, and personal conse- quences of drug use is an important quality of life issue for drug users,14,15and the involvement of primary care physicians in helping the patient find ways to reduce these consequences has the potential to improve both quality of care and outcomes. In fact, evidence suggests that higher quality primary care has the potential to reduce the odds of substance use.16The purpose of this study was to validate a version of the SIP that can be used in the primary care setting for drug use consequences. The SIP-DU and a sin- gle screening question about drug use provide time-efficient tools for primary care teams in identifying and caring for drug-using patients.7 Previous research has shown that the SIP and its variants (eg, the SIP-AD) are valuable measurement tools that can reliably assess negative consequences in patients with alco- hol or drug use disorders.2Although one instrument that summarizes consequences of both alcohol and drug use can TABLE 2.

Previous versions of the SIP have assessed consequences due to alcohol or drug use without distinguishing whether consequences were due to one or the other. This level of specificity is important when having a discussion with a patient about substance use consequences and when monitoring clinical progress of treatment outcomes in primary care. Having the ability to attribute consequences to alcohol and drugs separately may help clinicians and patients considering treatment op- tions to prioritize and individualize interventions to miti- gate the negative consequences experienced by the patient.The results of this study suggest that the SIP-DU retains strong internal consistency when administered in primary care and that this is comparable to those reported in earlier studies. The observed correlation of the SIP-DU with the DAST- 10 is sufficiently high to suggest that the SIP-DU is mea- suring an independent construct of drug use consequences. This further highlights the potential usefulness of the SIP- DU in primary care settings with drug-using patients. This study also provides additional evidence that the original SIP can be successfully modified to separately assess con- sequences of drug use and alcohol use. Allens worth-Davies et al. May-June 2012 261The unacceptable fit of the originally proposed five- factor structure for the SIP-DU is consistent with find- ings reported by Gillespie et al.17When they conducted confirmatory factor analysis with their data, they dis- covered that the loadings of the SIP-AD items were not consistent with a five-factor structure and concluded that a single-factor structure was most appropriate. The ex- ploratory factor analysis findings of this study are con- sistent with those results. This primary care sample was recruited from a single urban medical center, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The patients at this medical center tend to be more socioeconomically disadvantaged, more racially and ethnically diverse, and may have more severe drug use or dependence than that seen at other hospitals that are not in urban underserved settings. Generalizability may also be limited to English-speaking patients willing to participate in a research study. Since this was designed as a cross-sectional study, nei- ther test-retest reliability nor the responsiveness of the SIP-DU to change over time could be evaluated. In ad- dition, the sample size for this study was small and may not have been adequate to determine the true SIP-DU factor structure. Finally, unlike the full versions of the DrInC and InDUC, neither the original SIP for alcohol nor the SIP-DU contains a control subscale to detect careless responding. As part of a growing interest in developing substance use measures relevant to primary care, the present study evalu- ated the validity of the SIP-DU in a primary care sample. As was recently found with the SIP-DU's cousin instrument, the SIP-D,3this analysis provides evidence of the SIP-DU's validity in measuring drug use consequences in a primary care setting. Consistent with previous research, a five-factor structure for the SIP-DU could not be confirmed by this study. Instead, the results suggested a possible single-factor structure for the SIP-DU. Future research might include additional psychometric analysis of the SIP-DU in other clinical settings and other geographical regions with larger sample sizes, and might also test use of the SIP-DU for identifying consequences of drug use among patients with- out dependence. Nevertheless, the SIP-DU offers clinicians a practical assessment tool for drug use consequences in a primary care setting.

Hausmann, PhD,b,cJeff Whittle, MD, Dartmouth, and Boston, MA; Pittsburgh, PA; and Milwaukee, WI Background Chronic stressors such as perceived discrimination might underlie race disparities in cardiovascular disease. This study focused on the relationship between perceived discrimination and risk of severe coronary obstruction while also accounting for multiple psychosocial variables and clinical factors. Methods Data from 793 (629 white and 164 black) male veterans with positive nuclear imaging studies were analyzed. Participants were categorized as being at low/moderate or high risk for severe coronary obstruction based on results of theirnuclear imaging studies. Hierarchical logistic regression models were tested separately for blacks and whites. The first step of the models included clinical factors. The second step included the psychosocial variables of optimism, religiosity, negative affect, and social support. The final step included perceived discrimination. Results Perceived discrimination was positively related to risk of severe obstruction among blacks but not among whites after controlling for clinical and psychosocial variables. Similar results were found in patients who underwent coronary angiography (n = 311). Conclusions Perceived discrimination was associated with risk of severe coronary obstruction among black male veterans and could be an important target for future interventions. (Am Heart J 2012;163:677-83.) Cardiovascular disease affects disproportionately more blacks than whites in the United States.1However, the sources of this disparity are not clearly understood. Oneproposed mechanism underlying race differences incardiovascular health is differential exposure to chronicstressors, 2which includes racial discrimination.3,4As an unpredictable and uncontrollable stressor, perceived racial discrimination can elicit physiologic responses (eg, increased blood pressure) that can degrade healthover time and result in cardiovascular disease over thelong term. 5 A growing body of literature suggests that perceived discrimination is related to diverse markers of cardio-vascular disease. (Discrimination, while a real andobjective dynamic, is most often measured by askingindividuals their perceptions of whether/how discrimi- nation occurred. We posit that such perceptions are themost important aspect to measure, because if discrim-ination occurs objectively but is not perceived by anindividual, it may have less of an impact on healthoutcomes. For this reason, throughout the paper wewill refer to 'perceived 'discrimination, as that is the focus of this work.) Among blacks, but not whites, perceived racial discrimination was associated withhigher levels of endothelin-1, which contributes tovascular remodeling, ather osclerotic plaques, renal dysfunction, and ultimately, hypertension and heartfailure. 1Chronic discrimination was also associated with coronary calci cation, which is related to coronary obstruction, among a sample of black women.6In addition, perceived discrimination was positively asso-ciated with diastolic blood pressure reactivity and heartrate among black, but not white, women. 7Although not allndings support the relationship between perceived discrimination and cardiovascular health,8there is signicant evidence that perceived discrimination is related to cardiovascular health, particularly amongblack women. A number of other psychosocial factors are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association of perceived discrimination with risk ofsevere coronary obstruction in a sample of white andblack male veterans who had positive nuclear imaging studies. We hypothesized that increased levels of perceived discrimination would be related to greaterrisk of severe obstruction only among blacks evenafter controlling for clinical and behavioral risk factors(eg, smoking and high blood pressure) and psychoso-cial variables associated with cardiovascular health (ie,negative affect, optimism, social support, and religios-ity). We also examined how the above variables wererelated to severity of coronary obstruction in thesubset of veterans from our sample that underwentcoronary angiography. Methods Study population We used data from the Cardiac Decision Making Study, an observational cohort study of white and black veterans who had a cardiac nuclear imaging study performed between August 1999 and January 2001 at 1 of 5 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers with on-site catheterization laboratories.16 Overall, 2,335 of the 5,278 patients who were screened hada positive nuclear imaging study. Of these, 981 patients were excluded because they were unable to be contacted (n = 456), had a cardiac procedure in the preceding 6 months (n = 209), were not black or white (n = 102), had impaired mental status (n = 78), were in another study that would in fluence treat- ment of their coronary artery disease (n = 32), or other reasons (eg, impaired hearing, patient was a nonveteran, nuclear imaging study was performed for compensation and pension evaluation; n = 104). A total of 1,025 of the 1,354 eligible veterans agreed to participate, of which 793 (629 whites and 164 blacks) had complete data. We also collected coronary anatomy data in a subset of 311 patients (259 whites and 52 blacks) who had coronary angiography within 90 days of their imaging study.Data Sociodemographic information. Patients self-reported race, age (in years), and education (0, b12 years of education; 1, 12 years). Only patients who responded that they were white/Caucasian (coded as 0) or black/African American (coded as 1) were included in the study. Clinical variables. Trained nurses abstracted clinical information, including diagnosis of hypertension and diabetes, current smoking status, prior r evascularization, and prior myocardial infarction. These variables were coded as 1 if the conditions were present and 0 if they were not. We also collected data on a history of a diagnosis of hypercholesterol- emia and if the participants were on antiplatelet or lipid- lowering therapy. Perceived discrimination. Perceived discrimination was assessed with an adaptation of a previously published 7- item measure asking if the participant has ever been treated unfairly, been kept from doing something, or been made to feel inferior because of his or her race, ethnic group, or skin color in several domains, including (1) school, (2) getting a job, (3) at work, (4) getting medical care, (5) getting housing, (6) from the police or in the courts, or (7) on the street or in a public setting.17Because our patient population consisted of military veterans, we adapted the original measure by breaking the medical care question into \"getting medical care at the VA\"and \"getting medical care outside the VA, \"and added \"in the military \"as an additional domain. The \"yes\"responses were counted to create a perceived discrimination score. Overall, the 9-item measure had good internal reliability among white ( = .75) and black ( = .88) participants. We also conducted the analyses using the original 7-item scale and found the same pattern of results, so only results using the 9- item scale are reported. Psychosocial variables. Negative affect was assessed using a 9-item version18of the emotionality scale of the Eysenck Personality Inventory.19Participants responded \"yes or \"no\"to items such as \"Are you often uneasy, feeling that there is something you want without knowing it. \"The number of \"yes\" responses was counted to create a negative affect score. Opti- mism was assessed using a 10-item measure that asked participants to rate their agreement on items such as \"In uncertain times, I usually expect the best \"on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).20Responses were summed to create an optimism score. Social support was assessed using a validated 4-item scale,21which asked about satisfaction with family relationships, frequency of social contact with friends and relatives, and frequency of contact with someone the patient trusts and can con de in. Scores reflect the number of items to which the respondent answered \"yes.\"Religiosity was assessed using the sum of 3 items asking about how often patients attended religious services; watched or listened to religious programs on TV or radio; or prayed, meditated, or studied the Bible or other religious text (0 = never/ almost never, 7 = daily/more often). Risk of severe coronary obstruction. We categorized risk of severe coronary obstruction using a modi cation of the methods of Bateman et al,22described in detail elsewhere.23 Briefly, a board-certi ed general internist and a cardiology fellow classi ed the severity of each nuclear imaging study based on review of the of cial report, which did not include678 Ayotte et alAmerican Heart Journal April 2012information on patient race. We considered patients with reversible lesions in the distribution of left anterior descending coronary artery or in both the right coronary artery and left circum flex artery to be at high risk, along with patients with increased lung uptake or transient ischemic dilation with exercise or pharmacologic stress. We considered patients with reversible lesions in just 1 of the right coronary artery or left circum flex artery to be at moderate risk and patients whose defects were very small or minimally reversible to be at low risk. For the current analysis, we collapsed patients into 2 categories; patients at moderate or low risk of severe coronary obstruction and those at high risk. We also examined severity of coronary artery obstruction among participants who underwent coronary angiography. We classi ed coronary obstruction as severe if there was a stenosis of 70% in the left main coronary artery or all 3 major coronary systems. We classi ed nonsevere obstruction as moderate if there was at least 70% obstruction of the proximal left anterior descending artery. We de ned mild obstruction as at least 1 coronary artery obstruction N70%, but not moderate or severe. We classi ed obstruction as none if there was no obstruction of N70%. For the current analysis, we collapsed obstruction into 2 categories: moderate/severe and mild/none.Statistical analyses Werst examined race differences in all study variables using ttests or 2tests. We then used hierarchical logistic regression models to examine the association between perceived discrim- ination and risk of severe coronary obstruction separately for blacks and whites. We chose to stratify the analyses by race because the experiences and consequences of racial discrimi- nation are likely to be qualitatively different for blacks and whites, and the analytic strategies of including race as a covariate or attempting to adjust for variables confounded with race often can produce results that obscure racial differences.24Stratifying analyses by race is a recommended analytic technique that treats race as a \"marker for differential experiences and exposures \"(p. 303) and is less prone to mask important race differences.25 Each hierarchical model included 3 steps. Step 1 included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics that are known to differ by race or were associated with race in our sample (ie, age, education, hypertension, diabetes, prior revasculari- zation, prior myocardial infarction, and current smoking status). We tested the impact of including additional clinical variables (receipt of antiplatelet or lipid lowering therapy, hypercholesterolemia), but they were not signi cant, so we omitted them from the nal model. In the second step, weTable I.

We added perceived discrimination in thenal step. We repeated these steps for the analysis of coronary obstruction in the subsample of veterans who underwent coronary angiography. The predictive power of the models was examined by use of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ie, the cstatistic). Values near 0.50 re flect a model with no apparent accuracy, values between 0.70 and 0.80 are considered good, values between 0.80 and 0.90 are considered excellent, and values above 0.90 are considered outstanding.26 This research was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Health Services Research and Development Service (ECV 970-022 and RCS 02-066, NR Kressin, PI); Roundtable (9970113N, NR Kressin, PI); Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development postdoctoral fellowship (BJ Ayotte); Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development Career DevelopmentProgram (RCD 06-287, LRM Hausmann).

Results Descriptive statistics Characteristics of the full sample are presented in Table I . Compared with blacks, whites were signi cantly older and less likely to be diagnosed with hypertension but were more likely to have had prior revascularizationor prior myocardial infarction. Whites reported signi - cantly less discrimination, negative affect, and religiosity,but signi cantly more social support than blacks. There were no race differences in education, optimism, anddiabetes. Overall, 43.9% of participants were at high risk for severe coronary obstruction, based on their nuclearimaging studies; this percentage was similar in blacks andwhites. Among the 311 patients who underwentcoronary angiography, whites were signi cantly more likely than moderate/severe coronaryobstruction (39.0% vs 25.0%). Logistic regressions Thenal logistic regression models for the nuclear imaging study results are presented in Table II . Among blacks, step 1 ( cmodel = 14.86, Pb.05) indicated that prior myocardial infarction and smoking were positively associated with high (vs low/moderate) risk of severe coronary obstruction. In step2(c model = 0.70, 2 4= 10.36, Pb.05), optimism was negatively related to risk of severe coronary obstruc-tion. Finally, step 3 ( c model = 0.77, 2 1= 13.45, Pb .05) indicated that perceived discrimination was associated with an increase in risk of severe coronary obstruction after accounting for the variables in therst 2 steps of the model. Prior myocardial infarction, smoking, and optimism remained signi cant in the nal model. Among whites, smoking and myocardial infarction were related to high risk of severe coronary obstruction in step 1(c model = 0.59, 2 7= 15.04, Pb.05). 4= 14.04, Pb.05), optimism was related to lower risk of coronary obstruction. Perceived discrimination was notrelatedtoriskofcoronaryobstructionamongwhitesinstep 3(c model = 0.63, 2 1= 1.27, PN.05).

In step 3 (cmodel = 0.91, 2 1= 13.08, Pb.05), perceived discrimination was signi cantly related to likelihood of moderate/s evere obstruction. Among whites, myocardial infarction and smoking were relatedto an increased likelihood of moderate/severe obstruc-tion in step 1 ( c model = 0.61, 2 7= 15.88, 2(cmodel = 0.65, 2 4= 10.79, Pb.05), optimism was again related to a decreased likelihood of moderate/severe obstruction. Perceived discrimination was notassociated with obstruction among whites in step 3 (c model = 0.68, 2 1= 1.01, PN.05). Discussion In this study of black and white male veterans with abnormal nuclear imaging studies, we found that, among black men, greater perceptions of racial discrimination were related to increased risk for severe coronaryobstruction and to angiographic coronary obstructionafter controlling for clinical and psychosocial factors thatare related to cardiovascular health. In addition, smoking,prior myocardial infarction, and optimism were related tonuclear imaging study results and coronary angiographyresults for blacks and whites. These ndings support and extend previous research linking perceived discrimination to indicators of cardio-vascular disease 1,6,27,28and are consistent with previous work that found these associations mostly among blacks.1 Our results strengthen the evidence for a relationship between racial discrimination and cardiovascular diseasein men, as previous work tended to focus on women. Inaddition, we controlled for psychosocial factors related tocardiovascular outcomes that have not been examined inprevious research on the health correlates of perceived discrimination. Finally, by examining the association between perceived racial discrimination and coronary obstruction, we shed light on 1 possible causal pathwayfor the black-white disparity in cardiovascular deaths. There are several possible explanations for the relationship we report. Chronic stress such as perceiveddiscrimination is related to increased activation of thehypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, 29,30which re- sults in increased production of cortisol. Cortisol, in turn,is independently related to risk of coronary artery diseaseand stenosis. 31,32Research also suggests that perceived discrimination is related to hypertension1and increased cardiovascular reactivity,7which are both related to coronary obstruction.33In our results, perceived discrim- ination was associated with greater risk of severecoronary obstruction although we accounted for hyper-tension. Other possible contributors include increasedendothelin-1 (a vasoconstrictor implicated in associated atherosclerosis35), and C-reactive protein (a marker of in flammation that is associated with cardiovascular disease36), all of which are related to perceived discrimination. This study went beyond past studies of discrimination and cardiovascular disease indicators by including a number of psychosocial variables that are associatedwith cardiovascular health. Among blacks and whites,optimism was negatively related to the risk of severecoronary obstruction. Optimism might be related tocardiovascular health through factors such as hyperten-sion, 37as well as through other psychosocial factors (eg, increased social support, coping ability).12 This study found no signi cant associations of social support, negative affect, or religiosity with nuclearimaging study results or the results from coronaryTable III. Final logistic regression models predicting moderate/severe (vs mild/none) coronary obstruction (coronary angiogram) VariableBlack (n = 52) White (n = 259) OR95%CI OR95%CI Lower Upper Lower Upper Age 0.99 0.88 1.12 1.03 smoker 1.49 1.22 9.95 2.08 1.17 3.72 1.20 0.93 1.01 Negative affect 0.54 0.28 1.01 0.88 0.78 1.02 Discrimination 2.02 1.25 3.28 1.02 0.73 1.45 Pb.05Ayotte et al 681American Heart Journal Volume 163, Number 4angiography. One possible reason for these null ndings is that our sample was restricted to persons withevidence for clinically signi cant coronary ischemia on nuclear imaging studies; these associations might befound in a sample that included persons without suchevidence. It is also possible that these factors are notassociated with coronary obstruction, per se, althoughthey have been associated with other indicators ofcardiovascular health. We chose to control for thesevariables in the current study, although it is possible thatthey might serve as moderators of the relationship between perceived discrimination and cardiovascular health because of their stress-buffering potential. Wetested this possibility in supplemental analyses and foundno evidence that optimism, negative affect, religiosity, orsocial support moderated the relationship betweenperceived racial discrimination and the nuclear imagingstudy results or the results from coronary angiography.With this being the rst study to examine the relation- ships of these variables to nuclear imaging results,additional research is needed to determine whether thelack of signi cant relationships observed in the current study is seen in other populations. These ndings should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, our sample included only menwith positive nuclear imaging study results \u2014a popula- tion selected to be at high risk for coronary disease.This may explain why diabetes and hypertension,known risk factors for coronary artery disease, werenot associated with the imaging results. Although physicians presumably included these clinical risk factors in their clinical decision making, it is unlikelythat they incorporated perceptions of racial discrimina-tion (or optimism). Thus, to the extent that perceiveddiscrimination affects mea surable risk factors for coronary artery disease, our estimates of the impactof perceived discrimination may be conservative. Futureresearch should examine these relationships in peoplewho are at low risk for coronary disease. Second, our data were cross-sectional, thus precluding any causal interpretations. Third, we did not account for anumber of clinical variables that are associated with riskof coronary obstruction (eg, various cholesterol subsets).Fourth, the sample size of black patients was relativelysmall, resulting in relatively large con dence intervals around our effect size estimates. Finally, we assessed only racial discrimination, which was seldom a signi cant concern for white participants. This nonsigni cant relationship between discrimination and risk of coronary obstruction should not suggestthat discrimination is unimportant for whites. Previousstudies indicate that nonracial discrimination is associ-ated with cardiovascular outcomes, suggesting that it may be unfair treatment in general, rather than racial discrimination in particular, that leads to negativehealth effects. 38Despite these limitations, these results add to the growing literature on the relationship between per-ceived discrimination and cardiovascular health byinvestigating the relationship between perceived dis-crimination and risk of severe coronary artery obstruc-tion. This is important because coronary artery diseaseis the most common form of heart disease and is theleading cause of death in the United States. Our ndings underscore the possible negative health consequencesof perceived discrimination among blacks. Futureresearch should focus on identifying potential modi - able mediators of the relationship between perceived discrimination and cardiovascular disease so that thenegative health consequences of perceived discrimina-tion can be reduced.

RUSH Health Literacy Innovations Program, United Health Group Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA MICHAEL K. PAASCHE-ORLOW Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA We are pleased to present this special issue on health literacy of the Journal of Health Communication . The journal continues to demonstrate a deep commitment to this important topic, offering a venue to exhibit leading health literacy research for the third year in a row. We hope that this special issue helps guide the overall direction of the field and serves as a springboard for lively discussion, innovative research, and practice initiatives. As in the past, this special issue includes findings presented at the Health Literacy Annual Research Conference (HARC III), which was held on October 17-18, 2011 in Chicago, Illinois and was attended by more than 200 health literacy investigators. The 2011 conference was unique, as it was co-located with the International Conference for Communication in Healthcare (ICCH), an event dedicated to presenting cutting- edge research and educational strategies to improve how information and ideas are exchanged in health care settings\u2014topics that are clearly related to the health literacy agenda. The coordination of these two conferences allowed researchers from countries around the world to share findings and build collaborations for the future. In doing so, it offered an exceptional opportunity for HARC to fulfill its primary objectives of (a) professional development, (b) advancing the science of health literacy Journal of Health Communication , 17:2-6, 2012 Copyright \u00a9 Taylor & Francis Group, 09:58 05 February 2013 Introduction 3 research, and (c) promoting interdisciplinary research. We look forward to continuing our pursuit of these goals during HARC IV, which will be held on October 22-23, 2012 in Bethesda, Maryland. The expansion of HARC, along with the growth in health literacy research, has led to the largest health literacy special issue yet. This issue includes over 20 articles and commentaries from across the United States and Europe, covering a number of key themes. Recognizing the growing diversity of the United States, multiple articles explore the links between health literacy, culture, and language proficiency. This includes a commentary from McKee and Paasche-Orlow calling for greater collaboration between researchers studying low health literacy and those focusing on limited English proficiency, as well as a conceptual framework by Lie, Carter-Pokras, Braun, and Coleman that integrates the concepts of health literacy and cultural competence for the purpose of improving education for health care professionals. An original research article from Shaw, Armin, Torres, Orzech, and Vivian explores the relationship between culture, health literacy, and chronic disease self-management among patients from four ethnic groups, while another from Sentell and Braun examines health status by health literacy and English proficiency among an ethnically and linguistically diverse study sample. There has been increased recognition by researchers, clinicians, and government agencies of the importance of promoting patient-centered care and considering patient preferences in the design and implementation of interventions. Three articles in this issue respond to this movement by describing patients' preferences for receiving health information. Cawthon and colleagues discuss which components of their PILL-CVD intervention were considered beneficial according to patients, particularly those with low health literacy. Gaglio, Glasgow, and Bull report findings from an in-depth study on patients' preferred sources of health information. Finally, Guise, Koonce, Storrow, Kusnoor, and Ye reveal the importance of personalizing health education interventions by patients' preferred learning style and literacy skills. As in the past, this special issue also includes articles focused on the conceptualization and measurement of health literacy. Squiers, Peinado, Berkman, Boudewyns, and McCormack introduce a conceptual framework for health literacy that builds on prior frameworks, but emphasizes a full pathway from the development of literacy skills to resulting health outcomes. Haun, Luther, Dodd, and Donaldson report on the conceptual and measurement variations between three commonly used measures of health literacy. Helitzer, Hollis, Sanders, and Roybal introduce the TALKDOC, an instrument designed to measure multiple health literacy competencies within the context of HPV and cervical cancer. Rubin presents an article on the construct of \"listenability\" (versus readability) as part of health literacy. Finally, Bann, McCormack, Berkman, and Squiers describe the validation of a shortened, 10-item version of their Health Literacy Skills Instrument. While development and validation activities for these tools should continue, next steps include incorporating these measures into future and ongoing research. This is essential to advance the field and ensure that validated, theory-based instruments are being used in practice. This special issue expands upon the existing literature by including studies that further explore the association between health literacy and various health outcomes. Mitchell, Sadikova, Jack, and Paasche-Orlow assess the link between health literacy and re-hospitalization, while Mosher, Lund, Kripilani, and Kaboli examine the relationship between health literacy and medication-related outcomes, including Downloaded by [Boston University] at 09:58 05 February 2013 4 Introduction medication knowledge, adherence, and adverse drug events. Arnold and colleagues assess the role of health literacy in colorectal cancer screening knowledge, beliefs, and experiences. From an international perspective, Sahm, Wolf, Curtis, and McCarthy consider the prevalence and potential effects of limited health literacy in Ireland. Together, these articles serve to identify areas where additional research is needed; such findings have the potential to inform the design and implementation of future interventions. Three articles describe efforts to improve the design, content, and efficacy of written materials from a health literacy perspective. Boxell and colleagues present information on the development and testing of a gynecological cancer information pamphlet in the United Kingdom, while King et al. evaluate the benefit of using symbols on prescription medication information leaflets. Liu and Rawl examine the role of text cohesion on the understandability of print materials, and Kaphingst et al. describe the development and testing of the Health Literacy INDEX, a tool that measures the health literacy demands of written health information materials. These articles highlight the ways in which written information can be enhanced, but also show the limitations of using print material alone to convey health information to patients. Finally, a few articles in this special issue address topics that are of particular salience to health care organizations and providers. Weaver, Wray, Zellin, Gautam, and Jupka describe a process of assessing organizational health literacy in health centers serving vulnerable populations. Jager and Wynia examine how often physicians ask patients to \"teach-back\" information provided during clinical encounters; this article specifically examines the sociodemographic characteristics of patients who receive this health literacy via best practice versus those who do not. Finally, Bickmore and Paasche-Orlow discuss the potential impact of health information technology on health disparities and caution that greater inequalities will result without significant advances in health information technologies that are usable and accessible for people with low health literacy. The study by Gazmararian, Yang, Elon, Graham, and Parker explores this concern by examining the role of health literacy on women's ability to enroll electronically in the Text4Baby intervention. Overall, this special issue covers a variety of topics, methods and perspectives. It takes a truly interdisciplinary approach, incorporating research from public health, medicine, nursing, anthropology, and communication science, among others. It includes perspectives of insurers, clinicians, patients, and researchers from the United States and Europe, using quantitative and qualitative methodologies to examine some of the most pressing questions in health literacy research. This issue acknowledges the limitations of a still relatively new field, exhibits a continued discussion about the conceptualization of health literacy and the use of imperfect measures\u2014yet also shows great promise and progress. To move forward, we must continue to engage in this interdisciplinary dialogue, confronting and addressing our challenges, with the ultimate objective of advancing this important discourse.

The Breast Health Center at Boston Medical Center is a multidisciplinary program, with internists providing care alongside breast surgeons, radiolo- gists, and patient navigators. Using a triage system previously shown to have high provider and patient satisfaction, and the ability to provide timely care, patients are assigned to either a breast surgeon or internist. From 2007 to 2009, internists cared for 2,408 women, representing half of all referrals. Women served were diverse in terms of race (33% black, 30% Hispanic, 5% Asian), language (34% require language interpreter), and insurance status (51% had no insurance or public insurance). Most presented with an abnormal screen (breast examination 54% or imaging 4%) while the remainder were seen for symptoms such as pain (26%), non-bloody nipple discharge (4%), or risk assessment (7%). A majority of nal diagnoses were made through clinical evaluation alone ( n= 1,760, 73%), without the need for additional diagnostic imaging or tissue sampling; 9% ( n= 214) received a benign diagnosis aid of breast imaging; 19% ( n= 463) required tissue sampling. Only 4% went on to see a breast surgeon. Internists diagnosed 15 incident cancers with a median time to diagno- sis of 19 days. Patient and provider satisfaction was high. These data suggest that a group of appropriately trained inter- nists can provide quality breast care to a vulnerable population in a multidisciplinary setting. Replication of this model requires the availability of more clinical training programs for non-surgical providers. n Key Words: breast, diagnostic, health services, prevention, screening Increased attention to the early detection of breast cancer has resulted in more women participating in breast cancer screening (1). Concurrently, new and changing screening guidelines, imaging options, risk assessment methodologies, preventive strategies, and diagnostic algorithms and techniques have made the early detection of breast cancer increasingly complex. As available screening methods are not highly specic, abnormal ndings are common and often require clini- cal expertise, such that the demand for specialists inbreast health has increased (2,3). Yet, the number of breast cancers diagnosed as a result is quite low; the average positive predictive value (proportion of women with abnormal screening exams who have breast cancer) is approximately 2.0% for women below age 50, and 4.7% for women over age 50. The complexity of breast care can lead to failures in the process of care, which lead to lapses or discon- tinuation of breast health care that have the potential to impact survival for those found to have a malig- nancy (4,5). Lack of access to timely appointments with breast care subspecialists has been shown to con- tribute to such delays (6). The delivery of these ser- vices to underserved populations introduces additional complexity as a result of the additional burden of well-documented socio-cultural barriers to accessing care (7-9). Indeed, delays in diagnosis after an abnor- mal screening test for these underserved populations,Address correspondence and reprint requests to: Tracy A. Battaglia, MD, MPH, Associate Professor of Medicine Women's Health Unit, Section of General Internal Medicine, Evans Department of Medicine, Boston Medi- cal Center and Women's Health Interdisciplinary Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine. 801 Massachusetts Ave, Suite 470, Boston, MA 02118, DOI: 10.1111/j.1524-4741.2011.01179.x /C2112011 Journal, Volume 18 Number 1, 2012 58-64including those from racial ethnic minority and low socioeconomic groups, have been found to contribute to worse breast cancer outcomes (10-13). A number of societies have promoted guidelines to address the management of women with breast problems (14-17). While many of these guidelines suggest that diagnostic evaluation requires expertise of surgical oncologists or breast surgeons, there is a lack of evidence that this model is required for qual- ity care (18). As many women in need of breasthealth consultation do not have surgical needs, alter- native care models are needed to improve access for those who do. Therefore, we describe here a new care model for breast health and breast concerns that incorporates general internists with an expertise in women's health. This clinical practice, previously shown to improve adherence to timely follow-up of screening abnormalities (19), provides services to a disproportionate share of vulnerable and traditionally underserved women. We provide a description of the program structure and function along with evalua-tion metrics as evidence of its impact on quality care. Origin The Breast Health Program at Boston Medical Center (the teaching hospital of Boston University School of Medicine) was created in 1989 through col- laboration between the Women's Health Unit (within the Department of Internal Medicine), Surgical andMedical Oncology, and Breast Imaging. It was devel- oped out of the recognition that diagnostic evaluation for breast disease requires knowledge and skills beyond the level of traditionally trained internists, yet surgical providers were inundated with non-surgical referrals. As a result, breast surgeons had fewer appointments available for those truly in need of their service. Philosophy The Breast Health Program at Boston Medical Cen- ter is a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary diagnos- tic evaluation program. The goal of the program is to provide efcient and comprehensive diagnostic services and prevent delay in cancer diagnosis and care. Our multidisciplinary team includes seven internists, three breast surgeons, 2-4 radiologists specializing in breast imaging, and three pathologists with expertise in cyto- pathology and or surgical pathology. Interdisciplinary support is available with nurses, genetic counselors,social workers, patient navigators, medical assistants, and breast imaging technicians. Providers aim to deli- ver comprehensive services at each visit to minimize potential gaps in care, while addressing a wide range of breast conditions and barriers to care as they present in the clinical setting. Features Communication Communication between providers is facilitated by several features (1). Space: When thepractice began, there was no allocated space for all providers, so patient evaluation and care were accom- plished through a ''virtual center.'' With growth and documented success of the program (19,20), space for all clinical consultation and breast imaging was cre- ated in a dedicated facility to allow for real time com- munication and improve opportunities for formal and informal consultation on cases (2). Schedules: Sched- ules are coordinated to ensure that both an internist and breast surgeon staff the center during each avail- able clinical session, at which time a full spectrum ofscreening and diagnostic breast imaging services are also available (3). Regular conferences: A multidisci- plinary breast conference, which includes representa- tion from internal medicine as well as all oncology specialists (surgical, medical, and radiation oncology, pathology, and clinical trials), meets weekly to review all cases with ambiguous or inconclusive cytopatholo- gy as well as all newly diagnosed cancer cases to cre- ate comprehensive diagnostic and treatment plans.Special seminars are also organized quarterly to dis- cuss challenges in management of benign breast dis- ease, such as protocols for use of screening MRI among high-risk populations (4). Meetings: Leadership from internal medicine, surgery, and radiology meet monthly with nursing and administrative staff, to review organizational and management issues along with quality metrics. Additional interdisciplinary monthly meetings include IT staff, internal medicine, program coordinator, and patient navigators to review quality indicators and rene reporting systems andclinical protocols. Triage System The Breast Health Program devel- oped a central intake system to triage referrals to either a surgeon or internist based on patient risk of cancer. The aim was to ensure that women most likely to need surgical intervention are initially seen by a breast surgeon (Fig. 1). Triage decisions are made by an experienced practice triage nurse, andAdding Internists to a Breast Health Program 59result in an equal distribution of patient referrals being scheduled with internists and surgeons. We have previously shown that this triage system mini- mizes referral error, decreases time to surgicalappointment for those with a malignancy, and satis- es referring providers (20). A preclinical review includes assessment of potential need for diagnostic imaging or other services at the initial or follow-up visit. Interdisciplinary staff will consult with provid- ers to schedule this additional diagnostic imaging to coincide with the patient visit. Patient Navigation Breast Health Patient Naviga- tors have provided care management services to help our vulnerable patients access needed services withfunding from the Avon Foundation since 2001 (21). Two full-time patient navigators identify women referred to the practice, conduct outreach to identify barriers to care, work with providers to develop an individual action plan to overcome those barriers, and utilize the electronic medical record to track all women until diagnostic resolution. Their daily activi- ties are documented in a log within patient charts in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Patient navi-gators are nonclinical personnel usually with bache- lor or master's level training, who have experience caring for inner-city, low income patients and or are from one of the communities served by the medical center.Tracking Prospective tracking by navigators ensures that patients are followed through completion of all diagnostic workup and treatment as recommended by their provider. Once patients have been referred intoour practice, we utilize the hospital EMR to retrieve detailed patient information, including demographics, appointment scheduling, navigator outreach, visits with providers and diagnostic procedures. This infor- mation is consolidated into one automated data track- ing system, which provides patient navigators with a list of active patients in need of specic services, such as additional imaging (mammograms, MRIs or ultra- sound), pending cytology or pathology. Navigators work directly with the internists to ensure that timely resolution is achieved. Navigator supervisors reviewtracking logs weekly to ensure resolution of outstand- ing cases. This database also provides quality improvement evaluation data to guide our program management (19,22). Services Provided by Internists Internists provide a wide range of services, includ- ing (a) counseling on evidence for additional surveil- lance, breast cancer risk assessment, and discussion ofgenetic testing, fertility planning, and preventive strat- egies, including prophylactic surgery, and chemopre- vention; (b) clinical evaluation of abnormal breast ndings such as nipple discharge or breast masses; and (c) management of symptomatic benign disease,Intake by Triage Nurse Referring Provider Preference If Yes If No Clinical factors - Breast mass - Age > 35 - BIRADS 4/5 - Bloody nipple discharge - New cancer diagnosis Clinical factors - Breast Mass - Age <35 - Second opinion for breast exam in absence of discrete mass (any age) - Breast pain - Non-bloody nipple discharge - Mastitis/Abscess - High risk (family or personal history of cancer - Gynecomastia Surgeons Internists Surgeons InternistsFigure 1. Breast health program triage system.60battaglia et al.including breast pain, cysts, acute and recurrent masti- tisabscess. Internists include Fine Needle Aspiration biopsies (FNAB) and Core biopsies into their clinical competencies for two reasons: (a) to facilitate rapid diagnosis should a cancer be present; and (b) to com- plete diagnostic evaluation on patients not requiring surgical intervention. Training of Internal Medicine Physicians Most internists, including those with a focus on women'shealth, have insufcient training and skills to conduct a comprehensive breast health assessment (23). We developed a training system, which pairs trainees with an experienced internal medicine breast provider in the clinical setting for 4-8 hours weekly over a 3-4 month period to provide consulting in a supervised setting. These trainees, all of whom have previously completed internal medicine residency training, also shadow surgical providers. Trainees review all breast imaging with radiologists to develop skills in correlat- ing clinical ndings with diagnostic imaging. Traineespractice FNAB and core needle biopsies (with the sup- port of pathologists and cytopathologists) and must demonstrate prociency in these procedures before they perform them independently. For the rst year of practice, trainees are paired with each of the practic- ing internists on a rotating basis in an effort to increase exposure to multiple practice styles. EVALUATION METHODS We report on data collected from the EMR for all patients seeking care from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2009. Patient demographics are retrieved from the electronic scheduling system (SDK /C211; Esker Inc., Madison, WI), while all clinical information is retrieved from the medical charts in EMR (General Electric (GE); CentricityEMRTM, https:// www2.gehealthcare.com/portal/site/usen/menuitem.e8b 305b80b84c1b4d6354a1074c84130/?vgnextoid=5bb4 54fbded30210VgnVCM10000024dd1403RCRD&vgnextfmt=default&productid=4bb454fbded30210VgnV CM10000024dd1403). Reason for referral to the breast practice is documented in the EMR by the Tri- age Nurse at the time of intake, along with the refer- ral source. Final diagnosis was determined from pathology and cytology reports, from diagnostic imag- ing if no pathology or cytology was performed, and from ICD-9 billing diagnoses when no additional imaging or pathology was performed. To ensure thatno cancer diagnoses were missed, all patients seen were cross referenced with the Boston Medical Center Cancer registry. Patient satisfaction was continually measured using the institution-wide Press Ganey sur- vey (Press Ganey Associates, South Bend, Indiana), a commercial survey sent to a random subset of all patients with a response rate that represents 20% of the population served. IRB approval was obtained for all data collected. RESULTS Patient Population Patient volume for the Breast Health Program has increased from 651 unique patients in 2001 to 901 unique patients in 2009 as a result of the expansion of internists into the practice. From January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2009, 3,110 patient visits Table 1.

As described in Table 1, the popu- lations served are diverse and reflective of the urban population seeking care at an inner-city safety-net institution. As would be expected from the triage pro- tocol (see Fig. 1), the majority of women seen by internists were under age 65 (95%), and over half between 19 and 39 years of age (63%). A majority of women were of minority race or ethnicity (33% Black, 30% Hispanic, 5% Asian); while 23% werenon-Hispanic White. Thirty-four percent required a language interpreter during their visit, and over half (51%) had publicly funded or no health insurance at the time of their referral. Table 1 also shows the referral network for those patients seen by internists. About 60% of referrals come from a network of over 15 afliated community health centers, and about 30% from practices within the Boston Medical Center, including the emergency department, obstetrics and gynecology, family medi- cine, primary care internal medicine, and geriatrics.The remaining are referred from outside providers, with few self-referrals. The two most frequent reasons for referral triaged to internists are abnormal breast exam (54%) and breast pain (26%), followed by fam- ily history of breast cancer, abnormal imaging, and nipple discharge (Table 1). Services Rendered and Final Diagnoses Table 2 shows that a majority of nal diagnoses were made through clinical evaluation alone (n= 1,760, 73%), without the need for additional diagnostic imaging or tissue sampling. Nine percent(n= 214) received a benign diagnosis with the aid of breast imaging, most commonly from ultrasonography, followed by diagnostic mammography and rarely Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The remaining 19% of nal diagnoses ( n= 463) were made as result of tissue sampling, obtained mainly via percutaneous tissue sam- pling, while only 4% went on to see a breast surgeon for further evaluation. Of those referred to surgeons, the median age was 33 years (range 15-74 years) and the most common reason for referral was an abnormalclinical breast exam (55%), followed by abnormal imaging and patient preference for surgical excision of a benign process. A total of 15 women never returned to complete recommended care after an initial evalua- tion. For many, there was evidence that they transferred care to other institutions. From 2007 to 2009, a total of 15 breast cancers (Table 3) were diagnosed among all the patients ini- tially referred to internists, versus 502 cancers diagnosed by an initial breast surgeon evaluation dur- ing the same time period. Median age of these 15women was 55 years (range 32-76) and most were Non-White ( n= 10). The most common presenting symptom was an abnormal examination ( n= 6), which ranged from asymmetry to a discrete mass. The majority of women ( n= 9) were being followed by internists for long-term breast health care in the setting of either elevated cancer risk, pain, or in the context of an established primary care relationship with the internist, which explains why some were not''triaged'' directly to a surgeon according the existing triage protocol. As a result, most women ( n=9 ) obtained a percutaneous tissue diagnosis prior to Table 2.

The median time from initial referral to cancer diagnosis was 19 days (range 3-69 days). For one outlier, 69 days elapsed from referral to cancer diagnosis; during that time period,there are 15 documented attempts by the patient navigators to schedule for follow-up care, along with evidence of other active comorbid medical conditions. Most women were Stage 0 or 1 at the time of diagno- sis (n= 8), while 5 did present with Stage 2 or 3 dis- ease. Cross referencing with the hospital cancer registry revealed no additional cancer diagnoses on patients seen by internists during this time period. Satisfaction with Care Press Ganey data collected by Boston Medical Cen- ter indicates that over 90% of patients report being satised or very satised with access to care and con- dence in provider. This gure remained constant over the 3 years. Referring provider satisfaction with the program has previously been shown to be high (20). Our surgeons have found this to be a very useful model in that it allows them to take care of patients more likely to be surgical and avoid backing up their practices with non-surgical cases. DISCUSSION: IMPACT OF OUR MODEL We present comprehensive process and outcomes data for a model of care that delivers diagnosticservices by including a group of dedicated internists focused on breast care working collaboratively along- side breast surgeons. Our data demonstrate that appropriately trained internists can provide timely, quality evaluation using a team approach with surgi- cal specialists and an evidence-based triage protocol. Therefore, we believe that this model of care for breast health is worthy of adoption at other sites. While many models of care for management of breast masses state the need for a surgical oncology evaluation,no data support this need (24). To the contrary, several of our ndings support that the use of non-surgical pro- viders may be both reasonable and appropriate. First, we have shown here and in our prior work (20), using an evidence-based triage protocol results in successful risk stratication such that internists are evaluating a population with an inherently low probability of malig- nancy. Furthermore, even among the 3-4% with a can- cer diagnosis, there were no delays in diagnosis that may be attributed to the system and none of the nearly 3,000 women served went on to a breast cancer diagno-sis over the ensuing few years to suggest any missed diagnoses. It is also worth noting that the majority of patients were given a nal diagnosis with only a clinical diagnosis, while only 19% required cytopathologic or tissue sampling, most of which was performed prior to a surgical consultation. With the support of pathologists, Internists are trained to perform these non-invasive pro- cedures. Finally, this model has potential to improve access to breast surgeons by high-risk patients, thus pre-venting delays in surgery. This potential impact is sup- ported by the average time to surgical evaluation at our institution of 2 days. The high rates of Stage 2 and 3 cancers among those diagnosed by internists are reflec- tive of the overall rates of advanced cancer seen among the population of mostly minority, low-income patients served at our institution, and not linked to any delays in access to diagnostic services. The American Society of Breast Disease recently developed a framework of quality indicators related to multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary care (25). Thesequality indicators include the same outcome measures our program monitors, including early diagnosis, decreased time to visit for most at risk, patient satis- faction, and provider satisfaction. The ability of our program to deliver quality indicators recommended by leading authorities is further evidence that it is worthy of replication in other settings. While internists are not traditionally trained or pre- pared to conduct diagnostic breast health evaluation,Table 3.

Our patient population is reflective of the vulner- able patients served at other safety net intuitions who are at high risk for presenting with late-stage disease. Our diverse population presented with unusual mani- festations of common and rare diseases, including dia- betic mastopathy, mammary tuberculosis, breast sarcoidosis, cat scratch disease, abscesses, and recur- rent nonlactating mastitis that often require complex medical management. Having a broad background inpathophysiology and disease management is critical for these rare and or comorbid conditions. Lastly, this group can provide surveillance to high-risk women, for prevention and screening options--areas in which internists are well trained. There are limitations to our evaluation metrics. First, we do not have data prior to implementation of this model to allow for an historical comparison. Also, we do not have cost or cost effectiveness data. Future research should address the nancial implications of similar models, as it is likely that improving timelyaccess for all patients, especially those with cancer, along with the provision of comprehensive services in one visit with an internist, is likely to have nancial benets to the health care system. In summary, a model of specically training inter- nists to provide comprehensive breast health services within a multidisciplinary breast cancer center is a novel and effective model that results in high-quality care that is worthy of adoption when serving similarvulnerable populations. More clinical breast health training programs are needed for non-surgical providers to replicate this type of multidisciplinary program.

Battaglia, MD, MPH;Lois McCloskey, Sarah Edward Bernstein, MD; Ariel Childs, MPH; Hannah Jong, MPH; Kelly Walker, MPH; Judith Bernstein, PhD, RNC Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating chronic disease navigation using lay health care workers trained in motivational interviewing (MI) intoan existing mammography navigation program. Primary-care patient navigators implemented MI-based telephone conversations around mammography, smoking, depression, and obesity. Weconducted a small-scale demonstration, using mixed methods to assess patient outcomes andprovider satisfaction. One hundred nine patients participated. Ninety-four percent scheduled and 73% completed a mammography appointment. Seventy-one percent agreed to schedule a primary care appointment and 54% completed that appointment. Patients and providers respondedpositively. Incorporating telephone-based chronic disease navigation supported by MI into existingdisease-specic navigation is efcacious and acceptable to those enrolled.

Battaglia, MD, MPH, Women's Health Unit, Section of General Internal Medicine, Evans Department of Medicine and Women'sHealth Interdisciplinary Research Center, BostonIN RESPONSE TO the fragmented and com- plex nature of cancer care, patient naviga- tion was designed to help vulnerable patients overcome barriers to accessing cancer careservices through the support of a lay health care worker connected to the clinical team (Dohan & Schrag, 2005; Freeman et al., 1995).In 2007, a study conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administration iden- tied \"navigator\" as one of the 5 prevailingmodels for community health work and 18% of employers reported patient navigation as a specic strategy they use to conduct commu-nity health work (Health Resources and Ser- vices Administration, 2007).

Successful navigation programs traditionally target a specic disease such as breast cancer (Battaglia et al., 2007; Freemanet al., 1995) without taking into account com- peting medical comorbidities, patient health priorities, or patient preferences. The ma-jority of programs target single-site cancers (Bastani et al., 2010; Battaglia et al., 2007; Burhansstipanov et 2010; Chen et al.,2008; Ell et al., 2007; Percac-Lima et al., 2009) in specialty practice settings, while few target multiple cancer sites in a primary care setting (Dietrich et al., 2006; Ford et al., 2006; Guadagnolo et al., 2010). More the patient-centered med- ical home (PCMH or \"medical home\") is emerging as a promising health care deliv-ery model that will help transform the US health care system to improve quality of care delivered and reduce costs (Stange et al.,2010). The principles of the medical home (American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, AmericanCollege of Physicians, American Osteopathic Association, 2007) build on the primary care model by incorporating the evidence-basedchronic care model along with the use of of- ce systems and health information technol- ogy (Scholle et al., 2010). This model of careis also patient-centered with an emphasis on ensuring that patients get the care they need where and when they want it. Patient naviga- tion, as a care coordination process, ts well within many of the domains of the medicalhome, including care coordination, access to care, communication, and tracking and reg- istry. Researchers are beginning to assess thefeasibility and acceptability of chronic disease and primary care navigation (Ferrante et al., 2010; Lubetkin et al., 2010). However, littleis known about the feasibility of expanding the role of disease-specic navigation to tar- get chronic disease navigation. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a form of patient-centered counseling directly tailored to enhance readiness to change behavior. Itwas originally developed for use by psycholo- gists in the context of substance abuse treat- ment (Bernstein et al., 2005, 2007, 2009a,2009b; Hettema et al., 2005; Kaner et al., 2007; Stein et al., 2009; Whitlock et al.,2004) but has been widely adapted to ad- dress screening and intervention (both pri- mary and secondary preventions) for otherbehaviors that affect health status (Brug et al., 2007; Kressin et al., 2009; Mason, 2009; Ockene et al., 1999). Motivational interview-ing is based on the principle that exploring and resolving ambivalence about taking action is the central motivational task that preparespeople for change. The objective of this study was to eval- uate the feasibility of expanding a primary care breast navigation program to address ad- ditional medical comorbidities and allow pa-tients to set their own priorities for action through the use of brief motivational inter- view skills (B-MI). We hypothesize that incor-porating multiple chronic disease screenings into navigation outreach is feasible and pa- tients will respond positively. We believe thatincorporating MI, with its emphasis on patient choice, into the current navigator model will facilitate agenda-setting and behavior change. METHODS This feasibility study (Bowen et al., 2009) was designed as a clinical quality improve-ment initiative and thus did not have a continuous control group. We conducted a small-scale demonstration study, using mixedmethods to determine the (1) practicality (ability to carry out the intervention), (2) limited efcacy (intended effects on clinical care), and (3) acceptability (satisfaction, in- tent to use) of telephone-based chronic dis-ease navigation in an urban safety net primary care practice. All participants received the B-MI intervention March-July 2010, and weused electronic medical record (EMR) chart abstraction, navigator logs, and qualitative in- terviews, respectively, to measure outcomes.The Boston Medical Center institutional re- view board approved this study. Theoretical framework Brief motivational interview is an adap- tation of standard motivational techniques to the time pressures of the clinical visit Copyright \u00a9 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.LWW/JACM JAC200146 December 8, 2011 1:26 40 J OURNAL OF AMBULATORY CAREMANAGEMENT /JANUARY -MARCH 2012 and delivery by both clinicians and outreach workers. Motivational interviewing teacheshealth care providers to follow a specic algo- rithm for a conversation about decreasing risk factors for disease, enhancing patients' andproviders' self-efcacy for behavioral change (Ockene et al., 1996), and facilitating refer- ral for mental health and other treatment ifindicated (Bernstein et al., 2005). The litera- ture (Apodaca & Longabaugh, 2009) suggests that effect on outcomes is directly related tothe amount of change talk produced during such conversations. When individuals believe that they will be successful (effective) at mak- ing desired changes in their behavior, it is more likely that they will actually be able todo so (Bandura, 1977). The role of the pa- tient navigator in this study of chronic disease navigation is to use B-MI skills via telephonecontact to foster self-efcacy, thus increas- ing the probability of keeping a mammogram appointment and enhance the likelihood ofmaking effective contact with a primary care physician to discuss other prevention issues such as weight management, depression risk,and smoking. The importance of patients' participation in their own medical care and decision mak-ing is well documented, particularly for those with chronic illness (Greeneld et al., 1985, 1988; Kaplan et al., 1989). A key element in aparticipatory style of patient care is soliciting the patient's priorities and preferences during the medical visit (Kaplan et al., 1995; Marvel et al., 1999). Thus, our MI intervention also in- cluded prompts for patients to identify theirpriorities and set the agenda for their future primary care visit. Study population This study was conducted in Boston at an urban safety net hospital serving low-income, racial/ethnic minority residents. Female pa-tients of the internal medicine practice aged 51-70 years with a documented primary care visit in the past 24 months were eligible if theyhad at least 1 prior mammogram and more than 18 months had elapsed since their most recent documented mammogram. Because oflimited resources, non-English speakers were excluded. In addition, patients were excludedif their primary care provider deemed them ineligible on the basis of the presence ofcomorbidities that impaired their ability to participate, including a current diagnosis of breast cancer or travel out of the country dur-ing the study period. Navigator training Five experienced primary care-based breast health patient navigators participatedin this study. In addition to clinical navigation experience, each completed certication for the core competencies of a community healthcare worker offered by a regional education center. Each completed an intensive 2-week training workshop led by the Brief Negotiated Interview-Active Referral to Treatment In- stitute (BNI-ART) (http://www.ed.bmc.org/sbirt/). The training covered basic clinical in- formation about obesity/weight management, smoking cessation, and depression; how toscreen patients for weight, smoking, and de- pression; and how to apply motivational inter- vention techniques to screenings. Navigatorsengaged in role-playing and other experiential learning activities. A booster training was held 1 month after study enrollment began. Intervention protocol Navigators contacted eligible patients by phone. Multiple attempts to contact pa- tients were made at varying times and daysof the week. If contact was not made af- ter 6 attempts, the patient was deemed \"unreachable.\" If contact was made, verbal consent to participate was obtained. The navigator then conducted the B-MI interven-tion. The conversation included discussions on smoking status, depression, obesity, and participant health priorities, as well as mam-mography screening. Participants were asked whether weight was a concern for them and whether they were currently a smoker andwere screened for depression using the Pa- tient Health Questionnaire-2 (Kroenke et al., 2003; Lowe et al., 2005). Navigators alsoasked participants to list their top health pri- orities. Navigators worked with each partici- pant to schedule mammography and primarycare appointments and recorded the reason if participants were unwilling to schedule Copyright \u00a9 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Navigators offered to accom- pany participants to appointments. Remindercalls were made by navigators prior to sched- uled appointments to discuss any barriers to attendance and to work with participants toovercome those barriers. Data sources and data collection Practicality data elements were measured using navigator logs. Navigators documentedtheir activities, including telephone attempts and participant responses on encounter log forms. Efcacy data and participant characteris- tics were collected from manual chart ab-straction using the EMRs. Research assistants followed a standard operating procedure to obtain participant sociodemographic infor-m a t i o n ,b o d ym a s si n d e x ,c u r r e n ts m o k i n g status, and mammogram and primary care appointment information. Clinical data wereabstracted up to 30 days after scheduled appointment dates for each participant. Acceptability data were collected using semistructured qualitative one-on-one inter- views with key informants: a subset of par- ticipants (n =11), all navigators (n =5), and a subset of primary care providers (n =5). Participants with a scheduled primary care appointment were eligible for the qualitativeportion of this study, were consented, and then contacted by a research assistant by tele- phone to conduct the interviews. These in- terviews included a 2-part phone call\u2014the rst after the initial call with the navigatorand the second after the scheduled primary care appointment. Participants were asked about their experiences and the nature of theconversation with the navigator. Likert scales (range 1-5, 5 =most helpful) were incorpo- rated to assess the participant's satisfactionwith components of navigation. The navigator satisfaction interviews were conducted in person and assessed their satis-faction as a motivational interviewer and with providing navigation for other health issues in addition to the usual breast cancer screen-ing. Provider interviews were administered via telephone and assessed the physicians' satisfaction with the role that the navigatorhad in preparing their patients for the primary care visit. All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. The research team read the transcripts multiple times and, using an it-erative process, developed a coding scheme to reflect the key concepts raised in the narratives. The team coded each transcriptindependently, using HyperRESEARCH soft- ware (ResearchWare, Inc, Randolph, Mas- sachusetts). The team then met to discuss thecoded narratives and the major themes and subthemes that emerged. Measures The following chronic disease screenings were dened as positive: 1. Overweight/obese =ab o d ym a s si n d e x 25 recorded in the EMR. 2. Current smoker =a positive response to the navigator asking, \"Do you smoke?\" 3. Depression =score of 3 or more on the navigator administered Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (range: 0-6). Participant-identied health priorities were elicited by the navigator. Practicality outcome measures include (1) eligibility rate of female primary care pa- tients, (2) rate of eligible patients success- fully reached by telephone outreach, and (3)rate of consent among those reached. Primary efcacy outcome measures include (1) com- pletion of a mammography appointment and(2) completion of a primary care appoint- ment. Completion was dened as attending an appointment within 30 days of the origi-nal appointment scheduled by the navigator. Acceptability outcome measures include (1) participant and provider satisfaction, (2) par-ticipant willingness to have navigators accom- pany them to appointments, and (3) partici- pant willingness to speak with primary care provider about their health priorities. Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were performed using SAS version 9.1. Basic frequencies provided practicality and efcacy outcomes. Chi-squareand ttests were used to examine associations between enrollment status and sociodemo- graphic characteristics. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

An electronic query of the EMR generated a list of 671 active female general internal medicinepatients aged 51 to 70 years whose last docu- mented mammogram was 18 or more months prior. These patient charts were reviewed byresearch staff for enrollment eligibility. Of 671 patients, only 270 (40%) were considered eli- gible. The most common reason for ineligibil-ity was non-English language (135/401, 39%), while the remainder did not meet the prespec- ied eligibility criteria, such as age or time since last mammogram. Among those eligible for enrollment, almost a third (87/270, 32%)could not be reached via telephone outreach. When eligible patients were reached, the ma- jority (109/270, 68%) agreed to participate. The Table shows the sociodemographic characteristics of the eligible cohort reached via telephone. More than half of all partici-pants were blacks, on public health insurance, and most had a documented visit with their primary care doctor within the previous 12months. Rates of overweight/obese were sub- stantial. Compared with those who declined to participate, those enrolled into the studywere younger, more likely to be on public in- surance, more likely to be current smokers, and less likely to have had a primary care visitin the past year.The Table also shows prevalence of chronic disease for the enrolled group. The mostprevalent condition was overweight/obesity (25% and 55%, respectively), and about one- third of participants screened positive forboth smoking and/or depression. Overall, 93% of participants screened positive for one of the three chronic disease states; 39% hadmore than 1 condition (33% had 2 conditions, and 6% had all 3 conditions). Overall, 67% of participants reported per- sonal health priorities when asked. The majority of these participants (85%) re- ported health priorities that were congru- ent with the screening program priorities (36% weight/obesity, 10% depression, and9% smoking). Weight was the most com- mon patient-reported health priority. Dia- betes (4%) was the most common patient-reported disease-specic health priority that was not included as a program priority. Symp- toms such as pain or discomfort accountedfor 13% of reported health priorities. Most (83%) stated that they would be willing to talk to their primary care providers about theirhealth priorities. Figure 2 shows the clinical efcacy of the pilot intervention. Overall, 93% of partici-pants scheduled a mammogram appointment as a result of a navigator encounter, and af- ter 30 days, 73% completed their mammo-gram test. Meanwhile, 71% of participants Figure 1. Study enrollment process: Practicality outcomes. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

When asked what they most liked about the conversation withthe navigator, participants most frequently noted the opportunity to speak with some- one about their health and offering to sched-ule their appointments, especially concurrent appointments. Several also noted the value of sharing positive examples of their own self-care (eg, weight loss or quitting smoking). The majority of participants had nothing nega- tive to say about the phone call, although onecalled it \"excessive\" and one said she would rather speak to someone face to face than over the phone. Participants generally reported feeling very comfortable with and respected by the naviga-tor (eg, \"treated like a human being\"). Several noted the importance of being heard by some- one other than their doctor. One woman ex-pressed it this way: \"Navigators can help peo- ple who are in a shell\u2014maybe they'll come out to her and speak to her about certainthings. So I think it was a good idea.\" Another woman said that it would be good for some participants \"to know that someone feels thatthey're special enough to come out and speak to them.\" On average, all of the conversations about specic topics (smoking, depression, and weight) were rated above a helpfulness of 4.0, while those about smoking and receiving a mammogram were rated most favorably. All participants were favorable to the idea of com-bining the mammogram check-in with talk about other health issues. Some said that it gave them a chance to consider health-relatedissues that are important but that they had forgotten to pay attention to. Overall, partici- pants reported liking the \"holistic approach,\"saying that it was important to focus on the \"mind and body\" and \"the whole picture.\" The majority of participants reported that the priority list was helpful in preparation for the primary care visit. One participant stated, \"I have a lot of different health issues, and itwas very helpful for me to stop and think,well, which of those is the most important t om e ?Y o uk n o w ,i tj u s tk i n do fh e l p sm eevaluate where I stand.\" Only 2 participants accepted the naviga- tor's offer to accompany her to the primarycare visit. Another stated that introducing the navigator into the patient-provider rela- tionship might risk conflicting the already-established rapport: \"I don't want you to do that because [my provider has] been trying to get me to see a doctor. And I don't want herto think that I'm asking you and overstepping her.\" Participants uniformly spoke positively about reminder calls provided by the naviga- tor before both the mammography and pri-mary care appointments. Several mentioned that the reminder was particularly useful be- cause they tend to forget about scheduled ap-pointments. One said, \"I think the reminder was good because I don't like tests and stuff. Her reminding me\u2014and she made the ap-pointment, so that was the same day. So I got everything done. Otherwise, I probably would have said, forget it!\" During the follow-up call, the majority of respondents mentioned that the list of health priorities elicited by the patient herself wasuseful during the clinical visit with the pri- mary care provider. In regard to the helpful- ness of the priority list, 1 woman commented,\"It helped me to stay on focus and to be able to do the things and tell the things that\u2014you know because when you go to the doctor's of- ce you go in there and you say, 'Yup, Yup,' [ . . . ]. Sometimes I do that and really don'tsay anything.\" Another remarked, \"I think it helped me prioritize and pick the things that were most important in terms of talking to thedoctor.\" Acceptability outcomes: The navigator perspective When compared with previous patient nav- igation approaches, the navigators felt that theincorporation of B-MI and chronic disease cre- ated a more personalized experience, which fostered open and honest conversations anda greater sense of patient empowerment. On a scale of 1 to 5, all of the navigators rated Copyright \u00a9 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.LWW/JACM JAC200146 December 8, 2011 1:26 Feasibility of Chronic Disease Patient Navigation 45 their satisfaction with bundled patient naviga- tion as 3 or higher. Navigators noted that theB-MI intervention gave them a better sense of what each patient needed, and provided them with the resources to address each pa-tient's distinct health priorities. One navigator remarked, \"When I reiterate or when I give them a summary or give them a feedback ofwhat they've said, they seem to expand more. And I could feel them, like they take charge o fi t .Al i g h tb u l bh i t st h e m . \" Despite the numerous benets of enhanced patient navigation, the navigators also identi- ed challenges with the new approach. First, the navigators found that the intervention was unnecessarily excessive for some patients, inwhich case, the patients just wanted to sched- ule their appointments and did not want to engage in the B-MI intervention. They notedthat the intervention proved to be less useful for the unanticipated high number of patients who had long-standing, positive relationshipswith their providers, and who felt condent voicing their own health concerns. The navi- gators uniformly found the depression screen-ing to be an inappropriate screening tool to conduct over the phone with this patient pop- ulation. They reported that it was often mis-understood or misinterpreted by patients, and these confusions and the stigma attached to depression resulted in some patients beingless engaged and open after the depression screening took place. The navigators also confronted systemic and logistic challenges. Above all, they felt that the commitment involved in this pilotproject was too much to tack onto their day- to-day professional responsibilities already in place. They were frustrated by scheduling dif-culties and a lack of patient/provider aware- ness of patient navigation. They recommend that this type of navigation be implementedwithin an environment that has a stronger foundation to support enhanced patient navi- gation. Acceptability outcomes: The provider perspective Generally speaking, the providers were sat- ised with the enhanced patient navigation.Unfortunately, because of the size of their case load and the lapse of time between thepatient visits and their interview, it was dif- cult for the providers to remember specic aspects of the patient navigation that were rel-evant to the patient visit. The providers were most positive about the navigators' role in eliciting the patient's health priorities. Threeof the 4 providers interviewed agreed that many patients come to their visit and have a hard time prioritizing their health needs be-cause they \"tend to come in with a bunch of stuff.\" In the future, the providers recom- mended that patient navigation be used as a broad-based model, which can be tailored to address patients' specic psychosocial needs.The providers also felt that patient navigation could be a useful tool to support patients in complying with visits and routine health caremaintenance. DISCUSSION The ndings from this chronic disease nav- igation demonstration project targeting vul- nerable participants conrm the feasibility of several aspects of a telephone-based commu-nity health worker intervention. The high prevalence of chronic disease in this popu- lation in need of a single-site cancer screen-ing (ie, mammography) supports the need to adopt a more patient-centered approach like the one here. We found that almost all participants reached by telephone were willing to engage in the process of naviga-tion and this translated into effective deliv- ery of preventive health services for a pop- ulation at risk for poor outcomes. However,the practicality of telephone outreach was limited because of language barriers and in- ability to reach patients despite multiple at-tempts. Patients were generally acceptable of telephone navigation; however, they did not readily accept face-to-face navigation activi-ties. Navigators struggled with incorporating depression screening. These ndings are critical to the planning process for carecoordination programs that target similar populations. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

In the context of conversations that were geared rst to mammogram appointments, naviga-tors were able to screen for overweight and smoking, both risk factors for breast cancer. Screening for depression proved more dif-cult, possibly related to the sensitivity of the topic and the awkwardness of the screening tool, particularly when administered by tele-phone. Navigators found it uncomfortable to ask what they perceived as very personal ques- tions in this context. While some participantsdid not mind talking about depression, others appeared to be confused about what naviga- tors were actually asking. The practicality of this navigation program was limited, mainly on the basis of its reliance on telephone outreach. Navigators were able to reach only 68% of eligible patients by tele- phone, which is similar to telephone-basedcommunity health worker interventions tar- geting similar populations (Lasser et al., 2009; Myers et al., 2008; Percac-Lima et al., 2009;Weber & Reilly, 1997). Studies that were able to reach a larger percentage of patients fre- quently utilized additional recruitment strate-gies such as in-person recruitment and incen- tives for participation (Dietrich et al., 2006; Jandorf et al., 2005; Parker et al., 2007).We recommend that future studies consider additional recruitment strategies to compen- sate for the difculties inherent in telephone-based outreach. Efcacy Once navigators engaged patients, using B- MI skills, the clinical outcomes were positive and comparable with other navigation stud- ies. This study was conducted with a cohort ofwomen who had not received a mammogram in 18 to 24 months and were thus nonadher-ent with screening. The ability of the interven- tion to result in 73% of nonadherent partici-pants completing mammograms is impressive when compared with other intervention stud- ies targeting populations overdue for screen-ing. In a study by Weber and Reilly (1997), 41% of participants overdue for mammograms completed a mammogram in the 10-monthintervention period. A study by Burhanssti- panov et al. achieved a 55% mammogram com- pletion rate among women who had not beenscreened within 18 months (Burhansstipanov et al., 2010), and in a study by Fernandez et al., 41% of women who had not had a mam- mogram in 12 months completed a screen- ing within the 6-month follow-up period(Fernandez et al., 2009). However, because of the lack of a direct comparison group, gen- eralizability of efcacy data is limited. The full effect of the intervention may also have been limited by the failure of patient health priorities reaching the intended target,the primary care provider. The intervention was intended to prepare participants for their upcoming primary care visit, by discussingpriority health concerns in advance. Naviga- tors elicited from patients their list of prior- ity health concerns, a list that was to serveas a springboard for conversation with their provider. While participants reported bene- ts from generating the list, it did not, in theend, arrive at the providers' ofces/records as planned or (be perceived to) exert an im- pact on the visit. It is likely that this failure was related to the low level of awareness among providers about the intervention, andthe long-time lag between the navigation con- versation and the primary care visit, and be- tween the primary care visit and the follow-upinterview. Acceptability Once enrolled, patients talked freely about their health worries and strategies for self-care and reported high satisfaction with the con-versation. The fact that they did not readily accept face-to-face navigation services when offered was interesting and may well be re-lated to the nding that the relationships be- tween primary care providers and patients in Copyright \u00a9 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Thus, the presence of a naviga-tor and even the added information from a patient navigator may not be as critical as it might be in settings where such continuityand strength in provider-patient relationships are not the norm. In fact, providers who par- ticipated in follow-up interviews indicated lit-tle knowledge that the patient navigation and screening had or had not occurred. When asked about it hypothetically, they were mostlikely to comment positively on the value of a preset patient-generated priority list, particu- larly for patients with complex psychosocial needs. Key lessons learned and recommendations for future telephone-based navigation in this setting include the following: rFind ways to engage and inform providers early on and in more depth about the in- tervention and its intent to better prepare patients and providers for their primarycare visit. rExpand hours in which the intervention can be conducted to increase the likeli-hood of reaching eligible individuals with fewer phone calls. rSend the patient's priority list to the provider in a clear and recognized way (through the patient, through the naviga- tor, or through the EMR). The priority listalso could be effectively revisited when the navigator calls back to schedule or reschedule visits. rExclude depression screening in this con- text. rMake explicit the \"same day mammog- raphy/primary care visit\" goal for each patient.LIMITATIONS Because of the focus on quality improve- ment and feasibility, we did not include a di- rect comparison group in this demonstrationproject. While not ideal, this design is con- sistent with other feasibility studies that aim to determine whether an intervention shouldbe recommended for efcacy testing (Bowen et al., 2009) and the efcacy demonstrated here is consistent with other navigation eval-uation literature. This study was also limited by the restricted inclusion criteria to English speakers only, which is not fully representa- tive of the diverse patient population served at this safety net institution. This limitationunderscores the reality of providing culturally appropriate care in resource poor settings and calls for future planning that prioritizes multi-lingual health workers. CONCLUSION As patient navigation becomes a more prevalent form of community health work, inthe era of patient-centered health care reform it is crucial to expand navigation beyond the traditional disease-specic cancer setting andprovide navigators with tools to effectively ad- dress multiple chronic conditions. This study supports the feasibility of chronic disease pa-tient navigation in primary care with some key lessons for program planning and future efcacy testing. This type of feasibility data is critical to incorporating community health workers into the emerging patient-centeredmedical home model to ensure the deliv- ery of quality care to the most vulnerable populations.

Tracey A.

This work was supported by Cooperative Agreement Number 5U48 DP001922-02 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and also supported by the Boston University-Clinical Translational Sciences Institute BU-BRIDGE (NIH# UL1RR025771). Most of the 2 million Americans living in public housing fall below the federal poverty level and face significant social, economic, and physical stressors that negatively impact their health.1 This is dem\u00ad onstrated by the disproportionately high burden of chronic health problems among public housing residents nationwide, including high rates of asthma, cancer, oral health issues, obe\u00adAbstract Background: Despite close proximity to community health centers, public housing residents are at increased risk of uncontrolled chronic disease, in part because of under\u00adutilization of routine health care. Objectives: To assist in program planning, the Partners in Health and Housing Prevention Research Center (PHH \u00ad PRC) used the Community Readiness Model to compare readiness of public housing developments and community health centers to address community \u00adidentified health priori\u00ad ties. The model assumes that program success to affect change depends on matching the community's level of readi\u00ad ness to address the issue. Methods: Key respondent interviews were conducted across 15 communities: Eight housing developments and seven health centers. Interviews were scored across six dimensions on an anchored, 9 \u00adpoint scale and averaged to provide a composite readiness score. Higher scores indicate increasing levels of readiness. Interview transcripts were reviewed for consistent themes.Results: Health centers scored significantly higher (mean, 5.88) than housing developments (mean, 3.33), corresponding with the Preparation stage of readiness compared with the Vague Awareness stage, respectively. Both scored highest in Existing Programs and Resources and lowest in Knowledge of Efforts. Qualitative analysis revealed a lack of existing partnerships between housing developments and health centers as well as significant social barriers preventing housing residents from engaging in care. Conclusion: We found a mismatch in readiness to address community health priorities. Although health centers have programs to address health issues, community awareness of programs is limited and barriers to engaging in care persist. The model provided a useful tool for engaging communities into shared program planning. Keywords Community \u00adbased participatory research, community health partnerships, urban health, urban health services, health disparities, health promotion, health outcomes sity, hypertension, and diabetes. As a result, public housing residents are more likely than the general population to suffer early morbidity and mortality.1\u00ad5 In Boston, Massachusetts, nearly 10% of residents live in public housing or receive rental assistance.6 Research has shown that these public housing residents are over three times more likely to report fair or poor health status compared with other Boston residents; 240 Progress in Community Health Partnerships: Research, Education, and Action Fall 2012 vol 6.3they are more likely to have ever been diagnosed with high cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes; and report higher cur\u00ad rent rates of asthma, obesity, smoking, depressive tendencies, disability, and insufficient physical activity.7 These ongoing health disparities support the need for innovative interven\u00ad tions targeting this vulnerable population. Public housing residents live in closed multigenerational communities in close physical and social proximity. This creates opportunity for proactive community \u00adbased interventions that aim to address problems in the context of community strengths while respecting cultural diversity.8\u00ad10 Engagement of the community is critical to translating scientific advances in healthcare to improved health status, yet numerous barriers exist for vulnerable populations to participate in scientific inquiry, including lack of access and opportunity.11\u00ad13 These challenges limit our understanding of the causes of health disparities and of effective interventions to reduce these disparities among Boston's public housing residents. A community \u00ad based participatory research approach is one way to ensure participation of this population in intervention planning. The PHH \u00ad PRC was established in Boston in 2001 as 1 of 33 Prevention Research Centers nationwide, funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to create community-academic partnerships aimed at reducing the burden of disease and promoting health among at \u00ad risk populations. The PHH \u00adPRC is the only such collaboration that focuses exclusively on public housing, engaging residents in activities and research designed to improve their health and well \u00adb eing and thus reduce health disparities.14 The collaboration includes four equal partners: Boston University School of Public Health, Boston Public Health Commission, Boston Housing Authority, and the Community Committee for Health Promotion, representing the residents of Boston Housing Authority's family housing developments. Prior work by the PHH \u00adPRC found that 65% of residents were found to have evidence of at least one life \u00adt hreatening chronic illness.15 When followed for 3 months after their screening, only 15% of those with chronic disease had evidence of a follow \u00adup medical appointment,15 despite close proximity to numerous federally qualified health centers and academic medical centers in Boston. This finding calls for collabor ative approaches between the community and local clinical care sites. Table 1. Community Readiness Model Stages18-21 Stage Description Goal 1. No awareness Issue is not generally recognized by the community or leaders as a problem. Raise awareness of the issue. 2. Denial/resistance At least some community members recognize that it is a concern, but there is little recognition that it might be occurring locally.Raise awareness that the issue exists in this community. 3. Vague awareness Most feel that there is a local concern, but there is no immediate motivation to do anything about it.Raise awareness that the community can do something. 4. Preplanning There is clear recognition that something must be done, and there may even be a group addressing it. However, efforts are not focused or detailed.Raise awareness with concrete ideas to combat condition. 5. Preparation Active leaders begin planning in earnest. Community offers modest support of efforts. Gather existing information with which to plan strategies. 6. Initiation Enough information is available to justify efforts. Activities are underway. Provide community-specific information. 7. Stabilization Activities are supported by administrators or community decision makers. Staff are trained and experienced.Stabilize efforts and programs. 8. Confirmation/expansion Efforts are in place. Community members feel comfortable using services, and they support expansions. Local data are regularly obtained. Expand and enhance services. 9. High level of community ownershipDetailed and sophisticated knowledge exists about prevalence, causes, and consequences. Effective evaluation guides new directions. Model is applied to other issues. Maintain momentum and continue growth. 241 Battaglia et al. Connecting Boston's Public Housing Developments to Community Health Centers As preliminary research for interventions that link public housing residents with primary care services, we turned to the Community Readiness Model to assess the level of readiness of the \"community\" to address a community \u00adidentified health priority. The model, developed by the Tri \u00adEthnic Center for Prevention Research at Colorado State University, is a widely used model for community change16 that integrates a community's culture, resources, and level of readiness to guide the complex process of community change. The underlying assumption of the model is that overall success of programs to affect change depends on matching the program with a community's level of readiness to address the chosen issue.17 Community readiness theory combines principles of individual psychological readiness for change (trans \u00adtheoretical model) with the principles of community development to provide a framework for implementing changes in community health services, 18,19 then offers practical tools to design, implement, and evaluate programs in community settings.17 The model defines nine stages of community readiness ranging from no awareness of the problem to a high level of community ownership and action (Table 1). Each stage is characterized by a set of criteria and accompanied by a set of specific goals that facilitate advancing the level or stage of readiness. Originally designed to target substance abuse and drug prevention by the Tri \u00adEthnic Center,17,19 the model has since emerged as a tool in other areas,20 including obesity,21,22 HIV,23 and clinical trial enrollment.24 The aim of this study was to understand the level of readiness for each community partner (housing developments and health centers) to engage in health promotion planning, as a preliminary step toward successful implementation of programs that would engage residents into clinical care. We target both public housing developments and community health centers as \"communities\" of interest. The aims of this research were to (1) compare the readiness of housing developments versus community health centers to address a chosen health priority, and (2) identify community \u00ad specific barriers relevant to bringing residents of public housing developments into primary care services within the community health centers.

Key respondent interviews at each community site were conducted between May and October 2010. The Boston Univer sity Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved this study. study sites For this project, we define a \"community\" as a group that shares a common residence or clinical care site, as defined by a discrete public housing development or community health center. Rather than a geographic area or cultural group, we view a public housing development or community health center as a distinct community with its own identity.25 We included health centers and housing developments within the same geographic area as discrete communities because they have independent governing structures, health priorities, and ways of addressing those priorities. There are a total of 26 family public housing developments throughout Boston that provide quality, public, and affordable housing for low \u00ad and moderate \u00adincome individuals and families from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. In 2009, 11% of Boston Public Housing Residents were White, 32% were Black, 47% were Hispanic, and 10% \"other\" racial/ethnic groups. The average household income for these residents is less than $14,000 per year.26 Limited resources required the PHH \u00adPRC Steering Committee to identify eight family housing developments to participate. Criteria for selection included high burden of chronic disease, size of development, racial/ethnic variability, and geographic variability. The Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute at Boston University, BU BRIDGE, provided financial support for inclusion of seven of their 15 primary \u00adaffiliate federally qualified health centers in the assessment. These community \u00ad based, outpatient health, and multi \u00ad service centers located throughout Boston's neighborhoods provide comprehensive care to Boston's most vulnerable populations. In 2007, these centers provided care to nearly 200,000 individual patients (23% White, 35% Black, 19% Hispanic, 4% Asian/Pacific Islander) and nearly 80% living below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level.27 We chose health centers in close proximity to housing developments to compare readiness of institutions working within the same geographic area, and thus serving similar populations. The main criterion for selection of the 7 health centers was geographic proximity to the housing developments (Figure 1). Together, the eight housing developments and seven health centers comprised the 15 communities included in this assessment. health Priority Because readiness assessment is issue \u00adspecific and we wanted to ensure community engagement in the research process, the research team asked leadership from each of the 15 communities to choose one priority health topic for the assessment. Housing developments were represented collectively by the PHH \u00ad PRC partners who utilized data from their annual resident survey to identify multiple chronic diseases of concern, including obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, and smoking. PHH \u00ad PRC partners agreed to combine these chronic diseases into the broad category of cardiovascular disease or \"heart health\" for their assessments. Health center leadership, which included medical and administrative staff from each of the seven participating sites, was asked to identify the health priority for their individual health center. Priorities differed across health centers, though most also related to \"heart health\"; three chose obesity, one childhood obesity, one hypertension, one asthma, and one substance abuse. study subjects Readiness methodology requires four to six key respondent interviews per community. Key respondents were identified by leadership from their community, The Community Committee for Health Promotion for housing developments and medical directors or executive directors of the health center. Criteria for key respondents included adult community members knowledgeable about ongoing efforts around the chosen health priority and diversity across racial/ethnic groups representative of the larger community. Interview Guide A standardized, open \u00adended interview guide was adapted to measure the six dimensions of readiness: (1) Community efforts: To what extent are there efforts, programs, and policies 243 Battaglia et al. Connecting Boston's Public Housing Developments to Community Health Centers that address the issue? (2) Community knowledge of efforts: To what extent do community members know about local efforts and their effectiveness? Are the efforts accessible to all segments of the community? (3) Leadership: To what extent are appointed leaders and influential community members supportive of the issue? (4) Community climate: What is the prevailing attitude in the community toward the issue? (5) Community knowledge of the issue: To what extent do community members know about the causes of the problem, consequences, and how it impacts the community? and (6) Resources related to the issue: To what extent are local resources (people, time, money) available to support the efforts? PHH \u00adPRC partners contributed to the modification of an existing interview guide to target the issues identified by each community, addressed language and literacy concerns, and added additional questions that targeted partnerships between housing developments and health centers. Self \u00adreported socio\u00ad demographic variables including gender, age, race/ethnicity, and role in community were included along with 40 open \u00adended readi ness questions. Interview guides were piloted in March 2010 with two housing development residents and one health center staff and modified accordingly. (For a copy of the interview guide see the on \u00adline appendix http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/progress_ in_community_health_partnerships_research_educaton_and_ action/v006/6.3.battaglia02_supp01.pdf) data Collection After obtaining written informed consent, four to six in\u00adper son interviews were conducted at each of the 15 commu\u00ad nities by two authors (SM, SGB), each of whom completed in\u00adperson training by Tri \u00adEthnic Center staff. Each one \u00adon\u00ad one interview lasted between 45 and 75 minutes, was audio \u00ad taped, and sent via a secure, password \u00adprotected website to the Tri Ethnic Center for transcription and primary analysis. Community Readiness score Using a previously validated scoring system,17,18 experi enced Tri\u00adEthnic Center staff scored each community across six the dimensions of readiness on an anchored 9 \u00adpoint scale, with higher scores indicating higher levels of readiness. Interviews were reviewed and scored independently by two reviewers, who then met to discuss scores that did not match to reach consensus. Each question ties to certain dimensions, scores are given per dimension, not per question. Scores for each dimen sion are averaged to give each community an overall readiness score,16 and by convention are rounded down to determine the stage of readiness. As shown in Table 1, scores range from 1 to 9 corresponding to each stage: (1) No Awareness, (2) Denial/Resistance, (3) Vague Awareness, (4) Preplanning, (5) Preparation, (6) Initiation, (7) Stabilization, (8) Confirmation/ Expansion, and (9) High Level of Community Ownership. Analyses We used descriptive statistics to provide a summary of participant characteristics using SAS version 9.1 (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC). A community readiness score was calculated for each community and an independent t test was used to compare scores between communities. Three members of the research team (SM, TB, SGB) conducted a thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews to systematically organize observations in the data that were not represented in the readiness scale.28 Investigators independently reviewed transcripts to identify reoccurring themes, and then discussed independent findings in a group forum. Reoccurring themes were then grouped into agreed upon broader thematic categories. As demonstrated by previous research utilizing this model, this additional quali ta\u00ad tive analysis serves to enhance quantitative results by fostering a more thorough understanding of the unique factors that contribute to a community's level of readiness.29 Results We interviewed a total of 78 key respondents (43 housing development residents and 36 health center staff). More than half (73%) were female (Table 2). Key respondents from the health centers were majority White (67%), 17% Black, and 14% Asian/Pacific Islander. Conversely, housing development respondents were largely (86%) racial/ethnic minorities: 58% Black, 28% Hispanic, and 9% American Indian/Alaska Native. Overall, health center key respondents were younger than housing development residents; however, all adult age groups were well \u00adrepresented in both community settings. By study design, key respondents included management, leadership, lay, and outside members affiliated with the community. Community Readiness scores Overall, community readiness scores were significantly higher for health centers than housing developments (mean, 244 Progress in Community Health Partnerships: Research, Education, and Action Fall 2012 vol 6.35.8 vs. 3.33, respectively; p < .0001). Table 3 also demonstrates that there was little variability in scores across the 2 types of community settings, such that health center scores ranged from 4.98 to 7.48 (SD 0.91), while housing development scores ranged from 2.58 to 4.24 (SD 0.65). A score of 5 at the health centers indicates the Preparation Stage, meaning that active community leaders have begun planning in earnest, but the community itself (the health center) offers modest support of these efforts. According to the Community Readiness Model guide, to advance health promotion around the priority issue, the goal for these communities is to continue to gather pertinent information and work with key leaders and influential community members to introduce information about the issue and ongoing efforts to the target population (Table 1).16 Examples of stage \u00adspecific strategies for health centers include conducting patient interviews or surveys to identify service gaps, improving existing services to address those gaps, and identifying key places to post information. For housing developments, an overall score of 3 indicates the Vague Awareness Stage, meaning that there is local concern but no immediate motivation to take action around heart health. The goal for efforts in these communities is to raise awareness that the community can do something about this issue. One recommended strategy for advancing heart health promotion for these communities is educating existing small groups within the developments about heart health. Figure 2 depicts the mean readiness scores by dimension, comparing means for health centers with housing development communities. Despite the overall difference in stage of readiness between these two types of community settings, both health centers and housing developments scored highest in existing programs and policies to address their health priority (mean of 6.65 vs. 4.01) and in the resources available to address the issue (mean of 5.98 vs. 3.97). Health centers scored lowest in leadership (mean, 5.43) and community knowledge of efforts (mean, 5.57), whereas housing developments scored lowest in community knowledge of efforts and community knowledge of the issue (with means of 2.58 and 2.76, respectively). Qualitative Findings Several themes pertaining to programmatic planning were identified. In developments, two key themes emerged: (1) Barriers to heart health and (2) variability in site of care. In health centers, the major theme identified was a lack of targeted outreach efforts to housing developments. Barriers to Heart Health. Housing development key respondents repeatedly report barriers to health that are attributable to basic life needs, including violence/safety, sub stance abuse, financial issues, insurance, and housing condit ions. The following excerpts from two key respondents at different housing developments demonstrate this point:Table 2. Key Respondent Demographics (N = 79) CHCs (n = 36)Housing (n = 43) n (%) n (%) Gender Male 10 (28) 10 (23) Female 26 (72) 32 (74) Unspecified 0 (0) 1 (2) Race* White 24 (67) 8 (19) Hispanic/Latino 0 (0) 12 (28) African American/Black 6 (17) 25 (58) American Indian Alaska Native 1 (3) 4 (9) Asian/Pacific Islander 5 (14) 0 (0) Age (yrs) 19-34 7 (20) 10 (23) 35-54 22 (61) 15 (35) 55 7 (19) 18 (42) Role in the community Management 5 (14) 8 (19) Clinical/resident leader 9 (25) 15 (35) Provider/resident 10 (28) 18 (42) Support staff/local nonprofit 12 (33) 2 (5) * Percentages do not equal 100 because some participants selected multiple race/ethnicities.Table 3.

Connecting Boston's Public Housing Developments to Community Health Centers The hallways are not clean. There's spit. There's vermin. There's all type of bad, disgusting things in there. . . . [Heart health] would be people's main concern because they want to be healthy, but come out and see that spit in front of your door; you might not think about jogging right after. It's a concern, but it's not at the front of people's minds. Gun violence is a big concern . . . you can see violence. Site of Care. The second theme that emerged from the housing development key respondents was the tremendous variability noted in where residents reported receiving their care. Across the 43 housing development respondents, a total of 24 different sites of care were noted, and included both local community health centers and several academic medical centers. At one housing development, 13 different clinical sites were referenced as sites of care for community members. Outreach to Developments. The final theme that emerged came from review of transcripts from health center key respondents. None of these key respondents felt that their current programming specifically targeted or reached out to their local housing development residents. While they did express an interest in working with these communities, they were largely unaware of any current initiatives, as these two excerpts demonstrate:We don't have any specific relationships [with local housing developments]. We just serve people that live in local housing projects, but we do not have any coordinated efforts that I'm aware of. We have patients who come in from . . . the housing projects, but there isn't a partnership. dIsCuss Ion This is the first study to use community readiness as a means to galvanize two unique community settings into action to address common health priorities among at \u00adrisk, underserved, urban populations. Our findings confirm a mis match in health priorities as well as the level of readiness to address those health priorities between housing developments and community health centers. Although the community health centers report existing programs to address their prior ity health issues, community awareness of programs is limited in both settings. Further, hous ing developments demonstrate a local concern, but there is no immediate motivation to do anything about it, in part owing to perceived barriers to care. We found the readiness assessment to be a useful tool for engaging these communities in conversation and shared program planning by providing specific action \u00adoriented guidance on stepwise program planning. Figure 2. Mean Readiness Scores to Address Community-Identified Health Priorities by Dimension: Health Centers Versus Housing Developments246 Progress in Community Health Partnerships: Research, Education, and Action Fall 2012 vol 6.3Each community was given the opportunity to identify its own health priority. Although there was much overlap in identified priorities, there was some disconnect between the two settings as reflected by one health center choosing asthma and another substance abuse; all others chose some issue related to cardiovascular disease. Understanding these differences is a critical first step in aligning priorities for future health promotion activities. As it stands, this information identifies those health centers that share a common health priority with the PHH \u00adPRC and thus make logical partners for initial program planning efforts targeting heart health among these housing development residents. Readiness scores for the identified health priorities indicate that only 2 of our 15 communities were ready for immediate program implementation (as indicated by a score of 6 or higher). Our assessments indicate that most commu\u00ad nities are unprepared to take action despite awareness that there may be a health issue. This suggests that, for future prevention programs to be successful in these communities, there are a number of actions required first to raise awareness and to motivate community members to address the health issue. Information obtained across each community during the readiness assessments provides a rich platform to develop strategies that are specific to each community. For example, key respondents identified specific community members who are considered respected leaders and thus might serve as targets for awareness raising efforts. Immediate next steps in these communities would be meeting with these leaders to get recommendations on the best strategy to raise awareness across the respective community. The mismatch identified between housing development and health center readiness is not surprising if one considers that health centers exist to address community health. Yet, one might expect that communities that are able to iden\u00adtify their own health priority might be further along the overall continu um of readiness. Given that this is the first application of this model to compare communities, there is no prior literature to draw from in synthesizing our findings. Despite this mismatch between housing development and health center communities, it is interesting that there is consis tency across dimensions, even with the observed differences in overall phases of readiness. All communities scored highest in efforts but lowest in knowledge of efforts, suggesting that immediate next steps to program planning need to target education of community leaders and members. Yet the content of this education will differ between housing developments and health centers; according to the stage \u00ad specific strategies in the readiness model, targeted messages for housing developments should focus on the importance of heart health, and increasing knowledge of existing programs is needed for staff at health centers. Analyses of these qualitative data suggest barriers across the housing development communities are largely related to social determinants of health, and confirm the notion that basic life needs preclude action and motivation to address chronic disease despite their high prevalence. These findings are consistent with the vast literature on barriers to accessing needed healthcare in urban, underserved populations.7,30,31 Our findings also provide objective evidence for community leaders that targeting these barriers when planning prevention programs is essential to effectively impact health outcomes. Thus, our current work in program planning within these communities will address these barriers by adapting a patient navigation model,32\u00ad35 which is designed to target such barriers to accessing health care services. Our qualitative analyses also indicate that residents of Boston Public Housing Developments have a large variety of clinical care site options, which may contribute to the inertia to engage in care. Because there are so many choices, there is no single clinical setting for this \"community\" to seek care and knowledge, thus diluting the effect on any programmatic efforts at individual health centers. Although this finding may be unique to the Boston community given the large presence of health care training programs and the network of safety net community health centers, for this partnership it clearly suggests the need for more of a population \u00adlevel approach for program planning targeting residents of Boston public housing. So, rather than matching developments and health centers on a one \u00ad to \u00ad one basis, we are planning for housing development navigator training to include comprehensive systems training with all local health centers as well as the common barriers reported by development respondents, and will thus be able to assist residents in accessing care anywhere in Boston. We found the methods employed in the readiness assessment to be a useful tool for engaging these communities. First, the use of a validated measure to stage level of readiness 247 Battaglia et al. Connecting Boston's Public Housing Developments to Community Health Centers is helpful, as community partnership intervention teams often rely on limited impressions or subjective sources. In addition, having multiple respondents and common questions per community allowed for direct comparisons. As a result, the process generated mechanisms for feedback which will help communities make changes. For example, the study group facilitated discussion of study findings that occurred in multiple community settings. Each community received a personalized report with action \u00ado riented recommendations for their own use. As outlined, these specific findings guided the development of an active community \u00adbased patient navigation heart health intervention. In ensuring that all stakeholders were involved from the feasibility phase onward, we were able to avoid potential roadblocks and able to plan a more community appropriate intervention to address heart health within housing developments. In addition, having this platform for engagement served to introduce the research team to future partners and begin the process of building trust and buy \u00ad in. In fact, the Boston University Clinical Translational Sciences Institute is planning to use these findings to inform the local research community across both the institution and in the health centers about potential collaborators with common interests for future studies. Although our study has limited generalizability because it was conducted in a single urban setting, our approach utilized common methods and protocols and thus provides a generalizable tool for use in other settings. Con Clus Ions The readiness assessment conducted here provides a foundation for both a dialogue between these two community settings as well as an action \u00adoriented framework to guide collaborations. Eliciting perspectives of key stakeholders (residents of each housing development and staff of each corresponding health center) around a community \u00adidentified health priority helped to ensure community buy \u00adin and support for program planning. Future collaborative efforts will be aligned with each community's level of readiness to address their priority health issue to ensure successful implementation. Given the validated methods employed, this approach to program planning may serve as a model for other community collaborations that seek to address a common preventable health issue in their target community.

Battaglia1, Sharon M. Bak1, Timothy Heeren2, Clara A. Chen3, Richard Kalish4, Stephen Barbara Nisha Thakrar9, and Karen M. Freund1,10 Abstract Background: There is a need for controlled studies to assess the impact of patient navigation in vulnerable cancer populations. Methods: Boston Patient Navigation Research Program conducted a quasi-experimental patient navigation intervention across six federally qualied inner-city community health centers, three assigned to a breast cancer navigation intervention and three assigned to a cervical cancer navigation intervention; each group thenserved as the control for the other. Eligible women had an abnormal breast or cervical cancer screening testconducted at one of the participating health centers during a baseline (2004-2005) or intervention period (2007-2008). Kaplan-Meier survival curves and proportional hazards regression examined the effect of patientnavigation on time to denitive diagnosis, adjusting for covariates, clustering by clinic and differences between the baseline and intervention period. Results: We enrolled 997 subjects in the baseline period and 3,041 subjects during the intervention period, of whom 1,497 were in the navigated arm, and 1,544 in the control arm. There was a signicant decrease in time to diagnosis for subjects in the navigated group compared with controls among those with a cervical screeningabnormality [aHR 1.46; 95% condence interval (CI), 1.1-1.9]; and among those with a breast cancer screeningabnormality that resolved after 60 days (aHR 1.40; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9), with no differences before 60 days. Conclusions: This study documents a benet of patient navigation on time to diagnosis among a racially/ ethnically diverse inner city population. Impact: Patient navigation may address cancer health disparities by reducing time to diagnosis following an abnormal cancer-screening event. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 21(10); 1645-54. /C2112012 There is widespread recognition that increasing com- plexity of cancer care contributes to outcome disparities (1, 2) as evidenced by the impact that lack of access to timely, quality cancer services has on outcomes among vulnerable populations dened by low income, inade-quate insurance coverage, and minority race/ethnicity(3-7). To address this failure to equally deliver the spec- trum of cancer services to all Americans, there is growing emphasis on patient navigation programs (8-10). Patient navigation was designed to identify and elim- inate barriers to accessing cancer services to achieve timely completion of care (11, 12). The goal of patient navigation is to facilitate timely care by meeting culturalneeds and addressing barriers to accessing care at the individual level. Examples of navigation services include identifying patients at risk for delays, facilitating appoint-ment scheduling, coordinating care among providers, organizing interpreter services, ensuring access to prior medical records, and providing logistic support for trans-portation, childcare, or linkage to community resources. Navigators are trained to help patients advocate for them- selves in the health care system and provide emotionalsupport during this stressful period. Several demonstration projects and small clinical trials report the potential benet of patient navigation at certainpoints in the cancer care continuum and in specic popu-lations (10, 13-15) resulting in several organizations recommending patient navigation as standard care (16, 17). However, large-scale clinical trials across diverseAuthors' Af liations:1Women's Health Unit, Section of General Internal Medicine, Evans Department of Medicine, Boston Medical Center and Women's Health Interdisciplinary Research Center, Boston UniversitySchool of Medicine;2Department of Biostatistics; and3Data Coordinating Center, Boston University School of Public Health;4BostonHealthNet; 5Codman Square Community Health Center;6East Boston Neighborhood Health Center;7Greater Roslindale Medical and Dental Center;8Dorchester House Community Health Center;9South Boston Community Health Center; and10Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center and Tuft University School of Medicine, Boston,Massachusetts Corresponding Author: Tracy A.

Implementation research is needed to assess the ability of navigation to be adopted in usual clinical practice, especially in safety net institutionsthat care for low-income patients (18). To provide con- trolled clinical trial data on the efcacy and effectiveness of patient navigation for follow-up of screening abnor-malities, the Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities(CRCHD) and the American Cancer Society funded 10 intervention sites through 9 grants (11) to conduct a national Patient Navigation Research Program (PNRP).The Boston PNRP, one of the funded programs, was designed as an effectiveness study to assess the impact of patient navigation under usual clinical practice ratherthan the ideal circumstances of a randomized clinical trial. Materials and Methods Study design We conducted a quasi-experimental intervention across 6 federally qualied inner-city community health centerstargeting women with breast and cervical cancer screen-ing abnormalities. The Boston program was designed as a clinical effectiveness study of patient navigation as a new standard of care, where all patients with screening abnor-malities were included into the trial and thus the Boston University Institutional Review Board approved the study with a waiver of written informed consent. Usingthe community based participatory research process (19, 20) guided by a Community Advisory Panel, each health center partner agreed to collaborate in developing andevaluating the patient navigation program at their site.Each health center was assigned a navigation site for either abnormal breast or cervical cancer screening and a control for the other condition. To adjust for temporaltrends and observe for contamination between the inter- vention and control conditions, we collected baseline data from the health centers on a random sample of all subjectswith abnormal screening in 2004 to 2005, and collected data on all subjects with abnormal screening during the intervention period from January 2007 to December 2008.We followed all subjects for 365 days, censoring those who had not achieved diagnostic resolution by the end of the study. Study sites Because there were only 6 sites, each serving different racial/ethnic communities, rather than randomly assign- ing each to the navigation condition, the study team developed a strategic allocation protocol to reduce imbal- ance across the study by race/ethnicity. Inclusion and exclusion criteria We used electronic medical records to identify eligible women with an abnormal breast or cervical cancer screen- ing test conducted at one of the participating health centers during the study periods. Breast abnormalities include abnormal mammograms, ultrasound or magneticresonance imaging (MRI) of the breasts, coded as BI- RADS 0, 3, 4, or 5 using the Breast Imaging Reportingand Data System (21, 22), or abnormal clinical breast examinations with a mass or other lesion suspicious for cancer. Cervical cancer scree ning abnormalities includ- ed Pap test ndings of high-grade squamous (ASCUS), when reflex testingfor high risk human papill oma virus (HPV) was posi- tive, or atypical glandular cells of unknown signicance (AGUS). Women were excluded if they were pregnant at the time of the screening abnormality, as pregnancymay alter the evaluation protocol and its time course, or had a cognitive impairment that prevented their par- ticipation with a patient navigator. During the baselineperiod, we sampled all high-grade (BI-RADS 4, 5, and HGSIL) lesions and a random sample of all other mam- mographic and cytologic lesions with up to 100 subjectsper health center (23). We included all women withabnormalities during the intervention period. When guidelines for management of ASCUS HPV-positive and LGSIL changed for women ages 18 to 21 years in2007 (24), recommending annual Pap tests and not diagnostic colposcopy, we excluded, thereafter, those subjects where the clinician choose repeat Pap tests asthe management, retaining any subjects if the clinician referred the patient for colposcopy. Recruitment, training, and supervision of patient navigators Patient navigators were hired as employees of the health centers, not part of the research staff. With person- nel turnover, there were a total of 23 female navigators. They all had a high school education and some health care experience, such as medical assistant training. None hadadvanced training in social work or nursing. Each health center attempted to hire navigators who could address the language needs of their communities; ve navigatorsspoke another language, including Spanish, Vietnamese, Albanian, and Portuguese Creole; all other navigators had access to robust interpreter services. They were integratedinto the clinical team at the health center, receiving direct supervision from health center staff. All received standard training to ensure minimal competency. The researchteam conducted bi-monthly local training for all naviga-tors and their supervisors throughout the study period. All navigators participated in annual face-to-face national PNRP trainings and several webinars to standardize thetraining across the national sites (25). A protocol was developed at each health center for identifying women with abnormal cancer screening. Navigators contactedpatients by telephone to initiate navigation after a clini- cian had informed the patient of the test results. Naviga- tors used the care management model (26) to identifybarriers to recommended care, and developed strategiesto address these barriers, with the focus on timely com- pletion of the diagnostic evaluation. Follow-up occurred by telephone, mail, and in face-to-face meetings, usuallyat the health center. Navigators documented their activ- ities in a structured template in the electronic medicalCEBP FOCUS Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 21(10) October 2012 Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention 1646 American Association for Cancer Research Copyright \u00a9 2012 on October 15, 2012 cebp.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from DOI:10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0532record, which allowed providers to view the activities in real time and allowed electronic capture of the navigator activities. The research team conducted annual core competency assessments on all navigators, and provided feedback tothe local supervisors. The research team also providedeach site with a monthly spreadsheet of patients eligiblefor navigation at the health center and their progress in reaching diagnostic resolution. Data collection All data were captured through the electronic medical records at each of the health centers regardless of control or navigation status. Demographic information was cap- tured from registration and billing systems. Electronic charts recorded all screening studies and their results, sowe were able to capture abnormalities electronically. Allsubsequent information on the clinical diagnostic evalu- ation, including tests ordered, completed, and their results, were collected through manual abstraction bytrained abstractors, with 10% of charts reviewed by a second abstractor for accuracy of abstraction with 3% errors identied. Race/ethnicity was collected from registration data, as our prior work indicated a high correlation of this admin-istrative data with patient self-report (27). We imputed then\u00bc229 (8%) missing race/ethnicity data from the follow- ing sources, in order of: providers' notes, country of origin(28), last name (29), or based on the majority race/ethnic-ity group of their community health center site. Missinglanguage ( n\u00bc174, 6%) was imputed as other than English if there was documentation in the medical record of theprimary language, of need for interpreter, or correspon-dence with the patient in another language. Outcomes The primary outcomes of interest in our study were whether and when diagnostic resolution of the screening abnormality was achieved, as dened by the Design andAnalysis Committee for the National PNRP (11). Time to diagnostic resolution was dened as the time from the date of the initial screening abnormality to the date whenthe nal denitive diagnostic test or evaluation was com-pleted, a timepoint determined by the clinicians caring for the patient. For BI-RADS 4 and 5 lesions, it was usually biopsy. For BI-RADS 3 imaging, where serial 6 monthimaging for up to 2 years is recommended, we observed only to conrm when the next imaging was completed after 6 months. We subtracted 180 days from the diag-nostic evaluation time, which allowed us to compare all abnormalities in a similar timeframe. If the BI-RADS 3 was addressed in less than 180 days, we used 0.5 days for thetime to diagnostic resolution. For BI-RADS 0 lesions,resolution was dened as either follow-up imaging des- ignated BI-RADS 1 or 2, or completion of whatever diag- nostic testing through biopsy had been recommended. Forcervical abnormalities, diagnostic resolution was usually colposcopy.Analysis We followed our a priori analysis plan to conduct a difference in differences survival analysis, comparing the differences across the baseline and intervention time periods between the navigated and control study sites. We calculated separate Kaplan-Meier survival curvesand proportional hazards regression models for breastand cervical subjects to examine the effect of patient navigation on time to denitive diagnosis for each clinical abnormality. Proportional hazards regression modelsexamined the effect of patient navigation, controlling for differences between the baseline and intervention peri- ods, grade of abnormality, and demographic covariates.We included as potential confounders the covariates of age (BIRADS 4 and 5, HGSIL) versus lower (BIRADS 0 and 3, LGSIL) grade screening abnormality, race/ethnicity, primary language and insurance (private, public or no insurance), and percentage of zip code under federal poverty level asproxy for socioeconomic status. These models accounted for clustering by health center. We included interactions terms with the time to diagnostic resolution variablewhere proportional hazards assumptions were violated. All analyses were conducted in SAS, and the propor- tional hazards regression procedure in SAS used a robustsandwich estimator for the covariance matrix in Wald tests for the global null hypothesis and individual para- meters to account for clustering (30). The effect of patientnavigation met assumptions of proportionality for thecervical cancer screening arm of the trial, but did not for the breast cancer screening arm. We noted that the sur- vival curves for the baseline and intervention period forthe breast navigated sites crossed at approximately 60 days, and therefore included an interaction term between intervention and time allowing differential effects ofpatient navigation over days 0 to 59 and days 60 to 365. All observations were censored at 365 days. A limitation of the sandwich estimator to account for clustering is thatit is biased downward when there are few clusters (31). Therefore we conducted a secondary analysis using a shared gamma frailty model with a proportional hazardsmodel t through a penalized likelihood approach (usingthe frailtypack procedure in R; 32) as a second approach to account for clustering. This method does not allow one to account for the nonproportional hazards for navigation inthe breast cancer screening arm in a single model. There- fore, we ran separate proportional hazards for diagnostic resolution within 59 days and for diagnostic resolutionbetween 60 and 365 days in this secondary analysis. Because we were specically interested in knowing whether navigation had a greater impact on vulnerablegroups of women, described here by race/ethnicity, pri-mary language, and insurance coverage, we developed models including interaction terms for these variables with the navigation variable. Our primary analysis wasconducted as an intention to treat analysis, including all women whether or not they received patient navigation.Boston Patient Navigation www.aacrjournals.org Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 21(10) October 2012 1647 American Association for Cancer Research Copyright \u00a9 2012 on October 15, 2012 cebp.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from DOI:10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0532We conducted a secondary analysis, excluding those navigated subjects where the navigator did not initiate patient navigation within 30 days for breast screeningabnormalities and 60 days for cervical screening abnormalities. Results There were a total of 997 subjects in the baseline period and 3,041 subjects during the intervention period, of which 1,497 received navigation and 1,544 werecontrols. Tables 1 and 2 display demographics separately for breast and cervical subjects, looking at the overall group divided by both study period (baseline versusintervention) and by study site (navigation versus control sites). The majority of subjects were from racial or ethnic minority groups, including 30% from African Americancommunities and 29% from Hispanic populations. Thesubjects spoke 18 primary languages, with Spanish (19%), Vietnamese (3.5%), Albanian (2%), and Portuguese (1%) being the most common. The differences in the proportionof women from each racial and ethnic group in thenavigated versus control sites reflects the different com- munities served by each health center, and different sizes of the health centers. There are also differences in race/ethnicity over time within the health center populations. The proportion uninsured dropped from 40% to 29% overall between the baseline and intervention time peri-ods, reflecting the impact of Massachusetts Health Insur-ance Reform, initiated in 2006 (33, 34). Figure 1 represents the unadjusted proportion of sub- jects who ever reach a diagnostic resolution by 365 days,comparing differences across the 2 study periods (base- line and intervention) within navigation and control sites separated for breast and cervical cancer subjects. For thebreast cancer screening arm, at baseline, the control sites had similar rates of diagnostic resolution compared with the navigated sites (89.6% vs. 89.7%). The control sitesshowed no improvement in the proportion of womenreaching diagnostic resolution from the baseline to the intervention period (89.6% vs. 90.2%, P\u00bc0.7809), whereas the percentage of women at navigated sites who resolved increased from 89.7% to 92.6% from the baseline to Table 1.

For the cervical cancer screening arm, the control sites had slightly higher rates ofdiagnostic resolution during the baseline period com-pared with the navigated sites (87.9% vs. 79.1%). The control sites again showed no change temporally at 365 days after abnormal screening (80.0% versus 78.6%, P\u00bc 0.64). However, the navigated sites showed signicantimprovement in diagnostic resolution comparing the baseline with the intervention period (79.1% vs. 87.9%; P\u00bc0.0008). Figures 2 and 3 display the Kaplan-Meier curves for time to diagnostic resolution (where the y-axis represents the proportion achieving diagnostic resolution) compar-ing the baseline and intervention periods across both the navigation and control sites. For breast cancer screening subjects in the navigation sites, there is a superimpositionof the baseline and intervention period curves throughabout 60 days, when 73% of subjects in the baseline period have achieved resolution compared with 71% of subjectsin the intervention period. Median days to resolution are also similar in the 2 periods, with median days to reso- lution of 29 days in the baseline period and 32 days in the intervention period. After 60 days, there is a consistentlyhigher rate of resolution among subjects during the inter- vention than the baseline period. For patients without resolution by 60 days, median days to resolutiondecreased from 157 days to 70 days from the baseline tointervention period. The control sites had no change between the baseline and intervention time periods, also reflected at 60 days when 73% of subjects in the baselineperiod achieved resolution compared with 72% of subjects in the intervention period, and with median days to resolution of 27 days in the baseline period and 34 daysin the intervention period. For cervical cancer screening subjects in the navigation sites, the intervention period showed more subjects achieved timely resolution almostimmediately. For example, at 60 days, only 27% of subjectsin the baseline period achieved diagnostic resolution compared with 39% of subjects in the intervention period,Table 2.

Theseimprovements among intervention subjects in the cervical navigation sites persisted throughout the 365 day follow- up, compared with the baseline period, and comparedwith the control sites in either time period where the proportion of subjects achieving diagnostic resolution at 60 days was similar for baseline and intervention subjects(37% vs. 31%, respectively), and median time to resolution was also similar (84 days vs. 90 days). Table 3 presents the adjusted HRs for the proportional hazards models, for breast and cervical cancer subjects,respectively. We found a signicant benet of patient navigation in reaching diagnostic resolution after adjust-ing for differences in differences between the navigation and control sites of the study and the intervention and baseline time periods. The model also adjusted for cov-ariates and for clustering within each of the health centers. In the breast model, the adjusted HR for completing diagnostic evaluation in the rst 59 days is 1.04 (95% CI,0.83-1.30), indicating no difference between the navigatedand control sites after adjustment. From days 60 through 365, there was a signicant impact of patient navigation (aHR 1.40; 95% CI, 1.06-1.86), where HR more than 1.0indicates that patient navigation is associated with more timely diagnostic resolution. For the cervical cancer screening subjects of the study, the adjusted HR was1.46 (95% CI, 1.14-1.88), indicating a benet of navigation over the control sites in reaching diagnostic resolution throughout the course of the study. Secondary analysesusing a shared gamma frailty model to account for clus-tering gave similar effect size for breast cancer screening subjects, but were not signicant in separate models for the rst 59 days (aHR 1.03; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3) or for days60-365 (aHR 1.5; 95% CI, 0.9-2.4), whereas signicance remained among the cervical cancer screening subjects (aHR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8). In the breast model, several covariates were associated with delays in achieving diagnostic resolution. Comparedwith patients who had private insurance, those withpublic insurance (aHR 0.8; 95% CI, CI, 0.8-1.0; P\u00bc0.07), were less likely to have timely resolution. Patients with a primary lan- guage other than English or Spanish were also less likelyto have timely resolution (aHR 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9). Index screening abnormalities of BI-RADS 3 (aHR 12.7; 95% CI, 8.7-18.6) or BI-RADS 4 or 5 (aHR 4.5; 95% CI, 2.0-10.0)were initially associated with more timely resolution, which decayed over time, compared with those with a Breast intervention sites AB 0102030405060708090100 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Time to resolution (d)% Resolved Baseline period Intervention periodBaseline period Intervention periodBreast control sites 0102030405060708090100 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Time to resolution (d)% Resolved Figure 2.

Age, race/ethnicity, and percentage of zip code below federal poverty levelwere not predictors of timely resolution in the model. In the cervical model, public insurance status and younger age were associated with delays in achievingdiagnostic resolution. Compared with private insurance, publically insured (aHR 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9) but not uninsured women (aHR 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2) were lesslikely to have timely resolution. Women ages 18 to 40(aHR 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9) were less likely to have timely resolution than older women. Race/ethnicity, language, screening abnormality, and socioeconomic status werenot predictors of the outcome. We were specically interested in examining whether vulnerable populations dened by minority race/ethnic-ity, language other than English, or public or no insurance had a benet from the intervention. None of the interac- tion terms of these variables by the navigation variablewere signicant in either the breast or cervical model,suggesting that there was no differential benet of nav- igation for any specic group of women dened by these demographic variables. Our data indicated that 124 (16.1%) women in the navigated arm did not receive navigation services within30 days of the breast screening abnormality, and 103(14.2%) of women did not receive navigation within 60 days of the cervical cancer screening abnormality. These ndings varied by health center, and ranged from 4.0% to29.6%. Removing women enrolled later into navigation did not change our ndings (breast navigation effect /C2160 days: aHR, 95% CI, 1.3-2.1). Median time that a navigatorspent per case varied by disease status; breast navigators spent a median of 60 minutes per subject with navigation activities [75% interquartile range (IQR), 30-127.5], with amedian of 1 encounter per subject (range 0-15); whereascervical navigators spent a median of 75 minutes (75%IQR, 30-120) in navigation activities, with a median of 2 encounters per subject (range 0-18). Discussion The Boston Patient Navigation Research Program showed a benet of patient navigation for vulnerable communities of women with both breast and cervicalcancer screening abnormalities with an adjusted HR between 1.4 and 1.5. Observing the navigated arm over 365 days, this translated into an additional 9% of patientswith cervical abnormalities and 3% of women with breast screening abnormalities completing diagnostic resolution to determine whether or not they have a premalignant orinvasive cancer. By including all individuals with a screening abnormality, this study represents an assess- ment of the effectiveness of the patient navigation inter-vention for an entire population cared for in a safety netsystem of care, leading to greater external validity. Indi- vidual randomized clinical trial methodologies are often unable to randomize the most difcult to reach patientswho may be in greatest need of navigation (14), and thus limits their external validity. Our effectiveness design includes this difcult to reach group of women whileensuring identical methods in the navigated and control arms of the study, and thus provides an estimate of the effect of navigation when applied to an entire practicepopulation. Our data provide scientically rigorous evi- dence of how navigation can be implemented. The generalizability of our ndings extends to a diverse group of women from multiple communities and cul- tures: more than 55% of our sample were from minority communities, and more than 60% were either publicly insured or uninsured.

Our work shows that navigation is broadly benecial to all groups. We did not nd that our navigation inter-vention preferentially supported any group of subjects, dened by race/ethnicity, language, or insurance status. The increased rates of insurance seen in our interventionperiod of 2007 to 08 compared with the baseline 2004 to05 periods reflect the impact of Massachusetts Health Insurance reform. The persistent uninsured rates of 8% to 47% by health center, all higher than the overall 5%uninsured in the state in 2008 (35), reflect that women who are uninsured despite insurance reform dispropor- tionately seek their care at community health centers.Our nding that publically insured subjects had less timely care compared with uninsured subjects is consis- tent with other studies and suggests that insurance statusmay be a marker for other social determinants of health (36, 37). The benet of patient navigation does not seem to be only from shifting the diagnostic completion curve to an earlier time for all, but also in increasing the proportion completing diagnostic resolution. Our data in the breast cancer screening abnormalities suggests that navigationdoes not show an immediate benet, but may be of great- est benet for those with initial delays. This may be because many patients who complete in a timely mannerwill do so without the help of a navigator. This has implications for institutions with limited resources that wish to develop navigation programs with the mosteffective impact. Several navigation programs addressing annual mammography screening, for example, began at 18 months, providing patients a 6-month window tocomplete screening on their own before activating navi- gation (38). The main limitation of our trial is the lack of random- ization of subjects into the intervention and control groups. This could have resulted in potential imbalance of both measured and unmeasured differences betweenthe groups. We attempted to address this design limita-tion by collecting baseline data from all sites. This allowed us to adjust for secular trends and baseline differences in the health centers. The lack of any differences over time inthe control groups suggest that there was no secular trend to account for our ndings. It also suggests that there was little contamination of the navigation intervention into thecontrol arms. A related limitation is that our study was conducted at 6 urban, East Coast community health cen- ters. While our analyses do account for clustering ofpatients within health centers, available methods ofaccounting for clustering in the context of proportional hazards regression for time-to-event data do not perform well with a small numbers of clusters. Our results may notgeneralize to less urban settings, or other regions of the country, and we acknowledge that our data collection methods did not account for care received outside of theafliated health care system, though our previous work has shown that the majority of this population have documented longevity within this safety-net health sys-tem (39, 40). To successfully disseminate patient navigation pro- grams, there are several components critical to ensuresuccess. Safety-net institutions, including communityhealth centers and hospital ambulatory centers, will require an initial and ongoing training program to ensure the competence of navigators. Care sites will require theability to track patients with screening abnormalities, and link this tracking to the work of the navigators. The methods developed for the health centers in this projectfulll these components while also meeting many of the principles of the Patient Centered Medical Home, includ- ing criteria for care coordination, registry/tracking, andmeaningful use of electronic medical records (41). Because this study was not powered to provide clarity on all aspects of navigation, including its impact among specicsub-populations or on patient-reported outcomes or cost-effectiveness, it lays the groundwork for the future studies necessary to inform best practices. This study highlights the benets of a community based participatory research process (20) where the design of theresearch protocol as a quality improvement effectiveness research project was developed with leadership of thehealth centers and under the guidance of an active Com- munity Advisory Panel. The ndings provide controlled clinical trial data on the effectiveness of patient navigationto promote equal access to timely diagnostic cancer carefor a racial/ethnically diverse low-income population. Perhaps the strongest indicator of the success of this intervention is the fact that the health centers continuedto implement the intervention with internal funds follow- ing completion of the trial and saw this as a keyTable 3.

Rich, MD, MPH Alexander Y. \\\\alley, MD, MSe 0 PI OlD OVERDOSE IS A BURGEO:--JING PUBLIC HEALTH crisis, accounting for at least 16 000 deaths annu\u00ad allyin the United Statcs.1 Opioid overdose occurs across sex, ethnic, age, and geographic strata and involves both medical and nonmedical opioicl use. To date, fed\u00ad eral government response has focused primarily on monitor\u00ad ing and securing the drug supply. 1 This Viewpoint suggests vari\u00ad ous steps necessary to support a more comprehensive approach . During the rime it typically takes some overdoses to rum fatal, it is possible to reverse the respiratory depression and other effects of opioicls with the antagonist naloxone. Com\u00ad munity-based organizations, health care institutions, and lo\u00ad cal and state agencies have begun to train and equip potential nonmedical bystanders to recognize and reverse overdose events using first aid techniques and emergency supplies of naloxone.23 As the number of such initiatives has increased, the 53 000 program trainees have tracked more than 10 000 reports of overdose rescues in the United States.2 These ef\u00ad forts have targeted drug users (syringe access programs, drug treatment centers, correctio nal facilities), 1 physicians (to \"co\u00ad prescribe \" naloxone along with opioids),4 and first respond\u00ad ers (ie, fire and police).j The concept has also gained traction among policy makers, including the Office of the National Drug Control Policy and professional organizations .5 Despite the mounting supportive evidence , the number of these programs remains limited in many communities with elevated rates of fatal overdose.1 Multiple barriers limit the diffusion of this innovation: the price of naloxone has sky\u00ad rocketed in the context of a severe shortage; few prescrib\u00ad ers are aware of and are willing to facilitate overdose pre\u00ad vention education and naloxone access; funding for program activities and evaluation research remains sparse; and the food and Drug Administrat ion (FDA)-approved formula\u00ad tion of naloxone is suboptima l for out-of-hospital use. In April 2012, an interagency hearing on naloxone ac\u00ad cess was convened by the FDA and brought together prac\u00ad titioners, regulators , researchers , and people personally af\u00ad fected by overdose. Although the meeting underscored numerous regulatory hurdles, decisive action is necessary to advance overdose prevention programs beyond the proof\u00ad of-concept phase (TABLE). The FDA must ensure that adequate supplies of naloxone arc available to meet the increasing demand. Like many ster\u00ad ile injectable products , naloxone is in chronic shortage. Most naloxone programs experience challenges in obtainingnalox- \u00a92012 American Medical Association.

As existing programs scale up and more jurisdictions adopt these measures, federal action can help expand naloxone sup\u00ad ply, such as by fast-tracking importation licenses. llealth care practitioners are optimally positioned to facili\u00ad tate opioid overdose prevention. Equipping clinicians and pro\u00ad viding incentive for them to screen patients for overdose risk and to educate patients, their families, and caregivers about recognizing and responding to overdoses is an important step, alongside community -based education about opioicl over\u00ad dose and naloxone distribution. Explicitly integrating over\u00ad close prevention , including naloxone coprescription, into the FDA-industry cooperative strategy for evaluation and mitiga\u00ad tion of opioid risk also could be helpful.; Clinicians may be unclear about legal risks associated with prescribing naloxone <> and may be concerned about the pos\u00ad sibility of facilitating risky drug use6; yet there is no evidence of such disinhibition.7 Prescribing naloxone to manage opi\u00ad oid overdose is consistent with. its FDA-approved indication, precipitating no increased liability as long as prescribers ad\u00ad here to general rules of professional conduct7 Some states have passed laws indemnifying clinicians from risk of malpractice lawsuits perceived to arise from prescription of naloxone. Oth\u00ad ers have introduced Good Samaritan laws shielding lay by\u00ad standers and persons experiencing overdose from possible civil liability (flowing from providing first aid) and criminal drug charges when 91 l is called.7 Using evidence-based model leg\u00ad islation, federal coordinat ion can help disseminate these le\u00ad gal protections to encourage clinician engagement, lay re\u00ad sponder rescue, and help-seeking. In out-of-hospital settings, the administration of injectable drugs carries the risk of needle-stick injury and presents logis\u00ad tical barriers, such as the absence of a sterile syringe and delay in preparation . 3 FDA action is needed to fast-track approval of naloxone delivery systems that arc safe and user-friendly for nonmedical responders.

Some projectshave involved various approaches for activat- ing patients, families, and providers to im- prove patient safety during care transitions. For example, Coleman et al 6showed that care transition coaches decrease rehospital-izations even up to 180 days after hospital dis- charge.

Jack et al8used inpatient nurses with a checklist and personalized patient education materials along with a postdis-charge pharmacist telephone call, which re- sulted in a one-third decrease in the rate patients returned to the hospital within30 days. Few interventions, however, have focused on transitions from the SNF to the hospital. 9,10 Ouslander et al1using a comprehensive rehospitalization reduction program called INTERACT and the Evercare demonstra- tion project11have decreased hospital trans- fers from nursing facilities. More recently,Berkowitz et al 12described a successful in- tervention to improve transitions of care in an SNF. This 3-pronged intervention included(1) an admission checklist for physicians to en- courage discussion of repeat hospitalizations before worsening of symptoms, (2) automaticpalliative care consultations for patients with more than 3 rehospitalizations, and (3) Team Improvement for Patient and Safety (TIPS)conferences, recurring multidisciplinary team meetings to analyze root causes of failures in care. The TIPS conferences were designed to increase the organizational commitment to patient safety and transitions of care amongfrontline staff. This was motivated, in part, by studies that have shown that a higher de- gree of organizational commitment to patient safety, as reflected by the Nursing Home Sur- vey on Patient Safety Culture, is linked toimproved patient outcomes in SNFs. 13,14In this article, we describe in detail the design and implementation of a successful TIPS pro-gram that was part of the larger interven- tion resulting in a 20% reduction in transfer rates on our skilled nursing unit. 12Staff at- titudes on patient safety culture before and during the intervention are discussed, based on biannual responses to the benchmarkedNursing Home Survey on Patient Safety Cul- ture designed specically for nursing home providers and staff; the survey evaluates opin-ions regarding the culture of patient safety in a nursing home. 15METHODS Nursing facility The project was implemented on a 50-bed subacute rehabilitation unit admitting approx-imately 1000 patients per year. The medi- cal staff members were all salaried employ- ees consisting of 1.5 full-time equivalent of a nurse practitioner and 1.5 full-time equiva- lent of physician time. The unit is housed ina 600-unit long-term care, religious-afliated, not-for-prot organization in Boston, Mas- sachusetts. In addition to standard rehabilita-tion care, on-site services include radiology, electrocardiograph (ECG) technician, mobile laboratory, blood transfusion, psychiatry, geri-atric psychiatry, and a palliative care team composed of a chaplain, a nurse, a physician, and a social worker. Planning process The project was approved by the Hebrew SeniorLife institutional review board as a qual-ity improvement project. A multidisciplinary team was convened to understand the scope of the problem, determine objectives for theproject, develop concrete steps to address the problem of avoidable acute care hospital transfers, and reassess outcomes. The team was composed of the medical director, the director of nursing, the administrator, staffnurses and aides, therapists, a rabbi from the palliative care team, a daughter whose mother had experienced multiple rehospitalizations,a statistician, and representatives from a local acute care hospital and a home health agency. This group met twice before the project be-gan to determine the format of TIPS confer- ences, approach to root-cause analyses of care transitions, outcome measures, and how to in-volve the palliative care team. Measures To measure delity to the project and give credit to those who participated, attendance of core staff was recorded at TIPS meet- ings.

Staff attitudes on the organizational patient safety culture were monitored at baseline andbiannually with the Nursing Home Survey on Patient Safety Culture. 15The surveys were distributed to the core target audience forthe TIPS meeting. Surveys were sent by e- mail, and a paper version also was available. The Nursing Home Survey on Patient SafetyCulture includes 42 survey items measur- ing 12 dimensions and an additional over- all resident safety question. The dimensions are as follows: teamwork (4 items), stafng (4 items), compliance with procedures (3items), training and skills (3 items), nonpuni- tive response to mistakes (4 items), handoffs (4 items), feedback and communication aboutincidents (4 items), communication openness (3 items), supervisor expectations and actions promoting resident safety (3 items), overallperceptions of resident safety (3 items), man- agement support for resident safety (3 items), and organizational learning (4 items.) Answersto all Likert scale questions were coded 1 to 5, ranging from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree.\" In addition, an overall rating of patientsafety in the facility was included as the 43rd item. Mean composite dimensions scores for the perception of organizational patient safety culture were calculated by summing the scores for individual questions (with appropri- ate inversion of reverse-coded items) and di- viding by the number of questions answered.Respondents who answered \"does not ap- ply/don't know\" were treated in the same way as those who did not answer the item (miss-ing). In addition, following Agency for Health- care Research and Quality methods, the mean percentage of positive responses was derivedby scoring each question answered \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" as a positive response. The mean percentage of positive responses over-all was calculated by adding the number of re- spondents who reported \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" divided by the number of respondentsfor that item. The percentage of positive re- sponses was calculated both for the entiresurvey and for 7 specic dimensions (team- work, nonpunitive response to mistakes, feed- back and communication about incidents, su- pervisor expectation and actions promotingresident safety, organizational learning, and communication openness) of the survey iden- tied by the project team to be most relevantto the TIPS program. Statistical analysis Single-factor analyses of variance were cal- culated to compare the (1) mean overall composite scores, (2) mean scores for the 7 specied dimensions thought to be most relevant to the intervention, (3) mean per-centage of positive responses, and (4) mean percentage of positive responses for com- posite dimensions\u2014across the 3 time pointsof survey administration (ie, preinitiation of TIPS conferences, 6 months, and 12 months). Data were analyzed with Microsoft Excel2003. Intervention TIPS conferences were conducted every 2 weeks during the 1-year study period. All di- rect care staff members were invited and weretold that attendance would be taken. Other staff as well as patients and their families were invited (eg, ECG technicians, maintenance,security, information technology, home care agency staff, an outpatient pharmacist, family members, and patients) on a case-by-case ba- sis. Cases of potentially avoidable acute care hospital transfers or adverse events that mighthave ended in an acute care hospital transfer were identied by the medical director, hos- pital nursing liaisons, the nursing quality im-provement specialist, members of the pallia- tive care team, patients, families, and staff, as well as providers at acute care hospitals andhome care agencies, They were all asked to report such information to the medical direc- tor (Table). Potential cases were preliminarilyreviewed by the medical director and sched- uled for a TIPS conference session within 1 to 2 weeks of the event at a time key par-ticipants could attend. The TIPS conference sessions were designed to last 30 minutes. In Copyright \u00a9 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

After this, the medical director facilitated a 15- minute group discussion, in which an explicit expectation was set for all attendees to partic-ipate. The nal 10 minutes of the session was dedicated to the development of action steps. If a patient or family member presented thecase, the presenter was excused after the pre- sentation to allow for open staff discussion. The medical director led the majority of theconferences. Mechanics of the conferences To encourage development of actionable steps, the leader used a white board to record problems and help the group identify con- crete solutions. The leader also made an effortto engage all the staff members in the discus- sion. Staff members were called on if they were not speaking during the conferences.To ensure participation by nursing aides and direct care staff, meetings were con- ducted on the unit to minimize the time staff members were unable to answer call lightsand dispense medications. A rotating nurse and aide covered call lights during each con- ference. In addition, meeting times were var-ied to allow night and evening shift staff mem- bers to attend. To ensure that the lessons learned from the conferences were broadcast widely to staff both within and outside our organization, an e-mail listserve was created and short \"tips from TIPS\" were e-mailed on the same day of the conference. This enabled staff membersfrom all shifts who might not have attended a particular conference to learn from the cases as well. The evening supervisor used these e-mails to review the cases with staff on week- ends and nights.

RESULTS Over the course of the year, we held 22 TIPS conferences. The cases discussed in theTIPS conferences were all held within 2 weeks of the sentinel events. TIPS conference atten- dance by core unit staff was 81%. TIPS con-ference discussions led directly to multiple procedural changes to improve patient safety and decrease readmission risk (Table). Base- line, 6-month, and 1-year Nursing Home Sur- vey on Patient Safety Culture response rateswere 12.5%, 56.9%, and 49.4%, respectively. Mean scores increased during the study, in- dicating improved patient safety culture (pre-TIPS, mean [ F 2,88 =5.66, P<.005). Percentage of positive response rates for the overall sur- vey and the 7 selected dimensions showed in- creasing trends during the course of the study(Figure). DISCUSSION The TIPS conference initiative improved the staff perception of the patient safety cul-ture of the unit. This likely contributed to the observed 20% decrease in the acute care hos- pital transfer rates that we have previously reported. 12Several key aspects that were im- portant to the success of this program wereinstitutional support and program leadership. We had intended to hold TIPS conferences ev- ery 2 weeks throughout the course of the year.While we did not meet that goal, holding 22 of 26 (85%) conferences with high attendance represents a high degree of delity to the pro-gram. The support of the institution's senior management was critical to help build a cul- ture of accountability that was not focused onblame. It also was critical to have a committed program leader to choose appropriate cases, encourage attendance, and ensure implemen-tation of the solutions identied. For example, the SNF had a medication error in which apatient did not receive some doses of medicine. There was an immediate apology to the patient that was publicized broadly within our institution, and the patient presented herexperience after this event at a TIPS confer- ence. Pharmacy, nursing, and medical proce- dures were changed to review the list of allorders for medications that were expiring that day. The chief executive ofcer of our organi- zation publicly congratulated the team and itsefforts. We had several conferences after this in which nurses who themselves had been involved in medication errors requested TIPS conferences to address these events. Culture change When the conferences rst began, staff nurses did not want to attend the confer-ences, as they feared that they alone would be blamed. In addition, there was fear that if more acutely ill patients were kept on theunit instead of being sent to the hospital, then the nursing workload would increase, which would adversely impact the care being givento other patients. To encourage open conversation, the rst cases chosen were ones in which the medicaldirector bore the major responsibility for the outcome. Open conversations by the leader about ways in which she might have pre-vented a transfer helped to foster a nonblam- ing atmosphere. Thought leaders among di- rect nursing staff were identied. Once they engaged productively with the TIPS program, they encouraged participation by their peers.If the conversation did shift to blaming, the discussion was redirected by the leader. Aides in particular were reticent to speak in the rstconferences, but over time, they began to feel more comfortable voicing concerns. We anticipated that keeping potentially more acutely ill patients would present chal- lenges for direct care staff. For example, we reviewed the case of a dying woman whosefamily had decided against a transfer to the hospital and the patient died on our unit on comfort measures. However, the womanrequired a signicant amount of both nurs- ing and aide time to ensure her comfort. In Copyright \u00a9 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

TIPS indicates Team Improvement and PatientSafety. response to this case, we brought senior nurs- ing leadership into the TIPS meeting to discuss stafng concerns associated with very ill pa- tients and developed a plan for future cases to use other staff resources in the building such as a nursing supervisor whom staff had beenhesitant to call. Involvement of the entire team Early on we recognized that many of the is- sues involved team members both within and outside our core team. In one case, the hus-band of a dying patient would walk up and down the hallway in the evenings intimidat- ing direct care staff and threatening to suethem. This issue was identied, and through TIPS, a behavioral management plan was im- plemented. In another case, a woman wentout to the hospital with atrial brillation be- cause the ECG printout was lost. The ECG technician explained that the machine stored information and could easily have reprinted a hardcopy. She and the secretarial staff devel-oped a process to ensure that the ECG would reliably reach the clinicians. Another TIPS case involved a patient who had gained 20 lbon the unit without this being recognized bythe staff. Information technology staff mem- bers were brought in to demonstrate how bio- metric data such as weight could be recorded on our electronic medical record to more ef- fectively track weight changes. We also involved participants from outside our institution. We reviewed the case of a male patient discharged home from the unit who soon ended up back in the hospital be-cause of a lack of ostomy bags. We had nurses from a home care agency present the case and the downstream effects of not sendingbags home with the patient. Outpatient phar- macists were brought in to TIPS conferences as we identied issues of patients who hadincorrect medications from outdated medica- tion lists delivered to their homes. Another benet of implementing TIPS was the rapid review and discussion of the sentinel event, generally within a week. This increased staff ability to remember details of the events and quickly give a sense of closure around difcult situations. The conferences helpedstaff to see problems looming early on in a patient's stay. Staff members were frequently heard saying, \"We'd better address this beforeit becomes a TIPS case.\" Copyright \u00a9 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Some of the presen- tations at the conferences by patients and fam- ilies were very moving and helped focus staffmembers on the patient perspective. Lessons learned were in multiple areas of care de- livery: time-out for high-risk discharges, stan-dardized handoff to next team, shift-to-shift communication, easy access for patients and families after discharge, patient and family un- derstanding of illness and prognosis, optimiz- ing delivery of bad news, addressing disrup-tive families within a day of admission, com- munication with outside providers for ensur- ing unied messages to families and review ofcare, and identifying community resources. Care processes on the SNF unit that were addressed included infection control, medi-cation errors, and customer service. The project described in this article was 1 element of a 3-pronged approach to im-prove discharge that also included standard- ized physician admission assessments and au- tomatic palliative care consultations for high-risk patients. It is not possible to determine which changes in our care processes pro- duced the reduction in hospital admissionsor improvement in our patient safety culture. The study was limited by small sample size. Be- cause of this, we were not able to stratify ourresults by provider class. In addition, the base- line survey included a smaller proportion of participants than would have been ideal. We believe that this was possibly due to staff feel-ing fearful of completing the survey or skep- tical of the anonymous nature of the data col- lection. While it is difcult to judge how thismay have affected our results, it seems likely that this phenomenon would either be nondif- ferential or bias our ndings to be an underes-timation of the impact of TIPS, as nonpartic- ipants would most likely hold more negative perceptions than those who chose to partici- pate. While research has focused on how inter- disciplinary teams function in relation to clin- ical outcomes, additional work is needed to understand how to translate quality improve-ment efforts to sustained culture change for patient safety. 16As health care reform is im- plemented over the coming decade with payfor performance and encouragement of col- laboration across the continuum of care, it will be critical to have effective SNF teamspartnering with hospitals, primary care medi- cal homes, and home care agencies to man- age transitions in care and avoid unneces-sary hospitalizations. The results of this study suggest that a program such as the one de- scribed in this article could contribute to im-proved patient care by focusing the attention of SNF staff on improving quality and patient safety.

BICKMORE Northeastern University College of Computer and Information Science, Boston, Massachusetts, USA MICHAEL K. PAASCHE-ORLOW Section of General Internal Medicine, Boston Medical Center/Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Without concerted effort, the current explosion in health information technology will further widen the digital health divide for individuals with inadequate health literacy. However, with focused investment of time and energy, technology has the potential for reducing disparities through intelligent, usable, and accessible systems that tailor information, advice, counseling, and behavioral support to an individual's need at a given time and place. The development of information technology (IT) for patient and consumer health applications has been exploding in the past decade, with thousands of websites, hundreds of mobile applications, and dozens of special-purpose devices targeted at the health care market. However, this growth in technology is actually likely to increase health disparities for those with limited health, computer, and reading literacy, unless effort is devoted to the development of IT specifically designed for these disadvantaged groups, and issues of technology access are addressed. The design of technology for low-literacy individuals needs to be primarily focused on improved interface design, but all aspects of usability of health information systems must be addressed, including which health messages are delivered at a given time. There is now ample evidence that individuals with low health literacy have difficulty accessing and using state-of-the-art digital health communication media, such as websites (Jensen, King, Davis, & Guntzviller, et al., 2010). Barriers to health IT access, including cost, high-speed Internet access, access to consumer and patient medical devices, and rural-urban and regional variability in access, are often ignored by researchers developing new health technologies, but their resolution is crucial to ensure the ultimate success of their efforts. Downloaded by [Boston University] at 11:37 05 February 2013 24 T. W. Bickmore and M. K. Paasche-Orlow If these issues of usability and access are addressed, IT has the potential to reduce health literacy-based disparities through the use of intelligent but easy-to-use systems that can inform, teach, persuade, and counsel, using messages that are perfectly tailored for an individual to understand and act upon in a given situation. There is now a growing body of research into the development and evaluation of computational artifacts designed specifically for populations with low health literacy that demonstrates the potential of IT to level the playing field by providing information at the place and time it is needed and in a format that is more understandable and actionable than traditional print media. Several of these artifacts have even been shown to be preferred over oral communication with health providers because they have the potential to provide a low-pressure context in which patients\u2014especially those with low health literacy\u2014do not feel talked down to and are open to asking questions (Bickmore, Pfeifer, & Jack, 2009). In the rest of this article, we briefly survey the state of the art in using technology to help individuals with inadequate health literacy: automated assessment of individual health literacy level and document readability, and automated interventions for providing health information and/or counseling to individuals with inadequate health literacy. We close with some thoughts on future opportunities for the use of technology to assist individuals with low health literacy. Information Technology in Health Literacy Assessment of Individuals Several researchers have developed IT systems for automatically assessing the health literacy of individuals. Lobach and colleagues (Lobach, developed a computer-administered questionnaire to automatically assess users' reading and computer literacy levels, then used this assessment to automatically tailor the user interface to these factors. Yost and colleagues (2009) also developed a talking touchscreen system that assessed health literacy in English and Spanish, with the objective of completing assessments more efficiently and more accurately than the standard Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. To date, these efforts have been designed as research tools. In the near future, computer-adaptive testing will shorten the duration of these assessments and make them even easier to use. This could potentially lead to clinical use if and when a given patient's health literacy status needs to be identified in order to trigger specific interventions, although this has not yet occurred as of the time of writing. Information Technology in Readability Assessment Other researchers have developed automated approaches to assessing the readability levels of printed documents and websites. Although the Flesch-Kincaid readability calculator is the most well known given that it is a feature in Microsoft products, Dale-Chall, Gunning-Fog, SMOG, and other algorithms for automatically assessing the readability of documents are available in most modern word processors (Ley & Florio, 1996). These standard measures are easy to compute and use but are not reliable, as demonstrated by several recent studies (e.g., Feng, Jansche, Huenerfauth, & Elhadad, 2010). To date, they have been good tools to identify blocks of text that are likely to be inadequate. However, a transformation may be taking place as more sophisticated algorithms, on the basis of techniques from computational Downloaded by [Boston University] at 11:37 05 February 2013 Information Technology in Health Literacy 25 linguistics have yielded more accurate results (Feng et al., 2010). Preliminary research has also been conducted into automatically mapping lay (\"consumer\") health care terms to standardized medical nomenclature (Zeng & Tse, 2006). This work lays the groundwork for systems that can eventually be developed to automatically translate between technical language and language that people can better understand. Information Technology-Based Interventions Several computerized health interventions have now been developed and evaluated specifically for individuals with low health literacy, such as multimedia touch screen computers that administer standard diagnostic questionnaires (Bryant et al., 2009; Wofford, Currin, Michielutte, & Wofford, 2001), and health education systems that are designed to accommodate a wide range of health, computer, and reading literacy levels (Gerber et al., 2005; Kandula et al., 2009). These systems commonly provide information using audio, video or graphical displays along with text to minimize the literacy level required of users, and often use touch screen input so that users do not need to have mouse and keyboard proficiency (Gerber et al., 2005; Kandula et al., 2009). For example, the Multimedia Diabetes Education Program uses images, 2D animation, and spoken audio (narrator) along with text. In a study of 190 patients (21% with low health literacy), it was found that all patients had significant increases in diabetes knowledge after interacting with the program, although the program did not fully compensate for low health literacy. Interactive voice response (or phone-based) systems represent another modality that may be particularly well-suited to deliver interventions to low-literacy individuals because these systems (a) deliver information in speech instead of text and (b) use the ubiquitous communication channel of the telephone so that participants neither need computer literacy nor computer access (Piette, 2000). Schillinger and colleagues (2008) compared a multilingual interactive voice response system for diabetes self-management support with monthly group medical visits, and demonstrated that the interactive voice response system resulted in greater engagement, especially among participants with limited literacy. Shea and colleagues (2008) performed a direct comparison of a health satisfaction survey (Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) delivered either in its original 63-item text format, the text format augmented with images, or a bilingual interactive voice response-based implementation, and demonstrated that significantly more individuals with inadequate health literacy completed the survey, and completed it is less time and with fewer errors, when delivered through interactive voice response compared with the other two modes. Our own research in this area involves the use of embodied conversational agents that appear on the computer as animated characters that simulate the conversational nonverbal behavior that accompanies human face-to-face dialogue, such as hand gestures, facial displays, and gaze (Figure 1). We have found that patients learn more with embodied conversational agents compared to other modalities (e.g., human instructors), regardless of health literacy, and that individuals with inadequate health literacy generally report higher levels of satisfaction with embodied conversational agents and ask more questions with embodied conversational agents compared to individuals with adequate health literacy (Bickmore and Paasche-Orlow, 2011). However, as with the Multimedia Diabetes Education Program, embodied conversational agents did not fully compensate for low health literacy (Bickmore, Pfeifer, & Paasche-Orlow, 2009; Bickmore [Boston University] at 11:37 05 February 2013 26 T. W. Bickmore and M. K. Paasche-Orlow Future Directions for Information Technology in Health Literacy There are a great many promising directions of research into how technology can improve the health of individuals with inadequate health literacy. As described earlier, most of the work to date in this area has been on the development of technologies designed to improve an individual's knowledge about specific areas of health and self-care, such as diabetes. Even in this area, there is a tremendous opportunity for new research into improved pedagogical methods that can be borrowed from the field of Intelligent Tutoring Systems and applied in specific health domains (Nkambou, Bourdeau, & Mizoguchi, 2010). In addition to improving knowledge, intelligent systems can be used to improve skill deficits in health care (e.g., inhaler technique) as well as underlying deficits in basic literacy skills. For example, automated reading tutors that listen to learners read out loud and provide coaching (Mostow et al., 2003) and math tutors that provide adaptive, personalized instruction to improve numeracy skills have both been developed and tested (Melis & Siekmann, 2004). IT systems can also play a role in providing access to health care and other services. For example, intelligent online directories have been designed to help connect urban, low income populations with community services including health care, housing, food security, and income security services (Fleegler, Lieu, Wise, & Muret-Wagstaff, 2007). Extending this kind of matchmaking service to add educational support for people who are struggling with their care is an important research direction. Intelligent counseling systems can go beyond the provision of knowledge and literacy skills to impact a wide range of other psychological constructs associated with health literacy. Just as a good human counselor can work with an individual to improve self-efficacy and motivation to change a health behavior, automated Figure 1. Example of embodied conversational agent used in walking promotion intervention for older adults (Bickmore et al., 2010). (Color figure available online.) Downloaded by [Boston University] at 11:37 05 February 2013 Information Technology in Health Literacy 27 counseling agents can use techniques from health behavior change to improve health behaviors over time, and the messages and techniques used could be tailored to the individual's literacy (Bickmore & Giorgino, 2006; Bickmore, Schulman, & Sidner, 2011). Counseling agents could also be used to change norms by modeling or demonstrating ideal health behavior (e.g., medication adherence, walking, weight loss), and help prevent the discounting of future effects of current health decisions by reminding individuals of the long-term ramifications of their actions. Agents could also help address the fatalism about health outcomes many individuals with inadequate health literacy embrace by making individuals aware of the choices they have in their care and changing their expectations about the future. Information systems could be used to significantly improve patient-provider communication for individuals with low health literacy. Interventions to promote patient activation are particularly important for low-literacy patients because they tend to ask fewer questions in comparison with individuals with adequate literacy (Katz, Jacobson, Veledar, & Kripalani, 2007; Schillinger et al., 2003). Mobile systems that maintain lists of questions and issues for patients and promote their resolution during medical encounters represent one of many ways that IT systems could become automated advocates for those who lack family or friends who can perform this role. Automated coaches could also give patients practice interacting with virtual health providers to build self-efficacy for interactions with the actual health care system. Automated systems could also be used to help facilitate and mediate patient-provider interactions by, for example, negotiating the agenda of problems to address with providers and by facilitating shared decision making. Automated systems could also be used to change the behavior and attitudes of providers themselves when interacting with low-literacy patients by, for example, prompting them to evaluate comprehension and other best practice interventions. Last, IT systems can be used to significantly enhance the social support networks for individuals with low health literacy. Existing websites such as PatientsLikeMe.com and the many condition-specific support websites are wonderful resources for those who are connected into the digital world, but these resources are largely out of reach for those with low computer literacy and limited resources. In addition, the members of these online communities tend be well educated and highly health literate, which may represent a barrier for low-literacy individuals to fully participate. Parallel resources need to be established for those who lack this digital and health fluency and lack access to IT systems to connect them both to expert health advice and peers who can provide emotional, informational, and instrumental support. Conclusion Imagine a future in which an individual can carry a mobile device (perhaps their smartphone) that not only provides health information, but senses and interprets the environment and makes proactive recommendations about actions that might affect their health. The device could also translate health-related text into actionable messages, tailored not only to the individual's health literacy level, but their educational and cultural background, values, and even emotional state, providing information and recommendations at the time and location, and in the format, that will have the most effect. Such a digital health conscience would need a detailed cognitive model of its wearer, going beyond canonical models of health literacy and culture\u2014which can simply reinforce stereotypes\u2014to a detailed representation of a Downloaded by [Boston University] at 11:37 05 February 2013 28 T.

Elements of such systems already exist, and limited versions are certainly in our near future. However, the market for health IT products will not take care of our most vulnerable populations on its own; we need continued, focused, evidence-based research to continue developing technologies that specifically address disparities for individuals with low health literacy in order to realize this potential.

Downloaded by [Boston University] at 11:37 05 February 2013 RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Non-linear mixed models in the analysis of mediated longitudinal data with binary outcomes Emily A Blood1,2*and Debbie M Cheng1 Abstract Background: Structural equation models (SEMs) provide a general framework for analyzing mediated longitudinal data. However when interest is in the total effect (i.e. direct plus indirect) of a predictor on the binary outcome, alternative statistical techniques such as non-linear mixed models (NLMM) may be preferable, particularly if specificcausal pathways are not hypothesized or specialized SEM software is not readily available. The purpose of thispaper is to evaluate the performance of the NLMM in a setting where the SEM is presumed optimal. Methods: We performed a simulation study to assess the performance of NLMMs relative to SEMs with respect to bias, coverage probability, and power in the analysis of mediated binary longitudinal outcomes. Both logistic and probit models were evaluated. Models were also applied to data from a longitudinal study assessing the impact ofalcohol consumption on HIV disease progression. Results: For the logistic model, the NLMM adequately estimated the total effect of a repeated predictor on the repeated binary outcome and were similar to the SEM across a variety of scenarios evaluating sample size, effect size, and distributions of direct vs. indirect effects. For the probit model, the NLMM adequately estimated the total effect of the repeated predictor, however, the probit SEM overestimated effects. Conclusions: Both logistic and probit NLMMs performed well relative to corresponding SEMs with respect to bias, coverage probability and power. In addition, in the probit setting, the NLMM may produce better estimates of the total effect than the probit SEM, which appeared to overestimate effects. Background SEMs are a general modeling framework often used in the social sciences to analyze complex relationshipsbetween variables, such as mediated relationshipsbetween variables. A mediator is a variable in the causalpathway between a predictor and the outcome of inter-est. SEMs are becoming more common in the clinical research setting and can be used to model hypothesized causal pathways between variables of interest. Exten-sions of SEMs have been developed to allow for moregeneral types of dependent variables, including binaryoutcomes [1]. Common statistical techniques for non-mediated longitudinal binary data include non-linearmixed models (NLMM) [2] and generalized estimatingequations (GEE) [3]. When interest is primarily in the total effect of a predictor on an outcome, even ifmediation may be present, these commonly used techni- ques may be preferred over SEMs as they specifystraightforward predictor-outcome variable relationshipsand do not require specialized software, as the SEMoften does. It is therefore of interest to determine, in asetting conducive to using SEMs, whether a methodsuch as NLMMs adequately models the total effect of a predictor on binary outcomes without directly modeling mediation. We focus on NLMM rather than GEE in thispaper as it is more similar to the non-linear SEMs forlongitudinal data available in SEM software-both areconditional rather than marginal models. Comparisons have been made between SEM and other statistical models in different contexts [4-13]. Mixedeffect models have been evaluated against SEMs with continuous data [14,15], and found to adequately model mediated predictor-outcom e relationships. MacKinnon et al. [16] examined the calculation of mediated effectsin cross-sectional binary data with non-SEM techniquesusing two different methods (difference of coefficients * Correspondence: emily.blood@childrens.harvard.edu 1Department of Biostatistics Boston University School of Public Health 801 Massachusetts Avenue 3rdFloor Boston, MA 02118 USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the articleBlood and Cheng BMC Medical Research Methodology 2012, 12:5 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/12/5 \u00a9 2012 Blood and Cheng; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

While, Palta and Lin [17] compared structural equation models to various mar-ginal models in longitudinal binary data without media-tion. To our knowledge, eval uation of NLMMs relative to SEMs has not yet been performed in the context ofmediated longitudinal binary data. Linear and non-linear mixed models differ both in terms of the distributional assumptions and the estima-tion techniques used for inference. In addition, the para-meter estimates in non-linear mixed models using alogit or probit link are inherently scaled to the predic-tors (and mediators) included in the model. Therefore,comparisons of parameter estimates between NLMMswith different sets of predictors must first be re-scaled in order to make them comparable [16]. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of NLMMs relative to SEMs for the modeling of mediated, binary longitudinal data in a setting where the SEM is pre-sumed to be optimal. The purpose is to assess whetherthere is an impact of direct modeling of causal pathwaysin terms of bias, power, and c overage probability when the goal is to determine the total effect of the main independent variable. A simulation study is performed to assess these two classes of models across a variety ofsettings. We also describe, in an appendix, two differentapproaches for rescaling estimates when analyzing realworld data in order to allow direct comparisons betweenNLMMs and SEMs or to compute mediated effects viaNLMMs only. Methods In the current study, we consider a longitudinal data set-ting with binary outcomes, a repeated binary predictor, arepeated continuous mediator, and a continuous covari-ate measured at baseline. An example of such a clinicalsetting would be a prospective cohort study evaluatingthe impact of heavy alcohol consumption on HIV diseaseprogression, defined as low CD4 cell count (e.g. <350 cells/ L). Heavy alcohol consumption may influence pro- gression of HIV, while also influencing adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Level of adherence to ARTis also a predictor of HIV disease progression. In this set-ting there is a repeated binary independent variable ofprimary interest, heavy alcohol consumption (z j), and a longitudinal binary outcome, low CD4 cell count ( Yj) sig- nifying HIV progression. In addition, ART adherence (Mj), a continuous mediating variable, is measured repeatedly, and age ( w) is a continuous covariate assessed at baseline. ART adherence is said to be a mediator because the primary independent variable, heavy alcoholuse, may affect CD4 count directly as well as indirectlythrough ART adherence. We arbitrarily assume six time-points at which the predictor, outcome and mediator aremeasured. Time is represented by t jwith j= 1, 2,..., 6. In this setting, we considered measurement times to beequally spaced and the same for all individuals. We gen-erated data with a mediated non-linear relationshipbetween the predictor (heavy alcohol consumption) andoutcome (low CD4 cell count), i.e. we allowed the media- tor (ART adherence) to be directly affected by the predic- tor and the outcome to be directly affected by both thepredictor and mediator. Both the probit and logit linkswere assessed. We also describe the application of thesemodels to data from a prospective cohort study evaluat-ing the impact of heavy alcohol use on HIV diseaseprogression. As described by Fitzmaurice, Laird, and Ware [18] and others, binary outcome models can be described equiva-lently in two ways. The first approach would be todefine a linear function of an underlying latent continu-ous variable ( Y*) that when dichotomized represents the observed binary outcome (Y ). For example, we could define a continuous latent (unobserved) variable Y* such that observed Yis 1 if Y* > 0 and 0 otherwise and write: Y=0+1x+ (1) A second approach would be to define a non-linear model of the probability of a binary response. If we con-sider /C15~ N(0,1), the model in Equation 1 defines a uni- variate probit model that can be equivalentlyrepresented using the following non-linear link format: P(Y = 1) = (0+1x). Likewise, if we could consider the errors in Equation 1 to have standard logistic distribution (mean of 0 and variance of2 3) the model defines a univariate logistic model that can be represented as: P(Y = 1) =exp(0+1x) 1 + exp( 0+1x). In more complex situations, such as the longitudinal data we are studying, the same equivalence betweenmodel descriptions exist and we use both model formu-lations for the NLMMs and SEMs that follow. The con-vention for binary or categorical outcomes in SEMs hasbeen to describe binary re gression models with the latent variable format while the NLMMs are oftendefined using the non-linear link format. SEM To evaluate the performance of NLMMs in a settingconducive to the use of SEMs, we generated mediatedlongitudinal binary outcomes using a non-linear SEM.We then fit the data with a NLMM as well as the non-Blood and Cheng BMC Medical Research Methodology 2012, 12:5 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/12/5Page 2 of 10linear SEM to evaluate the performance of the NLMM relative to the SEM. The non-linear SEM used to gener-ate the data and subsequently fit to the generated datais described below. Following the notation from above, x jis the indepen- dent variable of primary interest, Mjis the continuous mediating variable, wis a continuous time-invariant cov- ariate, and tjrepresents time-point. Using the latent variable notation, we define a continuous unobserved outcome Y ijthat takes a value of 1 only if Y ij>0forj = 1 to 6. This model can be expressed as follows (drop- ping the subject index ifor simplicity), where: Measurement model Y j=U1+tjU2+Mj+zj+j (2) Just as in the simpler models above, if we assume /C15j~ N(0,1) this defines a probit model and if we assume /C15j~ Logistic ( 0,2 3) this defines a logit model. Structural model U1=1+2w+1 (3) U2=2+2 (4) Forj= 1 to 6, Mj=3+1zj+2+j, (5) where Ui1represents a latent intercept, Ui2represents a latent slope, zijrepresents the repeated binary predic- tor and Mijrepresents the repeated continuous media- tor. The errors in the structural model are normallydistributed with cov( 1,2)=,c o v ( 3:8)= and (2 +j)~N ( 0 ,). This model can be represented in a path diagram (Figure 1), a visual display of theinterrelationships between va riables typically presented along with SEMs. The parameters of the SEM defined in Equations 2 - 5 include: l, which represents the effect of the repeated mediator on the repeated outcome; g1, which represents the effect the repeated primary independent variables on the repeated mediator; g2, which represents the effect of the continuous covariate on the repeated outcomes; and /C20, which represents the effect of the repeated indepen- dent variable on the repeated outcome. In this simulation study we focused on the total effect of the repeated binary predictor and the repeated binaryoutcome, which is represented by lg 1+/C20. The interpre- tation of the parameters of this model is subject-specific since it represents the effect of a predictor on the out- come when the individual intercept, individual slope andmediator value are held constant. When the structural model Equations (3-5) are substi- tuted into the measurement model Equation 2, the fullmodel can be rewritten as: Y j=j+1+tj2+2+j+j where j=(a1+la3)+g 2w+a2tj+(/C20+lg1)zj.

Non-linear mixed effects model The following NLMM was evaluated in comparison tothe SEM: Y j=0+1w+2tj+3zj+b1+b2tj+ej. (8) where b1is a random individual intercept and b2is a random individual slope. Since the objective is to evalu-ate the total effect of the main independent variable, themediator is excluded from this model [20]. The regres-sion coefficient associated with the primary predictor Figure 1 Path diagram . The non-linear structural equation model defined in Equations 2 to 5.Blood and Cheng BMC Medical Research Methodology 2012, 12:5 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/12/5Page 3 of 10(b3) therefore represents its total (i.e. direct plus indir- ect) effect on the outcome [14]. Probit NLMM The probit model assumes ej~Logistic + exp( j+b can be fit with SAS PROC NLMIXED which estimates parameters via maximum likelihood [ 2 1 ] .W en o t et h a tt h er e g r e s sion coefficients of the NLMM are interpreted conditional on the random indi- vidual intercept and random individual slope, but mar- ginal on the residual error of the mediator (since themediator is not included in the model). Comparing NLMMs to SEMs As noted previously, the SEM and NLMM condition dif-ferently on the mediating variable. Specifically, the SEMconditions on the random intercept and slope as well as on the residual variance of the mediating variable, while the NLMM conditions only on the random interceptand random individual slo pe. Thus estimates from the two types of models are not directly incomparable.Instead, to compare parameters from the NLMM tothat of the SEM, we must first re-scale the regressioncoefficient from the NLMM so that it represents theeffect of the primary predictor variable z jconditional on the mediator. To determine the scaling factor, werewrite the SEM (for both the probit and logistic mod-els) conditional only on the variance of the randomintercept and slope to mimic the conditioning in theNLMM. Comparing probit models For the probit SEM, we generated the data according tothe model described in Equations 6 and 7. Conditioning only on the variances of the random intercept and slope ( 1and 2), but not on the variance of the mediator ( 2 +j), that: E(Y|1,2)=P ( =P (j+2+j>(j+1+tj2)|1,2).(11) The sum of terms on the left-hand side of the inequal- ity do not have a standard normal distribution since l2 +jis added to /C15jwhich itself has a standard normaldistribution. In order to express the probability in Equa-tion 11 using the standard normal cumulative probabil-ity function, we re-scale the terms on either side of theinequality by the standard deviation of /C15 j+l2+jto create normal random variable: =/Phi1/parenleftbigg(j+1+2tj 1+2/parenrightbigg of the random indi- vidual intercept and slope, all regression coefficients aredivided by the factor 1+2. For example, the regres- associated with zj, which was /C20+lg1,i s now+1 1+2. Thus, the model parameters from the SEM are scaled to the variance of /C15j+l2+jwhich is 1 + l2and the model parameters from the NLMM are scaled to the variance of /C15jwhich is 1, resulting in a scaling factor of/radicalbigg 1+2 1Parameter estimates from the SEM and NLMM must be on the same scale beforemaking direct comparisons. For example, the total effectof the main independent variable from the probitNLMM, b 3, which is also conditioned only on the ran- dom individual intercept and slope (Equation 9) shouldbe multiplied by a factor of 1+2before it is com- pared to the total effect from the probit SEM, /C20+lg71. Direct comparisons of parameter estimates from theNLMM to those from the SEM without first re-scalingwould underestimate effects by a factor of 1+2.I n the current study we present the conditional total effectestimates from the SEM and compare them to scaledand unscaled NLMM estimates. Note that in the analy-sis of real (i.e. non-simulated) data, true parameter values are unknown and therefore must be estimated. We describe in the appendix two approaches for rescal-ing estimates in practice to allow direct comparisonsbetween NLMMs and SEMs or to compute mediatedeffects via NLMMs only. Comparing logistic models Unlike the probit model, when the logit SEM is condi-tioned on only the random intercept and slope, the true relationship between the pre dictor and the outcome no longer follows a logistic model. That is, the distribution of the terms on the left-hand side of Equation 11 in alogit SEM does not follow a logistic distribution sincethe sum of a normal random variable (/C15 j) and logistic random variable ( 2+j) does not follow a logistic distribu- tion. The result of this is that the scaled coefficientsfrom the logit NLMM only approximate the mediated relationship described in a logit SEM. A similar situation occurs, for example, when comparing a non-linearBlood and Cheng BMC Medical Research Methodology 2012, 12:5 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/12/5Page 4 of 10mixed model to a non-linear generalized estimating equation as noted by Fitzmaurice, Laird, and Ware [18]. The scale factor for the logit model is created in the same was as it was for the probit model. The regressioncoefficient representing the total effect of the main inde-pendent variable (b 3) from the logit NLMM, can be multiplied by the standard deviation of /C15j+l2+jand divided by the standard deviation of /C15j. The scaling fac- tor for the logit model is therefore: /bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg2 3+2/parenrightbigg /2 3/bracketrightbigg1 2. Simulation plan Data generation and model fitting Because the goal of this study was to evaluate the per-formance of NLMM relative to SEMs in the settingwhere the SEM is presumed to be optimal, the SEM fra-mework was used to generate the mediated binary datafor the simulation studies. Data were generated accord-ing to Equations 2-5. For the probit model, errors inEquation 2 were assumed to be independent standardnormal random variates. For the logistic model, the errors in Equation 2 were assumed to be independent standard logistic random variates. Data generation wasrepeated to create 1000 datasets. NLMM were fit withSAS (Version 9.2) PROC NLMIXED and SEM were fitwith Mplus (Version 5.2). Simulated data scenarios We evaluated the performance of NLMM against SEM across several scenarios by examining the following: \u0081Sample size: ranging from 100 to 1000. The range of sample sizes was chosen to evaluate sample sizes that achieved adequate power with a moderate effectsize.\u0081Effect size: ranging from 0.2 to 0.5. The range of effect sizes represent small to moderate effect sizes as defined by Cohen [22]. \u0081Distribution of effects: three cases were evaluated: equally distributed direct and indirect effects, pri- marily direct effects of the main independent vari-able, and primarily indirect effects of the mainindependent variable. The total effect sizes (0.3 forprobit models and 0.4 for logit models) were chosensuch that adequate power was obtained when direct and indirect effects were equally distributed. Model performance was assessed based on the follow- ing: 1) Bias- the difference between the true parameter value and the mean observed parameter value dividedby the true parameter value; 2) Coverage probability-the percentage of the 1000 95% confidence intervals thatcontained the true parameter value; 3) Power - the per-centage of the 1000 datasets in which the null hypoth-esis that the total effect of the main independentvariable is equal to zero was statistically significant. Results Logistic link The results evaluating the conditional total effect fromsimulations evaluating sample size are displayed inTable 1. For the logistic model, a sample size of 700 wasrequired to obtain adequate (83%) power to detect amoderate effect size (0.3) for both the SEM and NLMM.Across all sample sizes, the estimates of power for the scaled NLMM were comparable to the SEM. As expected, for the unscaled NLMM, effects were underes-timated in all cases. For example with a sample size of600, the bias of the SEM was -0.6% while the bias forthe unscaled NLMM was -3.8% and the bias of thescaled NLMM was -1.6%. Once the scale factor wasapplied to the NLMM, however, the estimated biasdecreased and the power and coverage probability esti- mates were similar to that of the SEM. The results for the unscaled NLMM are therefore not described in sub-sequent tables as they are not directly comparable tothe SEM results. The results of the simulations in which the effect size (Table 2) and effect distribution (Table 3) were variedalso demonstrated that the appropriately scaled NLMMproduced comparable estimates of the total effect of the exposure relative to the SEM. The scaled NLMM results were similar to the comparison SEM with low bias at alleffect sizes (ranging from -2.0% to 0.4%) and effect dis-tributions (ranging from -1 .4% to -1.0%). As expected, the models showed increasing power with increasingeffect sizes (e.g., from 37% power for an effect size of0.2 to 98% power for an effect size of 0.5) and powerwas highest (91%) when the effect distribution was pri- marily direct. Probit models For the probit model, the SEM showed consistent posi- tive bias (i.e., no simulation scenario with the probitmodel resulted in a negati ve bias for the probit SEM). For example, the estimated bias for a sample size of 100was 51.5% and decreased to 7.5% with a sample size of 1000. In comparison, the scaled NLMM had bias ran- ging from 2.7% to -2.1%. Notably, the estimated powerfor the NLMM was consistently higher than that of thecomparison SEM. In the effect size simulation scenarios,bias in the SEM appeared to increase with effect size(effect sizes of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 resulted in biases of7.6%, 8.8%, and 11.7%, respectively). In contrast, theBlood and Cheng BMC Medical Research Methodology 2012, 12:5 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/12/5Page 5 of 10probit NLMM showed relatively small bias (-0.7% to 1.7%) for all effect sizes. For the probit model, the scaled NLMM generally performed better than the SEM, across a range of sample sizes, effect sizes, and effect distribu-tions, with higher estimated power and lower bias. Positive bias in probit models We explored possible explanations of the unexpectedpositive bias observed for the probit SEM models. Werepeated simulations by first eliminating mediation from the simulated scenarios to evaluate whether the positive bias in the SEM persisted i n unmediated settings. In addition, we assessed diffe rent estimation methods,including WLSMV (implemented in MPlus software)and also maximum likelihood using iteratively re- weighted least squares (implemented in Splus and SAS). We found that the mean regression coefficient estimatesusing WLSMV had larger bias in nearly all cases com-pared to estimates using maximum likelihood and itera-tively reweighted least squares (Table 4). The positivebias for the WLSMV method was avoided only with asample size of 5000. Our results suggest that theWLSMV, which is used by Mplus, may produce posi- tively biased results. This bias was also present, however to a smaller degree, in the NLMM fit with maximumlikelihood.Table 1 Impact of sample size.

Samet et al. have previously reported the ana-lyses from this longitudinal cohort study [23]. The original analyses combined data from two cohorts (the HIV-ALC and HIV-LIVE cohorts), however, to illustrate the models evaluated in this paper, we have used datafrom the HIV-LIVE study only. For clarity of presenta-tion, we limited the analyses to subjects who reportedany ART use during follow-up, had complete data onthe first four time-points (as Mplus and SAS have differ-ent methods for handling missing data in these models), and examined only the following key variables: heavy alcohol consumption (yes vs. no), the main independentvariable; ART adherence (percentage of pills taken inthe last three days), the mediator; age, a potential con-founder; and low CD4 cell count (dichotomized at <350cells /L), the primary outcome. Each variable was assessed every six months for up to four years, however for the current example only the first four time-points were analyzed in order to maximize the number of sub-jects with complete data. The resulting dataset was com-posed of 98 individuals contributing 392 observations.The total effect of heavy alcohol consumption on lowCD4 cell count was not significant for any of the SEMsor NLMMs fit to the data. For the logit SEM, the totaleffect estimate (SE) was 0.554(1.246) with an associated p-value of 0.66. The scaled result from the logit NLMM was similar: estimated total effect (SE) = 0.5107(0.701),p = 0.47. However for the probit link, the estimatedtotal effects (SE) from the SEM and con-sistent with the results from the simulation study, thelogit SEM and NLMM produced similar estimates in the real data example, whereas the probit SEM produced estimated effects that appe ared much larger in magni- tude in comparison to the probit NLMM. Discussion The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfor-mance of NLMMs relative to SEMs in the analysis ofmediated longitudinal binary outcomes in a setting where the SEM is presumed to be optimal. We found model performance differed based on the link functionthat was used in the non-linear portion of the models.Based on simulations performed across a variety of set-tings, the logistic NLMM performed well with respectto bias, coverage probability and power relative to thelogistic SEM. The results were similar for the SEM andscaled NLMM in the logistic model setting, with both accurately estimating the effect of the time-dependentTable 3 Impact of effect distribution.

Applica- tion of these techniques to a real-date example from aprospective cohort assessing the effect of heavy alcoholconsumption on low CD4 cell count also illustrate thesimilarity of results from the logit SEM and NLMM. For the probit model, however, the SEM consistently overestimated the total effects of the predictor and gen-erally had larger bias and lower power compared to theNLMM in both mediated and non-mediated data. Thelarger bias may be due to the weighted least squaresestimation method used for the probit SEMs (fit withMplus), which differs from the maximum likelihoodestimation method used for the NLMM (fit with SAS)and for the logistic SEM (fit with Mplus). In contrast to the SEM, the scaled probit NLMM had good perfor- mance (low bias and high power and coverage probabil-ity) with adequate sample sizes. Similar results wereobserved in the real data example where estimates fromthe probit SEM appeared larger than those from theprobit NLMM. The results showing similar estimated effects for the SEM and NLMM in the logistic model setting are simi- lar to results seen in the non-mediated case where SEM was compared to the generalized estimating equations (anon-SEM) technique. Palta and Lin [17] compared pro-bit models for SEM and generalized estimating equa-tions in the analysis of data from a cohort study andfound that when appropriately scaled, the two modelsyielded similar results. The y noted, however, that the SEM allowed for more flexible specification of variance structure and therefore allowed coefficients to be scaled to provide marginal or cluster-specific interpretation. To obtain scaled NLMM estimates in practice, it may be preferable to model the mediation by fitting separateequations, one for each pathway, using maximum likeli-hood rather than weighted least squares (the only esti-mation method currently available for probit linkmodels in MPlus). The potential burden of fitting multi- ple equations separately rather than simultaneously using SEMs may be outweighed by the benefit of usingmaximum likelihood estimation which, in the probitmodel simulations, appeared to produce less biasedresults. In addition, estimating scale parameters andusing the product of coefficients method appears to pro-duce acceptable estimates of the total effect of the expo-sure. Our study demonstrated that results using this approach were similar to those obtained when NLMM results were scaled using true parameter values. If indir-ect effects are of interest and the NLMM is used to ana-lyze the mediated longitudinal binary data, scaling willalso be necessary. Unlike the case with linear models forcontinuous outcome data, the product of coefficientsmethod is not equivalent to the \"difference of coeffi- cients \"method of determining the indirect or mediatedeffect [24] in the case of binary outcomes. Using the dif-ference of coefficients app roach in linear models, the total effect is obtained by fitting a model that excludesthe mediating variable and the direct effect is obtainedby fitting a model including the mediating variable. Theindirect effect is then determined by taking the differ- ence between the total effect and direct effect. However, in the binary case, the scale of the direct effect obtainedfrom a model that includes the mediating variable is dif-ferent from the scale of the total effect obtained from amodel that excludes the mediating variable [16]. Asdemonstrated by MacKinnon et al., to obtain compar-able estimates of the indirect effect in binary outcomemodels, the total effect must be appropriately scaled before the difference is taken. This study presents results based on simulated data from a single-mediator model. Conclusions from these results may not be generalizable to scenarios with differ-ent data characteristics. For example, in scenarios withmultiple mediators and pathways, the advantages anddisadvantages of NLMMs SEMs may differ.The performance of NLMMs and SEMs in other scenar- ios, such as the analysis of nominal and ordinal out- comes as well as the case of multiple mediators, shouldbe evaluated in future studies. Conclusions Overall, we found the NLMM performed sufficientlywell in the analysis of mediated longitudinal binary out-comes with respect to bias, coverage probability, and power. Under the logistic model, both the NLMM and SEM had acceptable performance and the results for thetwo types of models were similar. The NLMM requiresscaling of the regression pa rameters and this scaling requires fitting additional mo dels to separately estimate direct effects of the predictor, and effects of the primarypredictor on the mediator. An advantage of the SEM isthat it can fit all of the linear and non-linear models simultaneously, avoiding the burden of fitting multiple models. For the probit model, however, the SEM esti-mated using weighted least squares may overestimateeffects. In contrast, the NLMM appears to perform ade-quately across a range of settings and therefore is pre-ferred over the SEM for probit models. Appendix Estimating the Scaling Factor for Total Effect Estimates Scaling effect estimates is necessary to obtain total effectestimates that represent the total effect of the predictoron the outcome, conditional on the mediation. This isthe case when one wishes to compare estimates from SEMs to estimates from NLMMs, but also necessary ifone wishes to compute indirect (i.e. mediated) effectsusing results from NLMMs only. The difference in scaleBlood and Cheng BMC Medical Research Methodology 2012, 12:5 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/12/5Page 8 of 10for models with differing sets of predictors is due to the variance of the residual error term being fixed. This isnot an issue in linear models where this variance is esti-mated rather than fixed [16-18]. In practice, theunknown parameters necessary for scaling, i.e. (the variance of /C15 jand l(the effect of the mediator on the outcome), can be estimated by fitting the following addi-tional models: Mj=0+1zj+j (12) 1(Yj)=0+1w+2tj+3zj+4Mj+b1+b2tj(13) The first model (Equation 12) is similar to part of the structural model in the SEM (Equation 5), but instead is fit as a general linear model for longitudinal data with Mjas the outcome and zjas the predictor that allows correlation between the repeated observa-tions. Using data from the alcohol and HIV exampledescribed earlier, this would be a model with longitu-dinal ART adherence measures as the outcome andmeasures of heavy alcohol co nsumption as time-vary- ing predictors. The second model is an NLMM model- ingY jas a function of a random intercept and slope, and fixed effects for the continuous covariate ( w), time (tj), the repeated binary predictor ( zj), and the repeated mediator ( Mj). For the HIV example, this would be a model with low CD4 count as the outcome and include both heavy alcohol consumption and ARTadherence as predictors. Using Equations 12 and 13, the estimated variance of /C15 jprovides an estimate of and the estimated coefficient b4associated with Mjprovides an estimate of l.T h e original, unscaled NLMM estimate of the total effect ofthe primary predictor, b 3from Equation 8), can then be rescaled by multiplying by model). An alternative approach to using scaled regression coefficients would be to model indirect and direct path- ways separately and obtain the total effect by summing the indirect and direct effects. That is, estimates of thecoefficients b 3andb4associated with zjand Mj, respec- tively (from Equation 13) can be used along with esti-mates of the coefficient a 1associated with zj(from Equation 12) to obtain the estimated total effect of the main independent variable 3+14. In the current simulation study, we calculated the total effects of the main independent variable using both of the approaches described above. For the probitmodel, both methods yielded results comparable tothose where the true parameters were known. Therescaled NLMM resulted in a parameter estimate (stan-dard error) of 0.407 (0.105) which is a bias of 1.7%. Theproduct of coefficients method yielded an estimate of0.400 (0.102), which is a bias of 1.7%. Both estimateswere very similar to those obtained using true values for the scaling factor, parameter estimate of 0.407 (0.096) and bias of 1.7%.

BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled hypertension remains a significant problem for many patients. Few interven- tions to improve patients 'hypertension self-manage- ment have had lasting effects. Previous work hasfocused largely on patients 'beliefs as predictors of behavior, but little is understood about beliefs as they are embedded in patients 'social contexts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore how patients ' \"explanatory models \"of hypertension (understandings of the causes, mechanisms or pathophysiology, courseof illness, symptoms and effects of treatment) and socialcontext relate to their reported daily hypertension self- management behaviors. DESIGN: Semi-structured qualitative interviews with a diverse group of patients at two large urban Veterans Administration Medical centers. PARTICIPANTS (OR PATIENTS OR SUBJECTS): Afri- can-American, white and Latino Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care patients with uncontrolled blood pressure. APPROACH: We conducted thematic analysis using tools of grounded theory to identify key themes sur-rounding patients 'explanatory models, social context and hypertension management behaviors. RESULTS: Patients 'perceptions of the cause and course of hypertension, experiences of hypertension symptoms, and beliefs about the effectiveness of treatment were related to different hypertension self-managementbehaviors. Moreover, patients 'daily-lived experiences, such as an isolated lifestyle, serious competing health problems, a lack of habits and routines, barriers toexercise and prioritizing lifestyle choices, also interfered with optimal hypertension self-management. CONCLUSIONS: Designing interventions to improve patients 'hypertension self-management requires con- sideration of patients 'explanatory models and theirdaily-lived experience. We propose a new conceptual model \u2014the dynamic model of hypertension self- management behavior \u2014which incorporates these key elements of patients 'experiences.

Thus, finding ways to improve hyper- tension self-management remains a significant challenge. Prior interventions have included educating patients about hypertension, improving BP self-monitoring at home, and nurse or pharmacist-led care. A recent Cochrane review found that purely educational interventions improvedpatient knowledge but were largely ineffective in improving hypertension control. Patient self-monitoring and nurse or pharmacist-led interventions held greater promise, althoughresults were heterogeneous. 7 One reason for the failure of purely educational interven- tions may be that they lack a patient-centered focus, therebyfailing to address patients 'unique barriers to hypertensionReceived October 11, 2011 Revised April 11, 2012Accepted June 5, 2012Published online July 21, 2012 1626self-management. A patient-centered approach would incor- porate how patients understand hypertension, attempt to manage hypertension, and prioritize its management in theirlives. Many interventions are built upon theories that beliefs or illness perceptions drive patients 'illness self-manage- ment. 8,9Kleinman10reframes beliefs as integrated \"explan- atory models (EMs) \"\u2014 patients 'understanding of the causes, pathophysiology, course of illness, symptoms, and effects of treatment. EMs of an illness like hypertension aresituated within social contexts; they are formed and persist in the context of the communities in which patients live. Thus, in order to influence health-related self-management behav-iors, one must understand both patients 'beliefs about an illness and their social context. Further understanding hypertension self-management expe- riences would foster a patient-centered approach to hyper- tension control. Previous studies have examined patients ' 'lay'models of hypertension, 11-13but not how EMs relate to social context, or how they impact various hypertension self- management behaviors. In this qualitative study, we extend prior work by examining patients 'EMs, social contexts, and hypertension self-management behaviors. We explore these aspects of patients 'hypertension experiences and propose a new conceptual model of patients 'illness self-management. METHODS Participants and Recruitment We recruited a purposive sample of African-American, white and Latino patients with uncontrolled hypertension from primary care clinics at two large US Veterans Affairs (V A)Medical Centers serving diverse populations located in the Northeast and Southwest, respectively. In a 1-year period, we sought to recruit 20 patients from each racial/ethnic group toobtain a wide range of responses, with the expectation that we would reach thematic saturation for a diverse population. Each site 's institutional review board approved the study. Patients were eligible to participate if they had a diagnosis of hypertension and uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) ( 140/ 90 mmHg) documented at least once in the previous 6 monthsin the V A 's electronic medical record, and a BP>140/90 mmHg at their primary care visit. A research assistant (RA) called patients prior to their appointment to invite partic-ipation. At the visit, the RA administered eligibility screen- ing, collected demographic information, took BP readings and obtained written informed consent. The data werecollected between February 2007 and June 2008. Data Collection A trained RA conducted semi-structured 1.5 hour inter- views with patients. A $20.00 gift card was given forparticipation. Patients were asked to describe their family, a typical day, experiences living with hypertension, knowl- edge about hypertension, what they thought caused hyper-tension, the severity of their hypertension, their concernsabout hypertension, communication with their provider, and medications and strategies they used to manage their hypertension. Data Analysis Interviews were audio-recorded, professionally transcribed verbatim, and reviewed for accuracy. We used qualitativeanalytic techniques informed by grounded theory. 14,15We started by exploring how EMs affected hypertension self- management. Consistent with a grounded theory approach, we sought to identify other aspects of patient experience emergent in the data. Five team members began by opencoding five transcripts together, identifying themes grounded in participants 'language, and generating a coding dictionary that was refined with coding of subsequentinterviews. We collapsed codes into broader categories, informed by the data and EM categories of \"cause, \" \"course, \"\"pathophysiology, \"\"symptoms, \"and\"treatment, \" and by aspects of social context. We identified participants ' hypertension self-management behaviors \u2014reports of what they did to control their hypertension \u2014and developed summary templates describing each participant 'sE M s , social context, hypertension self-management behaviors, perceptions of clinical encounters, and primary barrier tohypertension self-management. Investigators paired up to analyze subsequent interviews and complete templates, which were reviewed by the entire team, and cases werecontrasted using constant comparison analysis. Throughout the analytic process, we iteratively refined conceptual links between constructs to develop a conceptual model. RESULTS We interviewed 48 patients (19 African-American, 20white, and 9 Hispanic). We failed to recruit the targetnumber of Hispanic patients, due to the relatively low Hispanic prevalence at our sites and greater participation refusal. The average age was 60; 92 % were men; 88 % hadat least a high school degree, and yet income was low (see Table 1). The average BP at the clinic visit was 160/93 mmHg. We identified two major domains affecting patients ' hypertension self-management behaviors: 1) four different aspects of EMs, including beliefs regarding the cause of hypertension, hypertension symptoms, the illness course(including whether they thought hypertension was chronic or intermittent), and treatment value and effects; and 2) aspects of patients 'social context, routines, habits, and1627 Bokhour et al.: Hypertension Explanatory Models and Daily-Lived Experience JGIMcompeting health problems, which we termed \"daily-lived experience \"(DLE). Patients described a wide range of EMs and DLEs that adversely affected their hypertension self-management behaviors and BP control (Tables 2and3). We first treat EM and DLE as separate and provide exemplary quotesdemonstrating how EMs and DLEs were related to patients ' reported hypertension self-management behaviors. We then show how EMs and DLEs may relate to one another inshaping self-management, and describe the resulting con- ceptual model. For 47 of the 48 patients we interviewed, we identified at least one EM or DLE that adversely affected their hypertension self-management behavior. We did not identify any unique racial/ethnic differences in EMs orDLE. Explanatory Models (EMs) One aspect of EMs was notably absent from patients ' interviews: pathophysiology, or a biomedical conceptuali-zation of the condition. Few p atients described their understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertension, and when they did, these understandings were not linked tohypertension self-management behaviors. In contrast, per- ceptions of cause, illness course, symptoms, and treatment were related to self-management in several ways. Cause. When asked what caused their high BP, patients ' responses corresponded to notions of both the chronicdisease of hypertension and to a temporary increase in BP associated with daily activities. Patients did not distinguish these two 'illnesses, 'and often engaged in behaviors to avoid the latter, rather than behaviors that addressed biomedically attributed causes of hypertension . Patients noted causes including: 1) heredity, 2) general life stress, 3)poor diet (especially salt intake), and 4) lack of exercise.Patients also described causes typically associated with temporary rises in BP: 1) increased situational stress, 2)pain, and 3) exercising. Hypertension self-management behaviors were related to both types of perceived causes. For example, one woman who responded that stress was thecause of her hypertension went on to say:Table 1.

Lack of routines and an unstructured lifestyleForgets to take medications; misses doctor appointments. Experiences medication side effects, such as impotenceDecides not to take medications. Frequent alcohol use Avoids medications while drinking, doubles up on medications when not drinking.1628 Bokhour et al.: Hypertension Explanatory Models and Daily-Lived Experience JGIM\"I think that my main reason for moving upstate is to find tranquility and maybe calm myself. And I keep saying, if I move upstate, I won 't have hypertension, I probably will not need medication, the lifestyle 's going to be different, it 'll be more relaxed.\" (#1 - Latino woman, age 51) This woman had described a complex, stressful city life, including work and family stressors. Her EM that stress was the cause of her hypertension, reflected in her statement thatif she moved she would no longer have hypertension, led her to consider altering her living situation. This view could perhaps contribute to poorer medication adherence. Course of Illness. The course of illness refers to patients ' perceptions of the path, controllability and severity of the illness. Some patients viewed hypertension as an intermittent problem that comes and goes. They were notconcerned with hypertension as a chronic problem that needed constant management; rather, they focused on it when they knew their BP was high. For example, onewoman stated: \"If my blood pressure is anywhere between, let 's say, 190 over 100, then I 'mo k a y .A sf a ra sI 'm concerned, I feel fine ....right now that 's what it 's running about. And I 'm still taking my medicine, though I 'm not up to the max dose that I was up to before. So in my eyes, I 'm fine. ...if after a point ... it starts creeping up to 220 over 120, then I have todo something at that point. It 's getting too high. I know that. But if it 's in the low 90, 180 range, to me, that's not considered high for me. Because I feel I 'm still feeling fine. I can function.\" (#2 -African American woman, age 53) This woman expressed an EM of hypertension as intermittent; moreover, 'normal BP 'for her is incongruent with the biomedical view of poor hypertension control. Subsequently, she altered her self-management behavior depending on her EM of 'high'blood pressure. She hinted that how she feels and functions, rather than an objective measurement, changes her behavior. Symptoms. Patients discussed symptoms of hypertension in two ways: 1) \"There are no symptoms of hypertension, \"or 2) \"I can feel when my blood pressure is high \"(see the previous quote). In the first view, patients stated that since they did not have any symptoms associated with their hypertension, there was no need to adhere to hypertension managementrecommendations. One man who didn 't have symptoms stated: \"[Hypertension] doesn 't affect me. If it would just hit me,\"boom! \"and it would like put me to a pointwhere I was ...I'm getting dizzy from eating bacon or whatever, then I would change that, I wouldn 'td o that. But it hasn 't.\" (#3 -African American man, age 73) H ee x p r e s s e da nE Mi nw h i c ht h ep r e s e n c eo f symptoms indicated a need for concern, incongruous withthe view of hypertension as the silent killer. Subsequently, he continued to eat bacon, despite recommendations to the contrary. Other patients described hypertension symptoms includ- ing headaches, \"pressure on your chest, \"feeling \"queasy or uneasy, \"neck aches, backaches, or racing pulse. One man described having a headache and feeling \"the blood [rush] to your head. \"Many of these patients altered their hyper- tension self-management behaviors depending on theirsymptoms. One man stated: \"I can almost tell when it 's a little bit getting higher, I start feeling a little different in my head, you know, it's like a headache or something, like a little pressure. So I back off on eating (inaudible) and whatnot, or I take an extra pill on that day. I mean, I usually take two, and I would do that and it sort oflevels it again. Or I really stop eating everything that has salt and sodium ...and that seems to work.\" (#4 -Latino man, age 63) The EM that high blood pressure produces symptoms led him to alter his medication and diet depending upon his symptoms. This behavior, in turn, may contribute to poorlycontrolled BP. Treatment. Beliefs about treatment effectiveness shaped hypertension self-management, and were linked to patients ' perceptions of causes and symptoms. Some endorsed taking medications, altering diet and engaging in exercise as effective treatment. Others, such as the following man,expressed concerns about taking medications for BPcontrol, and altered treatment accordingly. \"Higher dosages concern me. I felt that my pressure was higher than .... I must have done something and it started getting higher, and I came to your walk-inclinic. And I was given a higher dosage. And I didn 't take it, I just went home and I relaxed. I think I might have taken one actually, or one-half.\" (#5 - Latino man, age 63) This man 'sE Mt h a th i g hm e d i c a t i o nd o s e sm a yb e harmful led him to rely more on relaxation than taking medications to control his hypertension. Note this behav- ior also reflects an EM that relaxation is an effectivetreatment.1629 Bokhour et al.: Hypertension Explanatory Models and Daily-Lived Experience JGIMAnother man stated that he didn 't like taking medication, liked to drink and smoke, and that only exercising would control his hypertension: \"So, like I run. I run, until I, you know, I 'm tired and can't run any more. I stop. I sit. I collect myself and then I go again. ...I smoke, so I work on my lungs as much as I can. And the thing is I 'm trying to clear them so I can breathe better and basically have morewind...But now, I 'mo n \u2014they got me on \u2014blood pressure pills. I 'm taking medication for high blood pressure.\"INTERVIEWER:\"Right. And how many are you on for blood pressure?\" \"Just\u2014I take one a day. You know, sometimes I do. Sometimes I miss it, you know. But my doctor, my primary care doctor, she wants me to take these every day. I don 't like medication too much. I like natural things.\" (#6 -African American man, age 64) His EM was that taking medication was unnatural, and therefore concerning. Despite his acknowledgement that smoking is bad for him, he expressed an EM that getting exercise can overcome negative effects from smoking. Hesubsequently relied solely on exercise to control his BP. Daily-Lived Experience (DLE) Patients were asked to tell the interviewer about their livesand describe a typical day. The ways patients managed theirhypertension were often embedded in descriptions of their daily activities. We identified five aspects of patients 'DLE that were related to hypertension self-management behav-iors: 1) isolated lifestyle, 2) serious competing health problems, 3) lack of habits and routines, 4) barriers to exercise, and 5) prioritizing lifestyle choices (Table 3). Below we provide some exemplars, noting also how patients 'EMs intersected with DLE. Lonely and Isolated Lifestyle. Many patients lived alone, were retired, unemployed, or on disability. Subsequently,they had little regular daily social interaction. One exception was venturing out to a local diner for daily meals, through which they attained the social interactionnecessary to sustain their mental health. This practice, however, meant that they had little control over the amount of salt in their food. One man stated: \"I live alone, you know? So I don 't like cooking for one person. So I always go someplace to get lunches or dinners or whatever, or I go out and eat. Eveneggs, you know, you can have a pinch of sodium in eggs, they already have it; they have sodium already. So everything that I eat might have sodium, and thatlittle bit could bring it way up\". (#7 -Latino man, age 61) This man 's EM was that sodium was bad for his hypertension. However, his DLE included eating at restau- rants for social engagement, interfering with his ability to control his sodium intake. Serious Competing Health Problems. Most participants had multiple co-occurring illnesses that competed withtheir hypertension self-management. Some confused hypertension treatment regimens with regimens for other conditions. Problems such as having arthritis or pain interfered with following exe rcise recommendations. For others, controlling hypertension was not consideredimportant relative to other conditions. For example, when asked about how concerned he was about hypertension, one man who was HIV positive and had diabetesresponded: \"I'm not at all concerned about it, because I got the HIV and I got the diabetes. And high blood pressure is just another one.\" INTERVIEWER: \"How has it affected your overallhealth, if in any way?\" \"I think I keep saying, to the best of my knowledge, I don 't feel it anywhere.\" (#8 -African American man, age 67) The DLE of having other competing health problems to manage interfered with this man's hypertension self-man-agement. His EM of hypertension as symptomless further rendered it unimportant relative to his other health problems. Lack of habits and routines. Some patients described highly unstructured lifestyles with few routines, and forgetting to take medications. When asked by the interviewer what made it difficult for him to lower his BP,one man replied: \"Some very simple things. First of all, sometimes I scrap my morning routine. Sometimes I get up in the morning. By the time I realize, 'Oh, I didn 't take my medicine yet, 'it's one or two in the afternoon, okay.\" (#9-white man, age 54) This man 's DLE included disrupted routines, which subsequently resulted in not taking his medication as prescribed. This disruption, rather than any EM about his medications, interfered with medication adherence andhypertension control. Others had unpredictable daily lives. One man described working on a boat at sea, during which time he often forgot1630 Bokhour et al.: Hypertension Explanatory Models and Daily-Lived Experience JGIMto bring enough medication, was unable to obtain refills, and sometimes forgot to take it. He also described difficulty controlling his diet, as the ship 's cook prepared very salty food. Thus, despite having medication and limiting salt as part of his EM for controlling BP, his daily life presented barriers to doing so. Barriers to Exercise. Many participants expressed an EM that exercise was important to managing their hypertension, but they experienced barriers to exercising. One barrier wasother health conditions, such as arthritis, that prevented them from engaging in exercise. Another was an unsafe environment. One man explained: \"I do the exercise. Sometimes I go out and I walk up and down the steps. ...'You do that for 30 minutes, 'Is a i d , 'It is almost equivalent to walking a mile '... because in my neighborhood, it is not real safe to be walking around, up and down thestreet.\" INTERVIEWER: \"They got loose dogs everywhere, huh?\"\"Not only the dogs, gangsters.\" (#10 -white man, age 64) This man 's DLE of living in an unsafe neighborhood challenged his ability to get his desired exercise, despite the fact that he endorsed an EM in which exercise helps control BP. Prioritizing Lifestyle Choices. Patients described lifestyle choices that affected their hypertension self-management. For example, one man stated that he \"liked to drink. \" \"Sometimes I wouldn 't take [BP medication] for two or three days because I 'm drinking. And when I continue, I 'll take two for a couple days, and that 's it. You know, if I feel my pressure is too high so I just double-dose, you get it? Only for a couple days, and then I go back to the regular dose.\" (#11 -African American man, age 57) Drinking alcohol was part of his DLE. He understood the potential problems of drinking while taking hismedication, so he altered his medication use. He also expressed an EM of the effects of treatment: the total amount of medication taken in a week is important, ratherthan daily adherence. EMs and DLE Together Patients 'narratives about their hypertension reveal the intertwined nature of EMs and DLEs. In some instances,the EM might drive DLE and behavior. For example, in quote #5, the gentleman 's EM is that he doesn 't wish to take medications because they aren 't natural. This sub- sequently drives his behavior around exercising, which is something that he cando in his daily life. In other cases, DLE might drive the EM. In quote #1, the woman described a DLE in which stress was prevalent in the inner city context in which she lived. She attributed her high BP to this stressful life context, and in turn, believedthat moving to a more peaceful setting would control her BP. If she moved, and her BP did not improve, this could alter her EM about the cause of her hypertension. Conversely, there are instances where patients 'DLE interfered with their abilities to act on their EM. This is especially salient in the case of sodium intake. Manypatients reported that lowering their salt intake was important for controlling their BP, but as noted in quote #7, eating out and eating prepared foods limited patients ' abilities to control their salt intake. This in turn may reinforce an EM that excess salt causes hypertension. Conceptual links between these constructs resulted in the development of the Dynamic Model of Chronic Disease Self-Management (see Fig. 1). In this model, EMs and DLE continually shape one another in relationship to behavior,and may change over the course of a patient 's illness, as has been noted in our childhood asthma work. 16When discussing EMs and DLEs, patients suggested that commu-nication with providers was also important to their self- management. Research supports the importance of this dimension on patient adherence. 17Thus, we also include patient-provider communication in the model. DISCUSSION Patients 'reports of their EMs and DLEs demonstrate that hypertension self-management does not occur primarily in the doctor 's office. Rather, patients self-manage their hypertension in complex social contexts, in which theydevelop hypertension EMs while engaging in daily activ- ities. Our findings show different ways in which EMs and DLEs can affect patients 'hypertension self-management, including adherence to medications and recommended healthy behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated how differences in EMs affect patients 'illness management behaviors 13,18 and confirm our finding that patients 'EMs lead patients toward particular hypertension self-management behaviors that may interfere with hypertension control.1912. Huertin-Roberts12found that African American women differentiated between \"high blood pressure, \"thought to be responsive to diet and medication changes, and \"high- pertension, \"a disease of the nerves caused by stress and factors that elicit emotional upset, and responsive to stress1631 Bokhour et al.: Hypertension Explanatory Models and Daily-Lived Experience JGIMrelief rather than antihypertensives. Others have found that medication beliefs contribute to medication adherence.9,20 These studies are consistent with theories of health behavior that account for behavior in terms of patients ' internal cognitive assessments and motivations for engag-ing in healthy behaviors. 21-24 Our findings demonstrate, however, that patients 'self- management is based on more than their EMs or beliefs.Patients 'DLE, including their social context, routines and management of competing health demands, may conflict with their EMs, and interfere with good self-management.Previous work in understand ing chronic disease self- management has similarly found an important role of routines in disease self-management. 16,25 The intervention challenge is that patients with uncon- trolled hypertension have complex constellations of EMs, DLEs, other illnesses and competing priorities that con-verge to influence self-management behaviors. As shown in the conceptual model, DLEs and EMs are inextricably intertwined to shape behavior. If one were to imagine that an individuals 'hypertension self-management experience were a strand of yarn, each fiber may constitute an EM orDLE; but if one were to pull on one strand, all the others would follow, altering the yarn altogether. Limitations. Our findings are limited by three factors. Because this study was conducted in the V A, findings maynot generalize to non-veteran populations or women, sincemost participants were men. Additionally, we did not observe the behaviors described; patients 'reported behaviors may differ from actual behavior. Finally, although we reached saturation with our white and African American samples, we were unable to enroll asmany Latino patients as intended; therefore, we may have missed some additional novel EMs or DLEs. Interestingly, participants 'infrequently stated understand- ing of hypertension pathophysiology was not related to self- management behaviors, suggesting that focusing on explain- ing how hypertension works in the body may not be aneffective approach to improving hypertension control. Hyper- tension discussion in clinical encounters has often been restricted to adherence assessment (although even this maynot occur 26), with limited time spent counseling patients about hypertension self-management and lifestyle.27 While prior interventions have been tailored to particular patients 'needs,7,8,28these interventions remain focused on providing information or education to patients to encour- age them to improve their hypertension self-management behaviors, with little focus on patients 'EMs in the daily life context in which they manage their illness. Manyparticipants were able to state what they should do to control hypertension, but persisted in not doing so. Thus, these results suggest that improving patients 'hypertension self-management requires an approach beyond assessment and education. Encouraging patients to discuss their EMs and DLEs can enhance clinician understanding of patients 'lived experience Figure 1. Dynamic model of hypertension self-management behavior.1632 Bokhour et al.: Hypertension Explanatory Models JGIMof hypertension and subsequent self-management behav- iors.29Some participants expressed EMs that are inconsistent with biomedical knowledge leading to poor self-manage-ment. In these instances, providers should acknowledge these differences and tailor their intervention to accommodate those beliefs. 29,30For example, a provider may acknowledge that while reducing stress may be helpful for health, hypertension control requires additional lifestyle and medi- cation management. Simply reminding patients to takemedications and engage in healthy behavior is unlikely to be effective without addressing aspects of the patients ' context. Techniques such as motivational interviewing maybe effective in focusing on these aspects of hypertension management. 31Cooper 's suggestion28that providers need to 'get to know the patient as a person, 'would likely lead providers to a better understanding of patients 'DLE. These steps might lead to a decrease in contextual errors in treating hypertension: treatment errors based on a misunderstandingof the patients 'context of disease management. 32 Our findings underscore the importance of finding novel approaches in health care delivery systems to address thecomplex social and behavioral aspects of chronic disease self- management. While providers may address patients 'EMs and DLEs during routine clinical encounters, short clinic visitsoften preclude such in-depth conversations, although Haidet convincingly argues that such conversations need not neces- sarily take more time. 33Approaches using team based care,28 including health coaches34in the context of a patient-centered medical home, may be ideal for addressing these key aspects of patient hypertension self-management.

Borzecki, MD, MPH; Andrew J. Cowan, Postoperative pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis (pPE/DVT) is 0.5% to 5% of major surgery patients, with the highest risk following orthopedic procedures,particularly total hip replacement 1; pPE/DVT is associated with an excess of $21,000 in hospital charges, 5.4 hospital days, andfourfold 30-day mortality. 2,3 Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses have shown that prophylaxis, particularly pharmacoprophylaxis, can signifi-cantly reduce this risk, with reductions of almost 70% amonggeneral surgical patients. 1,4,5Despite this, and the long-standing existence of national evidence-based PE/DVT prevention guide-lines, 1,6observational studies continue to report prophylaxis underuse.7-9 In recognition of these gaps in care, The Joint Commission and the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) have devel-oped chart-based process measures addressing appropriatethromboprophylaxis use. 10The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has also included pPE/DVT as a PatientSafety Indicator (PSI). PSIs are outcome measures that use ad-ministrative data to identify potentially preventable adverseevents. 11The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has subsequently added the SCIP Venous Thromboembolism(VTE) measures and the pPE/DVT PSI to their hospital pay-for-reporting program. 12,13In addition, CMS no longer reim- burses for PE/DVTs following total hip or knee replacements.14 Given the adverse clinical consequences, as well as associated institutional penalties for pPE/DVT occurrences, we need to un-derstand the extent to which these events are related to prophy-laxis-related process-of-care failures and therefore potentiallypreventable through improved care. Although several recent caseseries have examined guideline-adherent thromboprophylaxisrates in either at-risk patients or those experiencing pPE/DVTevents, data are limited, and somewhat conflicted, on whetherthromboprophylaxis use differs between patients who do andPerformance Improvement Is Development of Postoperative Venous Thromboembolism Related to theVeterans Health Administration Article-at-a-Glance Observational studies continue to pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis (pPE/DVT) despite thelong-standing existence of prevention guidelines. However,data are limited on whether thromboprophylaxis use differsbetween patients developing pPE/DVT versus those who donot or on why prophylaxis is withheld. Methods: Administrative data (2002-2007) from 28 Vet- erans Health Administration hospitals were screened for dis-charges with (1) pPE/DVT as flagged by the Agency forHealthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicator software and (2) pharmacoprophylaxis-recom-mended procedures, and the medical records were reviewedto ascertain true pPE/DVT cases. Controls were selected bymatching cases by hospital, age, sex, diagnosis-related group,and predicted probability for developing pPE/DVT, andwho underwent pro-cedure. Records were assessed for \"appropriate pharmaco-prophylaxis use,\" defined primarily per American College ofChest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines, and reasons for antico-agulant nonuse. Results: The 116 case-control pairs were similar in terms of demographics, surgery type, ACCP risk category, and ap-propriate pharmacoprophylaxis rates overall. Of the highest-risk patients, respective pharmacoprophylaxis rates amongcases and controls were 88% versus 92% among hip/kneereplacements and 31% versus 48% among cancer patients.Of the cases and controls who did not receive appropriatepharmacoprophylaxis, only about 25% had documentedcontraindications. Reviewers identified contraindications in14% of cases and of controls. Conclusions: Similarities in preventive pPE/DVT prac- tice between cases and controls suggest that pPE/DVTs occurdespite implementation of guideline-adherent practices.

Methods STUDY DESIGN AND DATASOURCES As part of a larger VHA study examining the validity of selected PSIs, from May 2009 through July 2010 we conducted a retro-spective case-control study using data from October 1, 2002,through September 30, 2007. We obtained acute care hospitaladministrative discharge data from the VHA National PatientCare Database Patient T reatment File (PTF), 20,21and electronic medical record (EMR) data using VistAWeb, a program enablingcentralized access to VHA-wide facility data. 22 HOSPITAL SAMPLING Our hospital sampling method is described in detail else- where.23Briefly, we applied the AHRQ PSI software (v.3.1a) to the PTF-derived database to obtain individual PSI counts andcomposite scores (a combined measure of 11 PSIs). We selecteda geographically diverse sample of 28 of 158 VHA acute carehospitals using a stratified sampling method based on observedand expected PSI counts and composite scores. The final hospi-tal sample included hospitals from 19 of 21 VHA regional healthcare networks (otherwise known as Veterans Integrated ServiceNetworks), and 20 states representing a mix of rural (for exam-ple, Togus, Maine) and more urban areas (for example, Los An-geles). (All the US Census Bureau-designated regions anddivisions of the 48 contiguous states and the District of Colum-bia were represented.) PULMONARY EMBOLISM /DEEPVEINTHROMBOSIS CASE AND CONTROL IDENTIFICATION Case and control identification required several steps (Figure1, page 350). First, as part of a previous study examining thepositive predictive value of the PSI pPE/DVT, 23we randomly se- lected 112 PSI software-flagged pPE/DVT cases per samplehospital); nurse-abstractors reviewed EMRs toidentify true pPE/DVTs ( N = 48). 23,24Second, we excluded cases with ineligible procedures (that is, those not appropriate for pro-phylaxis [N = 25]; see below for eligibility); and third, we con- firmed there were no upper-extremity DVT cases. This left 23cases for matching. We then screened additional flagged cases inbatches of 112, repeating Step 2 (screening for eligible proce-dures), then Steps 1 and 3 (nurse-abstractor confirmation ofPE/lower-extremity DVT) until we obtained approximately 100cases. This target sample size was based on power calculationsthat assumed a pharmacoprophylaxis use difference of 20% be-tween cases and controls and a rate of approximately 50%among cases. 25 We used the SCIP-recommended procedures for thrombo- prophylaxis as initial reference to determine surgeries for inclu-sion. 26Additional selection was based on study clinician opinion [A.M.B., A.J.C.] with expert surgical input [K.I.]; only majorsurgeries were included. We excluded neurosurgical proceduressince do receive pharmacologic prophylaxis, andincluded procedures associated withfractures (excluding below knee) and lower-extremity amputa-tions lasting beyond one hour. In total, we screened 560 PSI software-flagged cases (five groups of 112, including the initial 112) (Figure 1); among thosewith eligible procedures, 128 were confirmed as true pPE/DVTs.We excluded 8 upper-extremity DVTs, plus 3 cases occurringmore than 30 days after surgery. Using the PTF , we then matched true pPE/DVT cases one- to-one with controls (that is, patients not experiencing a pPE/DVT), based on hospital, age (within 5 years), sex, and diagno-sis-related group ([DRG], which accounts for procedure type).Within strata defined by these variables, we selected the controlwith the closest predicted probability of developing pPE/DVTbased on a logistic regression model that included age, sex, DRG,and discharge comorbidities. 27We similarly screened out con- trols on the basis of procedure eligibility as described for cases.We lacked an appropriate match for 1 case; our final sample con-sisted of 116 matched cases and controls. Our cases came from27 of the 28 sample hospitals. The average number of cases persite was 4.1 (standard deviation [SD], 2.7) or median 3.5 (range,0-10). ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD ABSTRACTION Starting with preliminary tools and guidelines from AHRQ,28 Copyright 2012 \u00a9 The Joint Commission350August 2012 Volume 38 Number 8The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety we developed separate but comparable abstraction instruments for cases and controls. Specific to cases, the instrument includedquestions about case ascertainment per the PSI definition. 24 There had to be documentation in the discharge summary, ra-diology reports, or physician progress notes that the patient ex-perienced a VTE postoperatively. All but 2 cases had radi-ographic confirmation; these 2 cases were reviewed by study cli-nicians [A.M.B., A.J.C.] and retained as true events.

For controls, records werealso examined out to 90 days following discharge to look for lateVTE events. (We initially tested interrater reliability on approx-imately 10% of cases; average agreement across records was 92%.Further abstraction details are described elsewhere. 23) ANALYSES We compared cases and controls on several variables, includ- ing demographics, patient-related risk factors, surgery type,American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) risk category(Table 1, above), 31,32and thromboprophylaxis use. We conducted similar analyses comparing prophylaxis use between and withinsurgical specialties, with subcategorization of orthopedic proce-dures, and compared risk factors within surgery type. Thromboprophylaxis Use. We categorized thromboprophy- laxis SCIP VTE measures specifications (v.2.6b),derived from the seventh version of the ACCP guidelines (ACCP7), to define appropriateness. 27,32Appropriate pharmacoprophy- laxis required both proper timing of administration (within 24hours of the procedure) and use of recommended anticoagu-lants; the \"mechanical prophylaxis only\" group similarly requireduse of appropriately timed and recommended forms of mechan-ical prophylaxis (Appendix 1, available in online article). Forprocedures not represented in the SCIP measures (for example,lower-extremity amputations), we referred directly to recommended note, the SCIP specifica- tions differ from ACCP guidelines in being more explicit withrespect to appropriate timing of prophylaxis administration, out-lining appropriate prophylaxis options for a specific set of majorsurgeries, and not accounting for patient VTE risk factors (forexample, SCIP considers mechanical prophylaxis as appropriatein all urologic patients, even high-risk ones). 26,32Because ACCP guidelines recommend that mechanical prophylaxis be used as anadjunct to anticoagulants, particularly in high-risk patients, weCharacteristic Cases ( N = 116) Controls (N = 116) Age, years, mean (SD) 70.0 (10.2) 70.1 (10.3) Sex, male n (%) 115 (99.1) 115 (99.1) Length of stay, days, median (25th, 75th percentiles)18.0 (10.0, 32.0) 9.0 (5.0, 15.0) (71.6) 85 (73.3) Non-white 19 (16.4) 13 (11.2) Other/missing 14 (12.1) 18 (15.5) Patient Risk Factors Present on Admission n(%) Current neoplasm\u00a732 (27.6) 29 (25.0) Obesity (BMI 30)25 (21.6) 42 (36.2) Prior venous thromboembolism18 (15.5) 6 (5.2) History of recent trauma 7 (6.0) 12 (10.3) Hypercoaguable state#1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) ACCP 6/7 Highest-Risk Category** 95 (81.9) 90 (77.6) * Column percentages are shown.

Patient Sample Characteristics* Copyright 2012 \u00a9 The Joint Commission352August 2012 Volume 38 Number 8The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety also calculated the percentage on both appropriate pharmaco- logic and mechanical prophylaxis.32 Reasons for Lack of Pharmacoprophylaxis. Study clinicians [A.M.B., A.J.C] reviewed EMRs of all patients who did not re-ceive appropriate pharmacoprophylaxis and in whom nurse-ab-stractors did not identify a potential contraindication (includingrecords with delayed prophylaxis; that is, initiated > 24 hourspostoperatively). They looked for other potential reasons for lackof pharmacoprophylaxis use, such as significant perioperativebleeding (for example, bleeding-associated systolic blood pres-sure drop to < 90 mm Hg, or hematocrit drop to < 25% imme-diately postoperatively, or requiring > four units of blood), significant renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate< 30ml/min or end-stage renal disease on dialysis), or epiduralanesthesia/analgesia use. This last item was included because theSCIP specifications consider withholding of pharmacoprophy-laxis in patients undergoing epidural anesthesia or with anepidural catheter in situ as appropriate, provided mechanicalprophylaxis is used, contrary to ACCP guidelines. 1,32 We compared groups using parametric (chi-squares and t-tests) and nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon rank-sum) as appro-priate. We also calculated effect size (ES) for selected results tocharacterize the clinical significance of findings. 33(Effect sizes of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 are considered small, medium, and large re-spectively. 33) SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) was used for all analyses. Results PATIENT SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS Table 1 shows baseline characteristics of sample patients. Cases and controls were similar with respect to sex, race/ethnicity, andage; all patients were at least 40 years old. The most commonpreadmission risk factors overall were current neoplasm and obe-sity (that is, body mass index [BMI] > 30). Individual risk fac- tors were similar between cases and controls, except for moreprior VTEs in cases (16% versus 5%; p= .01) obesity in controls (36% versus 22%; p= .03). Cases and controls were comparable with respect to major surgery type; orthopedic sur-gery was the most common category (> 54% of cases and con-trols) followed by general surgery (> 29% of cases and > 26% ofcontrols; Table 2, page 353). Eighty-two percent of cases and77% of controls were in the ACCP highest risk category (p = .42); all were at least high risk. There were few significant differences in risk factors between cases and controls by surgery type, other than higher prior VTErates among orthopedic cases and impaired mobility amonglower-extremity amputation cases (data not presented; availablefrom authors.) Notably, current neoplasm was particularly com-mon among undergoing thoracic (100% of cases, 88%of controls), urologic (88% of cases, of controls), and gen-eral surgery (44% of cases, 52% of controls). We found no lateVTE events among controls. OVERALL THROMBOPROPHYLAXIS RATES As shown in Table 2, more controls than cases received appro- priate pharmacoprophylaxis (72% versus 62%), although thedifference was not statistically significant ( p = .13; ES = .16). Mechanical prophylaxis alone was used in 32% of cases and 22%of controls (p = .11); 6% of both cases and controls did not re- ceive any prophylaxis. Fifty-three percent of cases and 58% ofcontrols received both appropriate pharmacologic and mechan-ical prophylaxis (p = .60). SURGICAL SPECIALTY -SPECIFIC THROMBOPROPHYLAXIS RATES Orthopedic patients were significantly more likely to receive appropriate pharmacoprophylaxis compared with other surgicalgroups (p < .01), with similar rates among cases and controls (> 87%). Urologic patients had the lowest rates (0% and 29%for cases and controls, respectively). There was a nonsignificanttrend toward higher prophylaxis rates among controls versuscases for the nonorthopedic surgical groups. We saw opposite results with respect to mechanical prophy- laxis only use. Nonorthopedic surgical patients (other thanlower-extremity amputations and thoracic patients) had signifi-cantly higher mechanical prophylaxis rates compared with or-thopedic patients (p < .001); urologic patients had the highest rates (88% of cases and 71% of controls). Rates of no prophylaxis were comparable between cases and controls by specialty group, ranging from 0% to 50% for casesundergoing orthopedic procedures versus lower-extremity am-putations. With respect to use of both pharmacologic and me-chanical prophylaxis, trends were similar pharmacoprophylaxis. ACCP H IGHEST -RISKGROUPS Eighty-one percent of both cases and controls undergoing or- thopedic procedures represented hip or knee replacements.Among these joint replacement patients, 88% of cases and 92%of controls received appropriate pharmacoprophylaxis ( p= .65); all received some form of prophylaxis; approximately three quar-ters of both groups received a combination of appropriate phar-macologic and mechanical prophylaxis (Table 2.) While 83% of patients with a prior VTE in both groups Copyright 2012 \u00a9 The Joint Commissionreceived pharmacoprophylaxis, only 31% of cases and 48% of controls with a neoplasm received appropriate pharmacoprophy-laxis (p = .19; ES = 0.33). Of those in the highest ACCP risk category based on either procedure or patient risk factors, 68%of cases and 75% of controls received pharmacoprophylaxis ( p= .33); 56% of cases and both pharma-cologic and mechanical prophylaxis ( p= .46). REASONS FOR LACK OF PHARMACOPROPHYLAXIS Nurses identified contraindications in only approximately 25% of both cases and controls who did not receive appropriatepharmacoprophylaxis. Table 3 (page 354) shows results after cli-nician EMR review. Clinicians identified bleeding contraindi-cations in 12% of all cases (N = 14) and 9% of controls (N = 10). Of these, 57% of cases ( N = 8) and 60% of controls (N = 6) had these reasons explicitly documented, and 57% (N = 8) and 70% (N = 7), respectively, represented patients with cancer. Another 2 cases had documentation of not receiving pharmacoprophy-laxis because of fall risk. Among patients with contraindications,all but 1 case, a patient with peripheral vascular disease, receivedappropriate mechanical prophylaxis. T wo additional cases devel-oped VTEs within 24 hours postoperatively. We felt that wecould not conclude that they lacked a contraindication to phar-macoprophylaxis. Given the relatively short time frame betweenthe procedure and the VTE event, postoperative documentationof the acute complication would likely have taken precedenceover documentation of contraindications. (Had we excludedthese patients from the original sample, our results would nothave appreciably changed.) Thus, accounting for contraindications and early VTE oc- currence, a total of 78% of cases and 80% of controls were ap-propriately managed (p = .75). This represented 56% of cases and 72% of controls with malignancy (p = .19; ES = .32). Ac- counting for contraindications, assessments of appropriate man-agement increased for all surgical groups except thoracic casesand lower extremity amputation controls (Figure 2, page 355.) Of the remaining patients, either no reason was given or iden- tified in the record as to why they did not receive appropriatepharmacoprophylaxis (16% of both cases and controls), or po-tential reasons for withholding prophylaxis were not consistentwith accepted contraindications (that is, the presence of anepidural catheter or use of aspirin as prophylaxis instead of an-ticoagulants; 6% of cases and 4% of controls). No identifiablecause for lack of pharmacoprophylaxis use was found propor-tionately most often in lower-extremity amputation patients.

Discussion This study is one of the few investigations of VHA surgical pa-tients to examine thromboprophylaxis use and the first VHAstudy to our knowledge to evaluate the association of process fail-ures with outcomes. Among this high-risk group of veterans un-dergoing major operative procedures, we did not find a significantdifference in pharmacoprophylaxis use between cases and con-trols. Overall, appropriate pharmacoprophylaxis rates were mod-est, although rates of appropriate management were high whenaccounting for contraindications; 62% of cases and 72% guideline-recommended pharmacopro-phylaxis, with a further of cases and of controlsappropriately managed given contraindications. Had we approx-imated SCIP criteria by considering mechanical prophylaxis useas appropriate in all urologic patients and fractures), 83%of our cases and 90% of controls would have received appropri-ate prophylaxis (not accounting for SCIP exclusion criteria). 21,27 Pharmacoprophylaxis rates varied widely by surgery type, with the highest rates among orthopedic patients; general sur-gery, thoracic, and urologic patients had comparatively lowerrates. Among the highest ACCP risk groups, very high pharma-coprophylaxis rates were seen among joint replacement patientsand those with a VTE history (> 80%), with much lower ratesamong cancer patients (39% overall). These lower rates persistedeven after accounting for contraindications. (Although the clin-ical significance\u2014that is, effect size\u2014of case-control differenceswas slightly larger among cancer patients, both groups were rel-atively undertreated.) Clinical trial results strongly support the process-outcome link perioperative PE/DVT pharmacoprophylaxis useand decreased occurrence of PE, with muchweaker evidence supporting mechanical prophylaxis and onlywith respect to DVT risk reduction. 1Thus, the ACCP guide- lines generally recommend mechanical prophylaxis alone onlywhen the bleeding risk is unacceptably high. 1Although we did find a trend toward lower pharmacoprophylaxis use (and con-versely higher mechanical prophylaxis use) in cases compared tocontrols (both overall and within each nonorthopedic surgicalgroup), these differences were not statistically significant. Inter-estingly, when we performed a post hoc analysis among thenonorthopedic patients, we found borderline significant differ-ences in pharmacoprophylaxis rates (32% in cases versus 53% incontrols; p= .049, ES = 0.39). However, after we for contraindications, differences in appropriate prophylaxis use dis-appeared (64% versus 66%; Surgery Type Cases Controls Cases Controls Cases Controls Cases Controls Cases Controls Cases Controls All Procedures 116 116 14 (12.1) 10 (8.6) 19 (16.4) 18 (15.5) 6 (5.2) 4 (3.4) 1 (0.9) 1 (0.9) 4 (3.4) 0 Orthopedic 63 63 0 2 (3.2) 6 (9.5) 5 (7.9) 0 0 1 (1.6) 1 (1.6) 1 (1.6) 0 General Surgery 34 31 9 (26.5) 4 (12.9) 8 (23.5) 8 (25.8) 2 (5.9) 2 (6.5) 0 0 2 (5.9) 0 Urologic 8 7 4 (50.0) 3 (42.9) 1 (12.5) 2 (28.6) 2 (25.0) 0 0 0 1 (12.5) 0 Thoracic 5 8 0 1 (12.5) 1(20.0) 0 2 (40.0) 2 (25.0) 0000 LE Amputation 6 7 1 (16.7) 0 3 (50.0) 3 (42.9) 000000 * There were no significant differences between cases and controls overall.

Table 3. Reason for Inappropriate or No Pharmacoprophylaxis* Copyright 2012 \u00a9 The Joint Commission355August 2012 Volume 38 Number 8The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety more cases did not receive pharmacoprophylaxis, which may have contributed to at least some events, several of these wereappropriately treated and therefore not clearly preventable.Moreover, these findings remain consistent with existing obser-vational studies, both case-control and case series, that show thatmany pPE/DVT events occur despite the apparent use of bestpractices. 18,25,34 A similar disconnect between observational study and clini- cal trial results with respect to process-outcome links has beennoted for various conditions. 35-37Clinical trials occur in a struc- tured setting with a relatively homogeneous population; few in-terventions are as effective in actual practice. Further, ashypothesized by Shackford et al., guideline-recommended mea - sures may simply be \"insufficient to prevent VTE in some high-risk patients.\" 16(p. 9) However, we are not advocating for a decrease in prophylaxis use. Rather, our findings suggest opportunitiesfor improvements in preventive care, particularly among cancerpatients and those undergoing nonorthopedic procedures. Al-though each surgical specialty has its own guidelines, the ACCPVTE prophylaxis guidelines are considered the standard of carein the United States. Clinicians during our study period(2002-2007) would have been influenced by both the sixth(re-leased in 2001) and seventh (released in 2004) versions of theseguidelines, which contained very similar recommendations. 31,32 Orthopedic procedures have the highest procedure-associatedVTE risk, the strongest evidence base for prevention, and, there-fore, the strongest recommendations for pharmacoprophylaxis.However, ACCP 6 and 7 also strongly recommend pharmaco-prophylaxis for patients undergoing major general and thoracicprocedures, particularly if they are older than 40 years of age orhave other VTE risk factors; patients older than 40 years of agewith a prior VTE or cancer are considered at highest risk, simi-lar to orthopedic patients. 31,32For major urologic or vascular the guidelines recommend anticoagulant use if patientshave VTE risk factors. Thus, several of our high- and highest-riskcases and controls did not receive guideline-recommended care(even accounting for contraindications). Of note, our findingswould be similar even accounting for the recommendations ofthe recently published ACCP 9, other than one notable excep-tion; aspirin is now considered an acceptable anticoagulant alter-native in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. 38 Among patients undergoing knee arthroplasty, we had one caseand one control who received only aspirin. Nevertheless, our rates of appropriate pharmacoprophylaxisFigure 2. Accounting for contraindications to pharmacoprophylaxis, assessments of appropriate prophylaxis increased overall and for all surgical groups, except thoracic cases and lower-extremity amputation controls. For example, overall, 62% of cases received appropriate pharmacoprophylaxis; an additional 16% ei-ther had accepted contraindications to this but received appropriate mechanical prophylaxis or had early occurrence of venous thromboembolism. If this subgroupis considered as appropriately managed, then the percentage of cases appropriately managed increased from 62% to 78%. LE Amp, lower-extremity amputation.Percentage of Patients Appropriately Managed, Accounting for Contraindications Copyright 2012 \u00a9 The Joint Commission356August 2012 Volume 38 Number 8The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety are generally higher than those reported in recent case series of surgical patients.7,9,16,18,39,40A multinational trial using chart re- view (the ENDORSE study) and two large studies in the UnitedStates that used administrative data from similar time periodsreported overall appropriate pharmacoprophylaxis rates between18% and 55%. 7,9,39,40Rates also varied by specialty, with the high- est rates among orthopedic patients (38% to 74%), and the low-est rates tending to be among urologic patients (26% to32%). 7,9,40The ENDORSE study also found that patients with prior VTE had a higher likelihood of receiving recommendedprophylaxis than cancer patients. 9Among studies of surgical pa- tients experiencing VTE, two single site studies, one using 2009data (N = 89), and the other, the previously noted case-control study, found that 63% and 40%, respectively, received appro-priate pharmacoprophylaxis; an additional 25% and 23%, re-spectively were appropriately managed given contraindications. 18 There are several possible explanations for the discrepant rates, particularly with the larger case series, including slightlydifferent appropriateness definitions (all were based on ACCP 6or 7 guidelines), 31,32data sources used, patient characteristics, and included procedure types. Our population's higher VTE risklikely led to higher prophylaxis rates. For example, in the EN-DORSE study, rates of prior VTE, active cancer, and orthope-dic procedures were only 3%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. 9 Other important findings of our study were that relatively few of the patients who did not receive pharmacoprophylaxishad documented contraindications and that approximately halfof these cases and controls had no identifiable reason for lack ofuse even after careful clinician review. Few previous studies haveinvestigated this aspect of prophylaxis, other than reportingbleeding risk. 9,39In a setting with an established VTE prophy- laxis protocol, including an order sheet with check boxes to in-dicate contraindications, Weigelt et al. found that only 1% ofcases were missing documentation of contraindications. 18How- ever, Shackford et al. found up to 37% of VTE cases had no con-traindications documented or identified. 16 Our study design is unique compared to related recent stud- ies in surgical patients in that we used a well-established admin-istrative data-based indicator, the AHRQ PE/DVT PSI, to flagPE/DVT cases. 16,18,34However, given the PSI's recognized relatively high rate of misidentification of events (and underde-tection of events), we then confirmed cases through chart review. 23,41,42 Limitations Our study had a few limitations. First, our sample size may havebeen too small to show statistical significance. However, the cal-culated effect size for the level of difference observed for thewhole sample was relatively small at 0.16. 33Effect size is inde- pendent of the sample size. Thus, even if we had found a statis-tically significant result by including twice as many cases andcontrols, this difference is too small to be clinically meaningful.In addition, as noted, other studies support this lack of differencein management of cases and controls. 16Second, although we matched cases and controls on VTE risk using administrativedata, chart-abstracted data demonstrated some individual riskfactor differences between groups, notably with respect to priorVTE and obesity. However, by chart data all patients were in thehigh or highest ACCP VTE risk categories, with similar distri-butions by group. Third, despite using very accurate medicationdata (obtained from bar-coded medication administration logs),we may be overestimating appropriate pharmacoprophylaxisrates, given that we assessed prophylaxis use up to three dayspostoperatively but not beyond this. Further, although standardprophylaxis dosing for unfractionated and low molecular weightheparin had to be adhered to, target International NormalizedRatios (INRs) were frequently not documented. Because wecould not determine warfarin-dosing appropriateness, wedeemed any regular warfarin use as appropriate. Nevertheless,our rates are still higher than those in the ENDORSE study,which did not consider dosage and only examined prophylaxisuse at a single time-point. In addition, our methods of assessingappropriateness are similar to those of other recent chart-reviewstudies. 16,18,39Finally, it is possible that some controls may have had subclinical VTE. However, our findings are consistent withrelated studies that included only symptomatic VTEs. 16,18Al- though we focused on in-hospital outcomes, related studies used30-day outcomes. 16,18More recent data have also raised concern about events occurring up to 90 days following surgery, partic-ularly hip replacements. 43We therefore examined EMRs of all controls up to 90 days postdischarge and found no VTE events;all had evidence of ongoing VHA use after discharge to at least90 days, unless they died in-hospital or prior to day 90. (Noneof the deaths were attributed to a VTE.) Implications and Next Steps Our findings and those of others suggest that even with 100%compliance with current SCIP VTE measures or even with mod-ifications to increase use of pharmacoprophylaxis, pPE/DVTswill still occur. It may be important to incorporate other factorssuch as VTE risk or anticoagulant dosage and duration into VTEprocess measures to realize the full potential of such measures inimproving patient safety. Moreover, penalizing providers forpPE/DVT events, such as events that follow joint replacements, Copyright 2012 \u00a9 The Joint Commission357August 2012 Volume 38 Number 8The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety may be inappropriate because the vast majority of pPE/DVT events occur despite appropriate pharmacoprophylaxis. In addi-tion, our finding that clinicians often failed to document reasonsfor lack of pharmacoprophylaxis is concerning from a medicole-gal standpoint. We expect that such documentation will improveover time as provider awareness of performance monitoring andpublic reporting increases because this information is necessaryto satisfy the SCIP VTE measures for certain surgery types. Further work is needed to understand why these pPE/DVT events are happening. This may occur at the local level by meansof observational studies, including local quality improvementactivities that carefully assess process factors, using prospectivedata collection to determine whether important strategies suchas early mobilization are actually being implemented. Clinicaltrials are also necessary to examine additional strategies to re-duce VTE events. Conclusion Similarities in pPE/DVT preventive practices between cases andcontrols suggest that pPE/DVT events occur even with imple-mentation of evidence-based practices. However, despite highoverall rates of guideline-adherent care, certain high-risk patientgroups were relatively undertreated, and documentation of pro-phylaxis contraindications was frequently absent. While thesedeficiencies should be addressed through VHA quality improve-ment efforts, further research is necessary to uncover additionalmethods to prevent pPE/DVT.

Copyright 2012 \u00a9 The Joint CommissionBEHAVIORAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL RESEARCH Correlates of Antiretroviral and Antidepressant Adherence Among Depressed HIV-Infected Patients Kathryn A. Bottonari, Ph.D.,1Shanti M.D.2,3 Abstract Although crucial for efcacy of pharmacotherapy, adherence to prescribed medication regimens for both anti- retrovirals and antidepressants is often suboptimal. many depressed HIV-infected individuals are prescribedboth antiretrovirals and antidepressants, it is important to know whether correlates of nonadherence are similaror different across type of regimen. The HIV Translating Initiatives for Depression into Effective Solutions(HI-TIDES) study was a single-blinded, longitudinal, randomized controlled effectiveness trial comparing col- laborative care to usual depression care at three Veterans Affairs HIV clinics. The current investigation utilized self-report baseline interview and chart-abstracted data. Participants were 225 depressed HIV-infected patientswho were prescribed an antidepressant ( n=146), an n=192), or both ( n=113). Treatment ad- herence over the last 4 days was dichotomized as ''less than 90% adherence'' or ''90% or greater adherence.''After identifying potential correlates of nonadherence, we used a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) bivariateprobit model, in which the probability of adherence to HIV medications and the probability of adherence toantidepressant medications are modeled jointly. Results indicated that 75.5% ( n=146) of those prescribed an- tiretrovirals reported 90%-plus adherence to their antiretroviral prescription and 76.7% ( n=112) of those pre- scribed antidepressants reported 90%-plus adherence to their antidepressant prescription, while 67% of those prescribed both ( n=113) reported more than 90% adherence to both regimens. SUR results indicated that education, age, and HIV symptom severity were signicant correlates of antiretroviral medication adherencewhile gender and generalized anxiety disorder diagnosis were signicant correlates of adherence to antide-pressant medications. In addition, antiretroviral adherence did not predict antidepressant adherence ( b=1.62, p=0.17), however, antidepressant adherence did predict antiretroviral adherence ( b=2.30, p<0.05). Introduction Despite ongoing advances in pharmacotherapy in the treatments of depression and HIV, many depressed HIV-infected individuals experience only partial responsedue to nonadherence to prescribed regimens. Indeed, de-pressive symptoms have been repeatedly identied as a consistent, yet mutable, barrier to medical treatment adher- ence. 1,2Moreover, depression has been identied as a com-mon barrier to HIV treatment adherence.3Yet, despite advances in antidepressant treatment, there is evidence thatdepressed patients (both HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected) have trouble adhering to prescribed antidepressant regi- mens. 4,5Although past research has explored demographic, behavioral, and health-related barriers to adherence to de-pression and HIV treatment separately, limited research has examined whether common or distinct factors are barriers for individuals being prescribed both types of medications. 1Ralph H.

DOI: 10.1089/apc.2011.0218 265 Examination of such variables will likely add to providers' knowledge of treating the ''whole'' patient, i.e., examination of psychosocial and medical factors that exist for HIV-infected individuals.6The present investigation focuses on barriers to adherence for both antidepressant and antiretroviral medi- cations among depressed HIV-infected individuals prior to their enrollment in an intervention trial aimed at improv-ing depression treatment and outcomes among treatment- seeking HIV-infected individuals. To date, the literature has examined barriers of adherence to antiretrovirals and antidepressants separately. Extensiveresearch has been conducted on identifying barriers to HIV treatment adherence given the virologic consequences of non-adherence (i.e., virologic failure and development ofresistance). The most common factors found to impact HIV treatment adherence include complexity of treatment regi- mens, side effect proles, excessive substance use, psycho-pathology (e.g., depression and anxiety), beliefs about m e d i c a t i o n ,s e l f - e f c a c y ,s o c i a ls u p p o r t ,c o p i n gs t y l e ,a n d memory lapse. 7In contrast to HIV treatment adherence, re- search on antidepressant adherence is relatively sparse.Identied barriers to antidepressant adherence have in- cluded younger age, female gender, rst episode versus re- current depression, low self-efcacy, lower levels of formaleducation, severity of sympto ms, side effect proles, beliefs about medication-taking behavior, regimen characteristics, and forgetting. 8-12Finally, given evidence that many indi- viduals require maintenance treatment beyond remission of depressive symptoms,13it is of concern that several in- vestigators have identied premature discontinuation oftreatment as a more severe form of nonadherence. One retrospective chart review indicated that only 44% of their sample completed 6 months of treatment, suggesting thatthe majority of patients do not receive the full benet ofthe antidepressants. 14Given the illness proles of both de- pression and HIV, research is needed to identify barriers to adherence for both antidepressant and antiretroviralmedications. More recently, research has begun to emerge examining adherence patterns among depressed HIV-infected patients.Several investigations have demonstrated improved HIV treatment adherence outcomes with use of antidepressant treatment. First, there was preliminary data from a retro-spective chart review suggesting that adherence to anti-retrovirals was positively correlated with antidepressants adherence ( r=0.31; p<0.02) and of improved re- sponses given evidence of adherence to antidepressants(>80%). 15Second, several investigations have provided evi- dence of improved adherence to antiretrovirals among de- pressed individuals taking antidepressants.5,16,17Walkup and colleagues17reported that prescription of an antidepressant in a prior month increased the odds of adherence to anti- retroviral in the subsequent month. Furthermore, Horzbergand colleagues 5attempted to unpack the relationship be- tween depression, adherence to antiretrovirals, and HIV treatment adherence. They reported that depressed HIV-infected individuals who were highly adherent ( >90%) to their antidepressants had similar antiretroviral adherence proles to nondepressed individuals and that both of these groups had signicantly better antiretroviral adherence thanthose who were both depressed and nonadherent to their antidepressants. Finally, there is evidence that antidepressanttreatment also helps improve adherence to complex anti- retroviral regimens. 18However, given evidence that antide- pressant and antiretroviral adherence are related, it would be of interest to identify factors that predict adherence to bothtypes of medication. This investigation is part of the larger, three-site, two-arm, single-blinded, randomized controlled effectiveness trial,HIV Translating Initiatives for Depression into Effective Solutions (HI-TIDES). 19The goal of the HI-TIDES trial was to compare a collaborative care intervention20to treatment as usual (TAU) in the treatment of depression for depressedHIV clinic patients. The larger trial involved an intervention utilizing an offsite HIV depression care team (registered nurse depression care manager, pharmacist, and psychia-trist) who delivered up to 12 months of collaborative de- pression care supported by a Web-based decision support system. However, given that medication was the primarymode of depression treatment within the trial, adherence to prescribed regimens was essential. Therefore, the aim of the current investigation was to isolate demographic, mentalhealth, and physical health related factors that were associ-ated with preintervention adherence patterns. Identication of these factors will be helpful for future efforts to improve provision of physical and mental health interventions forHIV-infected veterans. Methods Participants Eligible participants were HIV-seropositive males and fe- males (aged 18 and over), who were being treated for HIV at one of three Veterans Administration Medical Centers(VAMC) HIV clinics and were identied as having clinically signicant symptoms of depression during the screening session (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] 21depres- sion score 10). Exclusion criteria were: no access to a tele- phone, current acute suicidal ideation, signicant cognitive impairment as indicated by a score greater than 10 on theBlessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration (BOMC), 22self- report history of bipolar disorder or manic depression, and medical record diagnosis of schizophrenia. After completing the informed consent process, participants completed thebaseline assessment and were randomly assigned to inter- vention or usual care. Two hundred seventy-six individuals were randomized at the baseline research session and 225 areincluded in these analyses as they had a baseline prescription for either antiretroviral treatment ( n=192), antidepressant treatment ( n=146), or both ( n=113). All participants signed informed consents approved by their VAMC's Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to the initiation of any research procedures. Measures Demographics The baseline interview included questions about the veteran's demographics characteristics. Data uti-lized in these analyses included gender, age, race, marital/ partner status, and level of formal education. Patient Health Questionnaire\u20149 items (PHQ-9) 21The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report measure that was used to screen for the presence of symptoms of depression. A PHQ-9 score of266 BOTTONARI ET AL. greater than 10 has strong psychometric properties in primary care settings (e.g., 99 +% sensitivity and a 91% specicity). Symptom Checklist\u201420 items (SLC-20).23Depression symptom severity over the 2 weeks before the baseline inter- view was measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist SCL-20. The SCL-20 includes the 1 3-item depression scale plus 7 depression-related items from the Hopkins Symptom Checklist- 90-Revised. The items are scored from 0 to 4 and averaged to provide a mean depression severity score from 0 to 4. Mental health diagnoses. The Mini International Neu- ropsychiatric Interview (MINI)24is a brief structured interview for the major Axis I psychiatric disorders, shown to be validand reliable when compared to the Structured Clinical Inter- view for DSM-III-R and the CIDI. 25The MINI was used to assess for the presence of clinically signicant depression (i.e.,major depression) and also for comorbid mental health con- ditions (i.e., generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol use disorder, any alcoholuse over the last year and number of drinks in week beforeinterview). Physical comorbidity. Chronic physical health condi- tions (other than HIV) were measured using the 21-item Physical Comorbidity scale from the Depression Outcomes Module. 26,27 HIV-related symptomatology. HIV symptom severity was measured using the 20-item Symptoms Distress Mod-ule, 28which summarizes the degree to which each symptom bothered the participant in the past 4 weeks on a scale from 0=I do not have this symptom to 4 =this symptom bothers me a lot. We also created a count variable to address the numberof self-reported symptoms. Quality of life. Health status was measured using the physical and mental health component summary scores from the Medical Outcomes Study SF-12V. 29Health-related quality of life was measured using the Quality of Well-Being self-administered scale (QWB-SA). 30,31The QWB-SA score is de- rived from general population preference weights and ranges from death (0.0) to perfect health (1.0). Self-reported medication adherence. Antidepressant and HIV medication adherence were measured separately using the AIDS Clinical Trial Group assessment,32which asks participants to report the number of pills per day they are supposed to take and the number of pills they skipped taking for each medication for each of the past 4 days. Percent ad-herence was calculated as follows. First, for each of the last 4 days, the number of pills prescribed minus number of pills taken divided by the total number prescribed for each medi-cation was calculated. Then, add the percentage adherence for each of the last 4 days and divide by 4; this algorithm allowed us to take into account the number of pills and to better ac-count for the ''weight'' of a missed pill (e.g., missing 1 pill of a2-pill regimen likely has a bigger influence on efcacy than missing 1 pill of a 6-pill regimen). However, the distributions for both antidepressant and antiretroviral adherence wereskewed as approximately 75% of the sample reported 100% adherence. The distributions were not amenable to transfor-mation and as such, we decided to dichotomize the data in ''less than 90%'' and ''90% or greater.'' This cut-point was chosen as our recent work demonstrated that 90% adherence was the most sensitive cut-point for antidepressant adher-ence. 33Although 95% adherence is a long accepted bench- mark among HIV treatment adherence research,34more recent research indicates that level of adherence varies byregimen and resistance prole. 35,36We chose 90% for both types of medication for consistency in analyses. Patient knowledge of regimen. As the adherence data were based on self-report, we did a chart review for medications prescribed to examine patient knowledge of regimen. Previous research has identied that p oor knowledge of one's regimen can be associated with nonadherence to HIV medications.37As such, we included this in our examination of possible correlates of adherence to both types of medication; however, due tolimitations in our data, we were only able to compare knowl- edge of names of medications. We measured knowledge in two ways. First, we measured if they knew the correct number ofantidepressant and antiretroviral medications that they wereprescribed. Second, we coded the names of the medications so that we could compare patient's knowledge of both the number and names of their prescribed antidepressant and antiretroviralmedications to the ones reflected in their chart (chart was as- s u m e dt ob eg o l ds t a n d a r d ) .W ec a l c u l a t e dap e r c e n t a g eb y dividing the number of correctly identied medications by thenumber that were prescribed to them as noted in their chart (e.g., chart review said they were prescribed Med A, Med B, and Med C; Veteran reported Med A and Med C but NOT Med B;their knowledge percentage would be 66.7%.) Procedure Veterans were screened for depressive symptoms by clinic staff during routine clinical care visits with their HIV pro-vider. Veterans who fullled the screening criteria were re- ferred to research to learn about the larger HI-TIDES trial. If interested, they completed the informed consent procedureat that visit and were called by research staff, on average, 7 days later, completed their baseline interview. The baseline interview contained questions about demographics, physi-cal and mental health symptoms, treatment history, treat- ment preferences, and self-reported treatment adherence for both antiretrovirals and antidepressants. This interview wascompleted before the veteran was informed about which armthey were randomized to (intervention versus TAU). Fol- lowing completion of the baseline interview, research staff conducted a chart review of the participant's electronicmedical record at the VA to gather information about their current prescriptions and comorbid health conditions. Data analytic strategy Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2 38(SAS Inc., Cary, NC) and Stata 9.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).39There were three steps in the analyses to identify predictors, runthe seemingly unrelated bivariate probit (SUR) model, andnally, to add adherence as an explanatory variable. Pre- liminary analyses to examine the relationship between par- ticipant characteristics and adherence (separate analyses forantidepressant and antiretroviral adherence) were conducted using appropriate tests based on the distribution of the item.ANTIRETROVIRAL AND ANTIDEPRESSANT ADHERENCE 267 Independent variables that were signicant at the bivariate level p<0.20 with either antidepressant or antiretroviral ad- herence were included as variables in the nal models. To examine correlates of adherence, we used an SUR model,where the probability of adherence to HIV medications and the probability of adherence to antidepressant medications are modeled jointly. The SUR model specically accounts forthe possibility that the unmeasured factors affecting adher- ence to HIV medications also affect adherence to antidepres- sant medications, which leads to correlated error terms acrossthe two probit regression equations. These unmeasured fac-tors include omitted variables impacting adherence to anti- depressant and HIV medications, and the measurement error common to assessing adherence to antidepressant medicationand adherence to HIV medications. The SUR model assumes this correlation follows a bivariate normal distribution (with covariance q) and calculates whether the error terms are sig- nicantly correlated and the direction of the correlation. 40,41 The signicance of the correlation coefcient qis tested using a likelihood ratio test that compares the log likelihood of themodel where qis restricted to 0 to the log likelihood of the model where qis unrestricted. If the correlation is not statis- tically signicant (e.g., q=0), it implies that unmeasured fac- tors influencing adherence to HIV medications and theunmeasured factors influencing adherence to antidepressant medications are different, and therefore that the two decisions are likely made independent of one another. In this case, themost appropriate statistical analysis involves estimating the parameters of two separate probit regressions. On the other hand, if the correlation is positive and signicant, it impliesthat unmeasured factors affect the adherence to antiretroviral and antidepressant medications in the same way. Conversely, if the correlation is negative and signicant, it suggests thatthe unmeasured factors affect adherence to HIV medicationsand antidepressant medications in opposite directions. In ei- ther case (signicantly positive or negative correlated error terms), a signicant correlation suggests that the decision totake HIV and antidepressant medications as prescribed are interdependent and should be modeled jointly using the seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model. Once the propermodel specication (two independent probit models or seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model) was determined, signicant correlates of nonadherence were examined basedon the signicance of the parameter estimates of the inde-pendent variables. The direction and magnitude of the cor- relate effects was determined by calculating standard marginal effects. 42Finally, two additional models were run to examine the impact of each type of adherence on the other. When adherence for one type of medication is included as an explanatory variable in the SUR equation predicting adher-ence for the other type of medication, it is referred to as the bivariate probit with endogenous dummy model 41or the re- cursive model for dichotomous choice.43For the model pre- dicting antidepressant adherence to be fully identied, the probit equation includes one exogenous independent variable (depression severity) that is not included as independentvariables in the probit equation predicting antiretroviral ad-herence. Likewise, for the model predicting antiretroviral adherence, to be fully identied, the probit equation includes one exogenous independent variable (HIV severity) that is notincluded as independent variables in the probit equation predicting antidepressant adherence (Fig. 1).Results Sample characteristics The sample consisted of 225 depressed HIV-infected vet- erans. Overall, the majority of the sample was male (97%), middle-aged (50 -10 years), and had a high school diploma (93%). Approximately 60% of the sample was AfricanAmerican, which is similar to the U.S. HIV population. 44 Over three fourths of the participants met criteria for major depressive disorder based on the MINI. Moreover, 75% of the sample also met criteria for at least 1 other comorbidmental health disorder. The participants reported a range of comorbid physical health conditions. The sample self-re- ported high rates of adherence to both their antidepressants and their antiretrovirals. Results indicated that 75.5% of those prescribed antiretrovirals ( n=192) reported 90% or greater adherence to their antiretroviral prescription while76.7% of those prescribed antidepressants ( n=146) reported 90% or greater adherence to thei r antidepressant prescrip- tion (Table 1). Among the subset of participants with both prescriptions (n=113), adherence rates were as follows: both prescrip- tions less than 90%: n=11 (9.73%); antiretroviral 90% and antidepressant adherence 90% or greater:n=16 (14.16%); antiretroviral adherence 90% or greater and antidepressant adherence less than 90%: n=10 (8.85%); and both prescriptions 90% or greater : n =76 (67.26%; see Table 2). Table 3 provides descriptive characteristics and bivariate relationships between correlates and treatment adherence. Bivariate relationships between correlates and treatment adherence Separate analyses were conducted to examine bivariate relationships between demographic correlates, mental health diagnostic status, alcohol use measures, markers of physicalhealth including HIV symptoms (both number and severity), measures of physical comorbidity, quality of life, medical knowledge, study-related factors (i.e., site), and treatmentadherence (Table 3).

Seeming unrelated regression (SUR) model. b, parameter estimates; q, correlation between the error terms; X, independent variables; e, error terms.268 BOTTONARI ET severity, self-reported verity of comorbidity, and quality of well-being ( p<0.05) were associated with antiretroviral adherence at p<0.20 in bivariate analyses. Given the high correlation between the ''number of HIV symptoms'' variable and the ''severity of HIV symptoms''variable, only the severity measure was used in subsequent analyses. In contrast, antidepressant adherence was associ- ated with the following correlates at p<0.20: gender, age (p<0.05), marital status, gener alized anxiety agnosis ( p<0.05), comorbid mental health disorder (p<0.05), and any alcohol use in the past year. Given that the 'comorbid mental health condition' variable was highlycorrelated with ''generalized anxiety disorder'' variable, only the ''generalized anxiety d isorder'' variable was used in subsequent analyses. Final prediction model A seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model was esti- mated and the positive correlation between the two errorsterms was signicant ( q=0.64, Wald test of adherence to anti- retrovirals and antidepressants were estimated jointly.Education, age, and HIV symptom severity were signicantcorrelates of antiretroviral medication adherence while gender and generalized anxiety disorder were signicant correlates of adherence to antidepressant medications (seeTable 4 for full results). The results from the bivariate probit with endogenous dummy models (available from rst au- thor upon request) indicate that antiretroviral adherencedoes not predict antidepressant adherence ( b=1.62, p=0.17) but antidepressant adherence does predict antiretroviral adherence ( b=2.30, p=0.036).Discussion The present study attempted to isolate demographic, mental health, and/or physical health factors that were associated with preintervention adherence patterns among depressedHIV-infected patients. While antiretroviral adherence did not predict antidepressant adherence, antidepressant adherence predicted antiretroviral adherence. Antidepressant adherencepredicting antiretroviral adherence is consistent with previous research. 5,16-18Certain demographic factors (i.e., age and level of education), physical health (i.e., HIV severity), and mentalhealth (i.e., generalized anxiety disorder diagnosis) were as-sociated with adherence but there were relatively few signi- cant correlates indicating the presence of omitted variables. We did note that older adults and those with comorbid generalizedanxiety disorder were more adherent, suggesting that there may be additional attention to adherence with increasing age and also among those with a tendency to worry. The ndingthat a higher level of education was predictive of poorer ad- herence in the SUR equation predicting antiretroviral adher- ence was surprising. In a recent review of results fromdeveloped and developing nations, education was not identi- ed as a predictor of antiretroviral adherence. 7However, in our sample there was a relatively small number of subjects whodid not have a high school diploma, therefore, this ndingshould not be over-interpreted. The negative relationship be- tween adherence and HIV symptom severity suggests to us that those who are feeling better may be motivated to maintainthis status via adherence to their regimens. Overall, our nd- ings were modest, suggesting the variables we measured were of limited utility in predicting nonadherence behaviors. The clinical implications of our ndings may be helpful for clinical providers. Results suggested that antidepressant ad- herence affected adherence to antiretrovirals but not viceversa. Given that the subjects enrolled in this investigationare active patients in HIV clinics and were suffering from depression, this suggests that clinical providers' efforts to improve antidepressant adherence may also improve anti-retroviral adherence, which is especially important given the virologic impact of inconsistent antiretroviral adherence. Our ndings mirrors several other investigations that have alsoprovided evidence of improved adherence to antiretrovirals among depressed individuals taking antidepressants. 5,16-18 However, we also simultaneously found that antiretroviral adherence did not impact antidepressant adherence. Even so, more research is needed to examine potential moderatorsTable 1.Overview of Treatment Adherence and Medications Prescribed Antiretroviral medication ( n=192) Antidepressant medication ( n=146) Mean -SD; range Mean -SD; range Treatment adherence Antiretroviral adherence (%) 87.7 -25.7; range =0-100 Antidepressant adherence (%) 84.3 -32.3; range =0-100 No. of medications prescribed Antiretrovirals\u2014self-report 2.4 Antidepressants\u2014chart -0.6; range =0-3 SD, standard deviation.

The present investigation has a number of strengths as well as noteworthy limitations. First, a major strength of the present investigation is the use of real-world patients, i.e., depressed HIV-infected veterans who were patients seekingcare in three VA HIV clinics. The eligibility criteria for this investigation were minimal so as to facilitate generalizability of these nding and the overall trial to HIV-infected veteransseeking care in the VA more generally. Moreover, the racialmakeup of our sample (60% African American) is similar to the U.S. HIV population, 44which further improves general- izability. Second, we were able to examine correlates for bothantiretroviral and antidepressant adherence simultaneously using the SUR modeling techniques. Limitations of the pres- ent investigation include reliance on self-reported treatmentadherence (which involves considerable measurement error), limited variables available due to limitations in data collec- tion, restriction of sample to veterans, use of cross-sectionaldata, few women in the sample, and modest sample size in theSUR model. Although there are benets and drawbacks to self-reported HIV treatment adherence, it can be used to ef- fectively estimate adherence. 45Even so, future trials may want to build on our results using more objective methods of measurement such as MEMS caps, pill count, or pharmacy record review and utilize a window of measurement that islonger than 4 days. 46Additionally, we believe that limitations in the variable ''patient's knowledge of regimen'' may be re- sponsible for the nonassociation between the knowledge andadherence variables. Furthermore, though the Veterans Af- fairs network of health care (VAMCs) is the largest provider of HIV care in the United States, the veteran population does notmirror the overall HIV-infected population in the UnitedStates. Indeed, veterans in care for HIV infection are more likely to be male and older than the average U.S. HIV-infected adult. Although the percentage of female veterans receivingcare at VAMCs is increasing, women are underrepresented in comparison to the percentage of HIV-infected women in the general U.S. population. We were limited in the interpretationof gender-related and possibly education-related ndings given the limited variability of these factors in our sample. Finally, although we had 225 participants with either an an-tidepressant or antiretroviral prescription in our baseline sample, our sample size was much smaller ( N=113) when we restricted the sample to those with both prescriptions. In conclusion, among our clinically depressed, treatment- seeking HIV-infected participants, demographic factors (i.e., age and level of education), physical health (i.e., HIV se-verity), and mental health (i.e., generalized anxiety disorder diagnosis) were correlates of self-reported adherence. We found limited support for additional mental and/or physicalhealth factors as correlates of adherence to these regimens.Our ndings also demonstrated that antidepressant adher- ence was associated with antiretroviral adherence in the SUR model but not vice versa. Future research is needed toidentify and test additional factors and interventions that jointly impact antiretroviral and antidepressant adherence among treatment-seeking HIV-infected patients.

Britton, MD, MPH; Alison Pedley, PhD; Joseph M. Murabito, MD, ScM; Udo Hoffmann, MD, Caroline S. Fox, MD, MPH Background- \u2014Thoracic periaortic adipose tissue (TAT) is associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and may play a role in obesity-mediated vascular disease. We sought to determine the prevalence, distribution, and riskfactor correlates of high TAT. Methods and Results- \u2014Participants from the Framingham Heart Study (n =3246, 48% women, mean age 51.1 years) underwent multidetector computed tomography; high TAT and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were de ned on the basis of sex-speci c 90th percentiles in a healthy referent sample. The prevalence of high TAT was 38.1% in women and 35.7% in men. Among individualswithout high VAT, 10.1% had high TAT. After adjustment for age and VAT, both women and men with high TAT in the absence ofhigh VAT were older and had a higher prevalence of CVD ( P<0.0001) compared with those without high TAT. In addition, men in this group were more likely to be smokers ( P=0.02), whereas women were more likely to have low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.005). Conclusions- \u2014Individuals in our community-based sample with high TAT in the absence of high VAT were characterized by an adverse cardiometabolic pro le. This adipose tissue phenotype may identify a subset of individuals with distinct metabolic characteristics. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2012;0:e004200 \u0081risk factors \u0081visceral adipose tissue Obesity is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.1The mechanisms by which obesity might contribute to vascular disease remain incompletely under- stood. Body fat distribution may be a cardiovascular risk factor even after accounting for generalized adiposity.2One component of abnormal body fat deposition involves thedeposition of adipose tissue, so-called ectopic fat, around organs and the vasculature.3Perivascular fat is one such ectopic fat depot that has been postulated to have a local pathogenic effect on blood vessels.4-8Thoracic periaortic fat is a subtype of perivascular fat computed tomography (MDCT).9 Thoracic periaortic fat (TAT) may be a novel risk marker for cardiovascular disease.10,11We have previously shown that TAT is associated with certain metabolic risk factors after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) as well as abdominal aortic and coronary calcium after adjustment for either BMI or visceral adipose tissue (VAT).11However, the prevalence and age distribution of TAT in a community-based sample has notbeen described. In addition, given the known correlation between TAT and VAT 11and the known association of VAT with cardiometabolic risk,12we sought to examine the relative association of high TAT versus high VAT with cardiometabolic risk by examining different patterns of thoracic periaortic and visceral fat deposition in a cohort of middle-aged individuals enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study.

In 2002, individuals with at least 1 parent in the Offspring cohort were enrolled in the Third-Generation cohort. The study designs have been described previ- ously.13,14The present study included participants from the Offspring and Third-Generation cohorts who participated in the MDCT substudy between 2002 and 2005 as previously described.12Of the 3529 participants in the MDCT substudy, 3246 had interpretable values for TAT. Of the individuals with interpretable TAT, 3228 had interpretable values for VAT. For individual regressions, any individuals with datamissing the covariate of interest were excluded. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the Boston University Medical Center and Massachusetts General Hospital. All subjects provided written informed consent. MDCT Scan Protocol and Adipose Tissue Measurements Participants underwent radiographic assessment of their thorax and abdomen in the supine position using an 8-slice MDCT scanner (LightSpeed Ultra, General Electric,Milwaukee, WI) as previously described. 9The thoracic scan was performed during an inspiratory breath hold with prospective ECG triggering (with the center of acquisition window at 70% of the R-R cycle to minimize cardiac motion). The average scan time was 18 seconds (tube voltage of 120 kVp, tube current of 320 mA ( <220 lbs) or 400 mA (>220 lbs) with a gantry rotation time of 500 ms and a temporal resolution of 330 ms. Thoracic and abdominal MDCT images were reconstructed as 2.5- and 5-mm nonov- erlapping slices, respectively. TAT and VAT were assessed using a dedicated workstation (Aquarius 3D, TeraRecon, San Mateo, CA). Fat volumes were measured by a semiautomatic segmentation technique requiring manual de nition of tissue borders. Fat within anarea of interest was de ned by pixels with characteristic Houns eld units (HU; window width /C0195 to /C045 HU; window center /C0120 HU). The area of interest for TAT was dened anteriorly by the area immediately surrounding the thoracic aorta (de ned by a line drawn horizontally through the esophagus, which connected to the left costovertebral joint) and posteriorly by the right lateral border of the vertebral body and the anterior edge of the vertebral body.9 This resulted in a 6.75-cm column of fat (27 slices)surrounding the thoracic aorta. VAT was quanti ed on abdominal scans as previously described. 12Briefly, the reader dened the area of interest by tracing the abdominal muscular wall and separating the subcutaneous from the visceral abdominal fat depot. These areas of interest were summed over the 25 abdominal slices. Intrareader and interreader (assessed between 2 readers) reproducibility was excellent for both TAT and VAT, with intraclass and interclass correlations >0.98.9,15A visual representation of the methodology for measuring TAT is presented in Figure 1. Covariate Assessment Covariates were measured at the seventh FraminghamOffspring examination (1998 -2001) and the rst Third- Generation examination (2002 -2005). BMI was de ned as weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of the height (in meters). Waist circumference (WC) was measured at the level of the umbilicus. Current smoking was de ned as smoking 1 cigarette per day in the past year. Alcohol use was assessed by physician-administered questionnaires, and dichotomizedon the basis of consumption of 14 drinks per week (in men) or7 drinks per week (in women). A physical activity index (PAI) score was calculated by summing the reported numbers for each level of activity, weighted by their estimated metabolic expenditure, as described previously. 16The PAI ranges from a minimum score of 24, indicating 24 hours of AB Figure 1.

Serum triglycerides, total and high- density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose were measured on fasting morning samples. Fasting plasma glucose 126 mg/dL or treatment with a hypoglycemic agent or insulin was used to de ne diabetes mellitus. Hypertension was de ned as a systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or treatment with an antihypertensive agent. Metabolic syndrome was de ned from the modi ed Adult Treatment Panel criteria.17If periods had stopped for >1 year, women were considered postmeno- pausal. Cardiovascular disease included coronary heart disease, stroke, intermittent claudication, and congestive heart failure. Statistical Analysis To determine the prevalence of high TAT, a healthy referent sample was created by hierarchical exclusion of participants with the following covariates: BMI 30 kg/m2(n=874), pres- ence of hypertension <50 mg/dL in women; n =193), impaired fasting glucose, diabetes or use of hypoglycemic medications (n =215); prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD; n=9); current tobacco smoking (n=12), and missing covariates (n =24), resulting in 499 women and 316 men. We de ned high TAT as a sex-speci c fat volume 90th percentile from the healthy referent sample. Sex-speci c TAT volumes <90th percentile from the healthy referent sample were classi ed as normal. The 90th percen- tile was chosen to ensure adequate sample size in the healthy referent sample to provide statistically robust estimates for the fat volume cutoff values. This method used to determine the volume for high TAT was the same as that used for other fat depots in the Framingham Heart Study.18,19High TAT, by this de nition, corresponded with volumes 10.2 cm3in women and 19.0 cm3in men. Prevalence estimates of high TAT were then determined in the overall sample (including those individuals who had been excluded from the healthyreferent sample) and strati ed by sex and the following age categories: 35 to 44, 45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84 years. To establish the risk factor pro les associated with different patterns of TAT and VAT, we strati ed our sample into 4 mutually exclusive categories on the basis of TAT and VAT volumes: (A) normal TAT and normal VAT, (B) high TAT but normal VAT, (C) high VAT and normal TAT, and (D) high TAT and high VAT. High VAT has been previously de ned as 1359 cm 3in women and 2323 cm3in men. Given the known correlation between TAT and VAT,10we examineddifferences in risk factor levels between the discordant categories (groups B versus C) using sex-speci c age-adjusted analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) and logistic regressions. Given that high VAT is already recognized as associated with an adverse cardiometabolic risk factor pro le, we also examined differences in risk factors among individuals with normal VAT that were discordant for high TAT (groups A versus B). For these analyses, we used sex-speci c ANCOVAs and logistic regres- sions adjusted for age as well as the volume of VAT. We also adjusted for VAT given that individuals with high TAT andnormal VAT tended to have higher absolute volumes of VAT compared with those with normal TAT and normal VAT. We did not adjust for height given the lack of documented association between height and TAT ( r=0.05, P=0.25 in women; r=0.01, P=0.75 in men) 11We tested for an age interaction across the 4 different categories of TAT/VAT. When age interactions were signicant, we performed additional analyses strati ed by median age. Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis restricting our sample to the Third-Generation cohort in whom risk factor assessment and MDCT scans were performed during the same period. SAS version 9.1 was used to perform all computations. Two-sided Pvalues <0.05 were considered signi cant. Because of the exploratory nature of this study, no adjust- ments were made for multiple comparisons. Results Overall, 1558 women and 1688 men for a total sample of 3246 individuals were included in this analysis. For the overall sample, the mean values for TAT in women and men were 9.9 and 17.5 cm3, respectively. The characteristics of the sample population are described in Table 1. Distribution of Thoracic Periaortic Fat in the Community Sex- and age-speci c TAT volumes are represented in Table 2. TAT volumes increased with age into the eighth decade for women and into the seventh decade for men for all percentiles of fat. Prevalence of High Thoracic Periaortic Fat The overall and age-strati ed prevalence of high TAT, de ned as90th percentile in the healthy referent sample, is reported in Table 3. The overall prevalence for high TAT was 38.1% in women and 35.7% in men and increased with age ( Pvalue for linear trend <0.0001). As expected, the prevalence of high TAT increased with increasing BMI and waist circumference categories (Table 4). DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.112.004200 Journal of the American Heart Association 3Thoracic Periaortic Fat and Risk Factors Britton et alORIGINAL RESEARCHCardiometabolic Risk Factor Pro les by Patterns of Thoracic Periaortic Fat and Visceral AdiposeTissue Given the known high correlation between TAT and VAT (r=0.75, P<0.001),11we divided individuals into 4 categories on the basis of the presence or absence of high TAT and thepresence or absence of high VAT to better evaluate the unique correlates of each fat depot. We then compared cardiometabolic risk factors between individuals with high TAT and normal VAT versus high VAT and normal TAT. In addition, among individuals with normal VAT, we compared cardiometabolic risk factors among individuals discordant for high TAT. In the overall sample, 16.4% of women and 18.8% of men were discordant for high TAT and high VAT. Comparing discordant groups, women with high TAT and normal VATcompared with high VAT and normal TAT were older but tended to have lower measures of clinical adiposity and better cardiometabolic risk factor pro les after adjusting for age (Table 5). In contrast, men with high TAT and normal VAT compared with high VAT and normal TAT were older and had a lower waist circumference, but otherwise the cardiometabolic proles were not signi cantly different (Table 5). Among individuals with normal VAT, high TAT compared with normal TAT was associated with a more adverse cardiometabolic pro le. Speci cally, these individuals were older and had a higher prevalence of the majority ofcardiometabolic risk factors, including a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (Table 5). Findings were similar when we also adjusted for BMI (data not shown). However, individuals with high TAT and normal VAT also had a higher absolute volume of VAT compared with individuals with normal TAT and normal VAT. Given this difference in VAT volumes, our ndings presented in Figure 2 re flect additional adjustment of these models for the absolute volume of VAT. In these models, the presence of high TAT was associated with prevalent CVD inboth sexes (age- and VAT-adjusted P=0.01 in women, Figure 2A; and P=0.004 in men, Figure 2B). In addition, among women with normal VAT, high TAT was associated with signicantly lower HDL levels ( P=0.005) (Figure 2A). In men with high TAT and normal VAT, there was a higher prevalence of smoking (age-VAT-adjusted P=0.02) and higher BMI ( P=0.004) compared with individuals with normal VAT and normal TAT. After adjustment for the volume of VAT, the difference in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was no longer different between those with high TAT versus normal TAT. When we reexamined the association of high TAT versus normal TAT withCVD prevalence after adjustment for low HDL and current smoking (in addition to adjustment for age and volume of VAT), there remained a signi cant association in both women (P=0.02) and men ( P=0.01). There were multiple signi cant age interactions across the 4 categories of TAT/VAT categories. Thus, we performed analysis strati ed by median age. The results were generally similar to the overall ndings (data not shown). Finally, in our sensitivity analysis limited to the Third Generation cohort, whounderwent risk factor and MDCT assessment during the same time period, ndings were overall similar (Table 6). Table 1.

DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.112.004200 Journal of the American Heart Association 4Thoracic Periaortic Fat and Risk Factors Britton et alORIGINAL RESEARCHDiscussion In our community-based sample, more than a third of individuals had high TAT. In the absence of high VAT, excess TAT identi ed a subset of individuals with a higher prevalence of adverse cardiometabolic characteristics compared with individuals without high TAT even after adjustment for total volume of VAT. This included a higher prevalence of CVD in both women and men, lower HDL levels in women, and a higher prevalence of current smoking in men. These ndings provide a better understanding of the risk factor correlates of TAT, a speci c subtype of perivascular fat. Further experi- mental studies are required to elucidate whether TAT is pathogenic. Multiple basic science and small clinical studies have suggested a local effect of perivascular fat that changeswith the development of obesity. 5,6,8Previous work in the Table 2.

Journal of the American Heart Association 6Thoracic Periaortic Fat and Risk Factors Britton et alORIGINAL RESEARCHFramingham Heart Study has demonstrated a novel and reliable method of quantifying thoracic periaortic fat by MDCT.9We now present a comprehensive age- and sex- speci c description of TAT distribution in a community-based sample and report differences in cardiometabolic features among subcategories of TAT and VAT. Ourndings that more than one third of individuals in the community had high TAT is similar to our previous reports of fat depots, including VAT, pericardial, and intrathoracic fat.18,19Despite this similar prevalence among various fat depots, our ndings suggest that a high volume of TAT is associated with adverse cardiometabolic features among the subset of individuals with normal VAT. Prior work has highlighted the existence of \"metabolically obese normal weight individuals \"who exhibit glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia despite a normal BMI.20Differences in visceral adiposity have been postulated to contribute to this phenotype.21Ourndings suggest that high thoracic periaor- tic fat may also identify a \"metabolically obese \"group among individuals who do not meet criteria for excess VAT. Some of these differences, such as the higher prevalence of CVD, are present in both sexes. However, others are sex speci c, with a prevalence of low HDL higher in women than men. This ndingis consistent with prior literature suggesting stronger asso- ciations of ectopic fat and metabolic risk factors in women compared with men. However, the prevalence of current smoking was higher in men than in women with high TAT/ normal VAT compared with normal TAT/normal VAT. TAT is directly wrapped around the aorta, and this distinct anatomic location may explain the speci c association between high TAT and CVD among individuals with normal VAT. TAT may serve as a marker of perivascular fat throughout the body including smaller blood vessels, andperivascular fat has been postulated to have adverse effects on the vasculature. 4,5Supporting this, prior work in the Framingham Heart Study has demonstrated an association between TAT and both abdominal aortic calcium and coronary artery calcium among individuals without known cardiovas- cular disease. These associations persisted after adjustment for VAT and standard cardiovascular risk factors.10Alterna- tively, our ndings that high TAT was associated with CVD among individuals with normal VAT may re flect that these individuals were more likely to have a higher prevalence of certain CVD risk factors, including low HDL in women andsmoking in men. Ourndings of a difference in the prevalence of smoking among men with normal VAT but discordant for TAT deserves speci c comment. Smokers tend to have a lower body weight but are known to have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Ectopic fat distribution, speci cally higher volumes of VAT, is already known to differ between smokers and nonsmokers. 22We have extended these ndings among individuals with normal VAT by demonstrating a higherprevalence of male smokers among individuals with high versus normal TAT. These ndings are noteworthy given the potential modulating role of nicotine on perivascular fat previously demonstrated in animal models. 23Speci cally, exposure of rats to nicotine prenatally and during lactation led to an increase in total adiposity as well as perivascular fat in the offspring compared with controls. Furthermore, the normal anticontractile effect of perivascular fat on blood vessels was no longer present in nicotine-exposed offspring, but was restored with the transfer of the medium surround- ing normal fat. Thus, nicotine was associated with highervolumes as well as dysfunction of perivascular fat. These ndings are consistent with prior work suggesting that excess perivascular adipose tissue disrupts the normal contribution of perivascular fat to vascular tone 24and further suggest that nicotine may contribute to this process. Other studies also support a potential role of nicotine on adipose tissue.25,26For example, differences in adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity have been found between smokers and nonsmokers.25Thus, elucidation of the full expression prole of perivascular fat in response to nicotine may help to extend our observational ndings. ****A Normal 05101520253035 VAT/Normal TAT TAT* **B Current Smoker CVD Low HDL p<0.05 p<0.005* ** Figure 2.

This allowed exploration of differences within subgroups of TAT and VAT and limited referral bias. We assessed TAT and VAT using ahighly reproducible CT volumetric assessment. Certain limitations warrant discussion. The cross-sectional and observational design of the analysis prevents inferences of causality or temporality. The Framingham Heart Study is predominantly white, and results cannot be generalized to other ethnic groups. We did not have information on the severity of CVD. Our analyses were exploratory, and we did not account for multiple testing. Replication of our ndings in independent cohorts is warranted. There were temporaldifferences between the MDCT scans and the risk factor assessments among the Offspring cohort. However, our sensitivity analysis limited to the Third-Generation cohort (in which MDCT scans and risk factor assessment occurred during the same period) demonstrated overall similar ndings. Finally, our ndings do not suggest that TAT quanti cation should be used as a clinical tool. Conclusions Elevated TAT is prevalent in the community and is associatedwith adverse cardiometabolic features, including CVD, smok- ing, and low HDL among individuals with normal VAT. Further work to better understand the biology of TAT and its association with metabolic and cardiovascular disease may provide insight into a potentially unique pathogenic role of periaortic fat.

Subjects were interviewed by telephone, and responseswere compared with information in their medical records. Prevalence, sensitivity, speci city, and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated. The prevalence of ever having been diagnosed with epilepsy was 3.1% by self-report and 2.7% by medical record review. Sensitivity was 84.2%, speci city was 99.2%, and PPV was 73.5% for self-reported lifetime epilepsy, and values were similar for active epilepsy. By comparison,sensitivity was higher and speci city was lower for epilepsy medication use and seizure occurrence. The PPV for seizure occurrence was substantially higher for a recall period of 12 months than for 3 months. These results compare favorably with results for other chronic conditions, such as diabetes and arthritis, andindicate that questionnaires can be used to identify epilepsy at a population level. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Depending on the region and methods of measurement, recent prevalence estimates range from 0.6 to 2.0% for lifetime epilepsy and from 0.5 to 1.0% for active epilepsy [3-8] . Epilepsy has important effects on physical activities and emotional health and can lead to diminished social functioning and decrements in health-related quality of life [5,9,10] . Persons with epilepsy are more likely to report fair or poor health status and more unhealthy days than persons without epilepsy [5,10] , and persons with active epilepsy report worse health than those with inactive epilepsy. Adults with epilepsy are also more likely to report being depressed than those without epilepsy, and are signi cantly more likely to smoke, not exercise, and be obese than people without epilepsy [3,11] . Given the signi cance of this condition, it is important to conduct population-based surveillance of epilepsy to measure its prevalenceand monitor changes over time, identify variability in population sub- groups, and provide information for purposes of planning and target- ing interventions for those with epilepsy. Various methods have been used to identify patients with epilepsy in prevalence studies. Hauser et al. used a database with detailed medical information from their large epidemiological study of Rochester, MN, USA, to identify patients with epilepsy [12]. Others have used individual practices 'medical records to identify epilepsy cases [13]. Although both of these methods provide accurate epilepsy identi cation, they are not feasible for assessing epilepsy in larger community-wide populations, nor are they feasible for continuous monitoring. Measurement of epilepsy prevalence in a community population can be accomplished through the use of surveys. The Epilepsy Group at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) devel- oped a set of ve questions ( Table 1 ) to assess the prevalence and impact of epilepsy. Prevalence of epilepsy is determined by the rst three questions in the set. Although these questions have been used in numerous surveys, including the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil- lance Survey (BRFSS), the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), and the Healthstyles Survey [3,5-8,10,11,14] , they have not previous- ly been subject to validation. The present study sought to validate the questions used to estimate epilepsy prevalence by comparing patients 'responses with documentation in their medical records.Epilepsy & Behavior 23 (2012) 57 -63 Corresponding author at: Center for the Assessment of Pharmaceutical Practices (CAPP), Department of Health Policy and Management, Boston University School ofPublic Health, Boston, MA 02118, USA.

Study population The study was conducted among a sample of patients at Boston Medical Center (BMC) in Boston, MA, USA, who were 18 years old, able to speak English, and cognitively able to participate in a telephone interview. BMC is an urban multispecialty teaching hospital that provides primary and specialty care and is also a major source of care for low-income residents and immigrants. The study was approved by the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Because a simple random sample of patients would yield few cases of epilepsy, we sampled patients after stratifying according to probability of having an epilepsy diagnosis. To identify putative epilepsy cases, we searched the electronic administrative/billing and medical record system, which covers visits back to 2000, for all patients with an ICD-9 code of either 345.XX1or 780.39 or a listing of the terms \"epilepsy\" or \"seizure disorder\" in the medical record problem list. Similar methodology has been used by others to identify epilepsy cases using ICD-9 codes [15-18] . For putative noncases, we started with a list of all patients who had a doctor in the primary care clinic and who met the general study eligibility criteria, and removed persons who met the criteria for putative cases. We narrowed the sampling frame for both putative cases and noncases to patients who had made either: (1) two or more visits to the primary care or neurology clinics within the past 2 years, or (2) one visit to the primary care clinic or neurology clinic and at least one nonemergency inpatient visit within the past 2 years. This criterion was imposed to increase the likelihood that there would be a current telephone number for contacting subjects as well as sufcient information in the medical record to establish the validity of their survey responses. Because of these concerns, subjects whose only contact with BMC was through the emergency department were excluded. Although the emergency department is a potentially important point of care for persons with epilepsy, a preliminary review of medical records found that information documented in the record of an emergency department visit was insuf cient to identify a case of epilepsy unless there were also other visits toBMC. A random sample of eligible putative cases and noncases were then selected to be contacted for a phone interview. 2.2. Data collection Patient information was obtained from different sources; those used in this analysis include the administrative/billing database, telephone interviews, and medical chart reviews. The administrative/ billing database provided basic demographics: sex, age, race/ethnicity, marital status, zip code of residence (which together with 2000 Census data was used to assign the median neighborhood income to eachsubject), medical insurance information, and health care utilization data. 2.3. Patient recruitment and telephone interviews Interviews were conducted over a 10-month period from December 2006 to October 2007. After receiving permission from their neurologist or primary care physician, we used telephone numbers from the administrative record to contact potential respondents. Trained interviewers made a minimum of nine attempts to reach each patient at different days and times, including evenings and weekends. For patients we were unable to contact and who had made a subsequent visit to BMC, we consulted the administrative record for an updated telephone number. On reaching a potential respondent, we described the study in a general manner that did not reveal its purpose or its focus on epilepsy. Persons who agreed to participate were consented by phone and administered the questionnaire; no proxy respondents were permitted. All interviews were conducted in English. The average length of the interview was 15 minutes. The telephone interview questionnaire (see Appendix for entire survey instrument) contained the ve Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) screening questions regarding epi- lepsy ( Table 1 ), as well as the VR-12 Health Survey instrument, BRFSS Healthy Days questions, and demographic items. We also added several supplementary epilepsy and seizure-related questions designed to provide more detail and help interpret answers to the screening questions. Questions included age at rst diagnosis, causes of seizures if not epilepsy, number of seizures (lifetime and past 12 months), and site of medical care for ongoing epilepsy treatment and for most recent seizure. All ve screening questions were asked of all study participants regardless of their responses to a previous item. To assess reliability of responses, we called back 50 putativecases within 4 -6 weeks of their initial interview and readministered the screening questions and selected additional items. 2.4. Medical chart reviews Data collection from the medical charts of telephone question- naire respondents was performed by specially trained research staff with a clinical background. The chart review instrument comprised clinical variables capable of validating the screening questions and was developed based on the input of study epileptologists and neurologists. The form and protocols for the chart reviews were developed and tested in an iterative fashion to accommodate the variability in chart documentation as practiced in different settings and by different physicians. The chart review forms are available from the corresponding author (L.E.K.). The reviewers abstracted data related to epilepsy, including its assessment, treatment, side effects, and complications, using clinician notes for primary care and speci c medical subspecialty visits, as well as documented data on emergency department and inpatient visits. Chart reviews covered the period that a patient began receiving care at BMC beginning as far back as 2000, when the electronic medical record system rst became operational, through the date of the phone interview. The note from each visit was reviewed andTable 1 Epilepsy screening questions. 1. Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have a seizure disorder or epilepsy? 2.

Brooks et al. / Epilepsy & Behavior 23 (2012) 57 -63information on diagnoses, seizure history, referrals, and changes in medications contained in the note was entered onto the data abstrac- tion instrument. Abstractions were aided by a glossary of medical terms, which also contained the names of all medications used in the treatment of epilepsy and described each respective class of drugs. Speci c data elements captured fell into three general categories: demographics and utilization of services, seizure history and diagno- sis, and treatment and medications. The seizure history and diagnosis section included the occurrence, frequency, and recurrence of seizures and diagnoses of epilepsy or \"seizure disorder. \"The treat- ment and medications section covered dosage and frequency and whether a recent change had been made in the medication. Diagnoses of other medical conditions were also collected from the chart and used to construct indices of physical and mental comorbidities [19]. A sample of records were reviewed a second time by a second abstractor to determine interrater reliability. A higher percentage of charts were tested during the rst 2 months of data abstraction to identify and correct any areas of particularly high disagreement among the abstractors. 2.5. Validation of epilepsy test items We used information collected from patient medical records at BMC as the standard against which to compare self-report data from the telephone questionnaire for screening questions Q1 -Q3 (Table 1 ). A diagnosis of epilepsy (Q1) was con rmed based on documentation in the patients 'medical record. Medical records docu- mented the clinical histories of epilepsy, as well as EEG and other neuroimaging test results, blood work, and referrals with varying degrees of detail. Thus, we accepted physician diagnoses as evidence of epilepsy when these were documented in the medical record without ambiguity or inconsistency. However, when ambiguities were noted, an epileptologist G.M. who was an internal consultant to the study and familiar with the study protocols reviewed the re- cord, considering all available clinical information in the charts, in- cluding test results, to make the case determination. The criterion for a diagnosis of epilepsy was explicit mention of \"epilepsy\" or \"seizure disorder \"in either a clinician note or the patient's problem list. Current medication use (Q2) was con rmed based on prescriptions noted in the medical record at the time of the telephone interview. Occurrence of seizures in the past 3 months (Q3) was validated based on mention of a seizure at any visit to BMC during that time frame as calculated from the date of interview. We were also interested in the validity of 12-month recall of seizures and so included this item in the telephone questionnaire, which was validated as described above but for a 12-month period. 2.6. Statistical analysis All data from administrative records, questionnaires, and chart reviews were entered into a relational database and linked by a common study ID number. We rst calculated the adjusted response rate as the number of completed interviews divided by the total sample excluding those determined to be ineligible and those expected to be ineligible among those who were not contacted based on the proportion ineligible among those contacted [20,21] . We also calculated the cooperation rate (completed interviews as proportion of potential respondents reached and determined to be eligible). Response rates are reported separately for putative epilepsy cases and noncases and strati ed by the demographic, utilization, and clinical factors listed in Tables 2A and 2B . The primary measures used to assess the accuracy of Q1 -Q3 were sensitivity, speci city, positive predictive value, and the difference in the estimate of prevalence based on self-report versus chart-based data. Because the sample had been constructed to oversamplepersons likely to have epilepsy, we weighted three strata, as identi- ed hierarchically in the electronic billing system [putative cases based on (1) ICD-9 345.1 or (2) ICD-9 780.39 or problem list mention, and (3) putative noncases], so that their distribution would be more representative of a sample randomly drawn from a community- based population. We weighted the data to the distribution of the three strata in the electronic billing system for patients who attended the Primary Care Center at BMC, which we took as the closest approx- imation to a community-based sample among the BMC patient popu- lation. The distribution of the three strata 1.76% for 345.1 putative cases, 95.8% for putative noncases. We weighted each stratum so that it summed to its propor- tion of the total sample size. Weights were equal to 0.064, 0.131, and 4.46 for the three strata, respectively. Using the weighted data, we rst calculated measures of validity for reported lifetime and active epilepsy. We de ned reported life- time epilepsy as an af rmative answer to the rst screening question: \"Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have a seizure disorder or epilepsy? \"We de ned active epilepsy as a report of lifetime epilepsy along with (1) currently being on medication for epilepsy and/or (2) having had a seizure in the past 3 months [5-8] . We also tested an alternative de nition in which the period of last seizure was extended to 12 months. We excluded seven participants who could not be categorized as self-reporting lifetime or active epilepsy because they responded \"don't know\" or \"refused\" to the relevant questions. We also assessed validity of lifetime and active epilepsy strati ed by demographic (sex, age, race, median income of zip code ofTable 2A Adjusted response rates, cooperation rates, and number and distribution of inter-viewees, by demographic and health-related characteristics, among putative cases.

Brooks et al. / Epilepsy & Behavior 23 (2012) 57 -63residence), utilization (most recent visit before initial phone contact, total number of neurology and primary care visits in past 2 years), and clinical (physical health comorbidities, mental health comorbid- ities) variables. We summed the current physical and mental health comorbidities based on ICD-9 codes listed in the administrative/ billing database from 30 physical health and 6 mental health condi- tions that constitute the Selim Comorbidity Index, a previously validated measure [19]. However, we excluded seizures, which is one of the conditions in the original index. One analytical complication in the strati ed analysis arose from the presence of a single false-positive report of epilepsy among the 215 subjects in the putative noncase stratum, all of whom were determined not to have epilepsy by chart review. Because subjects in this stratum had such large weights relative to the two putative case strata, the demographic or clinical category that happened to contain this individual always had lower accuracy than other strata. Because of its distorting effect on the results, we excluded this one observation from the analysis of stratum-speci c measures. We used the same accuracy measures to evaluate the performance of Q2 and Q3. We restricted analyses to respondents with self- reported lifetime epilepsy, regardless of con rmation by chart review, as this represented the performance of the questions as they would function in an actual survey setting where all respondents who answered af rmatively to the rst question would be asked the remaining questions. We again excluded the single putative noncase with a false-positive report of lifetime epilepsy. This individual constituted the only observation in this stratum and greatly in flatedthe standard error while providing essentially no information about the true distribution of responses. Therefore, the analysis included only the two putative case strata, which together accounted for 86% of the weighted value of all participants with self-reported epilepsy. For all of the above analyses, we used the SVYSET procedure in STATA 10.1, accounting for different weights and the strati ed sampling scheme [22]. Because the standard symmetric con dence intervals based on the normal approximation to the binomial are increasingly inaccurate at proportions very close to 0 or 1, we calculated asymmetric 95% con dence intervals based directly on the binomial distribution [23]. 3. Results We sampled a total of putative epilepsy cases putative noncases. Compared with the latter, putative cases were more likely to be white (38% vs 19%), have made fewer visits to BMC in the past 2 years (one to three visits: 43% vs 30%), and have fewer physical health comorbid- ities (none or one comorbidity: 41% vs 22%). Among the putative epilepsy cases, 332 were ineligible, 580 could not be reached, 348 refused to be interviewed, and 467 completed the telephone inter-view. The corresponding gures among putative noncases were 209 ineligible, 387 unable to be reached, 288 refused, and 216 completed. Response rates were 38% among putative cases and 28% among putative noncases, whereas the cooperation rates were 57 and 43%, respectively ( Table 2A ). Response and cooperation rates were higher for putative cases than noncases in virtually all demographic, utiliza- tion, and clinical categories. Factors associated with higher response rates among both putative cases and noncases included more recent visit to BMC, greater number of visits in past 2 years, and more phys- ical health comorbidities. Among putative noncases, response rates were also higher among persons with a larger number of mental health comorbidities. Differences in response rates between putative cases and noncases were particularly large among those who were residents of the lowest income tertile of zip codes (39% vs 23%), had not been to BMC for >1 year (25% vs 7%), and had made 1 -3 (34% vs 18%) or 10 (47% vs. 32%) visits to BMC in the past 2 years. 3.1. Lifetime and active epilepsy The results for the validation of lifetime and active epilepsy are summarized in Table 3 . The prevalence of lifetime epilepsy in this sample was 3.1% by self-report and 2.7% by chart review. Sensitivity and speci city of self-reported lifetime epilepsy were 84.2 and 99.2%, respectively, and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 73.5%. Approximately 85% of subjects with lifetime epilepsy had active epilepsy by both chart review and self-report. Of the 302 patients with active epilepsy based on chart review, only one wasTable 2B Adjusted response rates, cooperation rates, and number and distribution of inter-viewees, by demographic and health-related characteristics, among putative 47% 77 36% Time from visit before initial contact date b1 mo 33% 43% 112 care physician.

Brooks et al. / Epilepsy & Behavior 23 (2012) 57 -63not taking medication but had had a seizure in the 3 months prior to the interview. Sensitivity, speci city, predictive value, and the differ- ence in active epilepsy prevalence between self-report and chart re- view were almost the same as for lifetime epilepsy. Extending the time since last seizure to 12 months had almost no impact on the prevalence or accuracy of active epilepsy, because the great majority of respondents quali ed on the basis of taking medication. Table 4 outlines the results of a strati ed analysis of the accuracy of active epilepsy based on demographic and clinical variables. Prevalence measured by self-report was generally lower than that measured by chart review, but differences were generally small (range: 0.1 -0.8%). Measures of speci city also varied within a small range (99.5 -100%). There were no signi cant differences in sensitiv- ity, but rates were lower for older adults and those who had not visited BMC for 6 months. Persons with mental comorbidities had a signi cantly lower PPV than those without any comorbidities. We also used logistic regression analysis to simultaneously adjust for all the characteristics in Table 4 to identify the primary predictors of a false (positive or negative) response for active epilepsy. The odds of a false response were higher among subjects who were male, had more physical or mental comorbidities, and had not visited BMC for 6 months (data not shown). We also conducted a supplementary analysis to explore reasons for the false-positive responses for lifetime epilepsy. Because Q1 asks \"Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have a seizure disorder orepilepsy ,\"we hypothesized that false-positive responses were more likely to occur among subjects who had experienced a sei- zure which had not been diagnosed with epilepsy. A subsequent question in the telephone interview asked whether patients were speci cally diagnosed as having epilepsy or another seizure disorder,and 62% of false-positive responses named some sort of seizure disor- der but not explicitly epilepsy, compared with 41% of true-positive responses. The medical history of the single false-positive case from the putative noncase stratum illustrates the potential for this problem. In addition to responding af rmatively to the question about lifetime epilepsy, the subject also reported currently using medication forepilepsy or seizure disorder. In response to follow-up questions, the subject could not say whether the diagnosis was epilepsy or some- thing else. Review of the medical record revealed that the subject had suffered serious head trauma several years ago. The subject was started on an antiseizure medication (phenytoin), which appears to have been discontinued. The subject reports never having any seizures in two separate sections of the questionnaire, and there is no evidence of seizures in the medical record. On the basis of these facts, we suggest that the subject likely was told of the risk of seizure following the head trauma and therefore interpreted the term seizure disorder in the questionnaire as applicable. The subject continues to be followed for chronic headaches, which are likely linked in the subject's mind to the underlying \"seizure disorder \"resulting from the head trauma and, therefore, may explain the af rmative answer to current use of medication for a seizure disorder. 3.2. Medication use and seizure occurrence The prevalence of current medication use among those who self-reported having epilepsy was similar by self-report and chart review (78.3% vs 81.8%) ( Table 5 ). Sensitivity was 90% and speci city 74%. As expected given the high prevalence, the PPV (93.9%) was higher than the negative predictive value (62.1%). The sensitivity Table 4 Validation measures for active epilepsy by demographic and health-related characteristics.

However, there was a substantial difference in seizure prevalence between self-report and chart review (35.1% vs 19.3%). The PPV was 49.5%. When seizure occurrence in the past 12 months was substituted for the 3-month recall period, the prevalence of both self-reported and chart-veri ed seizure increased substantially to 51.9 and 39.2%, respectively, although there was little change in the extent of the difference between the two measures (15.8% at 3 months and 12.7% at 12 months). Other measures of validity were also similar with the exception of the PPV, which increased from 49.5% for 3-month to 69.4% for 12-month recall. It is possible that the low PPV and substantial disparity between self-reported and chart-based prevalence of seizure were due not to a problem with the question or subjects 'memory, but rather to the fact that we only had access to BMC medical records. If an individual had a seizure that was not treated or was treated elsewhere and not documented in the BMC medical record, the response would have been classi ed as a false positive. Subjects who were classi ed as making true-positive responses were more likely than those classi ed as making false-positive responses to report having come to BMC for treatment of their last seizure (66% vs 35%). To better understand the possible impact of treatment location, we reanalyzed the data for3-month recall based on the assumption that the ratio of true to false positives among those who did not go to BMC for care of their last seizure would have been the same as for those who did get care at BMC. The difference between self-reported and chart-based preva- lence decreased from 15.8 to 10.4%, whereas sensitivity increased by 2.9%, speci city by 8.7%, and the PPV by 17.4%. Among the 50 subjects who were interviewed a second time to assess test -retest reliability, values were 0.64 for lifetime epilepsy, 0.88 for medication use, and 0.65 for seizure occurrence. 4. Discussion Well-validated epilepsy screening assessments are important for purposes of monitoring both the burden of epilepsy and the needs of people with epilepsy at a community level. Tools for surveillance systems are important for planning health care delivery systems, designing appropriate clinical care services, and designing and imple- menting preventive services for policy makers interested in future resource allocations. The results of this study indicate that the ques- tions developed by the CDC Epilepsy Group are valid for the identi - cation of epilepsy. Sensitivity and speci city exceeded 80 and 99%, respectively, for both lifetime and active epilepsy. In addition, preva- lence as measured by self-report was within 0.4% of the estimate based on chart review prevalence for lifetime and active epilepsy. The absolute estimates of self-report prevalence, speci city, and PPV were higher in the strati ed results than in the overall analysis,which was due to the exclusion of the single false-positive putative noncase who had a highly disproportionate effect on the estimates. However, the focus in the strati ed analysis should be on the relative variation in estimates between strata rather than the absolute level. Few meaningful differences were seen for any measure by stratum of demographic, clinical, or medical care utilization characteristics. However, being male, having more physical or mental comorbidities,and not having visited BMC for 6 months were associated with inaccurate responses. The study used a strati ed sampling design which greatly over- represented people with epilepsy. Had we used a simple random sample, it would have been necessary to interview more than 10,000 subjects to identify the same number of people who reported having epilepsy. We weighted our data to re flect the prevalence of putative epilepsy among primary care patients as a proxy for a community-based sample. It was important to weight the sample in this manner because the PPV of self-reported epilepsy is affected by the prevalence in the population in addition to the accuracy of the test. Had the data not been weighted, the estimate of the PPV would have been arti cially high. Even so, probably because the sample was drawn from a medical setting, the prevalence of epilepsy \u2014both self-report and chart-based \u2014was somewhat higher in our study than in community-based estimates, particularly for active epilepsy. In our study, we asked all the screening questions of each subject regardless of how they responded to the rst question concerning whether they had ever been told they had epilepsy or a seizure disor- der. In a typical setting, however, only persons responding af rma- tively to this question would proceed to the subsequent questions. The PPV provides information regarding the universe of people being asked the remaining questions and the proportion who actually have epilepsy. Both lifetime and active epilepsy had a PPV of 74%, although the estimate was somewhat imprecise (as re flected by the wide con dence intervals) owing to the in fluence of the false- positive putative noncase. Based on this estimate, it appears that approximately one of four people answering the remaining questions does not actually have epilepsy. The levels of sensitivity and speci city in this study are similar or higher than have been reported in studies that assessed the validity of self-report compared with medical records for other chronic condi- tions. For example, a study of 599 HMO subscribers in Colorado com-pared telephone self-report for diabetes with medical records and found 73% sensitivity and 99.3% speci city [24]. A similar study among 45-year-old residents of Olmsted County, MN, USA, that used self-administered questionnaires showed 66% sensitivity and 99.7% speci city for diabetes [25]. A study that compared telephone self-report of arthritis with rheumatologist examination found a sen- sitivity of 70.8% and speci city of 70.3% [26]. Diabetes and arthritis exhibit similarities to epilepsy in that all three conditions are long- lasting and share similar impacts on quality of life including physical, psychological, and social functioning. There are also some limitations to this study. Despite multiple efforts to contact and enroll subjects, the response and cooperation rates were low, as might be expected among a disproportionately low-income and transient population. Despite the fact that we did not mention that the study concerned epilepsy, the rates were higher for persons with putative diagnoses of epilepsy. To the extent that subjects in the study differed in the accuracy of their responses compared with those who did not participate, our results could have been affected. However, as previously noted the results of this study are comparable to those reported in other studies assessing the validity of self-report compared with medical records. The biggest differences between responders and nonresponders was that those who responded were more likely to have more contact, and more recent contact, with BMC and were also more likely to have more physical and mental comorbidities. More recent contact was also associated with greater accuracy, which would suggest that theTable 5 Validation measures for current medication use and time since last seizure (3 monthsand 12 months) among persons reporting lifetime Epilepsy a.

Brooks et al. / Epilepsy & Behavior 23 (2012) 57 -63observed measures of sensitivity and speci city may be somewhat overstated. However, this effect appears to be modest because only 13% of subjects had not had recent contact. There are also limitations to using chart review as the validation standard. For patients whose main source of epilepsy care is elsewhere, there may not be suf cient documentation in the BMC record to validate the screening questions and the occurrence ofseizures, as suggested by the the fact that subjects categorized as false positive were more likely to have reported receiving care for the most recent seizure elsewhere or not at all. Additionally, the inde- pendence of charts from patient self-report may be overestimated. The source of documentation of a seizure occurrence in a chart may be the patient's self-report to the physician, which can make seizures particularly problematic to validate using medical records, unlike other conditions such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia that can be measured using objective tests in a clinical setting. Even the presence of lifetime epilepsy in the medical record may rely on the patient's self-report, particularly if he or she is an inactive case with no current seizures or medication use. Finally, our sampling frame in general may not be generalizable to a community sample or sample with different sociodemographic characteristics. We worked with a population receiving care in an urban tertiary care setting and, in particular, one of the only safety-net hospitals in the area that provides free care. Therefore, subjects included in this study are likely sicker and more disabled, as well as poorer and less likely to have health insurance, than a general community-based sample. Thus, it would be useful to replicate this study in other popula- tions to assess the generalizability of these ndings. In summary, for population surveillance of epilepsy prevalence, as well as medication use and seizure occurrence, future population-based assessments using these items can provide important information regard- ing the prevalence and characteristics of epilepsy in the US population.

For every 10 year increase in age, there was a 1% absolute increase in post-discharge adherence (95% CI 0.4% 2.0%). Compared to patients with private insurance, patients with Medicaid were 4.5% less adherent (95% CI 7.6% to 1.4%). For every 1-point increase in baseline medication adherence score, as measured by the 4-item Morisky score, there was a 1.6% absolute increase in post-discharge medication adherence (95% CI 0.8% to 2.4%).

Published in final edited form as: J Hosp Med . 2012 ; NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptConclusions\u2014 In patients hospitalized for cardiovascular disease, predictors of lower medication adherence post-discharge included younger age, Medicaid insurance, and baseline non-adherence. These factors can help predict patients who may benefit from further interventions. Background In the outpatient setting, medication adherence (defined as percentage of prescribed medication doses taken by a patient during a specific time period) ranges between 40 and 80 percent for chronic conditions. 1 During acute care hospitalization, changes are often made to patients' medication regimens, which can be confusing and contribute to non-adherence, medication errors, and harmful adverse events. 2 Indeed it is estimated that almost half of patients encounter a medication error after discharge, and approximately 12-17% experience an adverse drug event after returning home. 3-6 It is likely that some of these adverse events may be the result of medication non-adherence. 7 Improved patient-provider communication, systems to reconcile pre- and post-hospitalization medications, as well as development of mechanisms to enhance adherence may prevent many of these errors and have become new targets for quality improvement. 4, 8 Although post-discharge medication adherence is a crucial target for avoiding adverse events and re-hospitalization, few studies have focused on understanding its incidence and predictors, in particular patient demographic factors such as age and insurance status. 9-11 In addition, few studies have looked at general and post-hospital adherence in a population where health literacy is measured, an important area because medication changes during hospitalization may be particularly confusing for patients with low health literacy. 11, 12 Health literacy is defined as \"the degree to which an individual has the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.\"13 Prior outpatient research shows that low health literacy is associated with poor patient understanding of the medication regimen and instructions for medication use, which may contribute to post-discharge medication non-adherence.14, 15 Understanding the factors associated with post-discharge medication adherence could help refine interventions that are oriented toward improving transitions in care, patient safety, and reducing unnecessary re-hospitalization. We report here on factors associated with post-discharge medication adherence using data from the Pharmacist Intervention for Low Literacy in Cardiovascular Disease (PILL-CVD) study. 16 Methods Study and Participants PILL-CVD was a federally-funded, two-site randomized controlled trial using pharmacist- assisted medication reconciliation, inpatient pharmacist counseling, low-literacy adherence aids, and telephone follow-up that aimed to decrease rates of serious medication errors after hospital discharge. 16 The study targeted patients with cardiovascular disease (hospitalized on cardiology or general medical or geriatric services for acute coronary syndromes [ACS] or acute decompensated heart failure [ADHF]) at two large academic hospitals, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Vanderbilt University Hospital (VUH). Subjects were eligible for enrollment if they met criteria for ACS or ADHF, were likely to be discharged to home as determined by the primary medical team at the time of study enrollment, and took primary responsibility for administering their medications prior to admission (caregivers could be involved in medication management after discharge).Cohen et al. Page 2 J Hosp Med . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 July 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptExclusion criteria included severe visual or hearing impairment, inability to communicate in English or Spanish, active psychiatric illness, dementia, delirium, illness too severe to participate, lack of a home phone number, being in police custody, or participation in another intensive medication adherence program (e.g., due to renal transplant). Out of 6416 patients originally screened for possible enrollment, 862 were randomly assigned to receive usual care or usual care plus the intervention, and 851 remained in the study.16 Both the main study and this secondary data analysis were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of each site. Baseline measures Following informed consent and study enrollment, a variety of baseline data were collected on study participants from medical records and patient interview, including primary language, demographic information (age, race, insurance status, income, and education level), cognition (through administration of the 0-5 point MiniCog scale) 17 and level of health literacy (through use of the 0-36 point short form of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults, s-TOFHLA scale). 18 Baseline information was also collected on medication use, including number of preadmission medications, measurement of self- reported adherence prior to admission (using the Morisky scale, a validated 0-4 point questionnaire shown to correlate with disease control and indicative of general patterns of adherence), 19 and a medication understanding score, adapted from other instruments, which quantifies understanding of the indication, dose, and frequency of up to 5 randomly selected preadmission medications on a 0-3 point scale. 16,20, 21 Outcome measures Outcomes were collected 30 days post-discharge through a structured questionnaire, administered by telephone. Only patients who completed this call are included in the present analysis. Post-discharge medication adherence was assessed by asking patients to report the number of days out of the previous week they had taken each medication from their post- discharge regimen exactly as prescribed.22 A score was calculated for each medication as the proportion of adherent days (e.g., if a patient reported missing 2 days of a medication in the previous week, then adherence would be 5/7 or 71%). A global post-discharge adherence score was then derived for each patient by averaging the adherence score for all regularly- scheduled medications. This quantitative measure focused on adherence to medications patients knew they should be taking and did not measure medication discrepancies (sometimes termed \"unintentional non-adherence\"). Analysis Patient characteristics were summarized and reported using simple descriptive statistics. Candidate predictors of post-discharge medication adherence were chosen a priori from patient characteristics assessed during hospital admission. These included patient age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, insurance, years of education, presence of PCP, study site, number of preadmission medications, medication understanding, baseline adherence, cognition, and health literacy. Unadjusted results were calculated using univariable linear regression with each patient's adherence score as the dependent variable and each predictor as the independent variable. Adjusted results were then derived using multivariable linear regression with all the candidate predictors in the model. Lastly, because of missing data for some predictors, in particular baseline adherence and medication understanding, multiple imputation techniques were used to impute missing data and increase statistical power. 23 We used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for multiple imputation, which generally assumes that the data came from a normalCohen et al. Page 3 J Hosp Med . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 July 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptdistribution and that the missing data are missing at random. Because of the essentially normal distribution of the data, and because the amount of missing data was so small (<1% for almost all variables, 5% for baseline adherence, and 8% for medication understanding), we expected little bias and present the complete case analysis, which maximized statistical power. Two-sided p values < 0.05 were considered significant, and SAS version 9.2 (Cary, NC) was used for all analyses. Results Table 1 shows descriptive baseline patient characteristics of study sample (responders) as well as non-responders at 30 days. For the responders, the mean age of the 646 patients was 61.2 years, 94.7% were insured, and 19.3% had inadequate or marginal health literacy. Patients were prescribed an average of 8 preadmission medications. Most patients (92.3%) had a regular primary care physician prior to admission. Non-responders had non-significant trends towards having lower health literacy, medication understanding, and baseline medication adherence. The average post-discharge adherence score was 95% (SD = 10.2%), and less than 10% of patients had an adherence score of less than 85%; overall the distribution was left-skewed. Table 2 illustrates crude and adjusted parameter estimates for variables in the model. Table 3 shows significant findings in the fully adjusted model, which used multiple imputation techniques to account for missing data. Intervention arm was of borderline statistical significance in predicting post-discharge adherence (p=0.052), and so was removed from the final model. Study site, age, insurance, and baseline adherence were the only significant independent predictors of post-discharge adherence in the fully adjusted model (Table 3). For example, for every 10 year increase in age, patients had, on average, an adjusted 1% absolute increase in their adherence score (95% CI 0.4% to 2.0%). For every 1-point increase in baseline medication adherence (based on the Morisky scale), there was a 1.6% absolute increase in medication adherence (95% CI 0.8% to 2.4%). In unadjusted analyses, patients with Medicaid were less adherent with medications after discharge than were patients with private insurance. This difference became non-significant in adjusted analyses, but when analyses were repeated using multiple imputation techniques, the results again became statistically significant - Medicaid insurance was associated with a 4.5% absolute decrease in post-discharge adherence compared with private insurance (95% CI 7.6% to 1.4%). Study site (specifically, Brigham and Women's Hospital) was also a significant predictor of greater post-discharge medication adherence. Years of education was a significant predictor of adherence in unadjusted analyses but was not an independent predictor when adjusted for other factors. When baseline adherence was removed from the multiple imputation model, there were no changes in which factors were significant predictors of adherence. Discussion In this study, we found that low baseline adherence, younger age, Medicaid insurance, and study site were significant predictors of lower 30-day medication adherence. Of particular interest is our finding regarding baseline adherence, a simple measure to obtain on hospitalized patients. It is notable that in our study, education was not an independent significant predictor of post-discharge adherence, even when baseline adherence was removed from the model. The same is true for medication understanding, cognitive function, and health literacy.Cohen et al. Page 4 J Hosp Med . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 July 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptOlder patients appeared more adherent with medications in the month after hospital discharge, perhaps reflecting increased interaction with the healthcare system (appointments, number of physician interactions), a greater belief in the importance of chronic medication management, or a higher level of experience with managing medications. A similar relationship between age and adherence has been shown in outpatient studies of patients with hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. 24-27 Medicaid patients may be less likely to remain adherent because of the plan's limited coverage of medications relative to patients' ability to pay. For example, Medicaid in Tennessee covers the first 5 generic medications at no cost to the patient but has copayments for additional medications and for brand name drugs. Medicaid in Massachusetts has copayments of $1 to $3 for each medication. Alternatively, Medicaid insurance may be a marker for other patient characteristics associated with low adherence for which we were not fully able to adjust. Site differences were also notable in this study; these differences could have been due to differences in insurance coverage in Tennessee vs. Massachusetts (which has near-universal coverage), differences in types of insurance (e.g., fewer patients at Brigham and Women's Hospital had Medicaid than at Vanderbilt), cultural and geographic differences between the two locations, or other differences in transitional care between the two sites. This study corroborates previous literature on medication adherence (specifically unintentional non-adherence) in the outpatient setting, 4, 8-11 for example on the association of younger age with low adherence in certain populations. On the other hand, it may contrast with previous literature which has sometimes shown a relationship between patient education or health literacy and medication adherence. 14, 15, 28-35 However, previous studies have not focused on the transition from inpatient to outpatient settings. Perhaps intensive medication education in the hospital, even under usual care, mitigates the effects of these factors on post-discharge adherence. Finally, baseline adherence seems to correlate with post-discharge adherence, a finding which makes intuitive sense and has been previously reported for specific medications.36 There are several limitations to this study. Although large, the study was performed at only two clinical sites where most patients were white and fairly well-educated, perhaps because patients admitted to a tertiary care center with ACS or ADHF are more affluent than general medical inpatients as a whole; this may limit generalizability. Post-discharge medication adherence might have been higher than in other patient populations given the nature of the population, possible loss-to-follow-up bias, and the fact that half of the subjects received an intervention designed to improve medication management after discharge; such low rates of non-adherence in our study may have reduced our ability to detect important predictors in our models. In addition, the period of follow-up was 30 days, thus limiting our findings to short-term post-discharge medication adherence. Post-discharge medication adherence was based on patient self-report, which not only assumed that the patient was still managing his/ her own medications after discharge, but may also be susceptible to both recall and social acceptability bias, which might overestimate our adherence scores, again limiting our ability to detect important predictors of non-adherence. However, other studies have shown a good correlation between self-reported medication adherence and other more objective measures 37, 38 and recall was only for 7 days, a measure used previously in the literature39, 40 and one designed to reduce recall bias. Systematic under-reporting in certain patient populations is less likely but possible. In the future, research should focus on targeting patients who have low baseline adherence to evaluate the effects of various interventions on post-discharge medication outcomes.Cohen et al. Page 5 J Hosp Med . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 July 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptRepeating the study in a population with a high prevalence of low health literacy might be illuminating given that previous studies have shown that patients with low health literacy have less ability to identify their medications and have less refill adherence. 29, 30 In conclusion, in patients hospitalized with cardiovascular disease, predictors of lower post- discharge adherence include younger age, Medicaid insurance, and low baseline adherence. It may be prudent to assess baseline adherence and insurance type in hospitalized patients in order to identify those who may benefit from additional assistance to improve medication adherence and medication safety during transitions in care.

I met my patient\u2014whomI will call Rashid\u2014at the hotel in less than an hour of myarrival. He was apprehensive. We spent the evening in arelaxed, informal atmosphere with a group of attorneys.Despite the fact that I was a white, non-Muslim, Americanwoman, we were able to make a connection. Rashid tookus to a beautiful beach, peppered with traditional woodenshing boats, and he gave local children a few coins topick some baobab fruit for us to sample from a veryunusual looking tree. The attorneys, Rashid, and I lis-tened to his music and teased him about his taste inWestern hip-hop. As a physician evaluator for Physicians for Human Rights, I had been asked to interview Rashid. There was noclinical space in which to perform this evaluation, so weused my hotel room. I quickly learned the extent ofRashid's profound suffering. He described himself as aghost wandering around the town in isolation, unable toeat or sleep. He repeatedly asked me if he was \"crazy,\"because that is how he perceived himself. He detailed thehorrors of his arrest, during which he was beaten so badlythat he was admitted to a hospital with multiple fracturesand internal injuries. He described how he was kidnappedfrom his hospital bed and survived a 5-year ordeal in U.S.custody in multiple detention sites, including Afghanistan.In the stifling, humid hotel room, he detailed the methodsof his torture: severe beatings, prolonged painful stress po-sitions, prolonged solitary connement, forced nakednessand humiliation, sleep deprivation, withholding of food,sexual assault (anal rape and sodomy), forced intravenousmedication during interrogations that he thought might bea \"truth serum,\" and painful shackling. At times, he wasdenied medical and psychiatric care. As the hours wore on, Rashid's story became almost unbearable. There were times when we both broke downin tears. Rashid described being forced to lie on a wet mat,naked and handcuffed, having cold water poured on himwhile being kicked and beaten, and then rolled up in thewet mat \"like a corpse\"\u2014cold, wet, and shivering. In the \"water room,\" men attempted to insert the spout of a waterjug into his anus. He reported that his arms were chainedto an overhead pipe while he was in a standing position forwhat he estimates was 4 days. His heels could not touchthe floor and he developed severe back and shoulder pain.He was not allowed to use the toilet, and loud music blaredthe entire time. (\"It is just death.\") He went on to describebeing locked naked in a \"cofn\"; he could not move and itwas difcult to breathe. At one point during his detention,his flesh started rotting under a cast that was left unat-tended for too long. His request for medical care was ig-nored until he protested by going on a hunger strike for 6 days. Rashid's prominent symptoms included extreme sleep disturbance, sadness, loss of appetite with substantialweight loss, and difculty interacting with other people,(including family and friends), resulting in profound isola-tion. He has not been able to work as a result of his debil-itating psychological symptoms and has no means to sup-port himself. The lack of self-sufciency has caused furtherdepression, feelings of inadequacy, and shame and humil-iation when he has to rely on his family for basic needs.Rashid told me he wakes up at 2 a.m. and takes walks.(\"My head feels empty, like an empty box.\") His life hasunraveled since his return from U.S. custody, and he isunable to return to his former level of functioning andreintegrate back into his family and community. He meetsdiagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder and ma-jor depression, but those Western-based diagnoses do notadequately characterize his palpable suffering. In the evening, Rashid borrowed a car and we decom- pressed on a drive to the beautiful bush and beaches. I hadto abandon the Western doctor-patient boundaries. Ilearned about local life and customs and tasted the localfood. I photographed the old colonial buildings and mon-keys and camels. I then met his mother and sister, at hisrequest. We sat on the floor of a simple but welcomingcement structure, were served sweets and coffee, and weretreated as warmly as if we were family or close friends. Iexplained to Rashid's family that he wasn't \"crazy\" andthat there was hope for recovery. Neither Rashid nor hisfamily knew of posttraumatic stress disorder, or under-stood the link between the torture and his symptoms.Their gratitude for my simple explanation was humbling.We conducted our nal interviews on the beach at Rashid'srequest. After his 5 years in connement, this vast expanseof beauty was a place of solace and comfort for him. Hewould stop every so often and illustrate a point by drawingin the sand, such as when he drew a rough reproduction ofa cage in which he had been conned. It was difcult toleave Rashid after having uncovered such desperate needand having no available resources to alleviate his suffering.My fears were intensied by the fact that Rashid's sufferingwas not the aftermath of a natural disaster, but one delib-erately inflicted by other humans. After departure, I re-ceived a text message from Rashid. \"Thank u my Dr. U help me very much and my brain it gonna be OK.\" This unique and complicated situation demanded cre- ative and unorthodox measures. The combined collabora-tion of Physicians for Human Rights and a local organiza-tion made initial treatment for this man a reality. After Ileft, the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims ofTorture agreed to fund treatment and rehabilitation ser-vices, and a psychologist traveled from a neighboring coun- Annals of Internal Medicine On Being a Doctor \u00a9 2012 American College of Physicians 471try to provide mental health treatment. An antidepressant was sent by post, and I initially gave instructions and mon-itored Rashid's progress by cell phone. I continue to haveregular phone contact with him to provide support and tomonitor symptoms while trying to organize more regulartreatment. I have seen improvement in his self-esteem becausehe is better able to understand the root cause of his symptoms.I have detected something new in our communication\u2014hope. Rashid is now hopeful about his recovery and future. And I am hopeful that it is possible to repair the woundsmy country has inflicted. Rashid was given a document upon his release that con- rmed his connement as well as his innocence. On the basisof my evaluation, I have a high degree of medical certaintythat he was tortured while in U.S. custody. Nonetheless, nei-ther he nor I know the identity of the perpetrators. Sondra S.

Daley, MPH, Mandy A. Stahre, MPH, Frank J. Chaloupka, PhD, Timothy S. Naimi, MD, MPH Background: Excessive alcohol consumption causes 79,000 deaths annually in the U.S., shortening the lives of those who die from it by approximately 30 years. Although alcohol taxation is an effective measure to reduce excessive consumption and related harm, some argue that increasing alcohol taxesplaces an unfair economic burden on \"responsible\" drinkers and socially disadvantaged people. Purpose: To examine the impact of a hypothetic tax increase based on alcohol consumption and sociodemographic characteristics of current drinkers, individually and in aggregate. Methods: Data from the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey were analyzed from 2010 to 2011 to determine the net fnancial impact of a hypothetic 25-cent-per-drink taxincrease on current drinkers in the U.S. Higher-risk drinkers were defned as those whose past-30-day consumption included binge drinking, heavy drinking, drinking in excess of the U.S. DietaryGuidelines, and alcohol-impaired driving. Results: Of U.S. adults who consumed alcohol in the past 30 days, 50.4% (or approximately 25% of the total U.S. population) were classifed as higher-risk drinkers. The tax increase would result in a9.2% reduction in alcohol consumption, including an 11.4% reduction in heavy drinking. Comparedwith lower-risk drinkers, higher-risk drinkers would pay 4.7 times more in net increased annual percapita taxes, and 82.7% of the net increased annual aggregate taxes. Lower-risk drinkers would payless than $30 in net increased taxes annually. In aggregate, groups who paid the most in net taxincreases included those who were white, male, aged 21-50 years, earning /H11350$50,000 per year, employed, and had a college degree. Conclusions: A 25-cent-per-drink alcohol tax increase would reduce excessive drinking, and higher-risk drinkers would pay the substantial majority of the net tax increase. (Am J Prev Med 2012;42(4):382-389) \u00a9 2012 American Journal of Preventive Medicine Background Excessive alcohol consumption is a leading cause of preventable death1attributed to approximately 79,000 deaths annually in the U.S., shortening the lives of those who die of it by an average of 30 years.2 Drinking is also a major risk factor for a variety of adverse health outcomes, such as unintentional injuries, violence,unintended pregnancy, and cardiovascular disease. 3-7 Alcohol is also a major cause of social problems (e.g.,child neglect, divorce); legal and criminal justice prob- lems; and economic costs.4 Increasing the price of alcohol through alcohol excise taxes is an effective means of reducing excessive drinking,and it is considered the most important public healthintervention to reduce alcohol-related harm. 8-10A meta- analysis of 50 publications found that doubling the alcohol excise tax would reduce alcohol-related mortality by an av- erage of 35%, traffc crash deaths by 11%, sexually transmit-ted disease by 6%, violence by 2%, and crime by 1.4%. 10 Further, a comprehensive review found an inverse relation-ship between alcohol price and consumption, and deter-mined that a 10% increase in alcohol prices would result in a3%-10% decrease in overall consumption. 9 Despite strong evidence of public health beneft, there have been few recent alcohol tax increases, and manyinitiatives to raise them have been defeated on the basis ofarguments about the economic fairness of alcohol taxes.One argument against raising alcohol taxes is that suchFrom the Boston University School of Medicine (Daley); Section of General Internal Medicine (Naimi), Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts;Alcohol Epidemiology Program (Stahre), University of Minnesota Schoolof Public Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Health Policy Center (Cha-loupka), University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois Address correspondence to: Timothy S.

Also, there isconcern about how much those with lower socioeco-nomic status (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, those withlower incomes, less education) would have to pay com-pared with other groups. To explore these issues further,data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System(BRFSS) survey were analyzed to examine the effect of ahypothetic 25-cent-per-drink tax increase on U.S. adultswho drink alcohol. The purpose of the present study wasto assess the net fnancial impact, both individually and inaggregate, of a hypothetic tax increase on the basis ofalcohol consumption characteristics and socioeconomicfactors among current drinkers in the U.S. Methods Survey Data for the current study came from the 2008 BRFSS. A detailed overview of the BRFSS including survey methods and informationon data weighting is available at www.cdc.gov/brfss/ andwww.cdc. gov/brfss/technical_infodata/quality.htm . In brief, the BRFSS is a state-based random-digit-dial telephone survey of people aged/H1135018 years that is overseen by the CDC and conducted monthly inall states, the District of Columbia, and some territories. Analysiswas limited to the 50 U.S. states. The 2008 BRFSS had a responserate of 53.3%. A total of 411,736 respondents, including 200,587reporting alcohol consumption in the previous 30 days, constitutedthe study population. BRFSS data were weighted on the basis of age,gender, and race/ethnicity to be representative of the U.S. popula-tion aged /H1135018 years. Measures The BRFSS \"core\" (i.e., questions asked of all drinkers in allstates) alcohol questions were used to assess drinking frequencyand the average number of drinks consumed during drinkingdays during the past 30 days among current drinking U.S. adultsaged/H1135018 years. The core BRFSS also collects information on the frequency of binge drinking (i.e., consuming fve or more drinksfor men or four or more drinks for women per occasion in thepast 30 days), 11the greatest number of drinks consumed in the past 30 days, and alcohol-impaired driving (i.e., the number oftimes a person drove after having \"perhaps too much to drink\"). To determine average daily alcohol consumption by an individ- ual, a participant's frequency of drinking days in the past 30 dayswas multiplied by their usual number of drinks consumed perdrinking day and divided by 30. For binge drinkers, their average daily alcohol consumption was adjusted to account for self-reported estimates of binge drinking, using the indexing method originally described by Armor and Polich 12and applied to the BRFSS data.13For the current study, men reporting a maximum drink value of fve or more and women reporting a maximum drinkvalue of four or more were classifed as binge drinkers. 11Heavy drinking was defned as an average daily consumption of morethan two drinks for men or an average daily consumption of morethan one drink for women. 2 \"Higher-risk\" drinkers were defned as those with any of the following: drinking above U.S. Dietary Guidelines (defned as con-sumption during drinking days of three or more drinks for men or two or more drinks for women)14; binge drinking; alcohol- impaired driving; or heavy drinking. \"Lower-risk\" drinkers weredefned as those not meeting any of the four higher-risk criteriadefned above. Increasing the price of alcohol through a tax would decrease its consumption based on the price elasticity of demand for alcohol.The price elasticity of demand (/H110020.51) was obtained from a recentmeta-analysis. 15To determine the average price of a standard drink in the U.S., a weighted average of on- and off-premises prices forbeer, wine, and spirits was calculated 16based on beverage-specifc per capita consumption in the U.S. in 2007 (the most recent year forwhich data were available: 52.1% beer, 31.5% liquor, 16.4% wine 17) and assuming that 75% of alcohol is purchased from off-premisesestablishments. 18,19Assuming a 100% pass-through of the tax to the price paid by consumers, 25 cents constituted 18.1% of theaverage weighted price per drink ($1.38), yielding a 9.2% reductionin consumption. After factoring in the impact of the price increaseon average daily consumption, annual alcohol consumption wascalculated on a per capita and aggregate basis by multiplying theaverage number of drinks per day by 365. The net tax increase was calculated by frst determining the current amount of annual federal alcohol taxes already being paid by drinkers (10 cents per drink 7,20). Total annual taxes paid after a hypothetic 25-cent-per-drink increase were then calculated bymultiplying an individual's price elasticity-adjusted annual con-sumption by 35 cents per drink (10 cents per drink in current taxesplus a hypothetic 25-cent-per-drink increase). The net increase inexpenditures was then calculated by subtracting current annual taxexpenditures from the total annual tax expenditures after the taxincrease (i.e., after adjusting consumption to account for the im-pact of the higher price). Per capita and aggregate net tax increase-associated revenues were then assessed among a variety of sub-groups based on their alcohol consumption characteristics andsociodemographic factors such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, edu-cation, income, and employment status. Analyses were performedfrom May 2010 through August 2011, using SAS, version 9.2. Results After weighting, 50.5% of U.S. adults who reported current drinking in the past 30 days constituted the study population(Appendix A, available online at www.ajpmonline.org ). Among current drinkers, 50.4% were classifed as higher- risk drinkers, and 49.6% were classifed as lower-riskdrinkers. Among higher-risk drinkers, 58.8% usuallyconsumed three or more drinks per drinking day; 63.0% reported binge drinking, including 25.3% with three or more binge episodes; and 7.5% reported alcohol-impaired driving. A majority (75.2%) of lower-risk drinkers reported usu- ally consuming one drink per drinking day and 80.2% oflower-risk drinkers reported between 1 and 10 drinkingdays in the past 30 days. Men drank more than women forall consumption measures. Among male higher-riskdrinkers, 78.3% usually consumed three or more drinksper drinking day, 20.2% drank a maximum of ten or moredrinks on one occasion in the previous 30 days, 77.5%Daley et al / Am J Prev Med 2012;42(4):382-389 383 April 2012reported binge drinking, and 10.4% reported impaired driving. Higher-risk drinkers were further characterized on the basis of the risk criteria that were used to defne them assuch (Appendix B, available online at www.ajpmonline. org). The most common risk factor reported was exceed-ing the U.S. Dietary Guidelines (82.9%), followed bybinge drinking (63.0%); heavy drinking (26.4%); and im-paired driving (7.5%). Overall, higher-risk drinkers re-ported a mean of 1.8 of the four risk criteria. The meannumber of fulflled risk criteria based on strata of socio-economic factors including race/ethnicity, education, in-come, and employment status was similar overall, rang-ing from 1.7 to 1.9. As a result of the tax increase, current drinkers would reduce their annual consumption from 319.1 to 289.7drinks per year (absolute reduction 29.4 drinks annually,relative reduction 9.2%, data not shown). Compared withlower-risk drinkers, higher-risk drinkers would havelarger absolute reductions in the number of drinks con-sumed (48.4 fewer drinks vs 10.2 fewer drinks). Amongheavy drinkers (the subset of higher-risk drinkers defnedon the basis of average consumption), the tax increasewould reduce annual consumption by 58.6 drinks annu-ally, and result in an 11.4% relative reduction in heavydrinking (from 14.0% to 12.4%, or 1.8 million people). Table 1 provides per capita data regarding total drink consumption and the net additional cost of a hypotheticalcohol tax increase of 25 cents per drink, analyzed byvarious socioeconomic characteristics. On a per capita basis, higher-risk drinkers would pay 4.7 times as muchin net additional taxes compared with lower-risk drink-ers. Those exceeding four risk criteria would pay approx-imately 10 times more than those exceeding only one riskcriteria, and approximately 16 times more than thoseexceeding none (i.e., lower-risk drinkers). Among vari-ous strata of lower-risk drinkers, none would pay morethan $35.04 per year in net increased taxes. Higher-riskdrinkers who would pay the most in additional taxesinclude men, those with less education, those of lowerincome, and retired people. Lower-risk drinkers whowould pay the most in additional taxes include men,those of white race, college graduates, and those withincomes exceeding $50,000. Table 2 presents similar data but on an aggregate, rather than per capita, basis. Additional net tax revenue was approximately $7.9 billion annually, and 82.7% ($6.5billion) of this was to be paid by higher-risk drinkers.Among all drinkers and among higher-risk drinkers,those aged 21-50 years, men, those of white race, collegegraduates, those earning $50,000 or more per year, andemployed people paid the most in terms of aggregate taxincreases. Those exceeding three alcohol-related risk cri-teria (11.5% of all drinkers) paid approximately 48% of tax revenues. Discussion Raising the price of alcohol through taxation is a highlyeffective strategy by which to reduce excessive drinkingand related harm. A 25-cent-per-drink tax increasewould result in more than a 10% reduction in heavydrinking, which would yield a substantial public healthbeneft for a behavior that currently leads to approxi-mately 79,000 deaths annually in the U.S. 2However, it is likely that the morbidity and mortality benefts would exceed those suggested by the change in consumption,because absolute consumption would decrease mostamong those who drink the most and who incur mostalcohol-attributable consequences. 10,21 In addition, because the risk of alcohol-attributable harm increases exponentially with increasing levels ofconsumption, 22even moderate reductions in consump - tion among those drinking the most leads to relativelylarge reductions in alcohol-attributable harm. Finally,youth drinkers may experience greater-than-average re-ductions in alcohol consumption from a tax increasebecause they tend to be high-risk drinkers and becausetheir price elasticity of demand is typically high. Thiseffect was not modeled, because of a lack of an availablemeta-analysis of the price elasticity of demand for thisgroup. 10,21 Higher-risk drinkers (including those who reported binge drinking, consumption during drinking days thatexceeded U.S. Dietary Guidelines limits, heavy drinking,or alcohol-impaired driving) would pay approximatelyfve times as much individually and in aggregate compared with lower-risk drinkers, whereas the typical lower-risk drinker would pay less than $30 in net additionaltaxes annually. This result demonstrates that even thoughalcohol taxes are applied to all drinks (i.e., alcohol taxescannot selectively be applied based on who is purchasingthe alcohol), they cost higher-risk drinkers considerablymore than lower-risk drinkers because of how skewedalcohol consumption is in the U.S.: A relatively smallpercentage of drinkers consume most of the alcohol, andmost lower-risk drinkers do not drink regularly or con-sume much alcohol. Having higher-risk drinkers pay farmore than lower-risk drinkers not only is desirable froma fairness perspective but results in larger absolute reduc-tions in consumption among higher-risk drinkers, whichis desirable from a public health perspective. There is also interest about who pays the most in alco- hol taxes based on socioeconomic factors, particularlyamong lower-risk drinkers who are unlikely to be detri-mental to public health and safety.

Therefore, assuming that alcohol tax revenueswere used for offsets across the board to other tax obliga-tions, lower-risk drinkers from relatively disadvantagedsocioeconomic groups would realize a net economic gainfrom an alcohol tax increase. Among higher-risk drinkers, however, those who were relatively poor, less educated, and not employed paidmore in per capita tax increases than other groups. Also,it should be noted that any tax increase on those with lessincome will take a larger proportion of their income thanwould the same tax on someone earning more, and couldthus be potentially regressive in nature. In this case, how-ever, that larger fnancial impact might lead to greaterreductions in drinking and a larger public health beneftfor those same individuals. It is important to acknowledge that the distribution of taxes paid by higher-risk and lower-risk drinkers is de-pendent on the classifcation criteria for the two groups.Of the 57.4 million higher-risk drinkers, 17.8 millionwere considered higher risk solely because their con-sumption exceeded the U.S. Dietary Guidelines but ex-ceeded no other risk thresholds. This subset of higher-risk drinkers consumed less alcohol overall (and hencepaid less in taxes) than other higher-risk drinkers. Their net per capita taxes paid would increase by $31.30 annually, and in aggregate they would pay anadditional $556 million, or 8.5% of the amount thatwould be paid by the higher-risk group (data not shown).Had they been classifed as lower-risk drinkers instead,the remaining higher-risk drinkers would have paid 6.1times more than lower-risk drinkers in per capita taxes,and accounted for 75% of total tax paid (compared withpaying 4.7 times more than lower-risk drinkers and 83%of all additional taxes paid when only those drinkingabove U.S. Dietary Guidelines are included in the higher-risk group). Imposing alternative assumptions would have changed the current fndings. Had a different tax increase been used, consumption and revenue increases would have changedaccordingly (e.g., higher taxes would cause larger de-creases in consumption but higher revenue). The overallprice elasticity of demand for the current study was basedon a recent meta-analysis 15; however, had meta-analyses of price elasticities for subgroups (e.g., based on income,age, drinking quantity) been available, the observed dis-tribution of tax revenues would have been somewhatdifferent. For example, assuming a larger price elasticity of de- mand for those of younger ages or lower income would have resulted in relatively larger reductions in theirdrinking and a reduced tax burden for them. Although afull pass-through of the tax was modeled (i.e., assumingthat 100% of the tax was passed on as a price increase), modeling either a smaller or larger relative pass-through would have resulted in a smaller or larger change in price,which would have affected consumption and tax impactsaccordingly. Characteristics of surveys generally, including BRFSS, also make it likely that the fnancial impact of the taxincrease would differ from our estimates. 23Specifcally, BRFSS estimates of consumption account for less thanone third of consumption based on sales tax data, 24,25 suggesting that actual additional revenue from a 25-cent-Table 1.

In addition, survey respondents are less likely to includethose who consume high amounts of alcohol comparedwith those who consume lower amounts. 26-29This im - plies that in the current study, the proportion of alcoholconsumption and tax expenditures accounted for byhigher-risk drinkers are underestimates relative to con-sumption and expenditures by lower-risk drinkers. Despite the lack of any randomized study of low-dose alcohol and any morbidity or mortality outcome, anddespite the fact that observational studies of establishedmoderate drinkers are limited by confounding and selec-tion bias, much attention has been paid to possible healthbenefts of low-level (sometimes termed \"moderate\") al-cohol consumption. 30-33However, to the extent that there are health benefts associated with moderate drink-ing, reducing higher-risk alcohol consumption to moremoderate levels by means of a tax increase would have thesalutary side effect of increasing the number of people towhom such beneft might accrue. Moreover, the reduc-tions in higher-risk drinking following a tax increasewould lead to sharp reductions in overall alcohol-relatedmortality. A strong theoretic justifcation for taxes generally, and for alcohol excise taxes in particular, is to recoup thesocial and economic costs incurred from the sale of alco-hol that are not borne by its producers, sellers, or con-sumers (i.e., the \"external\" costs of alcohol consump-tion). 22These external costs are considerable, and include health-related effects; social problems (e.g., child abuseand neglect, marital problems, alcohol-related crimes);and economic costs (e.g., healthcare costs, legal and crim-inal justice system costs, lost economic productivity, andhigher car insurance premiums). 2,34-37Currently, the net external costs (external costs minus tax revenues) for alcohol in the U.S. are approximately $1 per drink; rem-edying this disparity would require raising alcohol taxesby an order of magnitude from present levels. 38-40 The gap between the societal costs of alcohol sales and its corresponding excise tax rates continues to widen.41 This is because most alcohol excise taxes at the federaland state levels are based on volume and have not beenincreased regularly or in large enough increments overtime, 42resulting in an erosion of the value of these taxes in inflation-adjusted terms.42,43For example, the federal beer tax has remained unchanged since it was last raisedin 1991, and its inflation-adjusted value has eroded byapproximately 40% in the interim. 43,44 Raising alcohol taxes provides multiple benefts in terms of public health and economic fairness.44It would reduce harm from the third-leading preventable cause ofdeath in the U.S., 1reduce costs to responsible drinkers by lowering tax obligations in other areas, begin to recoupalcohol-related costs to society associated with alcoholsales by moving taxes more closely in line with historicalstandards, and provide badly needed revenue to cash-strapped state and federal governments at a time whenthere is extreme reluctance to increase income or prop-erty taxes.

The objective of this study was to assess disparities in safe sexcounseling and resultant behavior among a patient population at risk of negative sexual health outcomes. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis among a sample of substance dependent men and women in a metropolitan area in the United States. Multiple logistic regression models were used to explore the relationship between race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic black; Hispanic; non-Hispanic white) and three indicators of mental illness (moderately severe to severe depression; any manic episodes; 3 psychotic symptoms) with two self-reported outcomes: receipt of safe sex counseling from a primary care physician and having practiced safer sex because of counseling. Results: Among 275 substance-dependent adults, approximately 71% (195/275) reported ever being counseled by their regular doctor about safe sex. Among these 195 subjects, 76% (149/195) reported practicing safer sex because of this advice. Blacks (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.71; 95% confidence interval (CI): (AOR: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.26,4.60) had higher odds of safe sex counseling. Neither race/ethnicity nor anyindicator of mental illness was significantly associated with practicing safer sex because of counseling. Conclusions: Those with past manic episodes reported more safe sex counseling, which is appropriate given that hypersexuality is a known symptom of mania. Black patients reported more safe sex counseling than white patients,despite controlling for sexual risk. One potential explanation is that counseling was conducted based on assumptions about sexual risk behaviors and patient race. There were no significant disparities in self-reported safer sex practices because of counseling, suggesting that increased counseling did not differentially affect safe sexbehavior for black patients and those with manic episodes. Exploring the basis of how patient characteristics can influence counseling and resultant behavior merits further exploration to help reduce disparities in safe sex counseling and outcomes.

Reproductive Health 2012, 9:35 http://www.reproductive-health-journal.com/content/9/1/35Background Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy are prevalent among racial/ethnic minoritiesand individuals with mental illness, and associated with a host of negative health outcomes and costs [1-7]. Unin- tended pregnancy is costly on many levels, including directmedical costs of births, abortions and fetal losses, indirect costs of wages lost from not working and psychological costs associated with the challenges posed by unintendedpregnancy [8-10]. Unintended pregnancies were recently estimated to cost taxpayers $11 billion each year [11,12]. Unintended pregnancies affect the parents (who may en-dure financial hardship and limitations to their educa- tional attainment) [9,10] and children, in terms of birth outcomes and worse cognitive, emotional and behavioraldevelopment [9,10,13-15]. Sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, human papiloma virus (HPV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), arehighly prevalent, preventable infections that can lead to serious health consequences including chronic pain, infer- tility and mortality [1]. The costs associated with the treat-ment of STIs are substantial, with an estimated $6.5 billion expended in 2000, for 15-24 year olds alone [16]. In 2001, the rate of unintended pregnancy was highest for black and Hispanic women (98 and 78 per 1,000, re- spectively), compared with that for whites (35 per 1,000) [3]. More recent data from 2006-2010 report the follo-wing percentages of unintended pregnancies resulting in births: 20% non-Hispanic white, 35% Hispanic and 45% black women [17]. Disparities also exist in rates of STIs.For example, black men and women are most affected by chlamydia and gonorrhea, having 9-19 times higher rates than whites [1]. Patients with mental illness haveworse health outcomes and a higher medical burden com- pared to the general population [18-20], including high rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion [5,21,22].Individuals with mental illness are at higher risk for ac- quiring STIs and having unintended pregnancies due to increased rates of unprotected intercourse as a result ofhaving less knowledge about contraception, lower capacity to plan ahead, inability to navigate contraceptive resources and being at higher risk for sexual coercion [4-6,23-32]. Substance use, the consumption of alcohol and/or use of illicit drugs, is also associated with sexual risk beha-viors [7,33]. The precise link between substance use and engagement in sexual risk behaviors has not been fully established in the literature, but studies suggest that thisrelationship is primarily a function of less consistent con- dom use and having multiple sex partners [7,34,35]. Thus, individuals with substance dependence are another vul-nerable population at increased risk for unprotected sex, unintended pregnancy and STIs [2]. Identifying barriers to contraceptive usage and safe sexual behaviors is vital in order to prevent STIs andunintended pregnancy. Clinicians can play a pivotal role in educating patients about safe sex and helping to in- crease their knowledge and use of contraception [36-39].Although many factors outside of the medical encounter can influence patient sexual behavior and contraception use, clinicians have an opportunity to counsel popula-tions at risk of negative sexual health outcomes, with the potential of affecting patient behavior. This counseling has the potential to reduce risky sexual behaviors andrelated negative health outcomes [36-41]. Contraceptive counseling in primary care, where there is a preventive focus and a longitudinal relationship with patients, canimpact patient contraceptive use and method choice [42]. Despite a higher prevalence of sexual risk behaviors among people with substance dependence than in thegeneral population [7], little is known about disparities in sexual health care among these individuals. Commu- nication problems in the patient-clinician exchange mayoccur differentially across race/ethnicities and among patients with mental illness, thereby contributing to the disparities in contraceptive use and, subsequently, STIsand unintended pregnancy [37,43]. Primary care clini- cians in particular may feel discomfort in discussing these issues because of their sensitive nature and lack oftraining [44-46]. Despite the vast literature about racial disparities in medical care, little is known about dispar- ities specific to sexual health care [47]. One recent studyof low income women found that blacks were more likely to report being pressured by their clinician to use contraceptives, compared to whites [47]. A series of stu-dies found that many African Americans who received family planning care felt discriminated against and held conspiracy beliefs about birth control (such as \"birth control is a form of Black genocide \") [48]. There is also a dearth of literature assessing disparities in clinician safe sex counseling for people with mentalillness [49]. Clinicians may unknowingly make assump- tions about the sexual risks of patients with mental illness or their ability to comply with birth control regimens,which may affect clinicians 'decisions to provide appro- priate counseling and discuss contraceptive options. Sexual health counseling for patients with mental illness is complex and challenging. Clinicians have the chal- lenge of assessing the patient 's autonomy in decision- making and risk of unintended pregnancy and STIs. They also need to use judgment to consider how capable the patient is of using contraceptives consist-ently and effectively [29]. They need to ensure patients fully understand contracepti ve options, risks, and bene- fits [29]. Guidelines to help clinicians assess patientautonomy may be subverted by subconscious bias in decision-making. The role clinicians can play in addres- sing the sexual health needs of individuals with mentalillness warrants further study [50].D'Amore et al. Reproductive Health 2012, 9:35 Page 2 of 10 http://www.reproductive-health-journal.com/content/9/1/35Further investigation into the role of clinicians is essen- tial to improving disparities in patients 'safe sex behaviors, including the usage of and adherence to contraception.The objectives of this study are therefore to examine whether race/ethnicity and indicators of mental illness are associated with two separate outcomes: patient report ofprimary clinician 's safe sex counseling and practicing safe sex due to counseling among individuals with substance dependence. We hypothesized that minority patients andthose with serious mental illness symptoms may receive less safe sex counseling, but anticipate that these dispar- ities will be attenuated after controlling for other patientsociodemographic characteristics, sexual risk behavior and the quality of clinician-patient relationship. Methods This was a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data col- lected for a randomized controlled trial (Addiction HealthEvaluation and Disease management (AHEAD) Study) con- ducted in Boston, Massachusetts from September 2006 to September 2008. This study was approved by the BostonUniversity Medical Campus Institutional Review Board (H-23464). All subjects provided informed consent, and procedures were followed in accordance with the HelsinkiDeclaration of 1975. A certificate of confidentiality was obtained from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism to further protect participants' privacy. TheAHEAD study is a randomized clinical trial evaluating chronic disease management for substance dependence in primary care. All subjects had current alcohol and/or drugdependence, by DSM IV criteria [51] (assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form) [52], were willing to establish or continue primary care atthe study location and had engaged in recent heavy drink- ing or recent drug use. If they had primary care elsewhere but wanted to change to Boston Medical Center (BMC),they were considered eligible. If they had no primary care clinician, they had to be willing to be referred to one at BMC. These subjects were primarily recruited from a resi-dential detoxification unit, but also from a large urban safety-net primary care clinic and through recruitment advertisements on public transportation. Subjects were atleast 18 years of age, spoke English or Spanish, and were without indication of cognitive impairment at screening (assessed by a Mini Mental State Examination score greaterthan 20) [53]. Half of the enrolled subjects were rando- mized to the AHEAD clinic intervention, which included a team comprised of a nurse care manager, social worker,psychiatrist and internist. All study subjects were reim- bursed $35 for completing all baseline visit procedures and $50 at the three month follow-up visit. The inclusion criteria for our analysis included: com- pleting the 3-month follow-up visit, reported having one particular doctor that they considered to be their regularprimary care doctor and being self-reported non-His- panic black, non-Hispanic white or Hispanic. The ques- tion about having a regular doctor asked: \"Is there one particular doctor (or primary care provider, e.g. Nurse Practitioner or Physician 's Assistant) that you consider to be your regular personal primary care doctor? \"Be- cause this survey then continued to use the term \"doctor \" to encompass all of the primary care clinicians listed above, we continue to use the term \"doctor \"in reporting the results. Independent variables The key independent variables in this study are race/ethnicity and three indicators of serious mental illness.Race/ethnicity was self-reported and categorized as: non- Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic at the initial study visit. The number of subjects in other racialcategories was small (n=20) and therefore were excluded from analyses. The three mental illness variables in this analysis include: moderately severe to severe depression;any past manic episodes; and 3 psychotic symptoms, all assessed at the three month study visit. (Mental illness was captured at baseline, but because most participantswere starting a detoxification program the 3 month visit provided more accurate data.) Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire short form(PHQ-9) which is comprised of nine items about respondents feelings in the last two weeks, such as \"feeling down, depressed or hopeless \", with responses ranging on a four point scale from \"n o ta ta l l \"to \"nearly every day \" (scores 0-3 points) [54]. We considered someone to be depressed if s/he had a PHQ-9 score of 15 or more, indi-cating moderately severe to severe depression [54,55]. Past manic or hypomanic episodes were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [56].Symptoms of mania include hypersexuality and impulsivity, and thus create the potential for increased sexual risk behavior [57]. This measure used a series of items to assesshypo/mania, asking about the frequency, duration and characteristics of manic episodes, with dichotomous responses of \"Yes \"or \"No \". The MINI has been validated as a diagnostic tool in accordance with criteria from to the DSM-IV [56]. Psychotic symptoms were measured using four items from the Behavior and Symptom Identifica-tion Scale (BASIS) [58]. These items included: thinking you had special powers, hearing voices or seeing things, thinking people were watching you and thinking peoplewere against you. Subjects were asked about their experience of these symptoms during the past week and asked to rate the frequency of these experiences on ascale ranging from \"never \"to \"always \".W ec o n s i d e r e d an individual to have substantial current psychotic symptoms if s/he responded \"sometimes \",\"often \",o rD'Amore et al.

The complete BASIS measure is comprised of 24 items and using three out of four items not considere d diagnostic, but an indica- tion of psychosis. Dependent variables The key dependent variables were two items about safe sex counseling and self-attributed resultant patient safe sex behavior, assessed during the three month study interview.The first item, having ever talked about safe sex with your regular doctor, was taken from the Primary Care Assessment Survey (PCAS) [59,60]. The PCAS is apatient reported instrument created to assess several domains that constitute quality primary care [59]. The spe- cific question asked was \"Which of the following has your r e g u l a rd o c t o re v e rt a l k e dt oy o ua b o u t : ....safe sex? \" (response: yes/no). The second dependent variable, having ever practiced safer sex because of your doctor 's advice, was taken from a survey used to examine the relationship between patient income and physician counseling about health risk behaviors [61]. Th es p e c i f i cq u e s t i o na s k e dw a s \"Which of the following have you ever done because of your doctor 's advice? ...Practiced safer sex \"(response: yes/ no). We included all patients who responded to these ques-tions in our analysis. For the second dependent variable, having practiced safer sex because of a doctor 's advice, the sample was restricted to only those who had reported everreceiving safe sex counseling. Covariates The covariates included in the analyses were self-reported age, gender, education (less th an high school; high school; more than high school) and which randomized group thesubject was assigned to, taken from the initial study visit. We also included whether the subject had multiple ( i.e., >1) male and/or female sex partners in the last threemonths, as an indication of sex ual risk behavior. These data were taken from the audio computer assisted self- interviewing (ACASI) portion of the three month follow-upinterview. We included these covariates given their poten- tial effect on receipt of safe sex counseling and behavior [62-64]. We also included quality of the patient-doctor rela-tionship, specifically assessing trust and communication from the PCAS, to evaluate if these variables attenuated any observed relationships between race/ethnicity, mentalillness, and the outcomes of interest. The PCAS trust scale was scored based on a series of eight items and the com- munication scale was based on seven items [59]. Thesescales were scored as continuous variables and transformed to a scale of 0-100 for multivariable analyses [59]. Statistical analysis First, descriptive statistics were obtained for all variables stratified by each dependent variable (ever received safe sexcounseling and ever practiced safer sex because of this advice). Bivariable tests were also performed for descriptive purposes. Next, we performed a series of multiple logisticregression models to test associations between indicators of mental illness and race/ethnicity with each outcome. For the outcome, having practiced safer sex because of adoctor 's advice, the analysis was restricted to the subset who reported ever receiving safe sex counseling. Spearman correlations were used to evaluate potential collinearitybetween independent variables and covariates. No pair of variables included in the same regression model was highly correlated (r>0.40). The following four models were fit foreach of the two dependent variables. Model 1 was a preliminary, minimally adjusted model that included the main independent variables race/ethnicity and indicatorsof mental illness (depression, having had any manic episodes and psychotic symptoms), and two potential confounders: randomization group and multiple sexpartners in the last three months. Model 2 additionally controlled for key sociodemographic characteristics: age, education, and gender. Model 3 added the trust scale fromthe PCAS as a continuous variable. Model 4, the final model representing the primary analyses, included the communication scale from PCAS as a continuous variable,and removed the trust scale. We did not include trust and communication scores in the same model due to their high correlation (r=0.67). The findings reported in the Resultss e c t i o na r et a k e nf r o mt h e final model (Model 4) with communication score, unless oth erwise specified. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) arereported. All analyses were conducted using two-sided tests and a significance level of 0.05. Due to the exploratory nature of the analyses, adjustments were not made formultiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed by the Boston University School of Public Health 'sD a t a Coordinating Center using SAS software (version 9.1; SASInstitute, Cary, NC). Results Of the 563 individuals enrolled in the AHEAD study, 500 were followed up at 3 months. Of those, 299 reported that they had a regular doctor and 295 of those answered thetwo questions about safe sex counseling and behavior. After excluding the 20 subjects who were not black, white or His- panic, our final sample for the analysis of ever received safesex counseling included 275 individuals. The study sample was comprised of 44% white, 45% black and 11% Hispanic w o m e na n dm e n( T a b l e1 ) ,w i t ham e a na g eo f4 0( r a n g e18-61) and median age of 42 (not shown). Moderately severe to severe depression was common, reported among 58% of subjects. Forty percent reported a previous manicepisode and 16% had at least th ree psychotic symptoms. Approximately 71% (195/275) of the sample reported having a doctor ever talk to them about safe sex. These 195D'Amore et al.

In the adjusted models, higher trust (AOR=1.03, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04; Model 3) and better communication (AOR=1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.04) were associated with higher odds of receipt of safe sex counseling (per 1 point increase on a scale of 0-100; Table 2). Having multiple sex partners in the lastthree months (AOR=0.44, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.94) was asso- ciated with lower odds of practicing safer sex because of this advice, compared to those with 0-1 sex partners(Table 3). Results by race/ethnicity In bivariable analyses, whites had the lowest observed proportion of their doctor ever talking to them about safe sex (p=0.007; Table 1), compared to blacks orHispanics. There were no significant findings by race/ ethnicity for practicing safer sex because of a doctor 's advice.

In fully adjusted models, having a manic episode remained significantly associated with higher odds of a doctor hav-ing ever talked to them about safe sex (AOR=2.41, 95% CI: 1.26, 4.60; Table 2). The association was statistically significant across all adjusted models. None of the mental health variables were significantly associated with practicing safer sex because of their doctor 'sa d v i c ei n adjusted models (Table 3). Discussion The majority of adults with s ubstance dependence in our sample reported being counseled about safe sex from their primary care doctor. Of those who were counseled, about three quarters reported that they practiced safer sexbecause of this advice. Our results suggest that improve- ments in safe sex counseling are needed for all individuals with substance dependence, pa rticularly whites. This isconsistent with prio r literature that suggests general defi- ciencies in safe sex counseling and the need to integrate this into regular health care visits [41,61,65]. Lack of counseling may be a result of primary care clinicians feeling it is nottheir responsibility to counsel patients in sexual health behaviors [44]. Clinicians may also be uncomfortable in sexual health counseling and need more training related to sexual health [46]. Time constraints and lack of support staff have been cited as potential reasons for lack of sexualhealth counseling [44,45,66]. The expanded role of nurses o rc a s em a n a g e r sm a yb eap o t e n t i a ls o l u t i o ni ni m p r o v i n g quality sexual health care [45]. Of note, patient trust andcommunication with their doctor were the only covariates associated with receipt of safe sex counseling. This suggests that improving patient-doctor trust and communicationmay increase safe sex counseling for patients with sub- stance dependence. Our findings suggest that safe sex counseling can have a positive impact on patient behaviors.

Reproductive Health 2012, 9:35 Page 7 of 10 http://www.reproductive-health-journal.com/content/9/1/35the discourse between patients and clinicians and effec- tive methods for delivering contraceptive information is critical in developing practice guidelines and guidancefor clinicians [67]. Future research should focus on under- standing how clinicians can affect patient behavior, in an effort to reduce disparities in sexual health and outcomes. Blacks and those with manic episodes reported being counseled by their doctors significantly more about safe sex. Although most who received counseling reportedpracticing safe sex because of their doctor 's advice, this was not more likely to translate into safer sex practices for one racial/ethnic group or individuals with indicatorsof mental illness. Interestingly, the covariates included in both sets of analyses largely did not affect the significant associations between race/ethnicity or mental illness withour outcomes. Although the findings that blacks are coun- seled more about safe sex are in contrast to our hypoth- eses, there is literature to support the finding of increasedcounseling for minorities [62]. Previous disparities re- search suggests that clinician behavior may be influenced by population based studies that affect their decision mak-ing in counseling patients [68,69]. Thus, if clinicians know from the literature that racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to have negative sexual health outcomes, they maycounsel these patients more about safe sex practices. Clin- icians may also have implicit, sub-conscious biases related to race that are not fully apparent but could affect pa-tient counseling [70,71]. Counseling based on assumptions about sexual risk behaviors because of patient race can be considered stereotyping, that leads to disparities in coun-seling black patients more about safe sex. Instead, patient- centered counseling, based on individual risk factors, tailored to that individual 's needs, is ideal. Patients with manic episodes may have been counseled more, given that hypersexuality is associated with these episodes [57]. It is difficult to disentangle the meaning ofthis finding, given that the subject was asked about current psychotic symptoms and depression, but any prior history of manic episodes. It is not clear if themanifestation of symptoms or diagnosis of mental illness came before or after safe sex counseling and thus we cannot determine if increased counseling among this group is in fact related to their mental illness. We also cannot verify that the clinician knew of the patient 'sm e n - tal illness. Although many interventions for increasing safe sex practices can be found in the literature [72], particularlyfor young and poor, minority women, there is not a ma- jor focus on individuals with substance dependence. Most of the interventions targeting substance users focus solelyon reducing HIV infection [62,73], instead of prevention of general STIs and unintended pregnancy. Interventions should focus on the interaction of factors, such as sub-stance use, race/ethnicity and mental illness, that may leadto disparities in sexual health outcomes [63]. Ultimately, reducing negative sexual health outcomes will require a multipronged intervention targeted at the patient, clinicianand system level to help influence patient behavior and enhance the patient-clinician interaction [37]. Our findings should be interpreted within the limita- tions of our study. Although our analysis examined three racial/ethnic groups, we did not test for within group dif- ferences ( i.e., by type of Hispanic origin) or interactionsby gender, because of potential sample size issues [74]. The findings that black patients and those with manic episodes had significantly higher odds of reporting beingcounseled could also be due to differential response bias or incomplete statistical adjustment (i.e., history of sexu- ally transmitted infections). This study is based entirely onpatient self-report, which may be subject to recall or social desirability bias. However, understanding if safe sex coun- seling occurred and how it affected behavior from patient 's perspective is ideal because they can most accurately re- port if/how counseling influenced their practices. Our sample was enrolled within one metropolitan area and themajority of subjects was of low socioeconomic status and thus may not be generalizable to all other substance de- pendent populations. We were unable to determine if pa-tients received safe sex counseling from another type of clinician (other than their primary care doctor) or prac- ticed safer sex because of advice from another clinician.There may also be temporal issues, in asking about life- time safe sex counseling versus symptoms of mental illnes- ses, which may have manifested after counseling occurred(as described above). We did not have data to account for the U.S. Preven- tive Services Task Force recommendations of counselingif patients had an STI within the last year, which may have affected safe sex counseling. Instead, we used num- ber of sex partners in the last three months as an indi-cator of sexual risk behavior. We also used only partial diagnostic instruments as indicators of mental illness, particularly for psychotic sy mptoms. Despite these limita- tions, this study is among the first to examine racial/ethnic and mental health disparities in safe sex counseling and practices among individuals with substance dependence. This paper is one of many that will answer the call for stu- dies to test hypotheses about how clinician behaviors affectdisparities in health care [68]. Beyond merely documenting that counseling occurred, research needs to focus on enhancing our understandin g of how counseling can have an impact on patient risk behavior. Conclusions Black patients and those with a history of manic episodeswere found to be counseled more about safe sex than white patients and those without manic episodes, respectively, despite controlling for sexual risk.

Litwin, MD, Bryce D. Smith, PhD, Elisa A. Koppelman, MSW, M. Diane McKee, MD, Cindy L. Christiansen, PhD, Allen L. Gifford, MD, Cindy M. Weinbaum, MD, and William N. Southern, MD Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a signi cant public health problem. With 3.2 million Americans chronically infected,1HCV is the leading cause of liver-related deaths,2accounting for 15 000 deaths in 2007.3Although earlier treatments were moderately effective in reducing theHCV disease burden, 4new treatments with greater promise have become available.5 Because treatment cannot be offered without diagnosis and 45% to 85% of patients with HCV are unaware of their infection,6,7inter- ventions designed to increase the number ofHCV cases diagnosed are urgently needed. Guidelines for HCV screening vary. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) recommends that patients who haveinjected drugs, who have long-term hemodial- ysis histories or persistently abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, who had bloodtransfusions or organ transplants before July1992 (when HCV was eradicated from thenation 's blood supply), who have been ex- posed to HCV (e.g., their mothers were HCVpositive or they have been exposed at theirworkplace), or who are HIV positive 8be assessed for HCV risk. Other authorities have expanded recommendations to include cur-rent sexual partners of individuals withHCV, 9,10people who have had multiple sex partners, intranasal cocaine users, people withtattoos or repeated body piercings, peoplewith high levels of daily alcohol use over time,Vietnam-era veterans, 11and immigrants from countries with high HCV prevalence rates.12 In addition, with respect to research on HCV risk, various studies have shown that home-lessness, incarceration, 13tattoos,14barbershop shaving,15body piercing,16ear piercing among men,17use of intranasal drugs and crack co- caine,18and mental illness19are associated with higher risk. Although not explicitly recom- mending testing, this literature suggests that these are potential HCV risk factors for whichscreening may be appropriate.Multiple approaches can be used in HCV testing programs. Universal screening of peoplewith identi ed risks appears to best meet CDC 's recommendations and to be the most efcient strategy, given that individuals with identi ed risk factors have been shown to have a much higher prevalence of HCV than thegeneral population. 1As the front-line health care providers for most Americans, primarycare settings offer an important opportunityto incorporate HCV risk assessments, althoughexamination of this model has been limited. In 2 studies conducted in primary care settings, patient self-administered question- naires have been used to assess HCV riskscreening. In one of these studies, set in anurban clinic, patients completed a 27-item riskassessment 20; the other study, set in a Veterans Health Administration facility, involved a ret-rospective analysis of HCV testing amongveterans who had reported HCV risk factors on a self-administered questionnaire. 21To date, no HCV screening tools have been validated,and no studies comparing different types of interventions have been conducted, includingcomparisons of patient-completed screeninginstruments and screeners implemented byprimary care providers (PCPs). We implemented a PCP-based risk screening intervention that successfully increased rates ofHCV testing among patients at risk. 22Because existing guidelines do not concur on what factorsshould trigger HCV testing, we included a mod-erately large number of risk factors (12) inassessing the intervention. However, it was un-known which factors of the screening interven- tion were responsible for the screener 'ss u c c e s s and whether an abbreviated set of risk factorswould be equally successful. To inform both thedevelopment of a parsimonious screening in-tervention and the revision of risk-based HCVtesting guidelines, we examined which factorswere the strongest independent predictors oftesting and diagnosis of HCV. The Hepatitis C Assessment and Testing project (HepCAT), a prospective cross-sectionalObjectives. We evaluated an intervention designed to identify patients at risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) through a risk screener used by primary careproviders. Methods. A clinical reminder sticker prompted physicians at 3 urban clinics to screen patients for 12 risk factors and order HCV testing if any risks were present.Risk factor data were collected from the sticker; demographic and testing datawere extracted from electronic medical records. We used the ttest, v 2test, and rank-sum test to compare patients who had and had not been screened and developed an analytic model to identify the incremental value of each element ofthe screener. Results. Among screened patients, 27.8% (n = 902) were identied as having at least 1 risk factor. Of screened patients with risk factors, 55.4% (n = 500) weretested for HCV. Our analysis showed that 7 elements (injection drug use, intranasal drug use, elevated alanine aminotransferase, transfusions before 1992, 20 lifetime sex partners, maternal HCV, existing liver disease) accounted for all HCV infections identied. Conclusions. A brief risk screener with a paper-based clinical reminder was effective in increasing HCV testing in a primary care setting. ( Am J Public Health. 2012;102:e115-e121. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2012.300659)RESEARCH AND PRACTICE November 2012, Vol 102, No. 11 |American Journal of Public Health Drainoni et al. |Peer Reviewed |Research and Practice |e115evaluation conducted in 3 urban primary care clinics, was designed to inform CDC 's revision of its HCV testing recommendations. HepCAT 's major goal was to evaluate an interventiondesigned to identify patients at risk for HCVwith a PCP-implemented risk screener and testthose identi ed as at risk. Another objective was to parse out a limited number of factors toinclude in a simple and effective screener. We hypothesized that using the risk screener would increase testing rates and that a briefscreener incorporating fewer risk factors wouldperform as well as the full screener. Weexamined the performance of the screeneroverall as well as the extent to which eachspeci c risk factor predicted HCV. METHODS The HepCAT project was funded by the CDC through the Agency for Healthcare Re-search and Quality 's Accelerating Change and Transformation in Organizations and Networks(ACTION) program. ACTION promotes \"eld- based research designed to promote innova- tion in health care delivery by accelerating the diffusion of research into practice \" 23rather than funding only traditional research studiesinvolving comparison and control groups. The ACTION network includes 15 partner- ships, each with a lead organization that servesas the prime contractor for projects. BostonUniversity is the prime contractor for one partnership that includes the Monte ore Med- ical Center in the Bronx, New York, andHepCAT, a collaborative effort between these2 organizations, was conducted in 3 clinicsafliated with the center. The 3 clinics provide approximately 150 000 primary care visitsannually to more than 54 000 adults; theclinics are located in economically depressed areas of the Bronx and serve patients with high rates of poverty, substance use, and sexuallytransmitted diseases. The estimated prevalenceof HCV infection in the adult population seenin the 3 clinics is 7.7%. 24 Intervention The risk-based screening intervention in- volved prompting physicians with a clinical reminder sticker to ask whether a patient hadany of 12 speci c HCV-related risks and to order HCV tests according to the presence ofthose risks. The sticker (Figure 1) incorporated a double-layer \"carbon copy \"design; once completed, the top copy of the sticker could beremoved and placed in a secured box in theexamination room for research purposes whilethe other copy remained af xed to the medical chart. In addition to the sticker, intervention training included the following: on-site educa- tional sessions including a standardized pre- sentation for all PCPs and clinic staff deliveredprior to and once during the interventionperiod, regular communication between theresearch team and clinical leadership, elec-tronic provision of a weekly scienti c article on HCV to all PCPs, and environmental reminders(HepCAT buttons, pocket cards, and posters). Also, project staff visited each clinic twice per week to place stickers on all progress notes,encourage adherence to screening protocols,and elicit feedback from PCPs and other clinicstaff. Furthermore, each clinic had a \"physician champion, \"a member of the research team who regularly visited the clinic to maintainPCPs 'engagement in the intervention. All PCPs were supplied with a script (in English and Spanish) to standardize and normalize theintroduction of the screener. Each PCP was asked to complete the sticker at every visit for patients who had not beentested for HCV in the preceding 12 months andto order an HCV antibody test if any risk factorwas identi ed. The risk-based screeningintervention was conducted over a 15-week period from November 2008 to March 2009. Data Collection Given the expectation that all adults seen in the clinics would be screened, demographicand HCV testing information on each adult(18 years old or older) seen during the in-tervention period was extracted from the elec- tronic medical record. Risk factor data were collected from the risk screener sticker. Thesedata sets were merged into a single database.We compared patients who had been screenedwith those who had not been screened. Amongscreened patients, we examined risk factors,HCV testing, and HCV positivity rates. Measures The main outcomes in our analysis were HCV testing and HCV positivity. A patient wasconsidered to have been tested if an anti-HCVantibody test was performed within 90 daysof the clinic visit date. HCV antibody positivitywas de ned as a positive anti-HCV test within the same time period. To determine the effects of the screener on HCV testing and positivity, we analyzed patients who had and had notbeen screened separately. A patient was con-sidered screened if a sticker was submitted withany information about HCV risk factors re-corded. A patient was considered not screenedif no sticker was submitted or if the submittedsticker was blank. After examining the main Note .

American Journal of Public Health |November 2012, Vol 102, No. 11outcomes, we examined the incremental value of each element of the screener to assess its performance with respect to promoting HCVtesting and identifying cases of anti-HCV pos-itivity; analyses focused on proportions ofpatients tested and results for patients witheach risk factor. Data Analysis We used Stata software in conducting our analyses.25We initially conducted the ttest, thev2test, the rank sum test to compare screened and nonscreened patients with re-spect to demographic characteristics. Amongscreened patients, we examined the propor-tions with any risk identi ed (vs no risk identi ed), the proportions who had (vs had not) been tested, and rates of HCV positivity. We then investigated the rates of testing andHCV positivity associated with each risk factor. We identi ed the incremental value of each screener element through an iterative processas follows. Initially we determined which riskfactor was most strongly associated with posi-tivity and counted the number of positive cases identi ed by asking about that risk factor. Next, we removed the HCV-positive casesidenti ed by the rst risk factor and deter- mined which of the other risk factors identi ed the most remaining positive cases. Then theHCV-positive cases identi ed by the secondrisk factor were removed and a third risk factor that identi ed the most remaining cases was sought. The process was repeated until theremaining risk factors did not identify any newHCV positive cases. RESULTS Of the 13 371 patients with at least 1 primary care visit during the intervention period, 4339 had previously been tested and51 were missing critical data; as a result,8981 patients were included in our analysis.Table 1 shows comparisons of patientsscreened and not screened during the inter-vention period. The mean age of the 8981 patients was 47.8 years, and one fourth were male. More than half were Latino, about 30% were Black, andfewer than 5% were White. About half wereinsured via Medicaid, just under a quarter hadcommercial insurance, about 14% were un-insured, and 12% had Medicare. A screenerwas completed for 3250 (36.2%) of the pa-tients seen. Male and White patients were more likely to be screened, and Black patients were less likely to be screened; there wereno differences in screening rates according toage or insurance status. Table 2 presents proportions of testing and yield (rate) of anti-HCV positivity among thosescreened and not screened and among those with and without identi ed risks. During the intervention, 13.1% of all patients seen in theclinics were tested for HCV. However, this levelof testing was driven primarily by screening:25.3% of screened patients were tested, asopposed to only 6.2% of unscreened patients.The yields of anti-HCV positivity were 5.9%among those with no screening documentation and 5.0% among the screened population. Of the 3250 patients screened, 27.8% (n = 902) had at least 1 HCV risk factor. Of thesepatients, 55.4% (n = 500) were tested forHCV; 13.7% of tested patients had no identi-ed risk. The yield of anti-HCV positivity among tested patients was higher for those witha risk factor (6.8%) than for those without a risk factor (2.2%). Identication of Risk Factors Table 3 provides details on the 902 screened patients identi ed as having at least 1 HCV risk factor. The most commonly iden-tied risk factors, documented among more than 20% of screened patients, were history of multiple sex partners, intranasal drug use, elevated ALT, homelessness, and incarceration.Histories of liver disease and blood transfu-sions before 1992 were reported by 10% to15% of those screened. A smaller percentage(6.2%) of patients reported injection druguse; just over 2% reported maternal HCV.Very few patients (< 1%) reported chronic hemodialysis or organ transplants before 1992. Testing Rates for Each Risk Factor All prevalent risk factors predicted testing relatively well, at close to or above 50% ofthe time. Testing was most often conducted ( >6 0 %o ft h et i m e )a m o n gt h o s ew h or e - ported histories of multiple sex partners, transfusions, and maternal hepatitis. In addi-tion, more than half of those with historiesof incarceration, intranasal drug use, and ele-vated ALT were tested, as were almost halfof those with histories of homelessness, injec-tion drug use, and liver disease. Yield of Patients Tested Overall, the yields of HCV testing were high. Sixty-three percent of patients with a history ofinjection drug use had positive anti-HCV testTABLE 1\u2014Characteristics of Patients Seen During the Intervention Period: Bronx, NY, 2008-2009 CharacteristicTotal (n = 8981), No. (%)Screened (n = 3250), No. (%)Not Screened (n = 5731), No. (%) P Gender .002a Male 2330 (25.9) 4307 (75.2) Race/ethnicity .01a .01a 2733 (30.4) (12.0) .23 Insurance coverage .09 Medicare 1029 None 1272 (14.2) 819 (14.3) 453 (13.9) .64 aSignicant difference between groups at P< .05.RESEARCH AND PRACTICE November 2012, Vol 102, No. 11 |American Journal of Public Health Drainoni et al. |Peer Reviewed |Research and Practice |e117results.

Incremental Value of Screener Elements Table 4 illustrates the incremental predictive value of each risk factor starting with the factor with the highest yield: injection drug use.Injection drug use was the strongest predictorof anti-HCV positivity; sole inclusion of the\"ever injected drugs \"variable would have predicted 41.5% of identi ed cases. Intranasal drug use was the second strongest predictor;the incremental bene t of adding \"ever snorted drugs \"as a second factor would have led to the additional identi cation of 14.6% of cases, for a total yield from a 2-question screenerof 56.1% of the identi ed Ultimately, we determined thata 7-element screener that comprised injection drug use, intranasal drug use, elevated ALT, transfusions before 1992, maternal HCV, 20or more lifetime sex partners, and existing liverdisease would have accounted for all anti-HCVcases identi ed. DISCUSSION We found that anti-HCV testing increased in a primary care setting when a 12-item riskscreener was implemented and that 10 ele-ments identi ed patients at risk. However, 6 of the elements would have identi ed the same number of cases of anti-HCV positivity, sug-gesting that a briefer screening instrumentwould be equally effective. Ourndings demonstrate the utility of risk- based testing in identifying individuals positivefor anti-HCV, con rming the ndings of pre- vious studies. 20,21Earlier research showed that the 3 study clinics had already tested 39.7% oftheir patient populations and had estimated that 59.7% of these patients were anti-HCV positive before the risk screening interven-tion. 24Although it could be argued that the individuals identi ed before the intervention would have presented with the most obviousrisks, the risk screener still identi ed an addi- tional 13.1% for screening in the previouslyuntested group, and of these patients 62 were anti-HCV positive. This increase in testing was primarily because of the screened popu-lation; 25.3% of screened patients were sub-sequently tested for HCV, whereas the testingrate among unscreened patients was 6.2%.More than half of patients who had at least 1risk factor identi ed on the screener were tested. Thus, the intervention was effective in increasing testing rates both overall and, par- ticularly, among patients with identi ed risk factors. It is notable that the testing rate among patients identi ed as having HCV risk factors was not closer to 100%, particularly in the caseof risk factors such as injection drug use thatare widely known to be associated with HCV. There may be several reasons for this nding, including the steps required by both patientand PCP to complete the anti-HCV testingprocess. For patients, testing required goingto a separate area in the clinic and waiting tohave blood drawn; for PCPs, ordering testsrequired completing a lab slip. These may beimportant barriers to be mindful of in attempts to increase testing in primary care settings,TABLE 2\u2014Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Screening, Testing, and Yield During the Intervention Period: Bronx, NY, 2008-2009 Tested for HCV, No. (%) Yield (Anti-HCV Positivity), No. (%) Total seen (n = 8981) 1179 (13.1) 62 (5.3) Not screened (n = 5731) 357 (6.2) 21 (5.9)Screened (n = 3250) 822 (25.3) 41 (5.0) No risk (n = 2348) 322 (13.7) 7 (2.2)Any risk (n = 902) 500 (55.4) 34 (6.8) TABLE 3\u2014Risk Factor Identication, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Testing, and Yield: Bronx, NY, 2008-2009 Factor Risk Factor Identied, No. (%) Tested for HCV, No. (%) Yield (Anti-HCV Positivity), No. (%) Ever homeless 234 (25.9) 111 (47.2) 10 (9.0) Ever incarcerated 214 (23.7) 119 (55.6) 13 (10.9)Ever snorted drugs 252 (27.9) 134 (53.2) 21 (15.7)Ever injected drugs 56 (6.2) 27 (48.2) 17 (63.0)20 lifetime sex partners 270 (29.9) 167 (61.9) 14 (8.4) Liver disease (physician diagnosis) 115 (12.7) 56 (48.7) 15 (26.8)Chronic hemodialysis 9 (1.0) 2 (22.2) 0 (0.0) Transplant before 1992 5 (0.5) 2 (40.0) 0 (0.0) Transfusion before 1992 108 (12.0) 72 (66.7) 5 (6.9)Maternal hepatitis C 19 (2.1) 12 (63.2) 2 (16.7)Elevated alanine aminotransferase (documented in electronic medical record) 242 (26.8) 137 (56.6) 10 (7.3) Note .

American Journal of Public Health |November 2012, Vol 102, No. 11particularly given the myriad screening and preventive care activities that are alreadyrecommended. In addition, there was no requirement in the HepCAT protocol for patients to be tested at the visit when the sticker was placed in the chart, and the PCP may have planned to testthe patient at a later visit. Only the VeteransHealth Administration, via a federal mandateand real-time electronic clinical reminders, hasdeveloped a mechanism to fully implementrisk-based HCV screening and testing in pri-mary care settings 23; an electronic reminder to screen might be the only method to achieve full implementation. A key question in the development and im- plementation of the HepCAT intervention waswhich items to include in the screener. Althoughscreened patients reported high rates of intrana-sal and injection drug use, as well as multiplesex partners, homelessness, incarceration, liver disease, and transfusions, our analysis illustrated that a screener with fewer risk factors could be aseffective as the 12-item screener. Our resultsshowed that two thirds of patients with positiveanti-HCV test results were identi ed with a screener that included just 3 factors (injectiondrug use, intranasal drug use, elevated ALT); 4additional factors (transfusions, maternal hepati- tis C, 20 or more lifetime sex partners, liver disease) identi ed an additional 17% of cases.It appears that some factors, such as in- carceration and homelessness, may actually beproxies for the other risk factors and will notproduce additional bene ts in terms of identi- fying cases of anti-HCV positivity. However, because 17% of the patients with positive anti-HCV test results had no risk factors iden-tied on the screener, it will be important to understand the characteristics of patientswithout risk factors who were tested and thereasons they were tested, including assessinghow demographic differences may or may notrelate to other risk factor differences. For example, it is important to examine reasons why male patients were more likely to bescreened than were female patients and Whitepatients were more likely to be screened thanwere Black patients. Ourndings mirror recent work showing that a parsimonious screener can be effec-tive 1,21and practical in the context of routine care. Consistent with our results, Zuniga et al.,21 using retrospective data on veterans, found that screening only for injection drug use wouldhave identi ed 41% of cases of anti-HCV positivity in that population; in addition, theyfound that a risk screener including only 5factors (injection drug use, blood transfusionbefore 1992, service during the Vietnam era, tattoos, and history of abnormal liver function tests) and a risk screener incorporating the5 factors independently associated with anti-HCV positivity would have identi ed 97% of cases with 20% fewer individuals beingtested. Our results also are consistent with ananalysis of National Health and Nutrition Ex- amination Study data conducted by Armstrong et al., 1who found that injection drug use, elevated ALT, and transfusions before 1992identi ed 85% of cases of anti-HCV positivity. An important difference between our work and previous studies is our inclusion of in-tranasal drug use as a screening item. Wefound that although intranasal drug use was not independently associated with anti-HCV positivity (probably as a result of sample sizelimitations), it identi ed almost 15% of cases of positivity. Given our ndings and the pos- sibility that patients will be more likely toacknowledge intranasal than injection druguse owing to the stigma often associated withinjection drug use, we propose that intranasal drug use be considered for inclusion in brief screeners. Overall, it is important to note that our study, conducted in the context of routine primarycare in a high-risk population, is congruent withthe results obtained by Armstrong et al. in theirUS population-based sample, and it appearsclear that a brief screener including injection drug use, elevated ALT, and transfusions be- fore 1992 will be effective in identifying HCVTABLE 4\u2014Incremental Value of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Screening Items: NY, 2008-2009 FactorNo. of Patients With Identied HCV RiskNo. of Patients With Positive Test Results (% of Positive Cases Overall) Cumulative % Ever injected drugs 56 17 (41.5) 41.5 Ever snorted drugs 200 6 (14.6) 56.1Elevated alanine aminotransferase (documented in electronic medical record)185 4 (9.8) 65.9 Transfusion before 1992 59 3 (8.0) 73.1 20 lifetime sex partners 115 2 (4.9) 78.0 Maternal hepatitis C 10 1 (2.4) 80.5Liver disease (physician diagnosis) 23 1 (2.4) 82.9Ever homeless 66 0 (0.0) 82.9Ever incarcerated 67 0 (0.0) 82.9Chronic hemodialysis 0 0 (0.0) 82.9Transplant before 1992 0 0 (0.0) 82.9 Total 34/41 82.9 Note .

Our results also concur with research by McGinn et al.20supporting risk-based testing; however, their study involved a 27-item ques-tionnaire, whereas our focus on using a briefscreener is more practical for implementation. With the current policy focus on the medical home model and the role of PCPs in coordi-nating and taking responsibility for all aspects of a patient 's care, the expectation will remain for PCPs to do more with less time. Thus, thechallenge of integrating a new intervention toidentify HCV in primary care settings remains.To minimize the impact on already-overtaxedPCPs, it is crucial to identify those elementsmost predictive of HCV positivity. We foundthat PCPs can perform effective HCV screening with a screener that includes many fewer risk factors than previously reported in the litera-ture. Moreover, screening could be performedby ancillary providers, such as nursing staff,and this type of intervention could be easilygeneralized to other settings or other clinicalconditions given its relative simplicity and thelack of technology required for implementation. Limitations Our study involved some limitations. First, it was dif cult to sustain a high level of PCP adherence to the intervention, and PCPs wereunable to do more than check a box ona screener (e.g., identify country of birth ifoutside the United States). Thus, it is important to consider whether screening could be con- ducted by other clinical staff. Second, becausewe were unable to track unused laboratoryslips, we cannot determine whether untestedpatients with risk factors were referred forbut did not undergo testing or whether thesepatients were not referred. Third, this study was observational; without a comparison group, we cannot establish a causal link between the intervention and theincrease in testing. Finally, the small numberof cases of identi ed anti-HCV positivity lim- ited our examination of the incremental valueof each of the risk factors in creating a brieferrisk screener. Conclusions We found that a brief risk screener with a paper-based clinical reminder was effectivein increasing HCV testing in a primary caresetting. With more effective treatments now available, it is critical that the process of identi cation of HCV be improved, given that care and treatment cannot be offered withoutdiagnosis. Primary care is the front line ofhealth care for most patients and the optimallocation for simple risk screening. Given the many challenges facing PCPs and the numerous preventive care activities expected of them, future efforts should focus on testing a more parsimonious risk screenerand determining whether ancillary staff couldconduct screening activities. In addition, thereis a need for future research testing the useof HCV screening by different types of PCPs,including studies involving experimental de-signs. Studies are also needed to explore the actual utility of a brief screener, followed by validation of that screener. Finally, we recom-mend that the cost-effectiveness of our inter-vention be assessed; if it is cost-effective forHCV screening, it might serve as a model forprimary care screening of other undiagnosedclinical conditions. j About the Authors Mari-Lynn Drainoni, Elisa A.

Esser, MPH, Dafna Kanny, PhD, Robert D. Brewer, MD, MSPH, Timothy S. Naimi, MD, MPH Background: Binge drinking (/H113504 drinks for women; /H113505 drinks for men, per occasion) is respon- sible for more than half of the estimated 80,000 U.S. deaths annually and three-quarters of the $223.5 billion in costs in 2006. Binge drinking prevalence is assessed more commonly than binge drinkingintensity (i.e., number of drinks consumed per binge episode). Risk of binge drinking-related harmincreases with intensity, and thus it is important to monitor. The largest number of drinks consumedis assessed in health surveys, but its usefulness for assessing binge intensity is unknown. Purpose: To assess the agreement between two potential measures of binge drinking intensity: the largest number of drinks consumed by binge drinkers (maximum-drinks) and the total number ofdrinks consumed during their most recent binge episode (drinks-per-binge). Methods: Data were analyzed from 7909 adult binge drinkers from 14 states responding to the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) binge drinking module. Mean and mediandrinks-per-binge from that module were compared to mean and median maximum-drinks. Analyseswere conducted in 2010-2011. Results: Mean (8.2) and median (5.9) maximum-drinks were strongly correlated with mean (7.4) and median (5.4) drinks-per-binge (r/H110050.57). These measures were also strongly correlated across most sociodemographic and drinking categories overall and within states. Conclusions: The maximum-drinks consumed by binge drinkers is a practical method for assessing binge drinking intensity and thus can be used to plan and evaluate Community Guide-recommendedstrategies for preventing binge drinking (e.g., increasing the price of alcoholic beverages and regulatingalcohol outlet density). (Am J Prev Med 2012;42(6):625-629) Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine Introduction Excessive alcohol consumption is responsible for an average of 80,000 deaths in the U.S. each year1and $223.5 billion in economic costs in 2006.2More than half of these deaths and three-quarters of the eco- nomic costs are due to binge drinking1,2(/H113504 drinks for women; /H113505 drinks for men, per occasion).3,4Binge drinking also is associated with a range of health andsocial problems, such as motor vehicle crashes, interper-sonal violence, new HIV infections and sexually trans- mitted infections, liver cirrhosis, cancers, stroke, and al-cohol dependence. 5-8 The risk of binge drinking-related harm increases with the intensity of binge drinking (i.e., the number of drinksconsumed). 9Yet, adult binge drinkers often report drink- ing at levels that far exceed those used to defne thispattern of alcohol consumption. 10,11It is therefore im- portant to routinely monitor binge drinking intensity toassess the public health impact of this behavior and toplan and evaluate evidence-based strategies to prevent it.However, questions on the number of drinks consumedby binge drinkers are not asked routinely in state healthrisk behavior surveys, such as the Behavioral Risk FactorSurveillance System (BRFSS). More commonly, healthsurveys include questions on the largest number of drinksconsumed in a given time period (i.e., maximum-drinks), 12,13but it is not clear whether these questions are useful for assessing binge drinking intensity.From the Alcohol Program, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch (Esser, Kanny, Brewer), Division of Population Health, National Center forChronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC, Atlanta, Geor-gia; and the Section of General Internal Medicine (Naimi), Boston Univer-sity Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts Address correspondence to: Dafna Kanny, PhD, Alcohol Program, Na- tional Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 4770 10.1016/j.amepre.2012.03.001 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine Am J Prev Med 2012;42(6):625-629 625The purpose of the present study was to assess the agreement between the following two measures of binge drinking intensity: the mean and median maximum-drinks reported by binge drinkers on any occasion andmean and median total drinks consumed by binge drink-ers during their most recent binge episode (i.e., drinks-per-binge). If there is strong agreement between thesetwo measures, maximum-drinks may be a way to rou-tinely measure state-specifc binge drinking intensity,thus improving public health surveillance on the numberof drinks consumed by adult binge drinkers. Methods Data came from the 2008 BRFSS. Sampling design, purpose, and analysis descriptions are available at www.cdc.gov/brfss/. Binge drinkers were defned as current drinkers who reported consuming/H113504 drinks (women) or /H113505 drinks (men) on an occasion during the past 30 days in the BRFSS core survey. Maximum-drinks con-sumed was assessed in the core survey by the largest number ofdrinks consumed on any occasion during the past 30 days. In 2008,a total of 14 states administered an optional module to obtaininformation about binge drinkers' most recent binge episode, in-cluding the number of drinks consumed by beverage type. Drinks-per-binge was calculated by summing beverage-specifc consump- tion (i.e., beer, wine, liquor, and pre-mixed flavored drinks) fromthat episode. Analyses were restricted to binge drinkers from the 14 states who administered the 2008 binge drinking module. Respondents withmissing information on beverage-specifc consumption, or thosewho reported maximum-drinks or drinks-per-binge that were /H110214 for women or /H110215 for men were excluded. The fnal sample con- sisted of 7909 respondents. Data analysis was conducted in 2010-2011 using SAS-callable SUDAAN 9.2. Results were weighted by age, gender, and race/ethnicity to be representative of people residing in the states and tothe respondent's selection probability. Means and 95% CIs, medi-ans, and Pearson correlation coeffcients of the maximum-drinksand drinks-per-binge were assessed by sociodemographic charac-teristics and by state. Signifcant differences between means weredetermined by non-overlapping CIs. Results The study population of binge drinkers was predomi- nantly male (58.0%); aged 18-54 years (76.9%); non-Hispanic white (83.3%); had at least some college educa-tion (63.9%); and had household incomes of /H11350$50,000 (52.6%). There was a strong correlation and drinks-per-binge (M/H110057.4; measures were strongly correlated for binge drink-ers across most groups, except those with less than highschool education (r/H110050.29, p/H110210.001); Hispanic race/eth- nicity (r/H110050.38, p/H110210.001); and those who reported /H113505 binge drinking episodes in the past month (r/H110050.45,p/H110210.001). Mean and median maximum-drinks anddrinks-per-binge were also strongly correlated in allstates except Georgia (Table 2). Discussion Overall, binge drinkers' maximum-drinks correlatedstrongly with drinks-per-binge, an established measure ofbinge drinking intensity. 10Measures generally correlated strongly within individual states as well. Further, the meanand median drinks-per-binge were approximately 90% ofthe mean and median maximum-drinks, respectively, fur-ther supporting the level of agreement between these two measures of binge drinking intensity. To our knowledge,this is the frst study to assess the agreement between thelargest number of drinks consumed by binge drinkers (max-imum-drinks) and the number of drinks consumed duringthe most-recent binge drinking episode (drinks-per-binge)as measures of binge drinking intensity. The fndings of the current study have important impli- cations for public health surveillance on binge drinkingamong adults because, unlike the drinks-per-binge measure,the maximum-drinks measure is assessed in all states annu-ally. Therefore, it can be used routinely to assess binge inten-sity, and to plan and evaluate evidence-based binge drinkingprevention strategies in states. Although the correlation be-tween maximum-drinks and drinks-per-binge was gener-ally quite strong across sociodemographic groups andwithin states, the correlations between these measures wereweaker for respondents of Hispanic race/ethnicity and withless than high school degree, even though the mean andmedian maximum-drinks and drinks-per-binge withinthese strata were quite similar. This inconsistency may bedue to the smaller sample sizes in these strata. The greater binge drinking intensity of those reporting /H113505 binge drinking episodes/month relative to those report- ing 1-2 episodes is consistent with other studies. 10Among respondents reporting /H113505 episodes/month, the higher mean and median maximum-drinks than drinks-per-bingemay reflect greater variability in binge intensity among fre-quent binge drinkers. Frequent binge drinkers ( /H113505 epi- sodes/month) had more episodes in which the maximum-drinks could exceed the drinks-per-binge measure.Consequently, there was a greater likelihood that the mostrecent binge episode was not the most intense. However,correlations between binge intensity measures were stillstrong for those who reported /H113505 episodes/month, support- ing the use of maximum-drinks to assess binge drinkingintensity among frequent binge drinkers too. The present study has limitations. First, restricting the sample to those who reported alcohol consumption at orabove the binge drinking threshold on multiple measuresmay have reduced the generalizability of the fndings.However, the binge intensity estimates were not substan-626 Esser et al / Am J Prev Med 2012;42(6):625-629 www.ajpmonline.orgtially different from those reported in other publications and it therefore seems unlikely that the restricted studypopulation substantially changed the relationship be-tween the two evaluated binge drinking intensity mea-sures. 10,11Second, self-reported estimates of binge drink - ing intensity are likely to be underestimated because of recall bias14; social desirability response bias; nonre - of increasing number ofcell phone-only households, particularly among young adults.16,17In fact, a recent study found that BRFSS alco - hol consumption data accounted for a median of 22%- 32% of state consumption based on alcohol sales.18 Therefore, it seems unlikely that either of the measures ofbinge drinking intensity that were assessed in the currentstudy overestimated the actual number of drinks con-sumed by adult binge drinkers in the U.S.Table 1.

Initially submitted March 18, 2011; accepted for publication August 16, 2011. This study examined associations between mortality and demographic and risk characteristics among young injection drug users in San Francisco, California, and compared the mortality rate with that of the population. A total of 644 young ( <30 years) injection drug users completed a baseline interview and were enrolled in a prospective cohort study, known as the UFO (''U Find Out'') Study, from November 1997 to December 2007. Using the National Death Index, the authors identied 38 deaths over 4,167 person-years of follow-up, yielding a mortality rate of 9.1 (95% condence interval: 6.6, 12.5) per 1,000 person-years. This mortality rate was 10 times that of the general population. The leading causes of death were overdose (57.9%), self-inflicted injury (13.2%),trauma/accidents (10.5%), and injection drug user-related medical conditions (13.1%). Mortality incidence wassignicantly higher among those who reported injecting heroin most days in the past month (adjusted hazard ratio\u00bc5.8, 95% condence interval: 1.4, 24.3). The leading cause of death in this group was overdose, and primary use of heroin was the only signicant risk factor for death observed in the study. These ndings highlight the continued need for public health interventions that address the risk of overdose in this population in order to reduce premature deaths. drug users; epidemiology; hepatitis immunodeciency virus; ICD, IQR, interquartile range; IRR, incidence Index; UFO, ''U Find Out.'' Injection drug use has been associated with excess mor- bidity and mortality (1, 2). A number of studies have reported incidence that greatly exceeds that of the generalpopulation (3-5). Risk factors that have been associated with mortality among injection drug u sers (IDUs) from prior studies include infectious diseases, such as human immunodeciency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (3, 6-8). Givenimprovements in medical care for HIVand HCVas well as more widespread implementation of public health interven- tions for IDUs (needle exchange, overdose prevention, opiatesubstitution treatment, and so on), current studies are needed to assess whether the incidence and causes of mortality have shifted over time. Additionally, studies of unique subpopula-tions such as young IDUs are needed to understand the patternsand risk factors for mortality in order to inform future tailored interventions. The current study was undertaken to assess the incidence of mortality and risk factors for mortality among young in-jection drug users in San Francisco, California. Given that the UFO (''U Find Out'') Study has been collecting detailedinformation on young IDUs since the late 1990s, it providesa unique opportunity to study mortality trends and risk factors for mortality in this population. The specic aims of the study were as follows: 1) to investigate trends in mortalityincidence overall and overdose-specic mortality, 2) to calculate standardized mortality ratios, and 3) to identify risk factors for mortality in young injectors in San Franciscobetween 1997 and 2007. 302 Am J Epidemiol. 2012;175(4):302-308 at Mugar Memorial Library, Boston University on March 6, 2012 http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from MATERIALS AND METHODS Beginning in 1997, young ( <30 years) IDUs in San Francisco have been offered participation in multiple pro- spective studies under variations of the shared title known as the UFO Study and described previously (9-11). In brief, young IDUs were recruited by peer outreach workers fa-miliar with neighborhoods in San Francisco where young IDUs congregate, using study invitation cards and flyers, contacts with youth friendly neighborhood groups and com- munity providers, and word of mouth. Inclusion criteria for screening were the following: 1) less than 30 years of age; 2) self reported use of injection drugs in the past 30 days,3) ability to provide informed c onsent, 4) understanding spoken English and, after 2005, 5) self-reported HCV-negativeor unknown status. The UFO Study had 3 waves of datacollection between November 1997 and December 2007. Inthe rst wave from 1997 to 1999, subjects completed a baseline screening interview and underwent counseling and serologic testing for HIV , hepatitis B, and hepatitis C virus. Subjectswithout evidence of acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or immunization to HBV were eligible for enrollment in a prospective study of HBV vaccination (UFO-2 Study). Starting in 2000, subjects who w ere HCV negative at the base- line screening were eligible for enrollment into the UFO-3Study. The UFO-3 Study had 2 waves of recruitment, from2000 to 2002 and from 2003 to 2007. Participants were in- cluded in this analysis only if they were enrolled prior to December 31, 2007, the end date for searching for deathrecords. All research protocols and informed consent wereapproved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, San Francisco. Survey instrument and measures Eligible consenting participants were interviewed, coun- seled, and tested for antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and presence of viremia (HCV RNA) at baseline. Follow-up in- cluded monthly ''check-ins'' and quarterly study visits that included structured interviews to assess risk (principally drug- related and sexual) exposures, HCV status (including anti- HCV and HCV RNA testing), and risk reduction counselingand referrals. In the rst and second study waves, testing for antibodies to HIV and HBV was performed at baseline and follow-up visits. Deaths were ascertained though the NationalDeath Index (NDI) through the end of 2007. Methods for establishing a match are described in detail on the NDI Web site (http://www.csc.gov/nchs/ndi.htm). In brief, records are matched by rst and last name, date of birth, sex, and state of birth. Causes of death were obtained from the NDI-Plus. The underlying cause of death was based on the International Classication of Diseases (ICD), Tenth Revision. The primary outcome for this analysis was date of death as identied byan NDI match. Causes of death were reviewed, and overdosedeath was dened as ICD, Tenth Revision, codes X42, X44, X62, and Y14. Sociodemographic variables included in the analyses were age, gender, race/ethnicity (Caucasian vs. non-Caucasian), educational level (less than high school vs. highschool or greater), recent (past 3 months) homelessness, and incarceration. Starting in wave 2 , participants were asked aboutparticipation in drug treatment programs in the past 3 monthsand in the past week in wave 3. Recent drug treatment pro- grams included drug detoxica tion, residential treatment, methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, and 12-step pro- grams. Risk-related exposures included duration of injection drug use; frequency of injection; injection of heroin, cocaine,methamphetamine, crack, or heroin mixed with methamphet- amine was dened as a loss of consciousnesswhere at least one intervention was attempted by a third party. Data analysis We calculated mortality incidence overall and by demo- graphic and risk characteristics reported at the baseline interview. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated in 3-year intervals adjusting for age, sex, and race by using na-tional mortality statistics from the National Center for Health Statistics. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated over- all, separately for males and females, and for overdose-related deaths only; 95% condence intervals were calculated by assuming that the observed deaths followed a Poisson dis- tribution. Cox regression models with time-varying covariateswere used to identify predictors of mortality. Survival timewas dened as the time from initiation of injection (self- reported as age at rst injected drugs) to death. Given that subjects were current injectors at the start of the study, datawere left truncated. Subjects entered into the analysis at the baseline visit, and they remained until the date of death or were censored at December 31, 2007, or the last interview date ifthe last interview was after December 31, 2007. Covariates were included in the multivariate model if the incidence rate ratio for mortality reached statistical signicance at a levelofP<0.10 in the bivariate analysis or were potential con- founders (study wave, age, gender, HCV status, and duration of injection drug use). Baseline characteristics including age, gender, duration of injection, and study wave were enteredinto the model as xed covariates. Drug use and injection- risk behaviors, overdose, and HCV status were entered as time-varying covariates. All analyses were conducted with theStata statistical software package (release 11.2; StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). RESULTS A total of 644 participants completed a baseline interview and were enrolled in the prospective cohort from November1997 to December 2007. The median age was 22.0 years (interquartile range (IQR): 19.8-25.0), and participants hadinjected for median of 4.0 years (IQR: 1.7-6.7) at the base- line interview. Sixty-eight percent of participants were male, and 78% were Caucasian (Table 1); 47% had less than a highschool education, and 68% reported being homeless or marginally housed. At the most recent interview, the drug most often injected in the past 30 days was heroin (63%) followed by methamphetamine (27%); 31% reported injectingevery day in the past month, 68% used a syringe exchange in the past month, and 32% were anti-HCV positive.

By use of national mortality as the reference, the over- all adjusted standardized mortality ratio for 1999-2001was 15.3 (95% CI: 7.6, 27.3), which decreased to 2002-2004 and 8.3 (95% CI: 4.4, 14.3)in 2005-2007 (Table 2). When data were stratied by wave of recruitment, temporal declines in mortality persisted (data not shown). In females, the adj usted standardized mortality ratios were higher than in males across all time bands. Further- more, there did not appear to be a trend toward a decreasing standardized mortality ratio over time among women, as thereappeared to be for men. Incidence of overdose mortality also declined between 2000 and 2007 (Table 3). However, women had lower rates of overdose mortality compared with men,and their rates did not appear to decline. The principal causeof death for the overall cohort was overdose (57.9%), fol- by self-inflicted injuries (13.2%), trauma or accidents (10.5%),and other causes (5.3%). In Cox regression with time-varying covariates adjusting for age and duration injecting, participants who used heroinor heroin mix most days or who had a recent overdose had elevated mortality (Table 4). Of these factors, heroin/heroin mix as the drug used most days in the past month was theonly one independently associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio \u00bc5.76, 95% CI: 1.37, 24.30) ( P<0.05). Having a recent nonfatal overdose was associated with higher relative hazards of death, although thi s did not quite meet statistical signicance. After adjustment for other covariates, being HCV infected was not signicantly associated with increased relative hazards of death. DISCUSSION This study of young IDUs in San Francisco between 1997 and 2007 found overall mortality rates 10 times higher thanthose in the general population. Mortality appeared to declineover the 10-year period; however, stratied results suggested that declines were restricted to males. The leading cause of death in this cohort was overdose, and primary use of heroinwas the only signicant independent risk factor for death that was observed in the study. Together, these ndings highlight the substantial mortality risk associated with injecting drugsfor young persons and point to a continued need for publichealth interventions that address the risk of overdose in this population in order to reduce premature deaths. The overall mortality rate observed in this study of IDUs in San Francisco was 9.12 per 1,000 person-years of obser-vation.

Am J Epidemiol. 2012;175(4):302-308 at Mugar Memorial Library, Boston University on March 6, 2012 http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from found a similar mortality rate (3). That study found an initial increase of mortality in the 2 years of the cohort study, fol- lowed by a decrease, which led the authors to hypothesizethat the immediate years following initiation of drug use might be a period of higher risk. In contrast, our study found only a continuous decline in mortality over calendar periods. Theprior study by Vlahov et al. enrolled only recently initiated IDUs (<5 years) and therefore did not include a range of age and duration of drug use to clarify period effects. Our study included participants with a wide range of injecting exposuretime (median \u00bc4 years, IQR: 1.7-6.7), and we performed multivariate Cox models to analyze the independent effectsof age and duration of use. The results did not support anassociation between duration of use and mortality. There are several potential explanations for the observed decline in mortality in our cohort of young injectors. First,it is possible that public hea lth interventions could have led to fewer deaths over the years. In the past decade, severaloverdose prevention programs have been implemented in theUnited States including the d istribution of the overdose- opiate antagonist Ford, (12-16). One of the longest running naloxone prescriptionprograms in the United States was implemented in San Francisco in 2003 and has provided overdose prevention train- ing and prescribed naloxone to nearly 2,000 individuals asof December 2009 (16). Furthermore, improved access to treatment for opioid dependence may be a factor, as opioid substitution treatment in IDUs has been shown to be a sig-nicant factor in reducing the risk of mortality (17). There could have been a change in the purity of heroin over theyears (18). Finally, because there was ongoing enrollment ofour cohort, differences in mortality over time may be associ-ated with unmeasured differences in the UFO Study population over time, such that subjects with lower risk were recruited during later phases of the study. To test this hypothesis, weincluded a variable for period of study recruitment in our Cox models. Although we did not nd signicant differences in the hazard ratios for death by enrollment wave, the hazardr a t i o sw e r el e s st h a n1 . 0c o m p aring the later with earlier years, suggesting that this could be an underlying factor.Furthermore, when we investigated changes in the UFO Studypopulation across the 3 waves of data collection, we found that participants in the rst wave were more likely to inject heroin or heroin mixed with other drugs in the past month andwere signicantly less likely to inject methamphetaminein the past month at baseline (data not shown). Since pri- mary use of heroin as the drug of injection was strongly predictive of death in our Cox models (hazard ratio \u00bc5.76, 95% CI: 1.37, 24.30), this observed decline in heroin injection in later waves of study recruitment is a likely contributor to the decline in overdose mortality over time. Our study of young injection drug users found the most common causes of death to be overdose and trauma, whichis consistent with prior studies (3, 6, 7, 19). This supportsa continued focus on overdose prevention in this age group.Of the risk factors examined in this study, only use of heroin as the main injecting drug was independently predictive of death. This contrasts with 2 prior studies of young IDUsthat found HIV infection to be s ignicantly associated withmortality (3, 6). This difference can likely be explained by the relatively small absolute number of participants included in our sample and the small number of persons with HIV.Also, HIVas a cause of death has been shown to have peaked in the 1990s (20, 21), before the advent of highly active anti- retroviral therapy, and is less likely to impact mortality inyoung versus older injectors (7). Our study showed differences in death rates between men and women. Although the incidence of death was higheramong men compared with women, standardized mortalityratios were higher for women. Female injectors were 12 times more likely to die compared w ith females in the general US population; in contrast, male injectors were 8 times more likely to die compared with the male US population. A similar difference in sex-stratied standardized mortality ratios has been reported in a cohort of young IDUs in Canada (6). Inaddition, although rates of d eath appeared to decline over time among men, rates appeared relatively stable for womenover the 10-year period. Sex -stratied results should be interpreted with caution however, as the sample size wasrelatively small and resulted in wide condence intervals for period-specic mortality rates. There were a number of important limitations to this study. Mortality rates may be underestimates because of deaths thatwere not captured by the NDI search criteria. A number of study participants were believed to have given pseudonymsrather than birth names, which would not allow matching, and incorrect birth dates may have been given. Causes of death were based on ICD codes on death certicates that may beinaccurate (22). Analyses used baseline predictor data, and some covariates measured constructs that could change over time (HIV and HCV infections, injecting behaviors, incarcer-ation, and so on). Therefore, a nalyses of certain predictors should be interpreted with cau tion. Finally, the relatively modest sample size and small absolute number of deaths arelimitations, particularly with regard to sex-stratied results. In conclusion, this study of young IDUs in San Francisco demonstrated that injection drug use is associated with sub-stantially increased risk for death, and that most of the excessrisk is due to overdose and trauma. Results also suggest that, among young adult injectors in San Francisco, mortality rates are decreasing over time but are generally restrictedto males. Research is needed to conrm these results and explore reasons for sex-specic differences in mortality in young IDUs.

This study identied factors related to the perceived difculty of implementing EHR. 163 physicianscompleted surveys before and after the implementation of EHR in an externally funded pilot program in three Massachusetts communities. Ordinal hierarchical logisticregression was used to identify baseline factors that correlated with physicians' report of difculty with EHR implementation. Compared with physicians withownership stake in their practices, physician employees were less likely to describe EHR implementation as difcult (adjusted OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.0). Physicianswho perceived their staff to be innovative were also lesslikely to view EHR implementation as difcult (adjusted OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.8). Physicians who own their practice may need more external support for EHRimplementation than those who do not. Innovative clinical support staff may ease the EHR implementation process and contribute to its success. Physicians who have not demonstrated 'meaning- ful use 'of health information technology (HIT) by 2015 may face reduced future Medicare reimburse- ment.1Failure to implement electronic health records (EHR) may prove costly to individualphysicians and may make it hard for them to engage in care redesign that will be needed under healthcare reform. 23Awards up to US $44 000 through Medicare or even US$63 750 through Medicaid are currently available to physi- cians in of ce practice who demonstrate meaning- ful use of their EHR over 5 years.1T o receive the maximum reimbursement providers must begin participating by 2012. Through the federal government, health infor- mation technology regional extension centers (REC) are positioned across the country to offertechnical support and best practices to at least100 000 providers over 2 years. 4In addition, approximately US$500 million has been awarded in federal support to states and territories to increasehealth information exchange. 56 Earlier studies have identi ed factors that predispose practices to successful EHR adoption,namely larger practices, those af liated with large hospitals, or those involved with teaching. 7e10 Physicians face numerous barriers to participating in the meaningful use program, including a bewil- dering number of choices when selecting an EHR.11 It is unclear how fast providers will adopt. Ford et al,12using EHR adoption data from six previoussurveys, found under their most optimistic scenario a predicted EHR adoption rate of 61% by 2014, far short of 'widespread adoption '. In contrast to adoption, comparatively little is known about the factors that predict successful implementation, the installation of EHR and theirincorporation into the usual operations of a func-tioning practice. Few data are available regarding what factors in fluence physicians 'perception of the ease or dif culty of EHR implementation. This perception of ease or dif culty is important. It may influence the actual successfulness of EHR imple- mentation or even the decision to complete an EHRimplementation that is underway. Therefore, we undertook the present study, using data from practices in three communities participating in theMassachusetts eHealth Collaborative (MAeHC)EHR implementation project. Our objective was to identify factors present at baseline that were subsequently related to the perceived dif culty of implementing EHR. METHODS Study design We carried out a pre epost evaluation of the MAeHC three-community intervention to promote physicians 'adoption and implementation of EHR. We collected physician attitudes, demographic andpractice characteristics and used post-intervention surveys to measure physicians 'perceived dif culty of EHR implementation. The Partners HealthCareHuman Research Committee approved the study protocol. Intervention The details of the MAeHC program have been described previously.13e15In summary, between 2006 and 2008, MAeHC installed robust EHR in physician practices in three Massachusettscommunities. MAeHC provided extensive on-site consultation, at no cost to these practices, to facilitate work flow redesign and integration of the EHR into the practice. They also provided technical support related to hardware and software. Settings and participants The Massachusetts communities of Brockton,Newburyport and North Adams were selected for the MAeHC program through a competitiveprocess described in detail in Goroll et al. 13Briefly, MAeHC issued a request for applications to which 35 communities throughout Massachusettssubmitted applications to participate.

Selection criteria emphasized local physician leadership and community support of the application. A total of 167 physician practices, representing 91% of all eligible primary care and specialty practices, participated. Weidenti ed all physicians in each of the participating practices for pre-intervention (2005) and post-intervention (2009) surveys. In the pre-intervention survey we identi ed 500 physicians from 167 practices; 355 completed the survey (response rate 77%). 16 In 2009, 468 physicians were eligible, of whom 319 completedthe survey (response rate 68%). For this study we includedonly the 163 physicians from 134 practice sites who completed both the 2005 and 2009 survey questionnaires. Survey design The design and content of the pre and post-intervention surveyswere based on similar statewide surveys of physicians described previously. 1617Briefly, the 2005 survey included items intended to measure physicians 'attitudes toward the use of computers in healthcare, perceptions of the quality of care, physician demo- graphics and practice characteristics. The post-intervention(2009) survey retained verbatim all of the items from the orig- inal survey and incorporated new items that would not have been relevant before the intervention. For example, new ques-tions asked about health information exchange, the EHR implementation process and work flow analysis. Survey administration and data collection Survey administration and data collection methods in 2005 and 2009 were similar. In 2005, paper surveys were hand-delivered to physicians 'ofces by MAeHC practice consultants, who had been making routine visits to the practices in preparation for the anticipated implementation. Physicians had the option of returning the survey directly to practice consultants or bymail. 16In 2009, the Survey Lab of the University of Chicago, a third-party research and consulting service, administered the survey to MAeHC physicians; these physicians returned thecompleted survey by mail or via the web to the Survey Lab in Chicago. Main outcome measure Our main outcome was the response to the following questionin the post-intervention survey: 'Was the implementation process for your EHR .(a) very dif cult; (b) somewhat dif cult; (c) not dif cult?' Other variables The pre-intervention survey included physician characteristics (age, sex, race, years in practice, number of outpatient visits per week); practice characteristics (number of physicians in practice,specialty, ownership, and nancial resources available for expansion); and information on individual physician stressors (isolation from colleagues, working long hours, personal/job stress, and demoralization). Several dimensions of organizationalculture were assessed, including innovation, initiative, quality improvement, evaluation, and risk assessment (see table 1). We requested information on the availability and physicians 'use of 10 key functions of the EHR post-intervention to calculate an EHR usage score. 9As in previous analyses, we calculated an EHR usage score as the number of functions reported as used most orall of the time, divided by the number of available functions. For example, physicians who reported using none of their available EHR functions would score 0, while those who reported usingall of their available functions most or all of the time wouldscore 1. In another example, physicians who reported using four of their eight available functions most or all of the time wouldscore 0.5. Statistical analysis T o identify potential confounders between our main outcomeand additional covariates we calculated c2tests or Fisher 's exact test among categorical values and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables. Variables noted to be signi cantly associ- ated (p <0.05) with the main outcome measure were included in the multivariate model. For multivariate analysis, we performed ordinal hierarchical logistic regression to account for the clus-tering of physicians within practice; the ordinal logistic regres-sion assumption was met. We decided a priori to include sex and categorical age in the multivariate model.

RESULTS Overall, 163 physicians completed both surveys in 2005 and 2009. Among these physicians, 156 physicians (96%) answered questions relating to our main outcome. The physicians weremostly men, and most had full or partial ownership stake in their practice (see table 1). Most participants (70%) had been in practice for at least 15 years, with a median of 22 years sincegraduation from medical school. A total of 22 physicians (15%) reported having a 'solo 'practice; 99 physicians (63%) indicated that they practised in a primary care or single specialty grouppractice and 35 (22%) worked in multispecialty group practices.A total of 26 physicians (17%) indicated that their practice had at least moderate resources for expansion or improvements of any kind; only two physicians (1%) stated that their practicehad extensive resources for expansion. The mean EHR usage score was 0.68 (SD \u00bc0.28). Overall, 54 physicians (35%) reported that the implementa- tion process for their EHR was very dif cult. Eighty-four (54%) of the physicians found the process to be somewhat dif cult; only 18 (12%) reported their implementation process was notdifcult. Factors associated with dif culty of EHR implementation in bivariate analyses are shown in table 2. Compared with physi-cians who were partial or full owners of their practice, thosewithout any ownership stake in their practice were less likely to view the implementation process as dif cult or very dif cult (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.9). In terms of absolute numbers, 26%of non-owners (14/54) indicated that implementation was very difcult, compared with 38% of owners (40/104). Physicians who indicated that the of ce staff was innovative were less likely to view the implementation process as dif cult or very dif cult (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.8), compared with physicians who did not indicate that their staff was innovative.Higher EHR usage scores were associated with lower likelihoodof viewing the implementation process as dif cult or very difcult (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.9). In multivariate analysis, however, physicians 'EHR usage score was not associated with the perceived dif culty of EHR implementation. Physicians who were employed by their prac- tice (ie, those who did not have partial or full ownership stake inthe practice) were less likely to view EHR implementation as difcult (adjusted OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.0). Similarly, physi- cians who perceived their staff as innovative were less likely toview EHR implementation as dif cult (adjusted OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.8). We did not nd evidence of effect modi cation by practice size on owners 'perception of dif culty (p \u00bc0.69).DISCUSSION We evaluated how physicians practising in three communities in Massachusetts perceived the EHR implementation process and factors that facilitated EHR implementation. In this setting, wefound that physicians who were not owners of the practice and those who perceived their of ce staff to be innovative were less likely to view the implementation process as dif cult or very difcult. Earlier studies have demonstrated that physicians working in larger practices and those af liated with hospitals are more likely to have adopted EHR and to use those systems mean- ingfully. 791 0However, relatively little attention has been paid to the ease or dif culty physicians perceive when they implement EHR in their practices. We found that physicians who were owners of their practice perceived their EHR implementation to be more dif cult, compared with physicians who did not have an ownershipstake. Because ownership is generally associated with greater levels of responsibility for day-to-day practice operations and management, these physicians probably experienced moreunderlying challenges associated with EHR implementation and work flow transformation. Physician owners probably bear nancial risk for failure of implementation out of proportion to payers or publicly funded health plans who bene t from patient safety and quality but not as directly from practice ef ciency or revenue cycle management. 18These physician owners may need not only nancial support but also training and expert consultation to bolster the implementation process. The association between physicians 'perception of having innovative staff and their report of less dif cult EHR imple- mentation deserves exploration. Having staff who are innovative may re flect an of ce culture that is committed to progress or potentially a marker for a physician who values the role of non-physician staff in ensuring the smooth operations of the of ce. Understanding the role of 'innovative staff 'may uncover a poten- tial facilitator for easing EHR adoption and implementation. This study has several limitations. Although the sample includes a broad range of primary care physicians and specialists from three diverse communities across Massachusetts, the ndings may not generalize to practices in other settings. It should be noted that the physicians in this study were part of a well-supported EHR implementation program. While the HITECH-mandated REC program is supporting practices, it islikely that most practices nationally will receive less support from their REC than the physician groups in our study. We also note the limitation as with any survey-based research, that ourvariables are self-reported perceptions, rather than objectivemeasures, and subject to a variety of biases, such as social desirability. Nonetheless, these perceptions are important, because they can in fluence physicians 'behavior. CONCLUSIONS Physicians who have ownership stake in their practices experi- ence rst-hand the challenges of EHR implementation, and they generally perceive EHR implementation as being more dif cult than their colleagues who are employed by the practices in which they work. Physicians who report that their staff is innovative perceive less dif culty with EHR implementation, suggesting that of ce staff play a critical role in EHR imple- mentation, as they do in any transformation effort. Efforts to expand EHR implementation should focus on the needs ofphysician owners, and future efforts should emphasize the important role that non-physician staff members play in the process of innovation and transformation.Table 2 The odds of nding the EHR implementation process difcult by physicians in ambulatory practices* Unadjusted OR (95% CI) Adjusted OR (95% CI) y Male 1.0 (0.5 to 2.0) 0.7 (0.3 to 1.6) Age>50 years 1.4 (0.8 to 2.5) 1.3 (0.7 to 2.5) EHR usage score z 0.3 (0.1 to 0.9) 0.3 (0.1 to 1.1) Non-owners 0.5 (0.2 to 0.9) 0.5 (0.3 to 1.0) Staff innovation 0.4 (0.2 to 0.8) 0.4 (0.2 to 0.8) *Bold items indicate a statistically signicant value at p #0.05. yAdjusted for sex, categorical age, calculated electronic health record (EHR) usage score, ownership, proportion of physicians who agree with the statement that their ofce staff are innovative. zMeasured as a continuous variable.

BERNSTEIN, MD Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians Comprehensive Headache Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder has been linked to women's ill health, including headaches. Intimate partner violence, which may result in posttraumatic stress disorder, is often reportedby women with headaches. Prior studies of intimate partner vio-lence and headache have estimated lifetime but not 12-monthprevalence. The researchers in this study examined the relation-ship between headache and posttraumatic stress disorder in anovel population, and estimated 12-month and lifetime prevalencerates of intimate partner violence. Methods: Patients were recruitedfrom a women's headache center (n =92) during 2006-07 and Received September 20, 2011; revised April 3, 2012; accepted April 4, 2012.

Posttraumatic stress disorder was measured using amodied Breslau scale. Twelve-month and lifetime physical inti- mate partner violence were measured with the Partner Violence Screen and the STaT (\"slapped, threatened and throw\") mea-sure. Multivariable regression determined factors independentlyassociated with headache severity. Results: Among all partici-pants, 28.3% screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder;9.8% and 36.9% of women endorsed recent and lifetime intimatepartner violence. Posttraumatic stress disorder was strongly asso-ciated with headache severity ( =34.12, p =0.01). Patients reporting lifetime intimate partner violence exhibited a trend ofnine additional days of disability due to headache over 90 days.Conclusions: Posttraumatic stress disorder and intimate partnerviolence occur among a sizable proportion of women referredfor headache. The authors' ndings reafrm that clinicians treat-ing women with headaches must be aware of the possibility ofposttraumatic stress disorder and intimate partner violence in suchpatients. KEYWORDS posttraumatic stress disorder, intimate partner vio- lence, headache, chronic pain, disability INTRODUCTION Interpersonal trauma has a profound and lasting impact on women's long-term health (Schnurr & Green, 2004). Many forms of chronic pain have beenlinked to past traumatic experiences (Paras et al., 2009; Romans et al., 2002;Wuest et al., 2008; Walling et al., 1994). Headache is one of the most fre-quent forms of chronic pain, accounting for considerable disability and useof health services (Lipton et al., 2007), with a disproportionate impact onwomen (Diamond, 2007). Over the last decade, an enlarging body of workhas examined the association between headache and exposure to manyforms of interpersonal trauma (Anda et al., 2010; Tietjen et al., 2009a, 2009b;Golding, 1999). Emerging data has suggested that posttraumatic stress disor-der (PTSD) is an important contributory factor in the relationship betweentrauma and resultant physical health sequelae (Schnurr & Green, & 2000; Dennis et al., 2009; Wuest et al., 2009).PTSD is prevalent in ambulatory medical populations; recent studies havefound a prevalence ranging from 12% to 33% among primary care patients(Liebschutz et al., 2007; Alim et al., 2006; Stein et al., 2000). PTSD is characterized by re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing, and arousal symptoms related to a signicant traumatic event (American Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:53 11 July 2012 456 M. R. Gerber et al. Psychological Association, 2000), and may be accompanied by altered allostatic load (physiologic changes that result from chronic stress) (Glover,Stuber, & Poland, 2006), which is one recognized pathway to poor health_(Rasmusson et al., 2010; Dennis et al., 2009; Dutton et al., 2006; Gill,Szanton, & Page, 2005) and chronic pain (Peterlin et 2008; Raphael &Widom, 2010; Otis, Keane, & Kerns, 2003; Sharp & Harvey, 2001). PTSDhas a higher incidence among women (Tolin & Foa, 2006). AlthoughPTSD appears to play a key role in the relationship between traumaand subsequent poor physical health and chronic pain (Kimerling, Clum,& Wolfe, 2000; Sharp & Harvey, 2001; Schnurr & Jankowski, 1999), itis frequently misdiagnosed or under-recognized outside of mental healthtreatment settings (Liebschutz et al., 2007). Thus, primary care providers car-ing for women may fail to recognize the presence of PTSD among theirpatients. Headache and PTSD often co-occur (Peterlin, Nijjar, & Tietjen, 2011). A large general population study revealed that the 12-month odds of PTSD in women with migraine were increased nearly four-fold (3.82), and lifetime odds were increased three-fold compared to women not reporting headache(Peterlin, Rosso, et al., 2011). The published prevalence rates of PTSD amongheadache patients have ranged from 12.5% to 42.9% et al., 2011).In a multi-site study of primary care patients, participants with PTSD had atwo-fold odds of reporting headache (Lowe et al., 2011). The presence ofPTSD was also a risk factor for chronic (versus episodic) headache in thesame clinic population (Peterlin et al., 2008, 2009) serving both genders witha majority of female participants. Estimates from an all-women's headachecenter are lacking in the literature. One frequent form of interpersonal trauma resulting in PTSD is intimate partner violence (IPV; Dutton et al., 2006). While PTSD can result from multi-ple forms of interpersonal trauma, the authors focused on IPV in the currentstudy due to the relative paucity of reports on IPV in clinical settings dedi-cated to treating headaches. IPV is a pattern of coercive behavior in whichone person attempts to control another through threats or actual use of phys-ical violence, sexual assault, and verbal or psychological abuse (Heron et al.,2003). The population-based National Intimate Partner and Sexual ViolenceSurvey (NISVS) found a lifetime rate of any severe physical IPV of 24.3%,and a rate of recent IPV of 2.7% among women. When less severe forms of physical IPV were included, the prevalence rates were 30.3% and 3.6%, respectively (Black et al., 2011). IPV has well-known adverse health effects(Coker et al., 2002; Campbell et al., 2002). Acute physical injury often occurs,with head and neck injuries the most frequent subtype of musculoskeletalinjury resulting from IPV (Tam et al., 2010). Abused women have 1.5 to2 times higher risk of chronic pain, including headache (Coker et al., 2002)(see Figure 1). Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:53 11 July 2012 PTSD, Intimate Partner Violence, and Women's Headaches 457 FIGURE 1 Relationship between headache severity, PTSD, and IPV. Women who are victims of IPV are up to 60% more likely to suffer from headache than unabused controls (Coker et al., 2002; Cripe et al., 2011).A retrospective chart review of mostly female (90.1%) tertiary care headachepatients in the United States found that nearly 35% reported a lifetime historyof physical and /or sexual abuse (Peterlin et al., 2007). However, that study did not use standardized measures of abuse, making the results difcult togeneralize. A recent study of post-partum hospitalized women in Peru foundthat 34.8% of migraine sufferers reported a lifetime history of IPV (Cripe et al.,2011). Neither of these studies ascertained recent or 12-month prevalencerates of IPV in the populations studied. Measurement of the prevalence ofrecent abuse would provide insight into the identication and managementof women with headache who are recently and /or currently involved in abusive relationships. Intervention for women experiencing current or recentabuse differs from care needed by women with past history of IPV. Given the growing popularity of outpatient, female-only clinics in the United States (American Hospital Association, 2000), including the expansionof dedicated primary care clinics for women veterans (Bean-Mayberry et al.,2003), examination of prevalence rates of IPV in ambulatory headache treat- ment settings that exclusively serve women would be useful. The majority of headache patients seen in primary care settings are not referred to specialists(Stokes et al., 2011). Therefore, describing the prevalence of potential PTSDand IPV in this setting could yield ndings relevant to more severe headachepatients who can be more challenging to manage in primary care. Survivors of IPV and other forms of trauma may prefer women-only clinics because such patients are often hyper-vigilant and likely to overes-timate the threat associated with being around men (Elwood et al., 2007).In previous studies of satisfaction with women-only practice settings ver-sus traditional models, only a study performed in Veteran's Administrationclinics demonstrated a strong patient preference for women-only centers(Bean-Mayberry et al., 2003); (Harpole et al., 2000; Phelan et al., 2000). Thisnding may support the possibility that populations with a high proportionof trauma-exposed women are more likely to prefer single-gender care set-tings and that the prevalence rates of PTSD could be higher in such settings.However, this has yet to be empirically proven. The authors designed the current study to assess the prevalence of previ- ously undetected screen positive, or suspected, PTSD and IPV in a dedicatedwomen's headache treatment center population. This study replicates and Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:53 11 July 2012 458 M. R. Gerber et al. extends prior work (Peterlin et al., 2009) to a dedicated women's headache treatment setting. It also makes a novel contribution by estimating a 12-month rate of IPV among headache sufferers as prior studies only reportedlifetime estimates. Researchers in the current study had several aims. First,they sought to estimate prevalence rates for PTSD and physical IPV (12-month and lifetime) in this all-female treatment setting. They expected thatthese rates would be higher than those reported previously. Secondly, theyseparately tested the associations between headache severity and PTSD andbetween headache severity and physical IPV. They theorized that the rela-tionship between PTSD and headache severity would be stronger than thatbetween physical IPV and headache severity because prior investigation sup-ports that PTSD is more strongly linked to health problems than traumaper se (Schnurr & Green, 2004). In a study of primary care outpatients,trauma and extreme stress were linked to medical illness, but this effect wasstronger for the subset of patients who had PTSD (Weisberg et al., 2002).PTSD itself appears to stress the affected individual, and traumatized women with PTSD have higher allostatic loads than traumatized women without PTSD (Glover, Stuber, & Poland, 2006). MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Sample The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey study of a convenience sam- ple of women presenting to a referral center for women with headache,based at an academic community hospital. Referred patients who presentedwith either migraine or tension variant headache to this treatment center inthe greater Boston area between 2006 and 2007 were approached duringregular operating hours of the clinic and asked if they would be willing toparticipate in a study on stress and headaches. The study was an unfundedexploratory study staffed by trained volunteer research assistants. Ninety-two female patients consented to complete the survey. Patients under theage of 18 years, pregnant women, and non-English speakers were eligibleto participate, and were approached by a research assistant after an initialnursing intake form established eligibility. Participants gave written, signedinformed consent administered by the research assistant prior to completingstudy questionnaires. Data Collection Those who chose to participate were asked basic demographic questionsand also completed the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) question-naire (Stewart, Lipton, Whyte, et al., 1999; Lipton et al., 2001) as part oftheir routine assessment. The MIDAS is a ve-question self-report tool that Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:53 11 July 2012 PTSD, Intimate Partner Violence, and Women's Headaches 459 measures headache-related disability over the preceding 90 days in three domains: paid work /education, household /family matters, and social /leisure activities; the unit of measure is days (see Appendix). The MIDAS has beenvalidated for use with both migraine and tension variant headaches (Stewart,Lipton, Kolodner, et al., 1999), and the highest possible score is 270 (Stewartet al., 2001). Respondents answered ve questions about the impact ofheadache on their functioning, as measured in missed days of school /work, decrements in work and household productivity and interference in family,social, and leisure activities using a self-administered format. The total daysof patient-reported disability were then summed into a point score. A scoregreater than 21 (days) indicated severe disability. The nal MIDAS score hasbeen validated as a measure of headache severity (Stewart, Lipton, Kolodner,et al., 1999; Lipton et al., 2001; Stewart et al., 2001). PTSD was ascertained using a seven-item modied Breslau screening tool (Breslau et al., 1999) that has been validated in primary care outpa-tient settings against a clinician-administered structured interview measuring 17 core symptoms (CAPS; Kimerling et al., 2006) (Appendix). In the cur- rent study, the research assistant administered the questions to participants.The instrument was scored by summing all responses; the range of possiblescores on this modied Breslau scale is 0-7. The cutoff score of 4 or greaterfor indicating PTSD was established using sensitivity, specicity, and likeli-hood ratios. A score over this cut point had a sensitivity (95% condenceinterval) of 2006). Lifetime IPV measured the STaT (\"slapped, threatened and throw\"; Paranjape & Liebschutz, 2003), a three-question by 3, respectively. The corresponding specicity is 75% (59%-91%), 100%, and 100%. The research assistant administered these questions.Endorsement of any item on the STaT was considered a positive screen forpast or lifetime IPV. The semi-structured interview against which the STaTwas validated included criteria measuring emotional control by an intimatepartner. The research assistant also administered the Partner Violence Screen(PVS) to ascertain recent IPV. The PVS is a three-item instrument validatedagainst the Index of Spousal Abuse (ISA) and the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS)(Appendix). Compared with the ISA, the sensitivity of the PVS in detecting partner abuse was 64.5%; the specicity was 80.3% (Feldhaus et al., 1997). When compared with the CTS, sensitivity of the PVS was 71.4%; the speci-city was 84.4%. Positive predictive values ranged from 51.3% to 63.4%,and negative predictive values ranged from 87.6% to 88.7%. For the PVS,any afrmative response was considered a positive screen when physicalabuse was perpetrated by an intimate partner. Due to the need for brevityin this busy clinical setting, instruments expressly designed and validated to Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:53 11 July 2012 460 M. R. Gerber et al. measure emotional and sexual abuse were not included; researchers focused instead on measurement of physical abuse and the threat thereof. Subsequently, the STaT responses were dichotomized into the past (lifetime) abuse variable, and the PVS responses formed the dichotomousvariable for recent (12-month) IPV. Women who endorsed recent IPVreceived immediate safety planning and counseling, and those who reportedany IPV or screened positive for PTSD were offered referrals to on-site mentalhealth services. A chart review was conducted to ascertain the MIDAS score (which was performed prior to the research interview by a clinician during the patient'smedical visit on the same date of the study visit) along with the followingvariables: smoking, alcohol use history, marital status, and insurance type. Statistical Analysis Frequencies were calculated for survey and chart review data. To reducepotential bias from missing data on smoking and drinking habits, researchersperformed multiple imputation modeling (Rubin, 1987). They rst performedchi square tests on cross tabulations of categorical variables to test bivariateassociations of the relationship between IPV and headache severity, andIPV and PTSD. In these analyses, headache severity (MIDAS score) wasdichotomized into a categorical variable, using the cut point of 21 for theseexploratory analyses to determine what percentage of women fell into thehighest category of headache severity. Researchers calculated the neededsample size based on a theoretical 20-point clinical difference in MIDAS score between participants positive for, and those negative for PTSD. At the time the study began, no published literature was available on the likelymagnitude of the relation of PTSD with headache. Using an a priori sam- ple size calculator for multiple regression (Cohen et al., 2003), researchersestimated that with 80% power and =0.05, a sample size of 70 would be sufcient to detect a theoretical 20-point difference in MIDAS score. In all subsequent regression models, MIDAS was entered as a con- tinuous variable to maximize statistical power. Next, researchers estimatedunadjusted linear regression models to examine relationships between thedependent variable, MIDAS score, and PTSD, 12-month and lifetime IPV,age, insurance type, and tobacco and alcohol use. Statistical signicance wasset at p=0.05. Covariates were retained in the nal multivariable models based on their theoretical association with the dependent variable, headacheseverity as measured by the MIDAS (Peterlin, Nijjar, Domino Haber, 1987; Aamodtet al., 2006; Schwartz et al., 1998; Diamond, as wellas PTSD (Feldner, Babson, & Zvolensky, 2007; Kessler et al., 1995), and IPV(Gerber et al., 2005). Insurance type was included as a proxy for socioeco-nomic status (SES), which has also been associated with headache (Winter Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:53 11 July 2012 PTSD, Intimate Partner Violence, and Women's Headaches 461 et al., 2012), PTSD (Savoca & Rosenheck, 2000), and IPV (Cunradi, Caetano, & Schafer, 2002). To determine whether recent and lifetime IPV could be entered into the same regression model, researchers estimated the correlation betweenthe two. In the nal step, they estimated three separate models: Model1 examined the relationship between PTSD and headache severity (MIDAS),Model 2 examined recent IPV and headache, and Model 3 examinedlifetime IPV and headache severity (MIDAS). Model t was assessed bycalculating an R 2statistic. Analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9.2 [Cary, NC]. The study received Institutional Review Board approval at the Cambridge Health Alliance and VA Boston Healthcare System. RESULTS The mean age of the participants was 39 years (SD =13.18, range 18-66 years), and the mean MIDAS score was 50.6 (SD =52.46, range 0-240) (see Table 1). While participants came from a wide spectrum ofsocioeconomic strata, the majority of the participants in the study hadprivate /commercial insurance (73%, 67 /92). Most of the participants reported living with an intimate partner (73%, 67 /92); 50% were married (46 /92). Nine (9.8%) of the participants endorsed having experienced IPV within the pre-ceding year, and 36.9% (34 /92) reported lifetime IPV. The prevalence of a positive screen for PTSD was 28.3% (26 /92). PTSD was signicantly associated severity in bivariate X 2=4.47, p=0.03). However, ( X2=0.007, p=0.9) IPV was associated with headache severity in bivariate analyses.

This beta coefcient translated intoan average of 34 more days of headache-related symptoms in a 90-day periodand a statistically signicant higher degree of headache severity for partici-pants with PTSD than for those without PTSD. Lifetime and recent IPV werecorrelated ( p=0.399), and were therefore added to two separate regres- sion models to examine their association with headache severity separately.Neither form of IPV was signicantly associated with headache severity ( p =0.05) in these two separate regression models (Table 2). A gradient was observed for model t in the R 2results: Model 1 (PTSD and headache) R2 =13.74%, Model 2 (lifetime IPV and headache) R2=11.04%, and Model 3 (recent IPV and headache) R2=9.2%. DISCUSSION The authors found that 28.3% of participants presenting to a women's headache treatment center screened positive for PTSD, which is in concert Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:53 11 July 2012 PTSD, Intimate Partner Violence, and Women's Headaches 463 with the range of 12.5% to 42.9% reported in other dedicated headache treatment settings (Peterlin et al., 2008, 2009), and also falls in the range of11.8% to 33% reported in various primary care settings (Liebschutz et al.,2007; Stein et al., 2000; Alim et al., 2006). The study participants also exhib-ited high prevalence rates of both lifetime (36.9%) and recent IPV (9.8%)when compared to estimates of 24.3% and 2.7% of women in the generalpopulation (Black et al., 2011). The current results replicated the prevalencerates of lifetime IPV (27.3% to 34.8%) that have previously been reported (Cripe et al., 2011; Peterlin et al., 2007), and augment the existing literature by presenting a 12-month prevalence rate for these clinical settings. It is notsurprising that the prevalence rates of IPV in this study exceeded popula-tion rates, as women with chronic pain report higher rates of exposure toabuse than those derived in population studies (Wuest et al., 2008; Nicolaidis& Liebschutz, 2009; Coker et al., 2002). The 12-month prevalence rate ofIPV in this headache center population was comparable to 12-month ratesof 8.6% reported among women in the same metropolitan area in primarycare settings (McCloskey et al., 2005) where women frequently present withheadache (Lipton et al., 2007). These ndings contradicted researchers original expectation that higher prevalence rates of suspected PTSD and IPV would be found in this all-female headache setting. One reason for this may have been the highproportion of women represented in the previously published estimatesin treatment settings for both male and female patients. It is also conceiv-able that patients presenting to an all-female clinical setting do not differ ontrauma exposure and potential susceptibility to PTSD. However, researchersmay also have underestimated the true prevalence of IPV in the currentpopulation by measuring primarily one domain of IPV (physical, not sex-ual or psychological). Although neither of the two prior studies of IPV andheadache cited previously included emotional abuse estimates, both mea- sured physical and sexual abuse (Cripe et al., 2011; Peterlin et al., 2007). It remains possible that had sexual abuse rates been measured in the cur-rent study, the observed prevalence rates of IPV may have been higher. It isalso plausible that headache is more strongly associated with psychologicalabuse, and that the authors underestimated the magnitude of this relationshipby using limited measures. The current study also reafrmed the ndings from prior work demonstrating increased headache impact scores in participants with PTSDusing a different measure of headache severity, the HIT-6 (Peterlin et al.,2009). In the current study, the mean MIDAS headache severity score of50, well above the cut point of 21, suggests that study participants wereexperiencing a high degree of headache-related disability. PTSD statuswas statistically associated with MIDAS score; participants whoscreened positive for PTSD had headache severity scores that were 34 pointshigher on average than those negative for PTSD, controlling for covariates. Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:53 11 July 2012 464 M. R. Gerber et al. This translates into 34 more days of headache-related disruption in activities over a 90-day period, or disabling headache more than 30% of the time.This degree of headache severity could affect treatment considerations.Within this population, IPV was not signicantly associated with headacheseverity at the p<0.05 level. Yet, patients who reported exposure to recent and lifetime IPV scored, respectively, 1.6 and 9 points higher on theMIDAS, suggesting that, despite lack of statistical signicance, these womenexhibited greater headache severity and more days of adverse impact from headache. This trend appears particularly salient for women who have experienced lifetime IPV. These results may reflect that the development of PTSD (or suspected PTSD) is a more important factor in determining headache severity than thetrauma alone (in this study, IPV exposure), as suggested previously (Schnurr& Green, 2004; Kimerling, Clum, & Wolfe, 2000). The normative response totrauma (including IPV) is resilience. Most trauma survivors recover naturally.In the minority of cases where PTSD develops, it puts \"load\" on the systemand increases risk for headache over and above IPV exposure. Headachepatients with PTSD may have higher allostatic load with accompanying phys-iologic changes that manifest as greater headache severity. These ndings areconsonant with the growing body of research documenting PTSD as a pri-mary mechanism contributing to the relationship between IPV and physicalhealth problems (Woods et al., 2008). This referral population was relatively well insured, underscoring the fact that IPV affects women from all socioeconomic strata. This ndingemphasizes that clinicians routinely caring for women with headaches mustbe attuned to the potential presence of IPV during their patient encounters.Clinicians and care teams should be prepared to offer resources and refer-rals when patients do disclose abuse. Additionally, because both headacheand PTSD are conditions that occur more frequently in women, healthcare providers who routinely treat women need to be cognizant of the association between headache and PTSD, especially in women with chronic headacheswho tend to have higher headache severity scores in the range reported bythis study. Limitations In the current data, headache was not classied by formal InternationalClassication of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) diagnostic guidelines, as have been used in other studies (Peterlin et al., 2007, 2008, 2009; Peterlin, Rosso, et al., 2011; Cripe et al., 2011), because the authors felt that this informationwas often not available to primary care providers seeing women patients, andbecause the MIDAS has been validated in both tension variant and migraineheadaches (Stewart, Lipton, Kolodner, et al., 1999). However, this limitedthe ability to compare current ndings to those of other studies that have Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:53 11 July 2012 PTSD, Intimate Partner Violence, and Women's Headaches 465 stratied their results by headache type. In addition, data on head injury and depression were not available, both of which could be confounders due totheir potential associations with physical trauma as well as headache. Further,statistical power to detect as statistically signicant meaningful differences inheadache severity by IPV exposure may have been limited by the small sam-ple size. The small numbers of women who reported recent IPV in particularmay have limited the researchers' ability to detect meaningful differencesin headache severity. Additionally, as stated above, the PTSD screen didnot determine whether the symptoms queried were anchored to IPV expo-sure specically. Thus, it is possible that the positive PTSD screening dataascertained with this measurement was secondary to other types of trauma(including child abuse and sexual assault) not measured in this study. Otherlimitations included the cross-sectional design of the study, which prohibitedassessment of the timing of the IPV and PTSD in relation to the developmentof headaches, and potential challenges to generalizeability, given that thiswas a clinical convenience sample from a unique treatment setting to which women with very severe headaches were referred. Participation bias was also possible; researchers did not collect data on all women approached inthe clinic and on women who did not participate in the study, to be able toassess potential selection and participation biases. Finally, the administrationof potentially sensitive trauma-related measures by a research assistant mayhave increased the possibility of reporting bias in the sample. CONCLUSION This study, conducted in a women's headache specialty center, contributesadditional evidence to the existing literature linking PTSD to adverse healthoutcomes, notably headache severity. While the study did not conrm theprior expectation that prevalence rates of PTSD and IPV could be higher ina dedicated women's headache population, the restricted denition of IPVmay have underestimated the true prevalence of all forms of IPV in this pop-ulation. This study does contribute prevalence estimates using well-validatedIPV measures, thus conrming prior observations that IPV is a salient issuefor women with headaches. The data on rates of recent IPV contribute newevidence to the imperative that providers treating women with headaches beaware of recent physical abuse in their patient populations. Clinicians practic-ing in dedicated headache treatment settings may have a unique opportunityto address abuse history (Schulman, 2010). Future work examining interventions for abused women with headache would be an important contribution to improving care for this patient popu-lation that is often treated not only by neurologists but primary care cliniciansworking in women's health. The strong association between headache sever- ity and PTSD presents a potential multi-disciplinary treatment path where traditional headache treatment is augmented with empirically supported Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:53 11 July 2012 466 M. R. Gerber et al. treatments for PTSD, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Informed by understanding that PTSD and chronic pain are linked, researchers havedemonstrated that integrated treatment is benecial for participants withthese co-morbidities (Otis et al., 2009; Shipherd et al., 2003). Even effec-tive treatment of PTSD alone may be helpful in improving chronic pain (Otiset al., 2003), suggesting that future intervention studies in populations withsevere and chronic headaches could yield similar benet.

However, because screening is not cost-saving, its financial feasibility must be understood. Study Objectives\u2014 We forecast the costs of two Emergency Department-based HIV testing programs in the Veterans Administration: 1) implementing a non-targeted screening program and providing treatment for all patients thusly identified (Rapid Testing); and 2) treating patients identified due to late-stage symptoms (Usual Care); to determine which program was the most financially feasible. Methods\u2014 Using a dynamic decision-analysis model, we estimated the financial impact of each program over a 7-year period. Costs were driven by patient disease-severity at diagnosis, measured by CD4+ category, and the proportion of patients in each disease-severity category. Cost per CD4+ category was modeled from chart review and database analysis of treatment-na\u00efve HIV- positive patients. Distributions of CD4+ counts differed in patients across the Rapid Testing and Usual Care arms. Results\u2014 A non-targeted Rapid Testing program was not significantly more costly than Usual Care. Although Rapid Testing had substantial screening costs, they were offset by lower inpatient expenses associated with earlier identification of disease. Assuming an HIV prevalence of 1% and 80% test acceptance, the cost of Rapid Testing was $1,418,088, vs. $1,320,338 for Usual Care ( p = 0.5854). Results support implementation of non-targeted rapid HIV screening in integrated systems. Conclusions: This analysis adds a new component of support for HIV screening by demonstrating that rapid, non-targeted testing does not cost significantly more than a diagnostic testing approach.

Published in final edited form as: J Emerg Med . 2012 June ; screening; budget impact; Rapid Testing; Emergency Department INTRODUCTION It is estimated that there are 1-1.2 million people living in the United States with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), with 21% of them unaware of their disease status (1,2). Many HIV-positive persons are identified only when they develop symptoms, indicating that they are severely immunosuppressed and less likely to respond optimally to antiretroviral therapy. Screening programs that diagnose patients early and offer them treatment can therefore substantially improve health outcomes (3). Recently, four separate analyses have indicated that HIV screening is cost-effective from a societal perspective compared to no screening and compared to current practice, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Physicians to encourage routine HIV screening as a part of normal medical practice (4-9). However, although HIV screening has been found to be cost-effective, it is not cost-saving. Therefore, even though HIV screening is economically justifiable, it may not be a financially viable option for an organization. A Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) can provide information about the financial feasibility of a program by examining the economic value of the health investment and the resources needed for its implementation (10). This study examines the budget impact of implementing a new HIV testing program in a Veterans Health Administration (VA) Emergency Department (ED) vs. the financial impact of following standard care. The standard care program examined is Usual Care, which in the ED setting involves blood-based diagnostic testing, or testing a patient when (s)he presents with symptoms suggestive of HIV/AIDS. The new program examined is Rapid Testing, or offering an HIV test to any previously untested patient in the ED, regardless of risk factors or symptoms (non-targeted testing). The rapid test in question is the OraQuick Advance HIV-1/2 Oral Specimen Collection Device (OraSure Technologies, Bethlehem, PA), a Food and Drug Administration-approved point-of-care test. Of particular interest for ED settings, the results of HIV rapid tests are available within 1 h, compared to the 24-48 h turnaround for blood-based testing. This analysis estimates the number of people who would be identified as disease-positive through Rapid Testing at various levels of program intensity and HIV prevalence rates. The model forecasts treatment costs for patients in the Rapid Test program and compares them to the expenses incurred by these same patients were they to be identified at later stages of disease through Usual Care. The program with the lowest overall costs, both in terms of implementation costs and cost offsets, represents the most economically-efficient strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We built a first-order stochastic decision-analysis model to determine the costs of treating a hypothetical cohort of patients identified due to a Rapid Testing screening program vs. costs of treating this same cohort of patients were they identified due to symptoms of disease (Usual Care). Cohort size indicates the number of HIV-positive persons identified by the screening programs in the ED. The ED was chosen as the screening site due to its ability to access an otherwise difficult-to-reach population and its predicted higher prevalence of HIV infection compared to primary care locations (11,12). This analysis used cost and economic data from an urban VA ED and Infectious Disease clinic located in a major metropolitanGidwani et al. Page 2 J Emerg Med . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 June 19. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptarea. The VA was chosen due to the extensive data available from its cost databases and electronic medical records. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the VA system. Due to the fact that the VA generally keeps patients for life, this analysis assumed all patients would be identified at some point in the system due to their symptoms. Therefore, sizes for the Rapid Test and Usual Care cohorts were identical. We modeled a variety of cohort sizes to reflect uncertainty in the number of patients offered testing, the percentage of patients accepting testing, and the prevalence of HIV (Table 1). This analysis evaluated the financial impact of three different offer rates: five per business day, 10 per business day, or universal. The former two rates were used to reflect realistic levels of testing that can occur in environments with existing capacity constraints; the latter was used in accordance with CDC recommendations. The model assumes HIV prevalence is independent of test acceptance. Costs of Rapid Testing include both program implementation and treatment of disease. Costs of Usual Care include disease-treatment costs only, but health care utilization is more intensive in this population due to late identification of disease. Treatment costs were calculated for the following budgets: inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and global (where global indicates the sum of the former three sub-budgets). All treatment costs were assumed to be dependent upon disease severity at diagnosis (measured by CD4+ count). Disease severity was noted by the following four categories: CD4+ < 50, CD4+ 50-199, CD4+ 200- 350, > 350 cells/mm3 at diagnosis (where low CD4+ values indicate higher disease severity). Costs were projected over a time horizon of 7 years. A horizon of 7 years is longer than usual for BIAs; however, we felt this longer horizon was necessary to capture the delay between when patients are diagnosed through screening and when they begin accruing costs of treatment. Treatment cost was a function of cost per disease-severity category and the proportion of cohort members in each disease-severity category. Estimated costs were calculated on an annual basis for each budget using 2007 dollars. The following equation was used to model the total estimated costs of treating disease: Where: Cj is the average cost per case in sub-budget category j i is the disease-severity category (CD4+) assigned at time of diagnosis t is the year in which costs are accrued C is the average cost per case of disease N is the number of people Cost per disease-severity category was determined by examining utilization patterns of HIV- positive patients and allocating VA-specific direct medical cost values to this utilization. VA-specific costs were used, following best practice recommendations for conducting BIAs. (10). Utilization data came from chart review of all treatment-na\u00efve patients diagnosed and treated at this site from Fiscal Year (FY) 2000 to FY 2007 (n = 112). Although this number is small, the analysis required the use of these actual data, due to the dearth of literature available on treatment-na\u00efve patients and the fact that data from treatment-experiencedGidwani et al. Page 3 J Emerg Med . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 June 19. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptpatients would substantially overestimate treatment costs. Modeling HIV-related utilization over time also poses significant difficulties, given that drug treatment efficacy decreases over time, is influenced by patient adherence, and that the relationship between adherence and consequences of much highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) is not fully understood (13). For example, partial adherence increases the risk of drug resistance more so than complete non-adherence (13). Only HIV-related utilization was included in the model. All inpatient stays with HIV as a primary or secondary diagnosis were reviewed by two infectious disease physicians who had treated the majority of these patients; only those inpatient stays unanimously deemed to be due to HIV were included in this analysis. Once the cost per disease-severity category was calculated, we populated the model with the program-specific CD4+ distributions. As Usual Care patients are diagnosed at later, more advanced stages of disease than are patients identified through Rapid Testing, the disease- severity distributions differed across the programs; a larger proportion of Usual Case patients had lower CD4+ counts at diagnosis. The CD4+ distribution for the Usual Care program was determined using patients from the national Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Virtual Cohort, which contains clinical data on all HIV-infected veterans in the country (14). Disease severity at diagnosis was obtained for VACS Virtual Cohort members who had ED visits in a VA facility before their HIV diagnosis (n = 3355), which represents the Usual Care patients in this model. We used a back-calculation scheme to determine the CD4+ distribution for the Rapid Testing program. Annual CD4+ decline in the absence of treatment can be estimated by the following equation: CD4+^\u00bd = .0584 - 0.918 [log(vRNA/1000)] (15). Entering patients' viral load at diagnosis, CD4+ count at diagnosis, as well as the length of time elapsed between first ED visit and HIV diagnosis into the equation yields an estimate of patients' CD4+ count had they been diagnosed with HIV at the time of first ED visit (a Rapid Testing approach). For example, a patient presenting 2 years after his first ED visit with an initial CD4 count of 150 cells/mm3 and viral load of 100,000 copies would be back-calculated to have had a CD4 of 292 cells/mm3 had he been diagnosed at the time of initial ED visit (Table 2). As identified HIV-positive patients, persons in the Rapid Testing arm begin accruing treatment costs immediately. However, it takes some time for Usual Care patients to display symptoms of disease, be diagnosed, and therefore start incurring treatment costs. Data from the VACS Virtual Cohort indicate a mean 1.25-year delay between the first ED visit and diagnosis of HIV. All estimated costs in the Usual Care program were adjusted back 1.25 years to reflect this delay to diagnosis. Over the entire analysis, the Rapid Test program therefore had 7 years of data, whereas the Usual Care program had 5.75 years of data. In the outpatient and pharmacy models, cost values associated with the Usual Care and Rapid Test programs were identical. The model assumed drug costs and office visits were not driven by method of HIV diagnosis, but simply by the severity of patient illness. However, cost values for the inpatient and thus global models differed across the Usual Care and Rapid Testing programs; inpatient utilization, and cost, was dependent upon whether a patient was diagnosed through Rapid Testing or Usual Care. Inpatient stays within 3 months of HIV diagnosis were excluded from the Rapid Testing costs. These hospitalizations represent patients who were diagnosed due to opportunistic infections; their exclusion was more indicative of the clinical scenario of Rapid Testing patients, who are not diagnosed due to opportunistic infections and therefore would not have experienced such inpatient stays.Gidwani et al. Page 4 J Emerg Med . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 June 19. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptOnce the model was populated with the cost per CD4+ category and the distributions of CD4+ counts, we ran the analysis and employed statistical techniques to mitigate the noise associated with small samples. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (with 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations) were run to gain a more accurate estimate of cost per CD4+ category, with each iteration randomly sampling from each distribution of cost per CD4+ category. This re- sampling increases the likelihood that outlier cost inputs would not have an undue influence on cost estimates. Model analyses were conducted using TreeAge Pro 2008 software (TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown MA). Usual Care program costs were directly obtained from model results. Rapid Testing program costs were obtained by adding program implementation costs to model results. Implementation costs were determined by micro-cost estimates of resources used in offering and conducting HIV tests, including testing kits and labor. Time-and-motion data were obtained by direct observation of HIV rapid testing in the ED. An applied rate of 85% was used for all salary calculations. Two-tailed t-tests of significance were run on the total costs of each program to determine if the overall 7-year global costs of the Rapid Test program were significantly different from the Usual Care program. Tests of significance were run using STATA version 9.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). To summarize, the following assumptions were made in conducting these analyses: 1.Patients can be properly stratified into four CD4+ count categories. 2.All health care utilization, and therefore cost, is contingent upon CD4+ count at diagnosis. 3.Utilization patterns of patients identified through these programs can be modeled using utilization data from past HIV-positive patients treated at the same location. 4.All persons diagnosed are immediately linked to treatment. 5.All patients identified by Rapid Test would be diagnosed an average of 1.25 years later in the Usual Care program. RESULTS At all test offer rates and cohort sizes, there is no significant difference in total 7-year estimated costs of the Rapid Test and Usual Care programs (Table 3). At lower cohort sizes, the Rapid Test program is more costly than the Usual Care program, across all offer rates. As cohort size increases, there is a threshold at which Rapid Testing becomes less costly than Usual Care. The threshold is not consistent across offer rates due to the inclusion of implementation costs, which do not increase linearly with cohort size. Implementation costs are responsible for the higher Rapid Testing costs at lower cohort sizes, as the organization is spending money in screening many patients but finding few who are HIV-positive. At lower cohort sizes, treatment costs are smaller; implementation costs thus represent a large percentage of overall costs. As cohort size\u2014or number of patients identified as HIV-positive\u2014increases, treatment costs increase substantially, whereas implementation costs increase only slightly. This is due to the fact that implementation costs are driven by test acceptance rates, whereas cohort size is substantially driven by disease prevalence. Hence, at large cohort sizes, when treatment costs are substantial in relation to implementation costs, Usual Care becomes the more costly program. Estimated costs for the Rapid Testing program differ across the same cohort size for the same reason. For example, the overall Rapid Testing costs for a cohort of size 11 may be $464,529 or $485,701 or $561,386. The reason for this discrepancy is implementation costs; the cost of offering tests to 10 patients in the ED is higher than the cost of offering HIV tests to 5 ED patients.Gidwani et al. Page 5 J Emerg Med . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 June 19. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptAn examination of the relative cost components of each program reveals that the higher cost for Usual Care patients is largely due to more inpatient stays, reflecting more hospitalizations for these patients due to opportunistic infections (Table 4). Outpatient costs represent approximately one-fifth of costs for both programs, whereas pharmacy comprises the greatest percentage of costs for both programs. However, total pharmacy costs are lower for the Usual Care program, due to the fewer years of cost data. As noted previously, the Usual Care program had no implementation costs, and only 5.75 years of data. This biases the cost estimates in its favor, as implementation costs for the Rapid Testing program range from $18,211 to $141,002. As statistical tests revealed no significant difference in the overall costs of the two programs, this suggests that once Usual Care patients are identified, their costs are higher than those for Rapid Test patients. Estimates of cost per capita reveal global costs per Usual Care patient to be $7237 annually vs. $5836 annually per Rapid Test patients. DISCUSSION Results indicate that over a 7-year period, an HIV screening program using a Rapid Testing approach is financially equivalent to following a Usual Care approach within the VA system. Given that early detection of HIV and linkage to treatment is also associated with better health outcomes, this analysis provides support for the implementation of a non- targeted oral Rapid Testing program. Inpatient costs were substantially lower for Rapid Testing patients, offsetting the costs of implementing screening, and resulting in similar costs for the two HIV testing programs. Patients in the Usual Care program had higher inpatient costs, due to the fact that many of them were hospitalized for opportunistic infections (OIs). When modeling utilization of the Rapid Testing cohort, we excluded any hospitalization occurring within 3 months of HIV diagnosis. The model's exclusion of these inpatient costs for the Rapid Testing patients is partly responsible for the lower inpatient costs for this program. This exclusion was warranted, as we sought to quantify the marginal cost of implementing a non-targeted HIV Rapid Testing program. Including the inpatient costs of patients who were diagnosed due to hospitalization from OIs would misrepresent the clinical scenario of Rapid Testing patients, as patients who have acute OIs would have been diagnosed by Usual Care regardless of whether a Rapid Testing program was in place. This analysis provides support for a non-targeted screening-based program. Although the initial investment of such a screening program may be as high as $141,000, the smaller treatment costs of patients identified at lower disease-severity offset the initial financial impact. This observation is crucial, as data from the VA and other health care systems indicate that targeted (risk-based) testing fails to capture a significant portion of the HIV- positive population (13,16). This analysis also provides support for rapid testing. Although costs of rapid tests are higher than conventional assays, oral rapid tests are particularly attractive for use in ED settings due to higher patient acceptance rates and virtually immediate turnaround (5). Short turnaround increases the likelihood that patients will receive tests results, which is especially important in an ED-using population, where continuity of care can be problematic and many patients have difficulties returning for test results. Studies indicate that 21-30% of patients testing positive and 25-39% of patients testing negative for HIV do not return for the results of their tests (17,18). This analysis used clinical and economic data from the VA. The advantage of using VA- specific data is that the VA is a non-profit, non-revenue-generating organization, whichGidwani et al. Page 6 J Emerg Med . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 June 19. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptensures that financial data used represent actual costs, rather than profit or cost-shifting from uncompensated care. Use of actual data, rather than projections, serves to more accurately demonstrate the relationship between a program and its clinical and economic effects. Therefore, the results shown here are more indicative of the true cost of screening. Furthermore, this analysis demonstrates that the initial costs of ED-based screening are offset by lower inpatient utilization\u2014data that are applicable to any integrated health system. Such results can guide other integrated systems in providing support for HIV screening in high-prevalence locations (defined as 0.5% or greater). Limitations The major limitation of this analysis lies in the small sample size used to determine utilization and estimate costs. This analysis had a sample size of 112, divided up into four disease-severity categories. First-order probabilistic sensitivity analyses were employed to gain more accurate estimates of the means with a small sample, but could not mitigate variation around the mean. Variation in inputs results in large confidence intervals, therefore increasing the likelihood of non-significance. However, there were also important benefits from using these actual data. First, use of actual data takes into account the various drug (and therefore cost) combinations of HAART therapy, as well as the cost of modifying HAART therapy over time. Second, it better captures the relationship between patient drug use and hospitalization than modeling practices. Use of actual clinical data also takes into account that although all HIV-positive patients are referred to care, some did not actually enter care or cycled in and out of the system, and that rates of adherence to care vary considerably. Lastly, use of actual clinical data captures true physician practice patterns; using clinical practice guidelines to model care does not take into account physician deviation from these guidelines. Use of actual cost data, rather than charges or billing data, provides a more accurate indication of the real economic impact of each program. In a clinical setting, it is likely that some patients would be lost to follow-up and not initiate treatment. However, this model assumed that all patients diagnosed were linked to treatment, as we believed that an organization should be prepared to allocate enough funding to a program such that all patients can be offered proper care for their disease. This analysis was conducted using data from the VA system, which may limit generalizability of cost results to other settings. However, perhaps even more important than producing actual cost estimates, this analysis demonstrates the relationship between non- targeted screening and usual care\u2014and provides evidence that a non-targeted screening program does not pose a significant cost burden to the organization. These findings are of use for decision-makers in any integrated system. Treatment patterns for HIV may have changed over time, raising the issue of the appropriateness of using past data to model future utilization. Although new drugs may have come to market from FY 2000 to FY 2007, analyses of these data indicate that annual pharmacy costs have not changed over time. Inpatient costs have also not changed significantly, suggesting that even if drug therapy has altered, neither its costs nor its effect on inpatient utilization have been modified. Therefore, using past utilization data to inform this model was appropriate. CONCLUSION This article demonstrates the practical, real-world effect of implementing evidence-based policies, and adds a new component of support for HIV screening, by demonstrating that anGidwani et al.

Early identication, as- sessment, treatment, and when indicated, refer-ral to specialty care, of patients with unhealthy substance use can be challenging for both ex- perienced health care providers as well as forhealth professional students and trainees. Theclinical procedures of screening for unhealthy substance use, providing brief interventions to reduce unhealthy substance use, and referring fortreatment patients in need of specialty treatment are evidence-based practices that are being pro- moted by research, policy, and service organiza-tions in the United States. Despite this national movement, few health professional schools and programs have formal screening, brief inter-vention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) cur-ricula (1). This special issue is an early ef- fort to describe and examine the outcomes of teaching SBIRT to health professionals andtrainees. Use of alcohol and illicit substances con- tributes to signicant morbidity and mortality.Substance use has deleterious effects on com- mon medical conditions (2-5), including di- abetes mellitus, hypertension, sleep disorders,depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease, and osteoporosis (6-10). Moreover, un-healthy substance use increases risky behaviors, reduces access to preventive health care, reduces compliance with prescribed medical treatment,and adversely affects housing and employment (11-14). According to the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, of the almost 21 mil-lion people who needed treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use but did not receive it in 2008, 94% did not feel they needed treatment (15).The addiction specialist treatment system is notappropriate for all persons who have unhealthy alcohol use, or perhaps occasional substance use, nor can that system alone address the needs ofall persons diagnosed with alcohol or substance use disorders. Other treatment modalities in a variety of clinical settings are needed. SBIRT is an integrated, comprehensive, pub- lic health approach to addressing the full spec- trum of unhealthy substance use in generalhealth care settings. The core components ofSBIRT include (1) screening\u2014a strategy of early identication and assessment of individuals with unhealthy substance use through interview orself report; (2) brief intervention\u2014a counseling approach that is focused on raising an individ- ual's awareness of his or her unhealthy substanceuse and motivating that individual to a positive behavior change; and (3) referral to treatment\u2014a proactive process that facilitates access to spe-cialty addiction for individuals with substanceuse disorders. Downloaded by [Boston University] at 10:33 29 June 2012 228 SUBSTANCE ABUSE In research studies, SBIRT for unhealthy al- cohol use has demonstrated effectiveness, ef- ciency, and cost-effectiveness (16, 17). There is growing evidence for SBIRT for unhealthydrug use (18). Validated \"single-item\" screeningquestions make early identication of unhealthy substance use in busy general health care settings feasible (19, 20). Furthermore, models of imple-mentation have been demonstrated for SBIRT in wide variety of general health care settings (21). SBIRT seems also to improve care coordinationbetween general health care and specialty ad- diction services (22, 23). Yet despite evidence for the effectiveness of SBIRT, implementationof SBIRT into clinical settings has been slow(24, 25). An emerging body of literature aims to improve diffusion and application of SBIRT (26, 27). These guides promote interdisciplinarySBIRT planning and implementation teams, and additional calls have been made for the involve- ment of other health care professionals in SBIRTpractices (28-30). Although the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Ofceof National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), theUnited States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), Institute of Medicine (IOM), and the Committee on Trauma of the American Collegeof Surgeons (ACS) have promoted widespread SBIRT implementation, a variety of provider-, system-, and patient-level barriers to SBIRTdelivery exist. These barriers include concerns about (1) lack of time and training for per- forming SBIRT, (2) perception or presence ofmore compelling clinical issues, (3) underuti-lization or lack of awareness of effective screen- ing and treatment strategies, and (4) concerns about patient privacy and potential damage tothe patient-provider relationship (31, 32). Addi- tionally, providers may perceive that SBIRT for unhealthy substance use is simply ineffective,unsatisfying, uncomfortable, or not within their role responsibilities (26, 27). SBIRT skills have been proposed as an ad- diction medicine core competency in generalistphysician training (33). Recognizing the urgent need to train general health care providers in SBIRT, in 2008, the Substance Abuse and Men-tal Health Services Administration, Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (SAMHSA/CSAT)funded eleven 5-year SBIRT Medical Resi- dency Program (SMRP) cooperative agreements to develop and implement training programs to \"teach medical residents the skills to pro-vide evidence-based SBIRT for patients whohave, or are at risk for a substance use disorder [and] promote adoption of SBIRT through de- livery of training to local and statewide medicalcommunities for wider dissemination of SBIRT practices\" (34). Recognizing the critical need to disseminate curricular innovations regarding SBIRT train- ing and evaluate the evidence of positive effects of SBIRT curricula on the learner- and patient-level outcomes, in January 2011, the Associa-tion of Medical Education and Research on Sub- stance Abuse (AMERSA) led a call for papers of a special issue of the Substance Abuse jour- nal. The special issue editors sought descrip- tions and evaluations of SBIRT curricula and training at health professional schools and res-idency and fellowship training programs, and targeting practicing health care professionals. Manuscripts describing innovative means to de- velop ,implement ,a n d evaluate SBIRT curric- ula were particularly sought. This special is- sue, \"Screening and Brief Intervention for Sub- stance Abuse,\" is the product of that call. InSeptember 2011, we accepted 14 papers\u20144 full- length papers and 10 brief reports of curricular innovation\u2014for publication. The work contained in this special issue ex- emplies early efforts to train health care profes- sionals and their trainees in SBIRT skills. Skillprociency of the learners in clinical practice isdifcult to assess. Infusing SBIRT into academic curriculum can be challenging: the teachers of the curriculum often must be taught and makingtime for SBIRT knowledge and skill transfers may be difcult in the ever present setting of multiple competing curricular priorities. Pivotalquestions such as who, when, and how to teach SBIRT to health care professionals need to be an- swered. For many of the educational projects de-scribed in this special issue, comprehensive out-come data have yet to be obtained. We will likely need to wait years to gain a full understanding of the effectiveness of various SBIRT curric-ula and training methods on changing health care providers' clinical practice.

However, there is consider- able debate about how liver biopsy should best be used, espe-cially with the advent of more efcacious antiviral therapies. To identify the factors that influence the use of liver biopsy for HCV patients, we describe variations in liver biopsy use at the delivery system and patient level in a national VA sample. Methods : We analyzed VA HCV registry data for 171,893 VA patients with conrmed chronic HCV. Delivery system character- istics included geographic region and specialist time. Patient characteristics included antiviral treatment indicators, contrain- dications, volume of healthcare visits, and demographic variables. Logistic regression was used to explore correlates of biopsy use. Results : Liver biopsy use in the VA system increased from 1997 to 2003 but began declining in 2004. Rates of liver biopsy from 2004 to 2006 varied by VA region, ranging from 5% to 18%. Treat- ment contraindications and laboratory tests were signicantly associated with more biopsies. Demographic variables (higher age, lower BMI, race/ethnicity, and less% service connected dis- ability) were associated with fewer biopsies. Regional variability remained signicant independent of volume of care and special- ist time. Conclusions : Liver biopsy rates in the VA system have variability that seems unrelated to clinical need. New antiviral therapies and non-invasive assessment techniques may create additional uncertainty for the role of liver biopsy, perhaps explaining its decline in recent years. The availability of more effective antiviral therapies may also affect biopsy rates in the future. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of the European Association for the Study of the Liver.Introduction Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects about 1.8% of the US population, [1]with higher rates in the VA patient population [2], and often leading to severe medical consequences [3-5] . Liver complica- tions may be avoided with effective antiviral treatment. Antiviral treatment eliminated the virus in 40-50% of patients [6,7] until the recent availability of new therapies that have cure rates of 65-73% for genotype 1 patients in clinical trials [8,9] . Although liver biopsy is used for a variety of purposes, the most common usage is for the assessment of liver damage to assist with antivi- ral treatment decisions. Liver biopsy is the recommended method for assessing liver damage resulting from chronic HCV infection. Both the VA [10] and NIH recommend its use for evaluating and making treatment decisions for most HCV patients (genotype 1). Additionally, the American Association of Liver Disease guidelines state that liver biopsy should be performed ''when the results will influence antiviral treatment recommendations'' [11,12] . Despite established recommendations, other factors such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation may influence biopsy rates. Some studies purport that HCV-infected persons with nor- mal ALT levels have less liver damage than those with abnormal ALT levels [13], and that liver biopsy may be of little value for those with normal ALT [14]. Others believe all patients, regard- less of ALT level, should be biopsied [15]. Relative contraindications to antiviral treatment such as depression or substance abuse can impact biopsy rates. Biopsymay only be considered for good treatment candidates. Con- versely, biopsy results could be used to motivate lifestyle change to produce better treatment candidates. The literature on varia- tion of health procedures in other conditions would suggest that non-clinical factors like race/ethnicity or geography may be another factor [16,17] . More recently, less invasive methods of liver brosis assess- ment have received considerable attention. A recent review of non-invasive methods concluded that non-invasive methods can- not match the information obtained from a biopsy [18]. Others have suggested that liver biopsy should only be recommended as a secondary test, due to the utility of biochemical marker tests [19].

Address: VA San Diego Healthcare System, 3550 La Jolla Village Drive, Mail Code 111 N-1 San Diego, CA ArticleEmerging HCV treatment options likely add to uncertainty about the utility of liver biopsy. New antiviral treatment may almost double sustained virologic response rates while shorten- ing treatment duration [9,20,21] . With these improvements, liver biopsy may play a lesser role in treatment decision making. Thus, there may be signicant variability in how liver biopsy is used at different locations. In a recent clinician poll, substantial variability was found in recommendations for a hypothetical HCV patient. Of 3216 health professionals from 115 countries, 44% voted to perform a liver biopsy, 34% voted for expectant manage- ment with periodic assessment of liver function, and 22% voted to initiate HCV therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin [22]. Thus, despite the recommendations of expert bodies, the optimal use of liver biopsy in HCV-infected patients remains unclear. Our study objective was to examine clinical and patient char- acteristics associated with variability of liver biopsy use for HCV- infected patients in VA Healthcare System. Patients and methods Design The study was a retrospective, large database analysis using data from the VA Hepatitis C Clinical Case Registry from 1997 to 2006. Data analyses were con-ducted and rened from 2009 to 2011. Data analyzed for the study includedpatient demographics, outpatient visits, inpatient services, procedure codes, lab-oratory results, diagnosis codes, and problem lists. IRB approval and informed consent waiver were obtained. Setting and sample Research consisted only of retrospective database analyses. The original sample consisted of 304,024 VA patients who had been entered into the VA Hepatitis CRegistry under unique patient identiers from 1997 to 2006. Of those patients,266,866 had evidence of either HCV antibody or conrmation testing. A subsetof those, 171,893 patients, had clear evidence of a positive conrmatory test forchronic hepatitis C infection. Conrmed HCV positive was dened as any positiveresult from genotype, qualitative RNA and quantitative RNA. If a subject is HCV+in a study year, the subject is HCV+ after this study year. We used all available data (10 years) when examining the frequency of liver biopsies performed over time. To examine correlates and variability of liverbiopsy use, we focused on the three most recent years of data (2004-2006) asmost representative of current practice. ''Receiving VA care'' was dened as hav-ing one or more recorded inpatient or outpatient visits during this time period.This resulted in a sample size of 136,269 subjects who were conrmed to havechronic HCV infection and received VA care for chronic HCV from 2004 to2006. Subjects with liver biopsies in any prior year or who died before 7/1/ 2004 were excluded. Procedures The initial data set included all VA patients with a positive HCV test. Since many patients with positive antibody tests clear the virus on their own, the rst step wasto limit our sample to patients that had tested positive on an HCV conrmationtest. Conrmatory testing was dened as a positive result on either a qualitativeor quantitative HCV RNA test, or a positive HCV genotype test. Conrmatory testswith 76 different name variations were classied into one of the three types ofconrmatory tests. Next, to reduce the chance of including test results that were labeled incorrectly, test result values were examined to ensure consistency with the type of test (qualitative test - yes/no answers, quantitative tests - numericalvalues within range, genotype tests - ranging from 1 to 6). Approximately 5% ofthe results were indeterminable or ambiguous and could not be used for analysis. We dened receipt of liver biopsy as presence of the following codes in the outpatient or inpatient data les (50.11 - Closed Liver Biopsy, 50.12 47001 - Needle Biopsy, Liver Add On, 47100 - Wedge Biopsy of Liver).We then examined the variables associated with receipt of a liver biopsy. To identify predictors of liver biopsy, we began with a list of possible contraindicationsfor antiviral treatment developed by Kanwal et al. for VA patients with HCV [23]. Possible contraindications were determined by ICD-9 codes and not actual treat- ment decisions. Because the goals of our study differed from the study cited, mod-ications were made to the coding of these contraindications. One modication wasto differentiate current substance use and psychiatric disorders from long-term dis-orders because long-term or permanent disorders may not be a current problem orcontraindication by themselves, but may be related to biopsy rates. A substance useor psychiatric disorder was considered ''current'' if any inpatient or outpatient visits between 2003 and 2006 had substance use or psychiatric ICD 9 codes. Substance use or psychiatric disorders that appeared on the medical record ''problem list'', butwere not linked to visits between 2003 and 2006, were considered long-term. A sec-ond modication from the reference manuscript [23] was that laboratory data was not used in the algorithms for dening the presence of co-morbid conditions as con-traindications. Laboratory variables were examined directly as independent corre-lates of receipt of liver biopsy ( Table 1 ). Demographic variables were recoded into the categories indicated in Table 3 . Regional variation was examined using the 21 regions of the national VA health- care system. To examine the effect of specialist time on biopsy frequency, weobtained data from the 2007 Survey to Assess Hepatitis C Care in VHA conductedby the VA Public Health Strategic Health Care Group. Responses from 141 ''leadHCV clinicians'' at VHA facilities indicated the ''Number of weekly \u00bd days clinicscovered'' by 13 different types of healthcare providers. To account for differencesin the number of patients served by each region, we divided the average numberof \u00bd day clinics for hepatologists and gastroenterologists in each region by the number of HCV patients from that region. Statistical analyses We present raw numbers of biopsies over time and proportion of patients in the database who were biopsied each year between 1997 and 2006. We focused onraw numbers instead of the proportion because many new patients were addedto the registry each year, making the proportion drop each year while the numberof biopsies being conducted was increasing. To examine geographical variability,descriptive statistics and Chi-square analysis were used to describe and examinedifferences in the proportion of patients biopsied at each of the 21 VA healthcare regions between 2004 and 2006. We limited the analysis of regional variation to the most recent years to best represent current utilization. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the effect of patient demographic and clinical characteristics, and geographic regions on the receiptof liver biopsy in HCV-infected patients. Because liver biopsy may be used for dif-ferent reasons among distinct subgroups within our sample, we identied threepatient subgroups (liver transplant, cirrhosis prior to biopsy, and those withouttransplant or cirrhosis prior to biopsy). Our nal model ( Table 3 ) focuses on HCV-infected patients without cirrhosis or liver transplant, representing over 90% of the sample. Independent variables were rst examined in bivariate analyses with pres- ence of liver biopsy between 2004 and 2006 as the dependent variable. Variableswith p-value <0.15 in bivariate analyses were included as predictors in multivar- iate logistic regression. Variables were entered into the nal model in the follow-ing order: contraindications, labs, demographics and other variables (specialisttime, geographic region). Stepwise backward model selection for main effects in the nal model was performed. Variables for the initial model were selected using Akaike's Information Criterion. Then the variable with the largest p-value was removed from the model until all variables included in the model with p-val- ues <0.05 were examined. Non-parametric rank sum tests conrmed that special-ist time differed by geographic region. Analyses were performed with SAS(version 9.1) and the open source statistical package R (version 2.8.1). Results Rates of liver biopsy and patient characteristics The raw number of liver biopsies conducted in the VA system nationally in 1997 was only 475. This number grew quickly in subsequent years and peaked at 4758 in 2004 before declining slightly in 2005 and 2006 ( Fig. 1 ). As an overall proportion for the study period of 1997-2006, 16.7% (28,677 of 171,893) of VA patients with conrmed HCV infection received a biopsy. JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY Journal of Hepatology 2012 vol. 57 j252-259 253However, many of these individuals may have had contraindica- tions for antiviral treatment, reducing the need for biopsy. Clini- cal and socio-demographic characteristics of the sample from 2004 to 2006 were compared for patients who did and did not receive a liver biopsy ( Table 2 ). Given the large sample size, almost all variables were signicantly different at the p<0.001 level. Geographical variability in biopsy rates To study geographical variability, we examined the proportion of HCV-infected patients who were biopsied by region from 2004 to 2006. The overall rate of biopsy among HCV patients in care from 2004 to 2006 was 9.3%. Overall data include many patients who had likely not been biopsied for specic reasons or refused (Fig. 2 ). When broken down by clinical subgroup, rates were 19.9% among liver transplant recipients (0.8% of the sample), 9.8% among HCV patients with cirrhosis (9.1% of the sample), and 9.2% among those without transplant or cirrhosis (90.1% of the sample). In initial models, patients with transplant (OR 3.29, <0.001) and cirrhosis prior to biopsy (OR 1.20, <0.001) were signicantly more likely to be biopsied.There was signicant variation in the rates of liver biopsy across the 21 VA regions. While 17.8% of HCV patients in region U received a liver biopsy between 2004 and 2006, biopsy rates in regions G, H, and P were much lower, in the range of 5-7% (p<0.001). Removing all patients with a potential contraindica- tion, increased the proportion of patients biopsied from 9.4% to 12.1% during that period. Regions B and U biopsied over 21% of patients without contraindications during this period while other regions were as low as 6.6%. Factors associated with receipt of liver biopsy Most contraindications were signicantly associated with lower rates of liver biopsy in the nal model. Recent organ transplant and advanced liver disease were signicantly associated with higher rates of liver biopsy ( Table 2 ). As expected, genotype 2 and 3 patients were less likely than genotype 1 patients to receive a biopsy. Patients who had been tested for hepatitis A or B were more likely to be biopsied. HIV infection was not signicantly associated with liver biopsy. Liver biopsy rates decreased slightly with each year of age, and increased slightly with increasing BMI and service connectionTable 1.

Research Article 254 Journal of Hepatology 2012 vol. 57 j252-259percentage. When compared with non-Hispanic Whites, Hispan- ics, African-Americans, and patients of Other/Unknown race/eth- nicity were signicantly less likely to receive a biopsy. In the next regression step, hepatologist and gastroenterolo- gist specialist times were initially associated with more biopsies, but became non-signicant when the mean number of healthcare visits (associated more liver biopsies) was entered into the anal- ysis. Finally, the 21 categories of geographic VA region were entered while controlling for other variables in the model. Spe- cialist time remained signicant after geographic region was entered, indicating independent effects. With region A's biopsy rate of 13% as the reference group, only regions B, E, F, and M, were not signicantly different. Fourteen regions had signi- cantly lower biopsy rates while subject two regions (O, U) had higher rates. To examine the univariate connection between liver biopsy rates and antiviral treatment rates, we examined correlation of the two rates by geographic regions. A signicant correlation was found between liver biopsy rates and HCV antiviral treat- ment rates (r(21) = 0.46, p= 0.036). Discussion The burden of chronic hepatitis C continues to grow in the US, especially for the VA healthcare system, which treats more HCV-infected individuals than any other system. Liver biopsy has long been the gold standard for assessing the severity of liver damage among HCV-infected patients, and it is recommended for the evaluation of all HCV patients with genotype 1 virus [10], who comprise about 70% of all cases in the US. Despite these rec- ommendations, our results indicate that only about 17% of all HCV-infected patients receiving care in the VA system had been biopsied. There are a number of plausible clinical and policy-related reasons that doctors and patients may choose to forgo biopsy. One common reason is that the majority of VA patients are not immediate candidates for antiviral medications because of rela- tive contraindications, most commonly substance use and psy- chological disorders [24]. Because liver biopsy can have side effects, result in complications, and consume healthcare resources, the benets of a biopsy may or may not outweigh the ''costs'' when being considered by healthcare providers and their patients. In addition, motivated candidates for antiviral therapy may decide to start therapy regardless of the additional prognostic information they might get from biopsy, and thus might forgo it.In our large national sample, liver biopsy use increased between 1997 and 2004 but began to decline in 2005 and 2006, despite the growing cumulative number of VA patients who have been conrmed with chronic HCV. Although the cumu- lative number of unbiopsied patients was increasing during the studied time period, these patients may have decided in conjunc- tion with their providers to not get biopsied, so a majority of the most appropriate candidates for biopsy may have already received one. As laboratory and other non-invasive assessments of liver brosis become more accurate [25] and are recommended liver disease guidelines [26], some reduction in the need for liver biopsy may be expected [27]. Other possible factors that may influence the consistency of liver biopsy use in the VA Healthcare system include: (a) the emergence of less invasive techniques for assessing liver damage (b) the belief that all HCV patients should be treated; and (c) the ongoing development of new antiviral medications with fewer side effects and high SVR rates. An interesting nding among analyses exploring predictors of biopsy was that Hispanics, African-Americans, and patients of Other/Unknown race/ethnicity were less likely to receive a biopsy than non-Hispanic Whites. It is important to note that the rates of biopsy in African-Americans were only slightly lower than those of non-Hispanic Whites, but were statistically signi- cant because of the very large sample size. Future research is needed to explore whether these differences might be explained by cultural preferences, access to care, or provider behavior in connection with rates of antiviral treatment. Understanding the cultural preferences and access to care among these groups may improve the quality of care they receive. Results also indicate that there is considerable variability between geographic regions in the proportion of HCV patients receiving biopsies. This is not surprising as variation in the rates of medical procedures and services has been well documented [28,29] . The variability patterns for biopsy in the VA systems are similar to the variability patterns in rates of antiviral treat- ment in the VA system [24,30] , suggesting that higher rates of biopsy are associated with higher rates of treatment. Hepatolo- gist and gastroenterologist specialist times were not associated with more liver biopsies once the overall volume of health care received entered the model as a signicant co-variate. Notably, regional variability remained signicant after controlling for clin- ical characteristics, patient demographics, or specialist time. Spe-cialist time or overall volume of care has frequently affected procedure variability in other conditions, but does not alwaysfully explain geographic differences [31-34] . Other explanations for regional variability in liver biopsies are not clear, but some evidence suggests that region U had the highest rates of biopsy and antiviral treatment because of a particular HCV care model developed at the main VA Medical Center in that region [35,36] . Other possible reasons for geographic variability in biopsy rates are differences in available resources, varying deni- tions of antiviral treatment candidacy, and varying beliefs about the utility of biopsy associated with proximity to large academic medical centers. Our study conrms and strengthens the data above in dem- onstrating geographic differences in performance of a common and expensive diagnostic practice in a single uniform medical care system.

In addition, because patient socio- demographic and health-related diagnoses were taken directly from the national computerized medical record, it is unlikely that important patient characteristics and diagnoses weremissed or not taken into account. The present data strongly sup- port the conclusion that geographic factors are associated with variation in biopsy use, independent of patient-related and administrative factors.Table 2.

Research Article 256 Journal of Hepatology 2012 vol. 57 j252-259Although our results show that liver biopsy has been used inconsistently in the recent past, and many genotype 1 HCV- infected individuals have never received a biopsy, it is hard to determine the optimal rate of biopsy and the impact of these results on the quality of care provided. Liver biopsy correlates fairly well with antiviral treatment rates and is recommended by the VA and other organizations as an important step in antivi- ral treatment decision-making for genotype 1 patients [10,11,26] . A recent study on the quality of care in the VA system calls for higher treatment rates and efforts to improve SVR [37]. Thus, if the recommendations noted above are followed, liver biopsy use should increase as treatment rates increase. Although it remains possible that the higher SVR rates of the new antiviral therapies may lead to less reliance on liver biopsy as it does with genotype 2-3 patients, biopsy will likely retain an important role because of the need to prioritize patients for treatment, given available resources. Therefore, it seems important for VA andnon-VA clinicians and researchers to study this use and provide more detailed guidance on the use of liver biopsy with HCV patients in the near future. The procedure will likely retain its value in some circumstances, but its utility must be weighed against its cost and potential for infrequent but signicant side effects. Patient preferences and behaviors should also be consid- ered when gauging optimal rates of liver biopsy. A limitation of the data is that it relies upon the accuracy of the VA Hepatitis C Registry. Some lab tests may be mislabeled, and mistakes likely occur in the human data entry process. It is impossible to know the exact level of accuracy, but in general, after recoding obvious transpositional errors, we excluded data on only a couple thousand cases, constituting 1-2% of cases for overall analyses. Our results include all available data from the VA Hepatitis C Registry. Although some data show that treatment rates and characteristics of patients with HCV do not differ much betweenTable 3.

In conclusion, we found that many VA patients with HCV have not been biopsied and the number of liver biopsies being con- ducted within the VA system nationally has been declining despite a large pool of untreated patients with HCV. We also found that there is considerable variability in the rate at which liver biopsy is used among the 21 regions in the VA system and to a lesser extent by other factors seemingly unrelated to clinical need. Future research and policy should focus on developing more detailed guidance on the use of liver biopsy among HCV- infected patients, as non-invasive techniques develop and in light of the recent arrival of more efcacious antiviral treatments.

JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY Journal of Hepatology 2012 vol. 57 j252-259 259Effects of Alcohol Retail Privatization on Excessive Alcohol Consumption and Related Harms A Community Guide Systematic Review Robert A. Hahn, PhD, MPH, Jennifer Cook Middleton, PhD, Randy Elder, PhD, Robert Brewer, MD, MSPH, Jonathan Fielding, MD, MPH, MBA, Timothy S. Naimi, MD, MPH, Traci L. Toomey, PhD, Sajal Chattopadhyay, PhD, Briana Lawrence, MPH, Carla Alexia Campbell, MHSc, and the Community Preventive Services Task Force Context: Excessive alcohol consumption is the third-leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. This systematic review is one in a series exploring effectiveness of interventions to reduce alcohol- related harms. Evidence acquisition: The focus of this review was on studies evaluating the effects of the priva- tization of alcohol retail sales on excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. Using Commu- nity Guide methods for conducting systematic reviews, a systematic search was conducted in multiple databases up to December 2010. Reference lists of acquired articles and review papers were alsoscanned for additional studies. Evidence synthesis: A total of 17 studies assessed the impact of privatizing retail alcohol sales on the per capita alcohol consumption, a well-established proxy for excessive alcohol consumption; 9 ofthese studies also examined the effects of privatization on the per capita consumption of alcoholicbeverages that were not privatized. One cohort study in Finland assessed the impact of privatizing thesales of medium-strength beer (MSB) on self-reported alcohol consumption. One study in Swedenassessed the impact of re-monopolizing the sale of MSB on alcohol-related harms. Across the 17studies, there was a 44.4% median increase in the per capita sales of privatized beverages in locationsthat privatized retail alcohol sales (interquartile interval: 4.5% to 122.5%). During the same timeperiod, sales of nonprivatized alcoholic beverages decreased by a median of 2.2% (interquartileinterval: /H110026.6% to /H110020.1%). Privatizing the sale of MSB in Finland was associated with a mean increase in alcohol consumption of 1.7 liters of pure alcohol per person per year. Re-monopolizationof the sale of MSB in Sweden was associated with a general reduction in alcohol-related harms. Conclusions: According to Community Guide rules of evidence, there is strong evidence that privatization of retail alcohol sales leads to increases in excessive alcohol consumption. (Am J Prev Med 2012;42(4):418-427) Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine Context Excessive alcohol consumption, including both binge drinking and underage drinking, is respon- sible for approximately 79,000 deaths per year in the U.S., making it the third-leading cause of preventabledeath in the nation. 1In 2009, approximately 23% of adult drinkers (aged /H1135018 years) in the U.S. reported binge drinking (consuming fve or more drinks per occasion formen and four or more drinks per occasion for women) inthe past 30 days, as did 25.2% of high school students. 2,3 Among full-time college students in 2008, 48.6% of menand 34.4% of women reported binge drinking. 4In 2006,From the Community Guide Branch, Epidemiology and Analysis Program Offce (Hahn, Middleton, Elder, Chattopadhyay, Lawrence, Campbell),National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion(Brewer), CDC, Atlanta, Georgia; Los Angeles County Department ofHealth Services (Fielding); University of Minnesota School of Public Health(Toomey), Minneapolis, Minnesota; and the Schools of Medicine and Pub-lic Health (Naimi), Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts Author affliations are shown at the time the research was conducted.

Following the end of Prohibition in the U.S. in 1933, some states continued prohibition at the state level.\"Control\" states allowed alcohol to be sold, but onlythrough government-run retail stores; \"license\" states al-lowed retail sales by commercial interests. 6In all states, wholesale of alcoholic beverages is under state control.Currently, no states prohibit alcohol sales, and the num-ber of states that have retained control over retail sales hasbeen reduced through privatization. However, in allstates with government control over certain beveragetypes, government control is restricted to off-premises sales outlets (i.e., outlets where alcohol is sold for con-sumption elsewhere); government control does not affecttheon-premises sale of alcohol in any state. In the U.S. and Canada, privatization most often affects wine and spirits (e.g., vodka and whiskey). In the U.S., allstates and counties that permit the sale of alcohol allowprivatized retail sales of beer, and most allow privatizedretail sale of all alcoholic beverages. In contrast, in theScandinavian countries where most other studies ofprivatization have been conducted, privatization and re-monopolization generally affect beer sales. The NationalAlcohol Beverage Control Association (NABCA; www. nabca.org) classifes state retail alcohol sales control pol-icies as shown in Table 1. The predominant trend in the U.S. and elsewhere is toward relaxing government control over the sale of alco- holic beverages, including by privatizing alcohol sales.The formation of the European Union has also led to aloosening of national control and increased privatizationin some member nations. 7,8However, because privatiza - tion could plausibly lead to increases in excessive alcoholconsumption and related harms, a public health interven-tion of possible interest to some jurisdictions and deci-sion makers may be the reversal of privatization (re-monopolization) or the maintenance of governmentcontrol where it exists currently. This review addresses three research questions related to the effect of privatizing retail sales of alcoholic beverages.(1) Does retail privatization of a specifc type of alcoholicbeverage increase its excessive consumption and associatedharms (e.g., alcohol-impaired driving, assaults, and cirrhosisof the liver)? (2) Does privatization of sales of one type ofalcoholic beverage also reduce excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages for which sales are not privatized(e.g., does the retail privatization of wine sales lead con-sumers to reduce their consumption of liquor, if liquorsales are still subject to government control)? (3) Does there-establishment of state control over the retail sales of analcoholic beverage (re-monopolization) reduce the ex-cessive consumption of that beverage and the harms re-lated to excessive consumption? Findings, Recommendations, and Directives from Other Reviews and Advisory Groups The 2010 WHO-sponsored review Alcohol: No Ordinary Commodity,8a consensus narrative review of a broad array of alcohol interventions, assessed government con-trol of the retail sale of alcohol, and rated it 3/H11001 (the highest rating) for effectiveness in reducing excessive al-cohol consumption and related harms and for the extentof research supporting the fnding and 2/H11001 on cross- cultural testing, suggesting generalizability across set- tings. The cost of implementing government control wasrated as low. The reviewers concluded that \"the evidence is quite strong that off-premise government control systems limit alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems,Table 1.

The intervention reviewed here may behelpful in addressing several national health objectivesrelated to substance abuse prevention, as specifed inHealthy People 2020. 9 Evidence Acquisition The Guide to Community Preventive Services (Community Guide) systematic review process was used to assess whether privatization leads to increases in excessive alcohol consumption and related harms.More details on the Community Guide review process are presented elsewhere. 10,11In brief, this process involves forming a systematic review development team; developing a conceptual approach to orga-nizing, grouping, and selecting interventions; prioritizing these inter-ventions; searching for and retrieving the existing research evidenceon the effects of the interventions; assessing the quality of each study;abstracting information from each study that meets qualifying criteria;drawing conclusions about the body of evidence on intervention ef-fectiveness; and translating the evidence on effectiveness into recom-mendations. To help ensure objectivity, the systematic review devel-opment team consists of systematic review methodologists and subjectmatter experts from a range of agencies, organizations, and academicinstitutions. The review team works under the oversight of the non-federal, independent Community Preventive Services Task Force(Task Force), which directs the work of the Community Guide. The systematic review development team collects and summarizes evidence on (1) the effectiveness of interventions in altering the health-related outcomes of interest; and (2) benefts and harms of the inter-vention on other health and nonhealth outcomes. When an interven-tion is shown to be effective, information is also included about (3) theapplicability (or generalizability) of the evidence to diverse populationsegments and settings; (4) the economic impact of the intervention;and (5) barriers to implementation. The systematic review develop-ment team then presents the results of this review process to the TaskForce, which considers all of the evidence presented and determineswhether it is suffcient to warrant a recommendation for practice orpolicy. 10The rules of evidence under which the Task Force makes its determination require consideration of several aspects of the body ofevidence, including the number of studies of different levels of designsuitability and execution, as well as judgments regarding the consis-tency of the fndings, the public health importance of the overall effectsize, and the balance of the outcome of interest with other conse-quences of the intervention. Conceptual Approach and Analytic Framework Six intermediate consequences of privatization are hypothesized toaffect alcohol consumption ( Figure 1). First, privatization generally leads to increases in the density of off-premises alcohol outlets. 12 Second, privatization may increase the availability of alcohol byincreasing the days and hours during which it is sold. 13,14Third, privatization may increase the availability of specifc types andbrands of alcoholic beverages. Fourth, privatization may affect the retail price of alcohol be- cause of various factors that may either increase or decrease prices;overall, prices tend to increase with privatization. 13,14However, the wider range of alcohol products typically available in privatizedsystems may result in more low-priced products that would appealto high-volume or high-risk drinkers, even if the average price forall alcohol products were similar in state-owned and privatizedsystems. Fifth, because it introduces competition among alcoholoutlets, privatization may lead to increased alcohol advertising invarious venues, including TV, radio, billboards, and at the point ofpurchase. 13Sixth, because of increased numbers of outlets and less direct governmental control, privatization may lead to de-creased enforcement of and compliance with sales regulations (e.g., minimum-drinking-age laws). 15 Many of these consequences of privatization may increase the demand for the privatized beverage, substitution to or from otherbeverages, and access to alcoholic beverages. In turn, these con- sequences may affect excessive consumption and related harms.In contrast, re-monopolization is expected to have effects oppo-site to those of privatization. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria To qualify as a source of primary evidence for this review, a study hadto meet several criteria. It had to evaluate retail privatization or re-newed government control; be conducted in a country with a high-income economy 16; be primary research (rather than a review of other research); be published in English; and have a comparison groupand/or compare conditions before and after privatization. Optimally,alcohol consumption in locations that experienced changes in govern-ment control (e.g., privatization) would be compared with alcoholconsumption in similar locations that did not experience this change. A study also had to report outcomes related to excessive alcohol consumption or related harms. Some specifc harms of interestincluded alcohol-related medical conditions (e.g., liver cirrhosis),alcohol-impaired driving and alcohol-related crashes, uninten-tional injuries, intentional injuries, and crime. Government re-ports were included, but unpublished papers were not, as they maybe diffcult for others to access and are not peer-reviewed. When studies assessed multiple outcomes of interest, those with the strongest known association with excessive alcohol consump-tion were given more weight. Outcome measures in the studies that had the strongest association with excessive alcohol con-sumption included binge drinking, heavy drinking, liver cirrho- Figure 1. Analytic framework Note: Privatization of retail sales of alcoholic beverages: Oval indicates intervention; rectangles with rounded corners indicate mediators or intermedi- ate outcomes; rectangles indicate health outcomes.420 Hahn et al / Am J Prev Med 2012;42(4):418-427 www.ajpmonline.orgsis mortality, alcohol-related hospital admissions, and alcohol- related motor vehicle crashes (or strong proxies for such crashes, e.g.,single-vehicle nighttime crashes for alcohol-related motor vehiclecrashes). 17Less-direct measures included per capita ethanol con - sumption, a well-recognized proxy for estimating the number of ex-cessive drinkers in a population 8,18,19; unintentional injuries; suicide; and crime (e.g., homicide and aggravated assault). Cross-sectional and panel studies in which the sequence of events was not taken into account (e.g., counting year as an ordinal variable)were considered secondary evidence in this review. Secondary evi-dence was regarded as useful for generating hypotheses and forstrengthening or weakening conclusions based on primary evidence,but was insuffcient alone for assessing intervention effectiveness.Many of the studies qualifying for this review used per capita alcoholsales as a proxy for excessive drinking. In assessing the quality of studyexecution, a penalty (described below) was assigned to studies thatassessed changes in population-level consumption rather thanchanges in excessive drinking by individuals. This was a conservativeapproach because excessive drinking and per capita alcohol consump-tion are strongly related both theoretically and empirically. 18-20 This empirical relationship is conceptualized in the \"single dis- tribution theory,\" which asserts that excessive drinkers, includingbinge and heavy drinkers, account for a consistent proportion ofthe drinking population in a given setting, 19such that the preva - lence of excessive alcohol consumption is directly related to percapita alcohol sales. Further, the theory proposes that the relation-ship between per capita sales and \"heavy\" or excessive drinking isquadratic, meaning that, \"If population A has twice the averageconsumption of population B, then A has about four times (i.e., 2 2) the prevalence of heavy drinking.\" Cook and Skog19report evi - dence from multiple countries supporting this proposition. Thus,changes in per capita alcohol consumption would be expected tohave a greater effect on excessive alcohol consumption, includingbinge drinking, than on non-excessive alcohol consumption. Thisevidence supports the Task Force's use of per capita alcohol con-sumption based on sales as an outcome measure for assessing theimpact of privatization on excessive alcohol consumption. Search for Evidence The following databases were searched for this review: Econlit,PsycINFO, Sociology Abstracts, MEDLINE, Embase, andEtOH. All years were searched up to October 2007. (Details ofthe search strategy are available at www.thecommunityguide. org/alcohol/supportingmaterials/SSalcoholuse.html .) This search was updated in the ISI Web of Knowledge through December 2010 bythe Alcohol Epidemiology Program at the University of Minnesota.Reference lists of articles reviewed as well as lists in review articles weresearched, and subject matter experts were consulted. Assessing the Quality and Summarizing the Body of Evidence on Effectiveness Each study that met the criteria for candidate studies was read by two reviewers, who used standardized criteria (available at www. thecommunityguide.org/about/methods.html ) to assess suitability of study design and threats to validity. Uncertainties and disagree-ments between reviewers were reconciled by consensus among theteam members. The team's classifcation of the designs of studiesreviewed corresponds with the research questions of the reviewand the standards of the Community Guide review process 11and may differ from the classifcation reported in the original studies.The quality of studies that were candidates as primary evidence for this review was evaluated both in terms of design and execution.Studies with greatest design suitability were those in which data onexposed and comparison populations were collected prospectively;studies with moderate design suitability were those in which dataon exposed and comparison populations were collected retrospec-tively or in which there were multiple pre- or post-interventionmeasurements, but no concurrent comparison population; andstudies with least-suitable designs were cross-sectional studies orthose in which there was no comparison population or only a singlepre- and post-measurement in the intervention population. On thebasis of the number of threats to validity\u2014such as poor measure-ment of exposure or outcome, lack of control of potential con-founders, or high attrition\u2014studies were characterized as havinggood (at most one threat to validity), fair (two to four threats), orlimited (fve or more threats) quality of execution. Studies withgood or fair quality of execution and any level of design suitability(greatest, moderate, or least) qualifed for the body of evidence. Effect estimates were calculated as relative percentage change using the following formulas: For studies with before-after measurements and concurrentcomparison groups: Effect estimate /H11005 /H20851/H20849IpostCpost/H20850/H20849IpreCpre/H20850/H110021/H20852/H11003100% where: Ipost/H11005last reported outcome rate or count in the intervention group after the intervention; Ipre/H11005last reported outcome rate in the intervention group before the intervention; Cpost/H11005last reported outcome rate in the comparison group after the intervention; Cpre/H11005last reported outcome rate in the comparison group before the intervention. For studies with before-after measurements but no concurrent comparison: Effect estimate /H11005/H20851/H20849Ipost/H11002Ipre/H20850Ipre/H20852/H11003100% . Several events of privatization (e.g., the privatization of wine in Iowa in 1985) were assessed by more than one team of researchers,thus resulting in multiple studies of the same event. Effect estimatesare reported for each research group, noting which were associatedwith a single event. Median effect sizes are calculated using themeans of privatization events with differing fndings from differentresearchers. Evidence Synthesis Intervention Effectiveness The effects of 12 distinct privatization events were as- sessed in 17 studies and reported in 13 publica-tions. 14,21-32In addition, there was one study of re- monopolization, described separately below.33The privatization events assessed were in seven U.S. states(Alabama, Idaho, Iowa [two events], Maine, Montana,Hahn et al / Am J Prev 2012;42(4):418-427 421 April 2012New event, andseveral publications eachassessed more than oneprivatization event. All studies used alcohol sales data as an indexof population-level alcoholconsumption except one 25 that assessed changes inindividual-level consump-tion (in Finland). Fitzgeraldand Mulford 14,22also as - sessed changes in self-reported consumption inaddition to sales data (in Iowa). However, as theynote, their measures of alcohol consumption were prob- lematic (e.g., separate cross-sectional studies collectedunder different sampling procedures with different interview procedures), and thus only the assessmentsof changes in alcohol sales from their study are in-cluded in this review. In the U.S., privatized beverages were limited to wine and spirits, as beer was already privatized. InCanada, sale of beer was privatized in addition to salesof wine and spirits, and in Scandinavia, privatization(and re-monopolization) focused on beer sales. The privatization events assessed in these studies occurredbetween 1950 and 2000. Three studies used autoregres-sive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time se-ries. 27-29Fourteen studies (presented in eight publica - tions)14,23,26-30,32were of greatest design suitability; three studies (presented in two publications)24,25were of moderate design suitability. All studies were of fair qual-ity of execution. The qualifying studies provided information on sev- eral of the intermediate consequences of privatizationdiscussed above (Figure 1). These consequences include increased numbers of alcoholic beverage outlets, in-creased hours and days of sale, advertising, greater brandselection, and acceptance of alternate forms of payment(e.g., credit card). 13,14,23,26-30,32,34All of these intermedi - ate outcomes would be expected to result in increasedconsumption. Most studies reviewed reported generally higher prices for alcoholic beverages in the privatized than in the statecontrol setting. The higher prices may be the conse-quence of relative ineffciencies of scale (e.g., multiple smaller outlets and increased overhead expenses). 35In contrast to other intermediate outcomes, higher pri- ces would be expected to result in decreased consump-tion. However, Fitzgerald and Mulford 21assessed whether the increase in the price of spirits followingprivatization of retail sales in Iowa had affected consum-ers' purchasing behavior, and found that only 37.4% ofthose surveyed who purchased liquor in the past monthrecognized that prices had increased, and /H110212% of Iowa consumers reported increasing their purchase of liquorfrom adjacent states. Effects of privatization on consumption of privatized beverages. Overall, the median increase in per capita sales of privatized beverages was 44.4%, with an interquartileinterval of 4.5% to 122.5% ( Figure 2). Some differences, however, were observed across studies in the impact ofprivatization on retail sales of privatized beverages and in therelationship between privatization and other public healthoutcomes, described below. Studies assessing the effects of the privatization of wine (1985) and spirits (1987) sales in Iowa had inconsistentfndings. Wagenaar and Holder 31reported that wine con - sumption increased 93.0% (95% CI/H1100569.3%, 120.2%)from baseline to 44 months after privatization of winesales in Iowa, with no decrease in spirits or beer con-sumption. Following the subsequent privatization ofspirits sales in Iowa 2 years later, these researchers 23re- ported a 9.5% (95% CI/H11005/H11002 20.6%, /H110022.7%) decrease in wine consumption and no change in Figure 2.

They23,31also found no evidence that privatization affected alcohol purchasing across state lines (effect estimate 0.1%, 95% CI/H11005/H11002 3.1%, 6.2%). In contrast, Mulford and Fitzgerald27found that wine privatization was associated with a nonsignifcant long-termincrease of only 0.5% (95% CI /H11005/H110026.8%, 8.3%) in wine sales, and that spirits privatization was associated with a non-signifcant long-term increase of 0.7% (95% CI/H11005/H11002 1.9%, 3.4%) in spirits sales. For both beverages, the nonsignifcantlong-term effects were preceded by 3-year spikes in sales.The differences between the conclusions of these two re-search teams about the effects of the privatization of wineand spirits in Iowa may be the consequence of differentmodeling strategies, different time periods covered, and dif-ferent forms of alcoholic beverages included\u2014particularlythe inclusion of \"wine coolers\" in measures of wine sales byWagenaar and Holder. 31,32 Finally, Makela25assessed the impact on alcohol con - sumption of a law in Finland that allowed the sale of medium- strength beer (MSB) in grocery stores. This was the onlystudy included in the review that assessed changes in self-reported alcohol consumption by individuals over time.Survey participants were specifcally asked about their levelsof consumption before implementation of the new law andthen again in the year following its implementation. Theresearchers stratifed their fndings based on drinking pat-terns of respondents before and after privatization. Con-sumption of all alcoholic beverages (not just the privatizedbeverage) increased by a mean of 1.7 L of pure alcohol peryear per person interviewed (approximately 137 ounces of80\u00b0 proof liquor). Makela reports that 86% of the increase inoverall alcohol consumption was attributable to increases inthe privatized beverage (MSB). The greatest increase in al-cohol consumption after privatization was observed amongthose who reported drinking between 17 and 68 ounces ofpure alcohol per year at frst interview. However, there wasalso an increase in consumption in the population that re- ported no alcohol consumption within the past 30 dayswhen frst interviewed. Effects of privatization on alcohol-related harms. Two studies assessed the association between retail privatization and motor vehicle crashes. One study estimated that incre-mental privatization over a 20-year period traffc fatalities in Alberta, Canada. 29This study estimated the degree of privatization over a long periodpreceding fnal privatization in 1994, had only 1 year offollow-up, and used a proxy outcome measure. A second study assessed changes in alcohol-related harms associated with the Iowa privatization of wine in1985 and spirits in 1987. 14,26The researchers compared the period before 1985 with the period after 1989, whenboth wine and spirits sales were privatized. Despite in- creased per capita sales of both wine and spirits, there wasa reported 1.6% decline in nighttime motor vehiclecrashes and a 5.5% decline in liver cirrhosis. However,initial mortality data were for 1985\u2014the same year inwhich the privatization of wine occurred; thus these dataincluded deaths both prior to and following privatization,weakening the analysis. Moreover, no comparison datawere provided to adjust for national or regional trends inthese outcomes over the time period evaluated. Effects of privatization on the consumption of non- privatized alcoholic beverages. Many of the stud- ies 14,25,26,31,32,36reviewed also assessed the effect of privatizing the sale of one type of alcoholic beverage on the sale of other nonprivatized beverages. In the sevensettings assessed, the sales of nonprivatized alcoholicbeverages decreased a median of 2.2%, with an inter-quartile interval ranging from a decrease of 6.6% insales to a decrease of 0.1% (Figure 3). These decreases are not of suffcient magnitude to offset the overallincrease in per capita sales of privatized beverages. Effects of re-monopolization on alcohol-related out- comes. One study in Sweden 33directly assessed effects of a 1977 re-monopolization of the sale of MSB (2.26%-3.50% alcohol by volume; beer in the U.S. is generally4%-6% alcohol by volume). The study was of moderatedesign suitability and fair execution. Re-monopolizationresulted in a substantial decline in the number of outletsfor MSB, from 11,550 to 300. The effects of this policychange on hospitalization for several alcohol-related out-comes (alcoholism, alcohol intoxication, alcoholic psy-chosis, hospitalizations for acute alcohol intoxication,suicides, falls, motor vehicle crashes, and assaults) wereassessed using time-series design, comparing the 4 yearsbefore and after re-monopolization. The results werestratifed by four age categories (10-19 years, 20-39years, 40-59 years, and /H1135060 years), and the study did not provide data to allow aggregation across age groups. The researchers identifed a number of positive changes in health outcomes following re-monopolization.Hospital admissions for the treatment of alcoholism,alcohol intoxication, and alcohol psychosis decreasedacross all age groups (p/H110220.05), and there was a 20%decline (p/H110210.05) in these outcomes among people aged 10-19 years. Hospitalizations for acute alcohol intoxica-tion decreased across all ages from 3.5% to 14.7%(p/H110220.05). Suicides decreased from 1.7% to 11.8%(p/H110220.05). Falls decreased from to 4.9% (p/H110220.05). Motor vehicle crashes decreased 14% (p/H110210.05) for three age categories (10-19 years, 40-59 years, and /H1135060 years) and by 4.4% for those aged 20-39 years (p/H110220.05). In contrast, assaults increased from 6.9% to 14.8% (p/H110220.05)Hahn et al / Am J Prev Med 2012;42(4):418-427 423 April 2012in three of four age catego- ries, and decreased by1.4% among those aged20-39 years (p/H110220.05).In summary, the re-monopolization all agegroups; however, many ofthese effects were notsignifcant. Cross-sectional studies, panel studies, and sum-marized studies in trans-lation. The team found 20 cross-sectional andpanel studies 29,35,37-54as- sessing the association ofprivatization with alcohol consumption and relatedharms; fve studies 35,38,43,47,48had multiple outcomes. (Panel studies were included in this section if they did not include time as an ordinal covariate or compare alcohol-related outcomes before and after events of privatiza-tion.) Seventeen studies 29,35,37,38,40,42-48,50-54found that privatization was associated with greater consumption(nine were signifcant, 37,40,42-44,46,48,52,53seven were not,29,35,38,45,47,50,54and one51did not report consumption (threewere signifcant, 40,43,44one not38). Three studies37,41,50 assessed the association of privatization with cirrhosismortality; all were positive and two 37,41were signif - cant. Finally, two studies assessed the association ofprivatization with motor vehicle fatalities, 39,46and both found a positive, but nonsignifcant association;one study found a negative, signifcant association ofprivatization and drunk driving. Overall, this evidenceis consistent with evidence from primary studies indi-cating positive associations between privatization andincreased population-level consumption alcohol-related harms. Makela, Rossow, and Tryggvesson 36published (in English) a review of studies conducted in Finland, Swe-den, and Norway that were not published in Englishtranslation and thus were not included in this review.These studies examined the effect of either privatizing orre-monopolization of the sales of medium or strong beerbetween the mid-1960s and the early 1990s on variouskinds of alcohol-related harms (e.g., arrests for drunken-ness and alcohol-related illnesses).The researchers found that when beer sales were privatized, there were increases in alcohol consump- tion and alcohol-related harms such as arrests fordrunkenness and alcohol-related illnesses. They alsofound that re-monopolization generally resulted in de- creased population-level consumption of the affected al- coholic beverage, decreases in excessive alcohol con-sumption, and decreases in alcohol-related harms. Inaddition, they found that when a particular strength ofbeer became more or less accessible, consumers tended topurchase the beverage type that was more readily acces-sible. This beverage substitution effect appeared to bestronger among different strengths of beer than amongdifferent types of alcoholic beverages. Summary of Intervention Effectiveness Across the studies qualifying for this review, the privati-zation of off-premises retail sales of an alcoholic beveragewas associated with a median 44.4% increase (interquar-tile interval 4.5%, 122.5%) in the per capita sales of thebeverage and with a 2.2% decline (interquartile interval/H110026.6%, /H110020.1%) in the per capita sales of beverages for which sales were not privatized. One study (in Finland) 25 found that the increases in consumption occurred amongdrinkers at all consumption levels. A single study 33eval- uating the effects of re-monopolization of alcohol salesfound that this change was associated with a subsequentdecrease in several alcohol-related harms (e.g., hospital-izations for acute alcohol intoxication).-60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300 320 340 Relative percent change in consumptionAlabama (1980) Maine (1971) Montana (1979) New Hampshire (1978) Iowa (1985) West Virginia (1981) Alabama (1980) Finland (1969) Maine (1971) Beer Light Beer Spirits Montana (1979) New Hampshire (1978) Iowa (1985) West Virginia (1981) Median -2.2%; Interquartile Interval (-6.6, -0.1) Undesirable direction Median Interquartile interval Place (year) Finland (1969) Figure 3.

In addition topotential public health benefts, lower outlet density mayimprove quality of life by reducing property damage andpublic disturbance (e.g., public intoxication). However,the studies reviewed did not assess these effects. Thereview team did not postulate any serious harms associ-ated with the maintenance of government control overretail alcohol sales. Applicability Consistent evidence of the association between privatizationand increased per capita alcohol sales comes from studiesdone in multiple settings in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.Most of these studies evaluated the effects of privatizing thesales of wine and spirits. Only one Swedish study 33specif - cally assessed the impact of re-monopolization (of MSB).The fndings from the current review apply most directly tothe impact of privatizing the sale of wine and spirits inhigh-income nations such as the U.S. Economic Efciency The present systematic economic review identifed onestudy 55in Canada that used simulation modeling to esti - mate healthcare and law enforcement costs and costs oflost productivity due to disability and premature mortal-ity in the event all Canadian provinces and territorieswere to privatize alcohol sales. The study was judged to besatisfactory by Community Guide economics criteria (www.thecommunityguide.org/about/EconAbstraction_v5.pdf). Study authors concluded that these costs weresubstantially greater than the tax and mark-up revenuegained from increased sales associated with privatization;however, beneft data were not documented. Research Gaps Although the studies reviewed have demonstrated anassociation between privatization and increases in the percapita consumption of the privatized beverages withoutsubstantial reductions in consumption of other alcoholicbeverages, additional research is needed to clarify therelationship between privatization and various patternsof excessive alcohol consumption (e.g., binge drinking) aswell as harms related to it. Most useful would be cohortstudies in the U.S. similar to the one conducted by Makelaet al. 25in Finland, assessing the effects of privatization on patterns of excessive alcohol consumption (e.g., bingedrinking) and alcohol-related harms. It would also beuseful to evaluate the impact of increased governmentcontrol over alcohol sales (e.g., re-monopolization) onexcessive alcohol consumption and related harms, weresuch events to occur in the U.S. or other high-income nations. Privatization has assumed different forms in different states and localities. Thus, it would be useful to determinehow the effects of privatization observed in this review vary by the degree of government regulation and otherspecifc parameters of the privatization. Although, ingeneral, government control establishes a greater degreeof regulation over retail alcohol sales than systems inwhich sales have been privatized, Her et al. 13have noted that \"privatization might involve a change from a veryrestrictive alcohol management system to a loosely regu-lated private one; it would also potentially involve achange from a commercially orientated public system to aprivate sector operation that is heavily regulated.\" No peer-reviewed studies were found that evaluated economic effects of privatizing the sale of alcoholic bev-erages in the U.S. The anticipated effects of privatizationinclude a large, but short-term, source of revenue tostates; a potential increase in healthcare and criminaljustice costs; and productivity losses from expected in-creases in excessive alcohol consumption owing togreater availability and/or lower prices. Studies assessingthese economic impacts would be useful for informingfuture discussions of this issue. It would be useful toassess the effects of different specifc approaches to priva-tization on state revenues associated with sales and taxeson alcoholic beverages. Conclusion The evidence consistently showed that privatization of retail alcohol sales was associated with a substantial in-crease in per capita sales of the privatized beverages, awell-established proxy for excessive alcohol consump-tion. There was also evidence that re-monopolization isassociated with a decrease in alcohol-related harms.Therefore, according to Community Guide rules of evi- dence, there was strong evidence that retail privatizationof alcohol sales leads to increases in excessive alcoholconsumption. In the U.S., many states have privatized the retail sales of alcoholic beverages. Currently, three states control theoff-premises consumption retail sales of both wine andspirits, and an additional ten states maintain control overthe retail sale of spirits alone. In addition, one county inthe state of Maryland has county-level control over theretail sale of spirits and wine. The fndings of the presentreport are based solely on evidence related to the publichealth consequences of privatization, which may be oneof several factors considered in making decisions onwhether to privatize retail alcohol sales. The maintenanceof government control of off-premises sale of alcoholicHahn et al / Am J Prev Med 2012;42(4):418-427 425 April 2012beverages is one of many effective strategies to prevent or reduce excessive consumption, which is one of the lead-ing causes of preventable death and disability.

Yet, little is known about the reform's impact on actual health care utilization among poor and minoritypopulations, particularly for receipt of inpatient surgical procedures that are commonly initiated by outpatient physician referral. Methods: Using discharge data on Massachusetts hospitalizations for 21 months before and after health reform implementation (7/1/ 2006-12/31/2007), we identified all nonobstetrical major ther- apeutic procedures for patients aged 40 or older and for whichZ70% of hospitalizations were initiated by outpatient physician referral. Stratifying by race/ethnicity and patient residential zip code median (area) income, we estimated prereform and postreform procedure rates, and their changes, for those aged 40-64 (non-elderly), adjusting for secular changes unrelated to reform by comparing to corresponding procedure rate changes for those aged70 years and above (elderly), whose coverage (Medicare) was not affected by reform. Results: Overall increases in procedure rates (among 17 procedures identied) between prereform and postreform periods were higher for nonelderly low area income (8%, P= 0.04) and medium area income (8%, P< 0.001) cohorts than for the high area income co- hort (4%); and for Hispanics and blacks (23% and 21%, re- spectively; P< 0.001) than for whites (7%). Adjusting for secular changes unrelated to reform, postreform increases in procedureutilization among nonelderly were: by area income, = 13% use of major inpatient procedures increased more among nonelderly lower and medium area income populations, Hispanics, and whites, suggesting potential improvements in access to outpatient care for these vulnerable subpopulations. Key Words: health reform, disparities, utilization, inpatient care, access to care, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity (Med Care 2012;50: 569-577) Acentral policy assumption in the United States is that expanding health insurance coverage will improve ac- cess to health care and outcomes, and make each more equitable for all Americans.1Massachusetts (MA) is the site of a key policy-relevant natural experiment2-8; recent legis- lation has resulted in nearly all (96.5%) of the state's resi- dents obtaining health insurance.9However, little is known about MA reform's impact on health care utilization, par-ticularly among poor and minority populations, whose access to care the reform sought to increase. The number of uninsured MA residents fell sharply after the reform was implemented. 10Among adults aged 18-64, the population targeted by the reform, uninsurance rates declined from 8.4% (2006) to 3.4% (2009) overall, but from 18%-9% among the poorest population quintile, from15%-5% among blacks, and 20%-13% among His- panics. 9,11,12However, the limited evidence of the reform's impact on access to and use of health care, based largely onpopulation surveys, provides a mixed picture.

Changes in receipt of such surgical pro- cedures after MA health reform could be a measure of accessto outpatient care that may improve with expanded insurancecoverage. 19Thus, we focused on the use of such procedures among vulnerable subpopulations\u2014those living in low-in- come areas and racial/ethnic minorities. These groups areknown to underutilize elective inpatient care, 20-22and were specifically targeted for larger gains in coverage expansion from the MA health reform.23We hypothesized that the entire reform package, including increased population rates of insurance coverage, would be associated with increasedrates of receipt of surgical procedures most commonly ini- tiated through outpatient physician referral, and that suchgains would be greater among vulnerable populations. METHODS Overview We estimated longitudinal population rates of receipt of referral-dependent procedures by combining compre- hensive state-level inpatient administrative data with census population data. We estimated prereform and postreformrates of procedure use among nonelderly subpopulations stratied by cohorts dened by race/ethnicity and income of the area of patient residence. To isolate the impact of healthreform from secular trends, we contrasted postreform changeamong the nonelderly with changes among the elderly. We chose this control group because most elderly residents were covered by Medicare both prereform and postreform, andtherefore the change in their procedure use reflects secular changes unrelated to health reform.

Data Sources and High Referral Rate (HRR) Procedures We focused on hospitalizations for surgical procedures that are predominantly scheduled by outpatient referral, that we term \"HRR procedures.\" While si milar to the previously de- ned concept of \"referral- sensitive procedures,\"19we found that for some referral-sensitive p rocedures (eg, coronary artery bypass graft) the proportion arising from outpatient referral wasno higher than 50% (See Appendix, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.l ww.com/MLR/A311). Using all hospital- izations with discharges during the prereform and postreformperiods as raw data (MA Inpatient Discharge Data for 2004-2009), 25we included MA-residing patients aged 40 or older (those with significant ris k for the procedures examined) undergoing a major therapeutic surgical procedure [usingAgency for Healthcare Researc h & Quality Procedure Classes system; Clinical Classifications Software (CCS)], as illustrated by Figure 1. 26These procedures' Intern ational Classification of Diseases-Ninth Edition-Clinical Modification diagnosis codes were classified into the 231-category Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality CCS.27To minimize chance mis- classification we only included procedures with aggregate volume of Z500. We excluded obstetric al procedures as their usage has been universally covered in MA. On the basis of the \"source of admission\" eld, we dened HRR procedures as those with an outpatient physi- cian referral rate Z70%, reasoning that this threshold would represent a large majority of procedures. We excluded somenonspecic HRR procedures\u2014for instance, \"Other oper- ations a broad range of proce- dures. To minimize chance fluctuations in procedure use, wegrouped the HRR CCS procedures into International Clas- sification of Diseases-Ninth Edition-Clinical procedure categories 27and excluded those with r200 sur- geries for each area income or race/ethnicity cohort. Information on patient race /ethnicity was part of the discharge data submitted by each hospital; as such identicationis likely based on multiple sources including, patient self-reportand administrative records. We f ound longitudinal consistency in the reporting patterns over yea rs, not only for the main racial/ ethnic groups (whites, blacks, and Hispanics), but also forproportion with missing race/ethnicity; the proportion of all discharges in a year with race /ethnicity missing or \"other\"(ie, not white, black, or Hispanic) ranged between a low of 5.32% (2004) to 6.06% (2006) of the study period years (2004-2006, 2008-2009). Analytic Data Structure To estimate prereform and postreform procedure use we produced 2 analytic datasets, 1 for performing compar- isons by race and ethnicity and another for comparisons byarea income. The rst dataset was obtained by stratifying the state population into cohorts stratied by race/ethnicity, age, sex, county, and time period (ie, prereform/postreform). Westratied patients by the 3 largest race/ethnic cohorts: His- panics, non-Hispanic whites, and non-Hispanic blacks (See Appendix, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MLR/A311). Categorizing patient age (in years) into 10 ve-year age groups aged 40-84 years (eg, 40-44 y), we excluded the 65-69-year age group; as the postreform studyperiod lasts 21 months, inclusion of both 60-64- and 65-69-year age cohorts may overestimate reform effect on proce- dure use if those initially aged 63 or 64 then age into the 65-69-year age group and became eligible for Medicarebefore the end of the 21st month. Excluding this age group also eliminates the sharp increases in procedure use pre- viously noted for new Medicare age-65 enrollees. 28,29To adjust for geographic heterogeneity across MA in factors determining procedure use, we stratified the state into 11 county-based areas, as this is the finest substate level forwhich annual census population counts are available. 30This allowed us to perform a finer grained analysis than that at the larger state level. With each county stratified into 54 cohorts (based on sex, 9 age groups and 3 racial/ethnic groups), therewas a total of 594 observations each for the prereform and postreform periods (N = 1188). For the second analytic data set, we followed a similar process but replaced race/ethnicity strata by area income strata. In the absence of individual in come, we followed previous work and used the median income (2000 census) for each pa-tient's residence zip code to st ratify all patients into 3 area income groups: lowest quartile (ie, all residents of zip codes in the poorest quartile, henceforth referred to as \"low area in-come\" population), second low est quartile (medium area in- come), and top 2 quartiles com bined (high area income). 22,31-33 As the number of area income cohorts (N = 3) is the same as that number of race/ethnicity cohorts, the second analytic da-taset has the same number of obs ervational units (N = 1188). Procedure Rates Our primary outcome measure was a procedure rate for each cohort of interest, derived from the ratio of (1) the number of HRR procedures for each cohort in the inpatientdischarge data; and (2) the census population of this cohort, and then multiplying this ratio by 10,000 so as to obtain the procedure rate per 10,000 census population. Analysis We estimated prereform and postreform procedure rates for all HRR procedures combined and for each in-dividual procedure category, for subpopulations by area in- come or race/ethnicity; we adjusted for compositionalMedical Care /C15Volume 50, Number 7, July 2012 Reform and Inpatient Utilization r2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins www.lww-medicalcare.com |571differences in sex and age by direct standardization.34These adjusted rates were estimated separately for nonelderly andelderly cohorts. We rst measured overall change (%) in procedure use\u2014the percentage change between prereform and postreform procedure rates. To estimate net change (%) as-sociated with health reform, we adjusted for secular changes using the elderly as the comparison cohort (\"difference-in- difference\" estimation). 35,36We used a count regression (Poisson) model with procedure count as the outcome measureand census population count as the population at risk. We specified a county-level fixed effects regression structure (with clustering-adjusted SEs) to capture nesting of cohortswithin county. 35,37Regression covariates included indicators of age, sex, race/ethnicity or area income, time period (pre- reform/postreform), and interaction between the elderly/non-elderly indicator and time period (to estimate the net change). Statistical significance was assessed at the level of P<0 . 0 5 . All estimation was performed using Stata Version 11.1. 37We performed several sensitivity analyses to assess the robustnessof findings to (a) inclusion of 65-69 age group; (b) alternative count regression (ie, negative binomial) specification; and (c) state-level aggregated unit of analysis (ie, without county-level stratification). To address potential bias from regression to the mean or differential changes in the characteristics of the study over time, we also estimated an alternative model on thebasis of segmented time-series specification of postreform effects that allowed for level and trend effects. This study was approved by the Boston University Medical Campus Institu-tional Review Board. Note that the comparison groups were based on age, not whether the patient held Medicare coverage, so dual el-igibles were included with their respective age groups. Ourestimates are based on change in procedure rate (say, among nonelderly or elderly patients) between the prereform and postreform period. It may well be that the subgroup of, say,elderly with dual eligibility may have different procedure rates than their counterparts without dual eligibility; how- ever, to the extent that prevalence of dual eligibility re-mained similar in the prereform and postreform periods, it does not impact the net estimates that we have estimated.RESULTS We identied 17 HRR procedures, in 5 clinical cate- with aggregate volume of 201,907 surgeries duringthe prereform and postreform periods (Table 1). The overallreferral rate for all procedures was 90%. Table 2 summarizes the number of people undergoing HRR procedures, the number of people in the population atrisk, and each group's sociodemographic composition pre- reform and postreform. Whereas the nonelderly accounted for 60% of prereform surgeries, their share increased to 64%in the postreform period; however, the nonelderly share of the population at risk remained at 78%. The share of blacks and Hispanics increased both among procedure recipients(6.4%-8.2%) and the population at risk (9.0%-9.8%); share by area income cohorts did not change. Procedure Rates and Overall Postreform Change by Area Income Prereform use of HRR procedures was similar among nonelderly area income subgroups (Table 3). After reform, overall increases in procedure rates were higher for low area income (8%, P= 0.04) and medium area income (10%, P< 0.001) cohorts compared with that for their high area income counterparts (4%). Adjusting for secular changes, the impact of health reform for the nonelderly income cohorts(or the net change in procedure rate) was: 95% condence 95% CI = [6%, 24%]), and 2% (high area income, 95% CI = [ /C03%, 8%]). Procedure Rates and Overall Postreform Change by Race/Ethnicity Prereform use of all HRR procedures was signicantly nonelderly Hispanics population; P< 0.001) and blacks (149; P= 0.05) compared with whites (157). After reform, overall change in procedure rates among the nonelderly was greater among Hispanics (23%, P< 0.001) and blacks (21%, P< 0.001) compared with that among whites (7%). Adjusting for sec- ular trends, the net change in procedure rate was 22% (95%TABLE 1.

Postreform Change by Procedure Categories Table 4 presents analogous ndings for each procedure category by area income and race/ethnicity. There is con- siderable variation in overall and net changes across cate-gories, with some indicating secular decrease in procedure rates, but statistical precision of estimates is also reduced because of relatively smaller volumes within individualprocedure categories. For musculoskeletal and urinary/geni- tal procedures, both low and medium area income cohorts experienced signicant increase in overall postreform pro-cedure rates. Although not statistically signicant, we foundthat compared with the high area income group, the esti- mated net increase (%) was larger or net decrease smaller for all 5 procedure categories among the lowest area incomecohort and for 4 procedure categories among the medium area income cohort. Comparisons by race/ethnicity indicate that compared with whites, the estimated net change (%) wasgreater for 3 of the procedure types (musculoskeletal, uri- nary/genital, and nervous) among Hispanics, but only for digestive procedures among blacks\u2014and statistically sig-nificant only for nervous system procedures among His- panics. Sensitivity analyses indicate that all main ndings re- ported are robust to (a) inclusion of those aged 65-69; (b)alternative count regression specification to permit over- dispersion; and (c) aggregation of procedure counts to state instead of county level (See Appendix, Supplemental DigitalContent, http://links.lww.com/MLR/A311). Segmented time- series Poisson model indicated similar patterns in postreformchange, with no significant transition period effects for any of the cohorts (See Appendix, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MLR/A311). DISCUSSION We compared prereform and postreform utilization of major therapeutic inpatient surgical procedures predom- inantly scheduled by outpatient referrals among nonelderly MA adults, and found greater overall increases for lower areaincome cohorts compared with the highest area income co- hort, and for Hispanics compared with whites. Before re- form, both blacks and Hispanics had lower rates of theseprocedures compared with whites. We estimated the netchange in procedure use associated with health reform among the nonelderly accounting for secular trends, nding signicant increases for lower area income groups and His-panics and whites but not among blacks or the highest area income group. As 90% of all surgeries came from outpatient physician referral, these ndings suggest a meaningful im-provement in access to outpatient care for the surgeries studied, especially those living in lower income areas, His- panics, and whites. Our ndings of greater net increases in procedure use among lower area income groups and Hispanics are con- sistent with previous randomized 38,39and natural experi- ments of expanded public insurance programs or similarpolicy changes; however, few prior studies have explicitly examined whether increased insurance coverage reduces income or racial/ethnic disparities in access to or use ofcare. 36,40A recent study of Oregon's lottery-selected ex- pansion of Medicaid to uninsured low-income nonelderlyTABLE 2.

Although the 17 surgical procedures examined repre- sent a broad spectrum of inpatient procedures, our main focus here was on their role as markers of access to care. In combining these procedures for evaluating the differentialimpact of health reform in access to care across sub- populations, we recognize heterogeneity in the procedures in other respects, including acuity of conditions targeted, im-pact on quality of life, and value in terms of clinical benet per dollar. Reflecting this heterogeneity, we found consid- erable differences in postreform changes in rates, with sev-eral categories of procedures experiencing decrease inutilization while some others had sharp increases ( Z25%). As estimates of net increases by in dividual procedure categories had wide CIs due largely to small numbers, we cannot rule outpotentially large diffe rences among subpopulations. Never- theless, statistically signicant net increases associated with health reform were found for musc uloskeletal and urinary/gen- ital procedures among lower area income cohorts and whites, and for urinary/genital procedures among Hispanics.TABLE 3.

HRR indicates high referral rate.Medical Care /C15Volume 50, Number 7, July 2012 Reform and Inpatient Utilization r2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins www.lww-medicalcare.com |575For Hispanics, the overall postreform increase in pro- cedure use among the nonelderly was considerably higher than that for their elderly counterparts, particularly for musculoskeletal, urinary/genital, and nervous system proce-dures. For blacks, whereas the changes for both groups weresimilar for musculoskeletal and urinary/genital procedures, the magnitude of the change is large and comparable with that for the nonelderly Hispanics. Therefore, it is the similarincrease in the use of these procedures among the elderly blacks that leads to the results of no signicant net change (for nonelderly) attributable to the reform. Reasons for thesimilar increase among all blacks (elderly and nonelderly) are unclear and merit further examination. There is considerable debate on whether more medical care leads to better health. 43However, most studies of nat- ural experimental policy changes have found that expansions of health insurance result in health improvements for in-dividual health measures or subpopulations. 36Given the natural experimental setting of MA reform, we instead ex- amined disparities in health care utilization and focused on vulnerable subpopulations and selected inpatient procedurecategories for which underutilization of care is known to be associated with uninsurance or underinsurance. Research has documented higher rates of clinically unmet need amongminorities and lower income patients for many inpatient procedures, including those for cardiac, 44cancer,45,46and musculoskeletal22care. Our ndings are among the rst to show that expanded insurance coverage on a population levelis associated with increase in use by such vulnerable pop- ulations. Our study has several important limitations. First, we cannot differentiate overuse of procedures from clinically appropriate use. We suspect that our ndings of increased procedure use among minorities do not reflect overuse, asDartmouth Atlas comparisons of regional differences for Medicare beneciaries for 12 common inpatient surgeries found MA procedure rates were below average for 6, nearaverage for 5, and above average for only 1 procedure. 47 Second, as our data is observational, the possibility of po-tential confounding from unobserved factors remains.However, as we adjust for changes among the elderly, ourestimates are robust to unobserved factors (including practice pattern changes) that affect all age groups. Also, comparison of nonelderly and elderly rates of use may not be clinicallymeaningful for some procedures. However, our ndings do include same-age group comparisons by race/ethnicity and area income cohorts. Further, we did not include individual-level data on insurance status, because of the inability to infer population rates of insurance status by the subgroups of interest from our data on health care users only. Identi-cation of patient race/ethnicity is not necessarily based onpatient self-report and may vary across hospitals; however, as this is likely to affect both nonelderly and elderly patients in each hospital, our methodology of contrasting changesamong nonelderly patients with those for elderly patients provides robustness of ndings to the potential heterogeneity in race/ethnicity identication. Also, in the absence ofdata on individual income, we have used zip code-level in- come as the measure of socioeconomic status; however, thisapproach has been used in numerous previous studies. 31-33 Finally, our focus on the use of inpatient procedures may underestimate use of procedures performed in outpatient settings. Nonetheless our ndings have implications for national health reform (Affordable Care Act, 2010) which shares many key elements with MA health reform.1Notably, before health reform, MA had lower uninsurance and better safety-net funding compared with other states. 48,49Depending on the extent to which similar subpopulations gain from insurance expansion from the national reform, the potentialfor improved access is considerably larger or smaller, as is the potential for higher costs. Our study examined uti- lization only in the rst 2 years after the reform, and there-fore may include sharp increases in utilization from nonelderly patients with prior unmet need. Whether these increases will taper-off in the longer run is unknown. Actualchanges also depend on other factors, including providersupply and practice patterns, which also vary considerably across states. In conclusion, our ndings of signicant postreform expansion in procedure use for Hispanics and lower area income patients are consistent with the relatively larger gains in insurance coverage among these subpopulations. Thesendings suggest potentially improved access to outpatient care and may reflect demand built up before reform when individuals were uninsured. Whether such improvedaccess\u2014a crucially important first step to improving equityin access and outcomes\u2014translates into improved clinical outcomes at a reasonable cost merits further study.

Using comprehensive data from 8 states, we sought to compare inpatient mortality and length of stay by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Methods\u2014We examined all 2007 hospitalizations for acute ischemic stroke in all nonfederal acute care hospitals in Arizona, California, Florida, Maine, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Population was stratified by race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics) and socioeconomic status, measured by median income of patient zip code. For each stratum, we estimated risk-adjusted rates of inpatient mortality and longer length of stay (greater than median length of stay). We also compared the hospitals where these subpopulations received care. Results\u2014Hispanic and black patients accounted for 14% and 12% of all ischemic stroke admissions (N=147 780), respecti vely, and had lower crude inpatient mortality rates (Hispanic=4.5%, blacks=4.4%; all P<0.001) compared with white patients (5.8%). Hispanic and black patients were younger and fewer had any form of atrial fibrillation. Adjusted for patient risk, inpatient mortality was similar by race/ethnicity, but was significantly higher for low-income area patients than that for high-income area patients (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.15). Risk-adjusted rates of longer length of stay were higher among minority and low-income area populations. Conclusions\u2014Risk-adjusted inpatient mortality was similar among patients by race/ethnicity but higher among patients from lower income areas. However, this pattern was not evident in sensitivity analyses, including the use of mechanical ventilation as a partial surrogate for stroke severity. ( Stroke. 2013;44:469-476.)

We examined inpatient mortality as the indicator of case fatality; in addition, length of stay (LOS) was also examined as a secondary patient outcome measure. 12,13 We compared outcomes by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). We examined for systematic differences in the type of hospitals where minority and low-income area patients received care. Methods Data Sources The primary data sources were the state-level inpatient discharge da- tabases (2007) from Arizona, California, Florida, Maine, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas. These cover the universe of all admissions to all nonfederal acute care hospitals. 17 These states were selected based on their sizable minority population and completeness of race and ethnicity data; the proportion of acute ischemic stroke admissions with patient race/ethnicity missing (or coded as unknown) was 2.8% and ranged from 0.3% (Texas) to 7.6% (New York). In ad-dition, we obtained zip code-level data on median household income from the 2000 Census. 18 We obtained data on hospital characteristics from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey (2007).19 Study Population To identify acute ischemic stroke admissions for adults 18 years of age, we followed other recent studies by including admissions with the principal discharge code (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinically Modified) of 433.x1, 434.x1, and 436. 12,13 To minimize confounding from scheduled admissions for discretionary treatment (for instance, carotid endarterectomy), we only considered inpatient admissions arising either from admission to the emergency department or transfer from another acute care facil-ity. To avoid 2 admissions being associated with the same outcome, we excluded hospitalizations that resulted in transfer to another acute care hospital. For comparability of patient outcomes by subpopula-tions, especially by SES, we included admissions of patients who were state residents. From the resulting cohort, we excluded 4.9% admissions with missing key measures; compared with the included cohort, patients in this 4.9% excluded cohort were broadly similar (Appendix in the online-only Data Supplement). Measures The primary outcome measures were inpatient death and LOS of the index hospitalization for acute ischemic stroke. We examined LOS as a dichotomous measure indicating longer LOS (ie, 1=LOS >me-dian LOS) because it is more robust to outliers and skewed distribu-tion. 12 Patient risk factors were characterized by comorbid conditions captured by the secondary discharge diagnosis codes (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinically Modified). 13,20 We identified patients with the following comorbid conditions: atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. 21 Indications for other comorbid conditions were collectively grouped using the Charlson comorbidity index.22 Discharge data from all states included separate indicators of race and ethnicity, which were together used to uniformly define 4 population cohorts: Hispanics, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and others; the others included those with missing race/ethnicity. 23 Given the absence of individual measures of SES, we followed previous re-search and used the census-based median zip code income, matched with patient residence zip code, to stratify patients from each state into 3 groups based on population quartiles 24,25: lowest quartile zip codes (low-income area), second lowest quartile (medium), and top 2 quar - tiles (high).25 On the basis of previous research on the role of hospital characteristics, we examined several structural measures: number of in-patient beds, number of intensive care unit beds, nursing staff (number of patients per nurse), mean daily emergency department admission volume, ownership, teaching status, and safety-net status (defined as >20% of discharges from the hospital covered by Medicaid). 26 Estimation The unit of all analyses was the index patient admission for acute ischemic stroke. We performed bivariate comparisons of patient and hospital characteristics by race/ethnicity and SES. We obtained 2 sets of risk-adjusted estimates of differences in the outcomes across population subgroups stratified by race/ethnicity and SES; in the first, we adjusted for patient risk factors, and in the second, we also ad-justed for hospital characteristics. 12 Each was estimated by hierarchi- cal logistic regression to adjust for clustering within hospitals. We estimated these models for all patients and for subgroups formed by the interaction of race/ethnicity and SES. Standard errors and con-fidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to account for heterogeneity across subpopulations. Statistical significance was defined as P0.05. Across patient risk factors, we found relatively larger differences in age and comorbidity of atrial fibrillation between whites and minori-ties. To assess their relative impact on outcomes, we estimated racial/ethnic differences in outcome rates adjusted for only these 2 factors. Sensitivity Analyses Ideally, we would have liked to adjust for initial stroke severity. In the absence of available data on stroke severity, we performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis adjusted instead for the use of mechanical ventila-tion, which has been previously shown to be a valid proxy for stroke severity. 27 In addition, we also examined whether LOS differences by cohorts were associated with inpatient mortality rate differences; for this, we re-estimated the LOS regression model, including inpatient mortality as a covariate. Because of space limitation, additional findings are reported in an Appendix in the online-only Data Supplement. All the statistical analyses were performed using Stata Version 12.1. This study was approved by the Boston University Institutional Review Board. Results We identified 147 780 hospitalizations for acute ischemic strok e during 2007 in the 8 states. Their distribution by race and ethnicity was whites=67%, blacks=14%, Hispanics=11%, and others=8% (Table 1). Patient Risk Factors by Race/Ethnicity and SES Comparing whites with minorities, we found relatively larger differences in age and prevalence of atrial fibrillation (Table 1). Although 58% of whites were 75 years of age, this propor - tion was 29% and 37% for blacks and Hispanics, respectively (P<0.001). Among individuals 18 to 64 years of age, whites comprised 23% of all admissions, compared with 48% and 40% among blacks and Hispanics, respectively. Prevalence of atrial fibrillation was significantly higher among whites (27%) than blacks (12%) and Hispanics (15%; P<0.001). This pattern in the 2 factors was persistent in every state (Figure). Patients also exhibited considerable differences by SES (Table 1). Low-income area patients were more often younger and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure, but lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation and coronary heart disease. Hospital Characteristics Systematic differences were also found in the hospitals where whites and minorities received care (Table 1).

In terms of hospital size, blacks and low-income area patients more frequently received care in teaching and safety-net hospitals and hospitals with higher bed size, more intensive care unit beds and emergency department volume, compared with whites and Hispanics. Differences in Inpatient Mortality Rate The overall average crude inpatient mortality rate was 5.5%; it was significantly lower for blacks (odds ratio [OR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70-0.80) and Hispanics (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70-0.82) than for whites (Tables 1 and 2). The hierarchical logistic regression model to adjust for patient risk factors indicated very good discrimination (c-statistic=0.74); it also indicates that only a small share (3.0%) of the residual inpatient mortal- ity differences across patients were associated with the hospi-tal where patients were treated (Appendix in the online-only Data Supplement). Adjusting for patient risk factors, inpatient mortality rates for blacks (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94-1.10) and Hispanics (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.07) were similar to that for whites. In assessing the impact of different risk factors in mitigating observed differences in inpatient mortality, we note that whites have higher prevalence of older age, atrial fibril-lation, coronary heart disease, and congestive heart failure; in addition, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, conditions for which prevalence was higher among minorities, were either protective or equivocal of inpatient mortality risk. We also performed comparisons by race/ethnicity separately among patients stratified by SES. Across all 3 SES cohorts, crude inpatient mortality rates were significantly lower for blacks and Hispanics relative to that for whites (Appendix in the online-only Data Supplement). However, adjusted inpatient mortality was generally similar by race/ethnicity among all SES strata; one exception was medium area income Hispanics who had significantly lower mortality (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67\u20140.96) relative to whites. We repeated this comparison analysis separately for each of the 8 states and found similar - ity in risk-adjusted inpatient mortality rates among blacks in all states and among Hispanics in 7 states; however, because of smaller cohort sizes, precision of estimates was lower (Appendix in the online-only Data Supplement). Similar comparison by SES indicated a converse pattern; although crude inpatient mortality rates were similar by SES cohorts, adjusted rate was higher among low-income area patients (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.15) when compared with high-income area patients (Table 2). A similar pattern of higher adjusted inpatient mortality for low-income area patients was found among whites, blacks, and Hispanics, although statisti-cal significance was present only for whites, the largest cohort.

Further, additional adjustment for hospital factors had little impact on the relative differences in inpatient mortality compared with those obtained by adjusting only for patient risk factors. Differences in LOS Although overall mean LOS was 6.2 days, differences by race/ethnicity were significant: whites=5.9, blacks=7.4, and Hispanics=6.3 (P =0.003; Table 1). Correspondingly, rate of longer LOS (LOS >4 days, the median LOS) was signifi-cantly higher among blacks (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.37-1.46) and Hispanics (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.11) compared with whites (Table 3). The regression model to adjust for patient risk factor indicated good discrimination (c-statistic=0.70; Appendix in the online-only Data Supplement). Adjusting for patient risk factors, the relative rate of longer LOS remained higher among blacks (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.31-1.41) and Hispanics (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.14-1.24). This pattern of higher rate of longer stays among minorities was persistent among subpopulations stratified by SES. Further, comparison among all patients of rates of longer LOS indicated higher crude and adjusted rates of longer stay among low SES patients (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.12-1.19) than among high SES patients; this pattern was persistent separately among whites, blacks, and Hispanics (Appendix in the online-only Data Supplement). Further adjustment to also account for differences in hospital characteristics, using hierarchical logistic regression model, indicated little change in the relative rates of longer stay by race/ethnicity and SES. Sensitivity analyses indicated that aforementioned cohort differences in LOS were not associated with differ - ences in inpatient mortality.Table 2.

Re-estimating the regression, with adjust-ment made only for these 2 patient factors, we found similar inpatient mortality by race/ethnicity. In contrast, a converse specification with adjustment made for all patient factors excluding age and presence of atrial fibrillation indicated persistence of lower inpatient mortality among blacks (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.71-0.83) and Hispanics (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78-0.91; Table 4). Sensitivity Analyses When added to the model, the use of mechanical ventilation was highly correlated with inpatient death (OR, 28.9; 95% CI, 27.1-30.9; Appendix in the online-only Data Supplement). The pattern of disparities in adjusted inpatient mortality rates was different from that without including the use of mechani-cal ventilation; adjusted inpatient mortality rates are signifi-cantly lower for blacks and Hispanics (compared with whites) but similar for lower income area patients (compared with high-income area patients). Discussion Comparing patient outcomes from acute ischemic stroke by race/ethnicity and SES, this study indicates that after adjust-ing for patient risk factors: (1) inpatient mortality rates are similar among whites, blacks, and Hispanics, but 8% higher among low-income area patients compared with high-income area patients and (2) rates of LOS >4 days are higher among blacks (+36%) and Hispanics (+19%) compared with whites, and among low-income area patients (+15%) compared with high-income area patients. Minorities and lower income area patients more frequently received care at hospitals with larger bed capacity and patient volumes and those with teaching and safety-net status. However, differences in hospital setting were not associated with differences in patient outcomes by race/ethnicity or SES.Compared with whites, although observed inpatient mor - tality rates were 27% and 25% lower among blacks and Hispanics, respectively, they were almost completely miti-gated after adjusting for patient risk factors. Among the risk factors that differed between whites and minorities, most sig-nificant were older age and atrial fibrillation, both of which were markedly less prevalent among blacks and Hispanics. We found that adjusting only for age and atrial fibrillation contributed to most of the mitigation of differences in inpa-tient mortality by race/ethnicity. Our findings of lower observed inpatient mortality rates among blacks are qualitatively similar to previously reported differences in stroke subtypes among blacks and whites. 14,28 One recent study, based on brain imaging, found fewer car - dioembolic strokes and fewer strokes from large vessel ath-erosclerosis among blacks compared with whites. 28 As in our study, blacks were younger and had a higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus and a lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation, which lends support to the etiologic subtype of small vessel disease. 5,14,29 Comparisons performed for subpopulations stratified by SES produced the same pattern of racial and ethnic differ - ences in observed inpatient mortality rates, which were nearly completely mitigated after adjustment for patient risk factors (except for medium-income area Hispanics). Our findings of higher rates of LOS >4 days among blacks and Hispanics, relative to whites, are consistent with previous findings. 12,13 In contrasting our findings with those from previous stud- ies, we distinguish studies based on population-representative data sources (for instance, administrative data) from those based on convenience data (for instance, registry of volun-tarily participating providers). Evidence from the former data source type indicates mixed patterns of similar 30 or lower13,30,31 inpatient mortality among minorities. Of particular relevance are studies that examined administrative data from some of the same states as in this study. 13,30 Using administrative data from New York (2005-2006), a recent study found lower risk-adjusted inpatient mortality among blacks (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.98) compared with whites. 13 This contrasts with the finding of similar mortality among blacks (OR, 1.0; 95%, Table 4.

Specifically, that study excluded 39% of admissions from 57% of hospitals based on rural hospital location or low hos-pital volume (<10) of black and white stroke patients; in con-trast, no such exclusions are made in the current study because our interest is in epidemiological outcome differences regard-less of the hospital setting where care was received. Evidence using convenience data on disparities in outcomes is also mixed. 12,14,32 On the basis of data from a large national registry of 1181 hospitals, a recent study found lower inpatient mor - tality among blacks and similar mortality among Hispanics, relative to that for whites. 12 Our findings of higher risk-adjusted inpatient mortality among lower income area patients are consistent with most previous studies, although these studies are based on non-US data. 33,34 Mechanisms underlying this association are not well known and seem complex, as noted in the broader literature on disparities by income. 35,36 Unobserved patient factors, includ- ing higher stroke severity or lower health literacy, and different attitudes toward life-sustaining therapies among lower income area populations, may underlie higher risk-adjusted inpatient mortality; however, this finding has also been noted in other studies using more detailed clinical indications, including stroke severity. 37 Our finding of more frequent LOS >4 days among blacks and Hispanics, compared with whites is consistent with pre-vious studies. 12,13 Stratified analysis also indicated that these differences are prevalent among all 3 income area groups. The factors underlying these differences are now well under - stood. Longer LOS among minorities could be attributable to unmeasured confounders of small vessel stroke or socioeco-nomic factors (including insurance coverage) that may affect timing of discharge to home or subacute care. 38 Previous studies have noted the potential role of hos- pital factors in modifying subgroup differences in stroke outcomes. 12,13,34 Racial and ethnic differences in structural characteristics of hospitals found in this study mirror those in the other studies: minority patients are more likely to receive care in larger hospitals (number of beds, number of intensive care unit beds, and admission volume), including teaching and safety-net hospitals. 12,13 However, these differences were not associated with a measurable change in the pattern of differ - ences in outcomes by race/ethnicity or SES. This study has several limitations. First, the administrative data used contain limited clinical information on stroke sever - ity. Sensitivity analysis with use of mechanical ventilation as a proxy indicator of patient severity affects the trends in dispari-ties for adjusted inpatient mortality, indicating lower rates for blacks and Hispanics compared with whites and similar rates by SES. The use of mechanical ventilation as measured in the study may not be an accurate proxy of initial stroke severity because it is not possible to distinguish between mechanical ventilation on admission versus a later complication. When present at admission, it may be a valid marker of severe stroke or perhaps of severe comorbid lung disease which is decom-pensated even by minor stroke. Alternatively, if it results from poor oral hygiene, inadequate dysphagia screening and aspi-ration pneumonia, then adjusting for its presence may in fact adjust away markers of poor stroke care. Nevertheless, these results point to the potential sensitivity of our main findings to unobserved stroke severity. Another limitation is that the diag-nosis codes are not confirmed by patient charts. 39 However, we found that patient differences in only 2 of the risk factors, age and presence of atrial fibrillation, mitigated most of the observed differences in inpatient mortality; additional patient comorbidity indicators did not influence relative differences markedly. Also, our data do not capture important behav-ioral risk factors (smoking, physical activity, and obesity). 2 Not only is smoking strongly associated with stroke severity, but also its prevalence varies considerably by race/ethnicity and SES. Our cases of acute ischemic strokes, identified by administrative diagnosis codes, were not confirmed by patient charts. 40 Another limitation is that our data cannot distinguish first strokes from secondary strokes. Even though secondary strokes are associated with higher mortality, 21 previous evi- dence indicates only a moderate black-white difference (33% vs 30%) in the rate of secondary strokes. 12 Also, our data do not include out-of-hospital strokes. Two previous studies reported similar rates (nearly 10%) of strokes (all subtypes) ascertained only in out-of-hospital settings 6,28; these rates were similar among whites and blacks.28 The accuracy and consis- tency of race and ethnicity information, including the extent to which they are patient reported, are also likely to vary across hospitals. Our selection of the 8 states was partly based on completeness of race and ethnicity data; also, all these states had adopted the current federal guidelines for reporting race and ethnicity information. 17,23 In addition, our measure of SES is not an individual measure but based on area-level (zip code) income; also, zip codes are more heterogeneous than census tract or block area units, 41 the latter are not available in the inpatient discharge data. To summarize, we found that the significantly lower rates of observed inpatient mortality among blacks and Hispanics, compared with that among whites, are primarily associated with differences in patient risk factors; specifically, adjust-ing for younger age and lower rate of atrial fibrillation among blacks and Hispanics completely mitigates the differences in observed inpatient mortality. Also, we found significantly higher risk-adjusted rates among low-income area patients compared with high-income area patients. However, this pat-tern was not evident in sensitivity analyses, including the use of mechanical ventilation as a partial surrogate for stroke severity. Further research in potential differences in patient severity or process of care is needed to identify the sources of this differential outcome rate by race/ethnicity and SES.

The impact of longi-tudinal trajectory patterns from serial sex steroid and gonadotro-phin measurements on the observed associations is unknown todate. Methods We prospectively evaluated 254 elderly men (mean age, 75 /C15 years) of the Framingham Heart Study with up to four serial measurements of serum total Cox proportionalhazard regression models relating baseline hormone concentra-tions and their mean, slope and variation over time (modelled as continuous and categorized into quartiles) to the incidence of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality at5- and 10-year follow-up.Results We observed no association between baseline concen- trations of sex steroids, gonadotrophins and their trajectorieswith incident clinical CVD over 5- and 10-year follow-up.Although higher baseline TT concentrations were associated withlower mortality risk at 5 years (hazard ratio per quartile incre- ment, 0 /C174; 95% condence interval, 0 /C156-0/C198), correction for multiple statistical testing ( P<0/C1005) rendered this association statistically nonsignicant. Repeat analyses at the 10-year follow-up time point also demonstrated no signicant associationbetween sex steroids, gonadotrophins or their trajectories and mortality. Conclusion Investigating longitudinal trajectory patterns of serial sex steroid and gonadotrophin measurements, the presentstudy found no consistent associations with incident clinicalCVD and all-cause mortality risk in elderly men from thecommunity. (Received 17 February 2012; returned for revision 25 April 2012; nally revised 06 June 2012; accepted 9 August 2012) Introduction Emerging data suggest that reduced circulating total testosterone (TT) concentrations in men are associated with increased car-diovascular risk and mortality. 1Longitudinal epidemiological studies have consistently reported positive associations betweenlow serum and hypertension, 2metabolic syn- drome,3, 4type 2 diabetes5and dyslipidaemia.6In contrast to these relations between low circulating TT concentrations in men and increased cardiometabolic risk factor burden, studiesrelating TT concentrations to incident cardiovascular disease(CVD) and mortality have remained inconclusive. While somelongitudinal studies 7-10reported an association between low TT concentrations and increased mortality risk, others like the Mas-sachusetts Male Aging Study 11or Caerphilly study12observed no such associations. Similarly, some longitudinal studies showed inverse associations between testosterone and cardiovascular events in elderly men,13, 14whereas a recent systematic review concluded that there was no association between testosteroneand CVD risk in middle-aged men. 15Furthermore, because a high CVD risk factor burden itself is associated with decreasedTT concentrations, 16there is a possibility of reverse causality when one considers the relations of circulating TT concentra-tions to CVD risk.Correspondence: Robin Haring, Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Lab- oratory Medicine, University 10.1111/cen.12013Analysing biomarker trajectories have previously been shown to offer additional insights into the assessment of the risk ofCVD and mortality. For instance, in the Cardiovascular HealthStudy, a steep decline and extreme variability in dehydroepiand-rosterone sulphate (DHEAS) concentrations were associated with increased mortality risk, whereas the baseline DHEAS concentra- tion itself was not. 17These ndings raise the possibility that information regarding absolute hormone concentrations at asingle point in time may be complemented by analysing serialmeasurements including hormone trajectories. Thus, we analysedup to four serial hormone measurements obtained over a10-year period in elderly men from the original cohort of theFramingham Heart Study (FHS), to investigate longitudinal tra- jectory patterns of sex steroids and gonadotrophins. We hypoth- esized that low baseline and mean concentrations, as well as asteep decline and extreme variability in sex steroids andgonadotrophins are associated positively with incident clinicalCVD and mortality. Methods Study population The FHS is a longitudinal epidemiological study initiated in 1948 in Framingham, Massachusetts, to investigate risk factors for heart disease in a community-based epidemiological cohortdesign. The selection criteria and the study design of the FHShave been described previously. 18Written informed consent was obtained at each examination and the Institutional ReviewBoard of the Boston University Medical Center approved thestudy protocol. The present study focused on men who attendedthe biennial original cohort examination cycles 17 (1981 -1983) through 20 (1987 -1989) with two or more hormone measure- ments. Of the 1401 baseline attendants at examination 20, weexcluded 866 women (our analyses were conned to men), 229men with prevalent CVD, 32 men with missing hormone orcovariate data and 20 men with less than two hormone measure-ments, yielding a nal study sample of 254 men for the presentinvestigation. Measures Single nonfasting blood samples were taken all-day from attend- ees at the original cohort's 17th -20th examination cycles between May 1981 and December 1989 and were stored at/C020\u00b0C until assays of sex hormones and gonadotrophins between October 1984 and March 1990. The maximum storagelength (for only a portion of the samples) was about 5 years.Concentrations of serum TT, estradiol (EST) were measured using radioimmunoassays (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA, USA) in the Boston Universitylaboratory of Dr. Sawin. The interassay coefcients of variationin LH, 6%; and EST, 4%, as previously described. 19 The vast majority of the studied 254 men contributed fourrepeated measurements for TT (two measurements, 4; three, 41; four, 209), DHEAS (two measurements, 55; four, 206), LH (two measure-ments, 4; three, 42; four, 208) and EST four, 205). Socio-demographic, behavioural and anthropometric charac- teristics as well as medical history, laboratory measures andmedication use were assessed by standardized methods at theHeart Study examinations. Clinical CVD was assessed accordingto previously reported standardized criteria [including coronaryheart disease (recognized or unrecognized myocardial infarction,angina pectoris, coronary insufciency or coronary heart diseasedeath), cerebrovascular disease (stroke or transient ischaemic attack) or congestive heart failure] and conrmed, together with information about vital status, by a three-physician adjudicationpanel with the aid of medical histories, physical examinations atthe study clinic, hospitalization records and communicationwith personal physicians. 20 Statistical analyses Clinical CVD and mortality outcomes were assessed prospec- tively over 5- and 10-year follow-up periods starting from the 20th examination cycle (Fig. 1). To understand the nature of sampling bias because of nonattendance at serial exams orbecause of nonrandom measurement of hormones at serialexams, we compared clinical characteristics of men with two ormore serial hormone measurements to those with less than twomeasurements using v 2tests for categorical data or two-sample t-tests for continuous data. We used age- and multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models to relate baseline and mean hormone concentrations and their trajectories over time to clinical CVDincidence and all-cause mortality at the 5- and 10-year follow-up, by assessing (1) baseline level: sex steroid and gonadotrophin concentration from the rst available baseline examination of Fig. 1 Study design. Baseline concentrations of sex steroids and gonadotrophins, as well as covariates were measured at the 20th examination cycle of the Framingham Heart Study. From the 17th to 20th examination cycle, serial hormone measurements were used to assess their mean, slope and variability (separate analyses for each of the hormones). Incident clinical cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality were analysed at the 5- and 10-year follow-up, respectively. \u00a92012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd Clinical Endocrinology (2013), 78, 629-634630 R. Haring et al.examination cycles 17 -20 (most from the 20th examination cycle); (2) mean: average sex steroid and gonadotrophin concen- tration calculated in each individual using measures from atleast two and up to four examination cycles; (3) slope: calculated using at least two available measures and the following regres- sion formula: y i=a i+bixiwhere yiis the predicted hormone concentration in the individual, aiis the hormone concentration at the rst examination, xiis the number of years after the rst examination and biis the hormone concentration's slope; and (4)variability : calculated using SASRMSE (Root Mean Square Error; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) function to estimatethe square root of the variance of the residuals based on at leastthree available measures FSH and LH; n=199 for DHEAS; n=249 for EST). We categorized the different predictor variables 1 -4 into quartiles and included them as a continuous variable into the models. Effects are presented ashazard ratios (HR) and their 95% condence intervals (95%CI). Multivariable modelling included covariates measured in the 20th examination cycle: age, body mass index, smoking, totalcholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure and antihypertensive medication. We conrmed that the proportional hazards assumption was satis-ed by visual inspection of log-log plots and a test based onSchoenfeld residuals. As the probability of experiencing the eventof interest (incident clinical CVD) may be altered by an alterna-tive event (death), we conducted competing risk analyses fordeath in the Cox models relating sex steroids, gonadotrophinsand their trajectories to incident clinical CVD. To identify additional clinical and laboratory parameters predic- tive of incident CVD and all-cause mortality, we modelled baselineclinical and laboratory parameters (age, BMI, smoking status, sys-tolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, type 2 diabetes, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)ratio, and sex steroid and gonadotrophin concentrations) withincident CVD and all-cause mortality at both 5- and 10-yearfollow-up in multivariable models. All statistical analyses were per- formed using SASstatistical software (SAS Institute Inc.). We used a minimal P<0/C1005 to indicate statistical signicance because we evaluated ve different hormones and two outcomes (0 /C105/10). The present study of 254 elderly men from the original cohort ofthe FHS had 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 2 /C143 per quar- tile increment of any sex hormone/gonadotrophin for 10-year riskof incident CVD. For 10-year all-cause mortality, this study had80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 1 /C176 per quartile increment. Results The baseline characteristics of our sample of older men are dis- played in Table 1. Comparing participants included in the pres-ent analysis to the participants not included, we observedstatistically signicant differences with higher lipid levels andblood pressure, as well as a lower prevalence of diabetes and anti-hypertensive medication use in the rst compared with the lattergroup. At the 5-year follow-up, we observed 56 incident clinical CVD cases and 42 deaths. We found no association between con- centrations of sex steroids, gonadotrophins and their trajectorieswith incident clinical CVD (Table 2). Higher baseline TT concen-trations were borderline signicantly associated with lower all-cause mortality risk (HR per quartile increment, 0 /C174; 95% CI, 0/C156-0/C198;P-value, 0 /C1034) in multivariable-adjusted, but not age-adjusted models (HR per quartile increment, 0 /C181; 95% CI, 0/C161-1/C107;P-value, 0 /C1134; Table 2). None of these results met the minimal P<0/C1005 criterion for statistical signicance accounting Table 1.

At the 10-year follow-up, we observed 92 incident clinical CVD cases and 104 deaths. However, repeatanalyses at the 10-year follow-up also showed no consistent sta-tistically signicant associations between sex steroids, gonadotro-phins and their trajectories with incident clinical CVD or all- cause mortality risk (Table 3). Adjusting the analyses for compet- ing risks of incident clinical CVD at the 5- and 10-year follow-upshowed no impact on the observed estimates (data not shown).Similarly, subgroup analyses and gonadotrophins with incident 10-year CVDand all-cause mortality risk in any of the BMI strata (data not shown). Other clinical and laboratory predictors for incident CVD were age and smoking, and for all-cause mortality age andtype 2 diabetes (data not shown). Discussion Leveraging the unique data set and design of the community- based FHS, the present study is the rst to investigate longitudi-nal trajectory patterns of serial sex steroid and gonadotrophinmeasurements and their associations with 5- and 10-year risk of incident clinical CVD and all-cause mortality. We observed noconsistent association of sex steroids, gonadotrophins and theirtrajectories with incident clinical CVD or all-cause mortality riskin 254 elderly men in the community. In contrast to previous longitudinal studies 13, 14and a recent meta-analysis15suggesting inverse associations between testoster- one and cardiovascular events in elderly men over 70 years ofage (with an estimated summary relative risk of 0 /C184 (0/C176-0/C192) per one SD increase in TT), the present and previous other lon-gitudinal studies were not able to detect any statistically signi-cant associations between TT concentrations and incidentCVD. 21-23In a 10-year follow-up of 2084 middle-aged men from the FHS, the results also suggested no association between TT or DHEAS concentrations and incident CVD.21Similarly, we found no consistent associations between baseline sex steroids,gonadotrophins and their longitudinal trajectory patterns with5- and 10-year all-cause mortality risk. A recent meta-analysessummarized the reported associations between low TT concen-trations and increased mortality risk and concluded that theconsiderable between-study heterogeneity related to study and participant characteristics limit the ability to provide valid sum- Table 2. Sex steroids and gonadotrophins in men (in quartiles) and their trajectories associated with incident clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality during models were adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, s ystolic blood pressure and antihypertensive medication. None of these results met the minimal P<0/C1005 criterion for statistical signicance accounting for multiple testing. \u00a92012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd Clinical Endocrinology (2013), 78, 629-634632 R. Haring et al.mary estimates or to draw any rm conclusions.1However, because of the advanced age and small size of the present study sample, competing risks of CVD and mortality risk and thelimited statistical power may potentially explain the lack of asso-ciation in our sample. The present study is the rst to analyse longitudinal trajectory patterns and their association with incident clinical CVD andmortality, but we did not observe any associations of mean hor-mone concentrations, their slope and variability with incident adverse events. In contrast, a previous study reported that a steep decline and extreme variability in DHEAS concentrations, butnot the actual baseline level, were associated with increased all-cause mortality risk. 17However, given the considerable potential for residual confounding (no adjustment was performed forBMI, BP or smoking) in that previous study and the negativending for trajectory patterns as predictor of incident CVD andmortality in the present study, the postulated advantage of serial measurements over a single baseline measure is questionable. The strengths of the present study include the use of four serial measurements of sex steroids and gonadotrophins from awell-characterized community-based sample of elderly men,enabling not only the analyses of baseline concentrations butalso longitudinal trajectory patterns. For the proper interpreta-tion of the present study, some important limitations must also be mentioned. Single nonfasting serum samples that were drawn through out the day at each individual examination were usedto measure concentrations of sex steroids and gonadotrophins.Although we sought to limit artifactual changes in sex hormoneconcentrations across serial examinations by performing mea-surements in one central laboratory, following the same collec-tion protocol, and using the same laboratory assays,measurement bias remains a possibility. However, a recent cross-sectional study of 95 elderly men aged 70 years also found no associations between sex steroid concentrations measured byliquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and prevalentCVD. 24Additionally, we did not measure sex hormone-binding globulin or androgen receptor polymorphisms (that may affectsex hormone concentrations and effects) or assess symptoms oflow TT concentrations for the clinical diagnosis of primary hyp-ogonadism or secondary hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. Finally, the external validity or generalizability of our ndings to other age groups or ethnicities is limited given our study sampleof elderly Caucasian men. In conclusion, the present study showed no association of baseline sex steroids, gonadotrophins and their longitudinaltrajectory patterns with incident clinical CVD and all-causeTable 3. Sex steroids and gonadotrophins in men (in quartiles) and their trajectories associated with incident clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality during 10-year follow-up TT models were adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, s ystolic blood pressure and antihypertensive medication. None of these results met the minimal P<0/C1005 criterion for statistical signicance accounting for multiple testing. \u00a92012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd Clinical Endocrinology (2013), 78, 629-634Assocaition of sex steroids and gonadotropins with CVD and mortality 633mortality in elderly men. Given the relatively small sample size, the advanced age of the study sample and the high rates of CVDand mortality, limited statistical power and competing riskshampered the detection of possible associations. However, thepotential role of sex steroid concentrations in men as useful bio- markers of general health, cardiovascular risk factor burden and subclinical CVD progression warrants further investigation.

We analysed up to five serial measurement s of total testosterone (TT), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), (LH) and total estradiol (EST) in older men in the original cohort of the Framingham Heart Study to determine the short\u00ad (2-years; I ,I 65 person-ob servations in 528 long-term (up to 10-years follow-up; 2520 person-ob servations in 835 individuals with mean baseline age: 71.2 years) clinical correlates of these sex steroids and gonadotro\u00ad pins using multilevel modelling and Generalized Estimating Equations. Age, body mass index and pre-existing type 2 diabetes were inversely related to long-term TT concentrations, whereas higher systolic blood pressure showed a positive association. Furthermore, age and pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) were inversely associated and HDL cholesterol concentrations positively associated with long-term DHEAS concentrations respective ly. Analyses of short-term changes revealed age was inversely related to DHEAS, but positively related to FSH and LH concentrations. Our commun ity-based study identified modifiable correlates of decreasing TT and DHEAS concentrat ions in elderly men, suggesting that maintenance of a low CVD risk factor burden may miti\u00ad gate the age-related decline of these hormones over the late adulthood. Low serum concentrations of total testosterone (TT) in men have been associated with increased cardiome tabolic risk factor burden including a greater prevalence of pidemia (Haring eta/., et al., 2009), as well as mortality risk (Araujo et al., 2007; Laughlin et al., 2008; Haring eta/., 2010b). In addition , prostate cancer patients who undergo long-term androgen deprivation therapy are at greater risk of developing dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hyper\u00ad glycaemia and MetS, suggesting potentially beneficial effects of endogenous TT on cardiovascu lar disease (CVD) risk factor burden (I-Iakimian et al., 2008). But prospective studies relating sex steroids to incident CVD have yielded inconsistent results (Muller et al., 2003b) and an initial trial of testosterone therapy was discontin\u00ad ued after it showed adverse cardiovascular events in the treatment group (Basaria et a/., 20 I 0). Furthermore, the interpretation of temporality of associations is challenging based on cross-sectional data because of the possibility of reverse causality. Thus, low TT concentrations are associ\u00ad ated with incident MetS (Haring eta/., diabetes (Vikan eta!., 2010; Schipf eta/., 2011), whereas these conditions are also associated with decreased TT concentrations (Laaksonen et al., 2005; Corona eta/., 2011). Although it has been widely observed that TT and \u00a9 2012 The Authors International Journal of Andrology @ 2012 European Academy of Andrology lnternacional Journal of Andrology. 2012. 35, 775-782 775 Clinical correlates of sex steroids and gonadotropins in men other sex steroids in men decline with age (Gray eta/., 1991; Harman eta/., 2001; Feldman et al., 2002; Svartberg eta/., 2003), other contributing factors have 2007; multifactorial basis for the decline in circulating TT concentrations in ageing men (Snyder, 2008). Overall, there is a gap in our current knowledge about whether low TT serum concentrations in men are causal or the consequence of CVD. Also, the clinical correlates of longitudina l tracking of TT concentrations in men from the general population have been less well studied (Snyder, 2008). Accordingly, we examined the longitudi \u00ad nal profile of sex steroids and gonadotropi ns in older men from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) using up to five serial hormone measurement s over a 10-year fol\u00ad low-up period, and evaluated the clinical correlates. Spe\u00ad cifically, we assessed both the short-term (2-year) change and the long-term (10-year) tracking for these steroid and non-steroid hormones. Methods Study population The FHS is a longitudinal epidemiological study that was initiated in 1948 in Framingham, Massachusetts, to inves\u00ad tigate risk factors for heart disease in the community. The selection criteria and study design of the original FHS cohort have been described previousl y (Dawber et al., 1951 ). Written informed consent was obtained from attendees at each examination and the Institutional Review Board of the Boston University Medical Center approved the study protocol. The present study focused on men who attended at least two of the biennial exami\u00ad nation cycles 17 (1981-1983) through 21 (1990-1992). We excluded observations with missing outcome or covariate information . We did not use information regarding testosterone therapy or hypogonadism as additional exclusion criteria as such data were not systematica lly collected at these examinat ions. Correlates of short-term change in sex steroids and gonadotrop ins (over any 2-year period) were investigated pooling I 165 person-observations from 528 unique participant s who attended two consecutive examinations. Long-term track\u00ad ing of sex steroids and gonadotropins (over the course of I 0 years) was analysed in 835 unique participants (2520 person-observations) (Fig. I). Laboratory measurements Single non-fasting blood samples were obtained through\u00ad out the day from attendees at the original cohort's 17th - 21st examination cycles between May 1981 and International Journal of Andrology, 2012. 35, 775-782 776 Exam 17 R.

Short-term change in sex steroids and gonadotropins was evaluated in 528 men (1165 person-observations). Long-term tracking of sex steroids and gonadotropins was performed in 835 men who attended up to five senal examination cycles (25>20 person-observa tions). December 1989, and the biosample s were stored at -20 \u00b0C until measurement of sex hormones and gonadotropins between October 1984 to March 1990. The maximum stor\u00ad age length (for only a p01:tion of the samples) was about 5 years. Concentrations of serum TT, DHEAS, follicle estradiol (EST) were measured using radioimmunoassays (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA, USA) in the Boston University laboratory of Dr. Sawin. The interassay coefficients of variation in described (Amin eta/., 2000). Clinical correlates At each FHS examination , socio-demog raphic and behavio\u00ad ural characteristics (such as age, smoking status etc.), as well as medical history and medication use were assessed using standardized interviews. Height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMT) was calculated (kg/m2). Blood pressure (BP) was measured twice in the left arm of the seated subject with a mercury column sphygmomanometer . The average of the two readings was used as the exam BP, and hypertension was defined as systolic BP 2:140 mmHg or a diastolic the self-reported use of antihy\u00ad pertensive medications. Type 2 diabetes was defined by a non-fasting glucose >200 mgldL, or self-reported use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications. Plasma total cho\u00ad lesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrat ions were measured using standard enzymatic methods, as previously described (McNamara & Schaefer, 1987). Pre-existing CVD was defined according to previ\u00ad ously reported standardized FHS criteria (including coro\u00ad nary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, intermittent \u00a9 2012 The Authors International Journal of Andrology \u00a9 2012 European Academy of Andrology R. Haring eta/. claudication or congestive heart failure) and confirmed with the aid of medical histories, physical examinat ions at the study clinic, hospitalization records and communication with personal physicians as previously described (Kannel et nl., 1979). Statistical analyses Correlates of short-term change of sex steroids and gonadotropi ns in men We naturally logarithmically transformed serum DHEAS, FSH, LH and EST concentrations to normalize their distri\u00ad butions. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to determine clinical correlates of short-term change in sex steroids and gonadotropins during a 2-year follow\u00ad up period (Fig. I). In these multi variable models, we related hormone concentrations (dependent variable; each hormone considered individually) to the following clinical covariates (independent variables ): age, BMI, systolic BP, antihypertensive treatment, smoking status, type 2 diabe\u00ad tes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and pre-existing CVD. These variables were chosen based on their previ\u00ad ously reported associations with steroid and non-steroid hormone concentrations in the literature (Travison et al., 2007a; Haring eta/., 2010a). To account for potential temporal trends in sex steroids and gonadotropins across different examination cycles, we carefully adjusted all statistical analyses for examination cycle. Furthermore, we provided boxplots for the median sex steroid and gonado\u00ad tropin concentrations over time for a reference age group of individuals aged 65-75 years at each examination cycle, indicating no large variability across the different exami\u00ad nation cycles (Suppleme ntal Fig. S l ). Interaction terms between age and each clinical covariate were investigated using multivariable models. To analyse patterns of miss\u00ad ingness we compared characteristics of the study sample according to the number of missing examinations (Sup\u00ad plemental Tables S I and S2). Effects are presented as regression coefficients and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Correlates of lor\u00b71g-term tracking of sex steroids and gorzadotropins in men We performed multilevel statistical modelling (SAS PROC MIXED; using an unstructured correlation matrix) to identify clinical correlates of long-term track\u00ad ing of sex hormone concentrations over a 10-year period. Accommodating participants with missing data at some of the serial examinations over the I 0-year follow-up period, this analytical approach allows the maximization of the available number of observations in a longitudinal study design and accounts for a hierarchical data struc\u00ad ture that varies on the individual level. Multivari able \u00a9 2012 The Authors International Journal of Andrology \u00a9 2012 European Academy of Andrology Clinical correlates of sex steroids and gonadotropins in men models incorporated the same set of covariates and inter\u00ad action terms as used in the short-term analyses described above. While change in covariates is captured in the long-term follow-up analysis, the short-term analysis used \"baseline\" covariate data and only the hormone data from the baseline and the subsequent examinat ion cycle. For the paired 2-year data, participants had to attend consecutive examinations while for the 1 0-year data no such sequential follow-up was mandated (not every individual has to attend every examination), which is why the latter approach provided more person observations. We examined and detected statistically sig\u00ad nificant random age effects for DHEAS, FSH, LH and EST, and modelled age as a random and a fixed effect accordingly. We also examined non-linear age effects, by including the 'squared age' term into the regression models and assessing the p-value for the term. As the 'squared age' term was not statistically significant in any of the models, we did not include it in further regression modelling. Graphical representation of long-term sex steroids in men To illustrate the impact o( an individual's risk factor burden on long-term 1T concentrations, graphical dis\u00ad plays show the adjusted (for all significant variables from the long-term analyses) mean TT concentra tions with increasing age stratified by 'high' vs. 'low' risk factor bur\u00ad den. The covariates used to define high and low risk factor status (age, BMI, systolic BP, type 2 diabetes and smoking) were selected on the basis of their statistically significant associations with TT concentrations in the final regression model. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and the figures were generated using Excel (Microsoft Office 2003, Redmond, W A, USA). Results The baseline characteristics of our sample of older men are displayed in Table I. Correlates of short-tem1 change in sex steroids and gonadotropins in men We identified age as the main correlate of short-term change in sex steroids and gonadotropins (Table 2), inversely associated with change in log-DHEAS ([3 per I year increase in age, -0.007; 95o/o CJ, -0.012 to -0.002) and positively associated with change in log-FSH and log-LH concentrations ([3 per I year increase associated with change in 1T concentrations ([3 per one unit increase in International Journal of Andrology , 2012. 35, 775-782 777 Clinical correlates of sex steroids and gonadotropins in men Table 1 Baseline characteristics of the study population with 1 0-year follow-up\" Characteristic Age. years Body mass index. kg/m} Current smoker, % Systolic blood pressure. mmHg Diastolic blood pressure, mmHg Antihypertensive medication. % Hypertension, % Type 2 diabetes, % HDL cholesterol. mg/dl Total cholesterol. mg/dl Ratio total : HDL cholesterol, mg/dL Prevalence of cardiovascular % \u00b1 1.6 34.3 4 (3.9; 5.9) 91.2 (56.8; 137 .0) 9.0 (6 2; 13 4) 8.6 (62; 12 0) 30 2 (213; 39 .2) Data are percentages. mean\u00b1 SO. or median (Q1; 03).

Correlates of long-term tracking of sex steroids and gonadotropin s in men Age, BMI, smoking, systolic BP, hypertension treatment, type 2 diabetes, HDL cholesterol concentrations and pre\u00ad existing CVD were identified as significant correlates of changes in sex steroids and gonadotropins over the I 0-year follow-up period (Tables 2 and 3). With regard to long\u00ad term TT concentrations, we found inverse associatio ns with age, BMI and type 2 diabetes, and a positive associa\u00ad tion with systolic BP respectively. The interaction between age and smoking was statistically significant , indicating that the inverse effect of age on TT concentrations varies according to smoking status (smokers have a greater age-related decline in TT concentrations compared with non-smokers). Consistent with the analyses of short-term change, age was inversely associated with log-DHEAS con\u00ad centrations and positively associated with log-LH concen\u00ad trations tn long-term analyses. Furthermore, HDL cholesterol concentrations were positively and pre-existing CVD inversely associated with log-DHEAS concentrations in long-term analyses. Other correlates and their direction\u00ad ality are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Finally, Fig. 2 illustrates the conjoint effect of multiple risk factors (categorized into two groups for example) on TT concentra tions over the I 0-year period. Discussion Our longitudinal study identified various clinical corre\u00ad lates of short-term changes and long-term tracking of sex steroids and gonadotrop ins in older men respectively. Analyses of short-term changes revealed age as inversely related to DHEAS, but positively related to FSH and LH concentrations. Age, BMI and type 2 diabetes were inver\u00ad sely related to long-term TT concentrations, whereas higher systolic BP showed a positive association. Thus, our study offers important insights into the correlates of long-term progression of sex steroids and gonadotropins in community-dwelling older men _over their late adult\u00ad hood. Our study confirms previous longitudinal data report\u00ad ing age as the main correlate of sex steroids and gonado\u00ad tropins in men (Gray and DHEAS (Cappola eta!., eta/., 1997; Lapauw et al., 2008) and LH et al., 1997; Lapauw et al., 2008; Wu eta/., 2008) concentrations. The fact that age was the only consistent correlate in our analyses of short-term changes may be explained by the \u00a9 2012 The Authors International Journal of Andrology \u00a9 2012 European Academy of Andrology R.

But besides ageing \u00a9 2012 The Authors International Journal of Andrology \u00a9 2012 European Academy of Andrology alone, the clinical correlates of long-term TT concentra\u00ad tions identified in this study are consistent with previous studies reporting visceral obesity (Derby et TT concentra\u00ad tions. In contrast to previous studies reporting an inverse association between TT concentrations and BP among middle-aged men (Barrett-Connor & Khaw, 1988; Yarnell et al., 1993; Tork.Jer et al., 2011 ), the present study is the first to report a positive association between systolic BP and TT among elderly men, whereas others did not observe any association at all (Zmuda et al., 1997; Khaw eta/., 2007). However, these inconsistencies may relate to differences in study design, study sample, characteristics of the study population including age and underlying comor\u00ad bidity or confounders adjusted for. Concerning DHEAS concentrations, a 9-year follow-up of 989 older men and women (mean age 85.2 years) from the Cardiovascular Health Study also showed that pre-existing CVD was asso\u00ad ciated with greater incident DHEAS decline (Sanders eta/., 2010). Furthermore, our finding of a positive association between HDL cholesterol and DHEAS concentrations in tncemarional Journal of Andrology, 2012, 35, 775-782 779 Clinical correlates of sex steroids and gonadotropins in men long-term analyses was consistent with previous results from small cross-sec tional studies (Haffner eta/., 1993; Yasui et n/., 2008). Special attention belongs to our finding that BMI showed an inverse association with TI concentrations. It has been previously shown that a 4-5 kg/m2 increase in BMI is associated with declines in IT concentrations comparable to that associated with approximately 10 years of ageing (Travison et al., 2007a). Furthermore, we observed, consistent with previous longitudinal studies that pre-existing type 2 diabetes (Laaksonen et nl., 2005; Corona et nl., 2011) and pre-existing CVD (Sanders eta/., 2010) are associated with lower IT and DHEAS concen\u00ad trations. Given the previously shown associations of low TT and DHEAS concentrations with incident type 2 diabe\u00ad tes Vikan eta/., 2010) and pre-existing CVD (Sarrett-Connor et al., 1986) respectively, the present results provide further evidence for bidirectional influences between sex steroids and chronic diseases (Yeap, 2009). Our reported positive associations between age and LH concentrations and also between smoking and LJ-1 con\u00ad centrations confirms previous cross-sec tional findings from the European Male Ageing Study among 3,220 men aged 40-79 years (Wu et al., 2008) and extends them using serial longitudinal observation s. As LH stimulates the Leydig cells to secrete testosterone and the quantity of testosterone secreted increases approximately in direct proportion to the amount of LH available, the effects of smoking are tightly linked for both steroid and non-ste\u00ad roid hormones in men (Mendelson eta/., 2003); which could possibly explain the observed positive associations between current smoking, LH (Wu eta/., 2008) and TT (Vermeulen et al., 1996; Wu et al., 2008). Strengths and limitations The strengths of the present investigation include the use of multilevel modelling in a unique community-based sample of older men with up to five serial measurements of sex steroids and gonadotropin s over a 10-year period. Some important limitations also have to be mentioned. First, we used single serum samples and radioimmunoas\u00ad says to measure circulating steroid and non-steroid hormone concentra tions. However, because changes were related to baseline measures, the necessity of repeated test\u00ad ing at single time points to characterize borderline hor\u00ad mone concentration s does not apply to our study aims (Rosner et nl., 2007). Furthermore, we sought to limit artifactual changes in sex steroids and gonadotropins across serial examinat ions by performing measurements in one central laboratory, following the same collection pro\u00ad tocol, and using the same laborator y assays for serum International Journal of Andrology, 2012, 35, 775-782 780 R. Haring et a/. samples that were stored at -70 \u00b0C. In addition, we care\u00ad fully adjusted all our analyses for \"examination cycle\" to account for potential measurement bias. Second, we did not measure sex-hormone binding globulin and were therefore not able to examine its correlates and interplay with the identified correlates of steroid and non-steroid hormone concentrations in men. Third, the external validity or generalizability of our findings to other populations, age groups or ethnicities is limited because of a community-based study sample of predominantly white older Caucasian men. Conclusions Given the accumulat ing evidence suggesting that low sex steroid concentrations in men may be associated with greater cardiome tabolic risk, it is crucial to characterize their correlates. But the identified correlates influencing long-term steroid and non-steroid hormone concentra\u00ad tions in older men also constitute major cardiometabolic risk factors associated with CVD onset and progression. Thus, reverse causation might explain some of the observed associations in. the literature, wherein adverse cardiometabolic risk factor profiles influence (lower) TT concentrations, which in turn may affect cardiometabolic risk factor burden. To further elucidate the potential role of low TT as a causal CVD risk factor (and the direction of causality), future research from large randomize d con\u00ad trolled clinical trials of testostero ne replacement therapy is needed. However, the present findings assert that pre\u00ad vention strategies should focus on health maintenance including a low cardiometabolic risk factor burden, instead of testosterone replacement therapy for improving CV health and lowering CVD risk.

Recent genome-wide association studies have identified several novel genetic loci associated with these two traits. However, the association between these loci and breast cancer risk is unknown. Methods: In this study, we investigated 19 and 17 newly identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the ReproGen Consortium that have been associated with age at menarche and age at natural menopause, respectively, and assessed their associations with breast cancer risk in 6 population-based studies among up to 3,683 breast cancer cases and 34,174 controls in white women of European ancestry. In addition, we used these SNPs to calculate genetic risk scores (GRSs) based on their associations with each trait. Results: After adjusting for age and potential population stratification, two age at menarche associated SNPs (rs1079866 and rs7821178) and one age at natural menopause associated SNP (rs2517388) were associated with breast cancer risk (p values, 0.003, 0.009 and 0.023, respectively). The odds ratios for breast cancer corresponding to per-risk-allele were 1.14 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.24), 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.15) and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.20), respectively, and were in the direction predicted by their associations with age at menarche or age at natural menopause. These associations did not appear to be attenuated by further controlling for self-reported age at menarche, age at natural menopause, or known breast cancer susceptibility loci. Although we did not observe a statistically significant association between any GRS for reproductive aging and breast cancer risk, the 4thand 5th highest quintiles of the younger age at menarche GRS had odds ratios of 1.14 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.28) and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.27), respectively, compared to the lowest quintile. Conclusions: Our study suggests that three genetic variants, independent of their associations with age at menarche or age at natural menopause, were associated with breast cancer risk and may contribute modestly to breast cancer risk prediction; however, the combination of the 19 age at menarche or the 17 age at natural menopause associated SNPs did not appear to be useful for identifying a high risk subgroup for breast cancer. Introduction A younger age at menarche and an older age at meno- pause are well-established risk factors for the develop- ment of breast cancer [1]. In the general population, the risk of breast cancer decreases by 10% for each 2-yeardelay in menarche [2] but increases by 3% for each year that menopause is delayed [3]. These associations are consistent with the hypothesis that breast cancer risk is related to the extent of steroid hormone exposure dur- ing a woman 's reproductive years, which drives breast mitotic activity and determines the probability of tumorigenic somatic events [4]. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) several new common genetic loci* Correspondence: chunhe@iupui.edu 1Department of Public Health, Indiana University School of Medicine, 980 West Walnut Street, R3-C241, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the articleHeet al .Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R54 http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/2/R54 \u00a9 2011 He et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Four independent GWAS of age atmenarche have identified two novel loci at LIN28B and 9q31.2 [5-8], and two GWAS of age at natural meno-pause have identified four novel loci on chromosomes 5,6, 19, and 20 [5,9]. Most recently, the ReproGen Con- sortium, which consisted of these initial GWASs and many additional studies, has conducted expanded meta-analyses for age at menarche [10] and age at naturalmenopause [11] and reported more new loci identifiedfor each trait. Given the well-established associations ofage at menarche and age at natural menopause withbreast cancer risk, we set out to assess whether thesecommon genetic loci influence breast cancer risk and whether a genetic risk score (GRS) for these reproduc- tive events might be useful for identifying a high-risksubgroup for breast cancer. Furthermore, since thereproductive risk factors have been observed to be dif-ferentially associated with breast cancer by tumor histo-logical subtypes [12-16], we assessed these geneticassociations by tumor histological subtypes defined byestrogen receptor (ER) status. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of six popula- tion-based studies to investigate the association betweengenetic loci associated with age at menarche or age atnatural menopause and breast cancer risk. We assessed19 and 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) thathave been previously reported to be linked to age atmenarche [10] and age at natural menopause [11],respectively, among up to 3,683 breast cancer cases and 34,174 controls in women of European ancestry and evaluated whether these SNPs were differentially asso-ciated with breast cancer subtypes defined by ER statusin two studies in which such data were available. Materials and methods Study population The ReproGen Consortium was formed by more than 30 studies in the US and Europe to investigate the genetics of reproductive aging traits [10,11]. Ouranalysis used data from six population-based studies from the ReproGen Consortium: the Nurses 'Health Study (NHS), the Women 's Genome Health Study (WGHS), the SardiNIA Breast Cancer Study (SardiNIA),the Rotterdam Study I and II (RSI+II), the FraminghamHeart Study (FHS), and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC). Each study had at least 200 breast cancer cases. Four studies were prospectivecohort studies, one was a nested case-control study, andone was a case-control study.

As most of theparticipants in these studies were European whites, werestricted analyses to women of European ancestry. Weexcluded subjects with missing information on age. Twostudies (NHS and WGHS) provided information on the ER status of the breast tumors for a subset of the cases. This information was extracted from medical records.Each study was approved by the relevant local institu-tional review boards. Genotype data We analyzed genotypes for 19 and 17 independent SNPswith reported associations with age at menarche and age at natural menopause, respectively, in the ReproGen Consortium, in which all SNPs achieved genome-widesignificance in the meta-analysis of each trait (combinedstage 1 and replication Pvalue of less than 1 \u00d7 10 -8) [10,11]. None of these SNPs has been reported to beassociated with breast cancer risk in previous GWASand this is likely because of the very stringent Pvalue threshold used to declare genome-wide significance (usually, Pvalues were less than at least 1 \u00d7 10 -7). As positive controls, 10 SNPs with consistently reported Table 1 List of participating studies and number of case and control subjects Study acronymStudy name Study design Case subjects (n= WGHS (29.8) 909/190 22,205 (65.0) (61.5) (22.0) - 674 (2.0) 1,483 (3.9) RSI+II Rotterdam Study I and II Prospective cohort 216 (5.9) - 4,261 (12.5) 4,477 (11.8) FHS Framingham Heart Study Prospective cohort 207 (5.6) - 3,698 (10.8) 3,905 (10.3)ARIC Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities StudyProspective cohort 207 (5.6) - 2,194 (6.4) 2,401 (6.3) Data are presented as the number (percentage) of cases, controls, and all subjects.

All 46 SNPs are listed inT a b l eS 1o fA d d i t i o n a lf i l e2 .G e n o t y p e su s e di nt h i sanalysis have been previously described [10,11]. Com-plete genotype data from a total of up to 3,683 casesand 34,174 control subjects were available for analysis after the exclusions described in the 'Study population ' section. Breast cancer risk factors The six studies from the ReproGen Consortium pro-vided information on one or more of the following riskfactors for breast cancer: age (continuous, at study entryor diagnosis), age at menarche (continuous, between 9 and 17 years), age at natural menopause (continuous, between 40 and 60 years), age at first live birth (lessthan 20, 20 to 24, 25 to 29 or no birth, at least 30years), family history of breast cancer in first-degreerelatives (yes/no), alcohol consumption (less than 5, 5 to15, 15 to 30, at least 30 g/day), parity (0, 1 to 2, at least3), menopausal hormone therapy (ever/never), oral con-traceptive (OC) use (ever/never), and adult body mass index (BMI) (continuous). Genetic risk score computation The GRS was calculated on the basis of the 19 and 17 independent SNPs identified in previous studies as beingassociated with age at menarche and age at naturalmenopause, respectively [10,11]. As a younger age atmenarche and an older age at menopause are indepen- dently associated with an elevated breast cancer risk, we computed separate GRSs for a younger age at menarcheand an older age at natural menopause. The risk allelewas defined as an allele that was associated with ayounger age at menarche or an older age at naturalmenopause. Two methods were used to determine theGRS: a simple count method (count GRS) and aweighted method (weighted GRS). We assumed an addi- tive genetic model for each SNP, applying a linear weighting of 0, 1, or 2 to genotypes containing 0, 1, or 2risk alleles, respectively. The count method assumes thateach SNP contributes equally to the risk of breast can-cer. The count GRS was calculated by simply summingthe number of risk alleles of each SNP. For the weightedGRS, each SNP was weighted by b-coefficients obtained from the replication studies of recent meta-analyses of two traits [10,11]. The weighted GRS was calculated by multiplying each b-coefficient by the number of corre- sponding risk alleles (0, 1, or 2) and then summing theproducts. To simplify interpr etation and facilitate com- parison with the count GRS, the weighted GRS wasfurther divided by twice the sum of the b-coefficients and then multiplied by the total number of risk alleles.To provide a positive control and also to control forpotential confounding by known breast cancer-asso- ciated genetic variants, a count GRS was computed onthe basis of the 10 SNPs with consistently analysis In each of the six studies, we performed logistic regres-sion to evaluate the association with breast cancer foreach of the 46 candidate SNPs, assuming an additivegenetic model. Logistic regression was also used to ana-lyze the association between GRS and breast cancer byincluding both GRSs for age at menarche and age at natural menopause in the model as the main effects. The GRSs were modeled as continuous variables orcategorized into quintiles, and the cutoff points forquintiles were based on the WGHS population, which isthe largest prospective cohort population among all par-ticipating studies. This approach was applied to each ofthe six participating studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95%confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from logistic regression. To control for potential confounding by population stratification, we adjusted for the top princi-pal components of genetic variation chosen for eachstudy. We adjusted for age in the main model. Toexamine whether the genetic association of each of thecandidate SNPs or GRSs with breast cancer is mediatedthrough the onset of menarche or natural menopause,we then adjusted for self-reported age at menarche and age at natural menopause in the main model. Other conventional risk factors for breast cancer - includingage at first live birth, family history of breast cancer infirst-degree relatives, alcohol consumption, parity,menopausal hormone therapy, OC use, and adult BMI -were further included in the model to control for poten-tial confounding in studies which had such data avail-a b l e .T oe x a m i n ew h e t h e rt h e s eg e n e t i ca s s o c i a t i o n s differ by breast cancer subtypes, in each of the two stu- dies that provided information on ER status, we theninvestigated the genetic association of each of the candi-date SNPs or GRSs with breast cancer in subgroup ana-lysis by ER histological status (positive or negative). Forest plots were used to present study-specific ORs and 95% CIs. We then performed meta-analyses byusing the fixed-effects model to estimate summary ORs from study-specific estimatesthat were weighted by the inverse of the variance of each study. As the meta-ana-lyses restricted to prospective cohort studies or case-control studies yielded similar results, we present resultsfrom only the meta-analysis of all six participating stu-dies. We also tested the heterogeneity of associationsacross studies as well as across different tumor subtypesby using the Q test [20].Heet al .Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R54 http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/2/R54Page 3 of 15All statistical analyses were performed by using SAS version 9.1 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,USA). Power calculations were carried out by usingQuanto (University of Southern California, Los Angeles,CA, USA). All Pvalues were based on two-sided tests and were considered statistically significant if less than 0.05. Because SNPs were selected on the basis of an a priori hypothesis, adjustments for multiple comparison tests were not performed. Results The six participating studies contributed 3,683 breastcancer cases and 34,174 controls of self-reported whitewomen of European ancestry (Table 1), all with available data on age and the 46 candidate SNPs, and at least one of the conventional risk factors considered. Of the 3,683cases, about 52% were from the four prospective cohortstudies (WGHS, RSI+II, FHS, and ARIC), about in NHS, andabout 18% were from the population-based case-controlstudy in SardiNIA. ER status was known for 2,087 casesin the NHS and the WGHS. On average, compared with the controls, the cases had a younger age at menarche and an older age at natural menopause. The expectedassociations with breast cancer were generally observedfor the conventional risk factors across all of the studies(Table S2 of Additional file 3). The associations of the46 candidate SNPs with age at menarche or age at nat-ural menopause in the six studies were consistent withthe original findings from the two meta-analyses [10,11]. Table 2 shows the risk allele frequency and the corre- sponding per-risk-allele OR of breast cancer for each ofthe 46 candidate SNPs. The results are arranged inorder of the strength of statistical significance ( Pvalue). The allele frequency for each SNP in the controls wassimilar to those reported for populations of Europeandescent [21-23]. After adjusting for age and potentialpopulation stratification, we found that, among the 19 candidate SNPs for a younger age at menarche, two SNPs, rs1079866 and rs7821178, were significantly asso-ciated with breast cancer risk and had correspondingper-risk-allele ORs of 1.14 (96% CI = 1.05 to 1.24; P value = 0.003; Pfor heterogeneity = 0.37) and 1.08 (95% to 1.15; Pvalue = 0.009; Pfor = 0.43), respectively. The rs1079866 is located about250 kb away from the INHBA gene on chromosome 7, whereas SNP rs7821178 is about 181 kb away from the PXMP3 gene (also known as PEX3 ) on chromosome 8. The strongest GWAS hit for age at menarche,rs7759938 at LIN28B on chromosome 6, was not found to be associated with breast cancer risk ( Pvalue = 0.60). Of the 17 candidate SNPs associated with an older ageat natural menopause, one SNP, rs2517388, was signifi-cantly associated with breast cancer risk with a per-risk-allele OR of 1.10 (95% CI = 1.01 to = intro- nic SNP in the ASH2L gene on chromosome 8. The study-specific and summary ORs for the three associatedSNPs are shown in Figure 1. Further adjustment forconventional risk factors - including age at menarche, age at natural menopause, age at first live birth, family history of breast cancer in firs t-degree relatives, alcohol consumption, parity, menopausal hormone therapy, OCuse, and adult BMI - did not change the results substan-tially. For candidate loci for age at menarche and age atnatural menopause, the findings did not differ materiallywhen we further adjusted for known breast cancer-asso-ciated SNPs. To evaluate the combined effect of candidate SNPs on breast cancer risk, we calculated a GRS for each trait byusing either a count GRS or a weighted GRS approach.The mean values of count and weighted GRSs were20.41 and 20.03, respectively, for age at menarche and16.21 and 14.32, respectively, for age at natural meno-pause (Table 3). Based on the count GRS for a youngerage at menarche, the OR for breast cancer associated with each point scored, corresponding to 1 risk allele, was 1.01 (95% CI = 1.00 to 1.03) after age and potentialpopulation stratification were adjusted for. ORs did notincrease linearly across quintiles of GRS for age atmenarche ( Pfor trend = 0.06). Compared with women in the lowest quintile, women in the fourth and fifthquintiles had ORs for breast cancer of 1.14 (95% CI =1.01 to 1.28) and 1.13 (95% CI = 1.00 to 1.27), respec- tively. Results were similar when analyses were per- formed by using weighted GRS. Overall, we did notobserve statistically signif icant associations between breast cancer risk and age at natural menopause wheneither count or weighted GRS was used. In secondary analyses, we then determined whether the associations of the 46 candidate SNPs with breastcancer vary across tumor subtypes defined by ER status in the NHS and the WGHS (Table 4). For the two SNPs (rs1079866 and rs7821178) that had reported associa-tions with age at menarche and that were associated with overall breast cancer risk, we found no statisticallysignificant evidence that the associations differed ER +tumors (per-allele OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.41) than with ER-tumors (per-allele OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.38). Of note, one SNP thathad a reported association with age at menarche,rs17188434, had a significantly stronger association withER -tumors (per-allele OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.15 than with ER+tumors heterogeneity = 0.035).

When the count GRS for age at menarche orage at natural menopause was applied to ER +and ER-breast cancer separately, the trend in the OR for ER+ tumors was very similar to that for overall breast cancer.The ER -tumor data suggested a somewhat different pat- tern, although the statistical power was limited for thissubtype (Figure 2). Of the 10 candidate SNPs with consistently reported associations with breast cancer risk, five SNPs(rs11249433, rs3803662, rs2981582, rs13387042, and rs999737) appeared to have a stronger association with ER +tumor than ER-tumors, and rs3803662 reached 0.008) with per-risk-allele ORs 1.26 (95% CI = 1.16 to 1.37) and0.98 (95% CI = 0.82 to 1.16) for ER +and ER-tumors,Table 4 Association of candidate single-nucleotide polymorphism loci and risk of breast cancer by estrogen receptor status in the Nurses?

Two breast cancer candidate SNPs, rs1045485 and rs3817198, did not show statisti-cally significant association s with overall risk. However, rs1045485 appeared to have a stronger association withER -tumors (per-allele OR = 1.20; 95% CI = ER+tumors Pfor heterogeneity = 0.35), and rs3817198 was associated with a decreased risk of ER-tumors (per- allele OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 1.04) but anincreased risk of ER +tumors (per-allele Pfor heterogeneity = 0.047). In these analyses, we further confirmed statistically significant associations with breast cancer risk for 8 ofthe 10 candidate SNPs that were identified previously in published GWAS of breast cancer (most Pvalues were less than 0.001) (Table 2). We did not observe a statisti-cally significant association for either LSP1 -rs3817198 or CASP8 -rs1045485 (both with Pvalues of 0.13) in our study, although the direction of the associations wasconsistent with that of previous reports [21,22]. We alsocalculated, as a positive control, a count GRS based onthese 10 SNPs. We found that each score point increase, corresponding to one-risk-allele increase, was signifi- cantly associated with an OR of 1.13 (95% CI = 1.11 to1.15) for breast cancer (Table 3). Compared withwomen in the lowest quintile, women in the highestquintile had an OR for breast cancer of 1.89 (95% CI =1.67 to 2.14). For this GRS, the trend in log odds wassignificantly steeper for ER +than for ER-tumors ( Pfor heterogeneity < 0.001), and across quintiles was no longer monotonic in ER-tumors (Figure 2). Discussion In this large meta-analysis of six population-based stu- dies, we investigated whether 19 loci linked with age atm e n a r c h ea n d1 7l o c il i n k e dw i t ha g ea tn a t u r a lm e n o -pause were associated with breast cancer risk among upto 3,683 breast cancer cases and 34,174 controls. We found that two SNPs with reported associations with a g ea tm e n a r c h ea n do n eS N Pw i t har e p o r t e da s s o c i a -tion with age at natural menopause were significantlyassociated with breast cancer risk. However, no statisti-cally significant associati ons were found for GRSs that combined all 19 or 17 loci associated with each trait,although the association for age-at-menarche GRS wasmarginally statistically significant. We confirmed most of the candidate loci for breast cancer which were iden- tified in previous GWAS. Some of these associationsappeared to differ by tumor subtypes defined by ERstatus. In our analyses, most of the candidate SNPs, including t h es t r o n g e s tG W A Sh i tf o ra g ea tm e n a r c h eo ra g ea tnatural menopause, were not found to be associatedwith breast cancer risk. This is not necessarily surprisinggiven that age at menarche and age at natural meno- pause are relatively weak risk factors [2,3], and all candi-date SNPs collectively explain only a small portion ofthe variation of each trait [10,11]. However, two candi-date SNPs for age at menarche, rs1079866 andrs7821178, and one candidate SNP for age at natural menopause, rs2517388, were found to be associated with breast cancer risk. These associations were notattenuated after we further adjusted for self-reportedage at menarche and age at natural menopause, suggest-ing these three genetic loci were associated with breastcancer risk independently of their associations with ageat menarche or age at natural menopause. It is possiblethat these genetic loci have pleiotropic effects on repro- ductive timing as well as other biological processes lead- ing to breast cancer, and the observed associationsmight be due largely to other biological consequences ofthese risk variants that do not manifest themselves aschanges in age at menarche or age at natural meno-pause. Alternatively, it is also possible that the relativelycrude assignment of these reproductive events to a sin-gle chronological year is not sufficiently accurate to cap- ture the biological effect of these processes on breast cancer risk and the genetic variants contribute indepen-dent information on the underlying biological risk. Thethree candidate SNPs also co ntributed to breast cancer risk independently of the kn own susceptibility loci for breast cancer, as further adjustment for breast cancerloci did not materially alter the results. We found statistically signif icant evidence of associa- tion with breast cancer for eight of the 10 breast cancer susceptibility The direction and magnitude of these associations were consistent with those of previousreports [17,18,22-25]. We did no t observe a statistically significant association for either LSP1 -rs3817198 or CASP8 -rs1045485. However, these two SNPs had rela- tively small reported effects that our study might nothave been able to detect. When the 10 candidate SNPswere combined by using a polygenic risk score, the rela-tive risk for women in the highest quintile was abouttwice that in the lowest quintile, and this is in accor-dance with other published results [19,26]. In this study,none of the 10 breast cancer susceptibility loci was sig- nificantly associated with age at menarche or age at nat- ural menopause, and this is in line with a previousreport [27]. Given that most of the candidate loci for age at menarche and age at natural menopause were not asso-ciated with breast cancer risk, it is not surprising thatthere were no statistically significant associations for thepolygenetic risk scores that combined all candidate lociHeet al .Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R54 http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/2/R54Page 11 of 15f o re a c ht r a i t .T oc o n d u c ta post hoc and exploratory analysis, we created a polygenetic risk score by includingonly the three candidate loci associated with either ageat menarche or age at natural menopause and withbreast cancer risk and found that each risk allele incre-ment was associated with an approximately 17% increased risk for breast cancer. Women with four or more risk alleles had an approximately 60% increasedrisk for breast cancer in comparison with those withtwo risk alleles or less. When we further combined thethree associated SNPs with the 10 breast cancer suscept-ibility loci to create a polyg enetic risk score, each risk allele increment was associated with an approximately18% increased risk for breast cancer. For women with 14 or more risk alleles (the highest quintile), the risk for breast cancer increased threefold in comparison withthose with 10 or less (the lowest quintile). Because theformer group constitutes approximately 20% of thestudy population, the GRS that combines the three can-didate SNPs for age at menarche and age at naturalmenopause and the identified breast cancer susceptibil-ity loci might be useful for identifying a subgroup of women with a high genetic risk for breast cancer. Further research is needed to confirm this finding. It has been hypothesized that the risk of ER +breast cancer is positively associated with a woman 's cumula- tive lifetime exposure to endogenous ovarian hormones[28]. A younger age at menarche [12,15,29] and an olderage at menopause [30] have been observed to be moreconsistently associated with ER +than ER-tumors. In this report, we found that candidate loci for age at menarche and age at natural menopause may also bedifferentially associated wi th tumor subtypes defined by ER status. Of the three candidate loci that were foundto be associated with overall breast cancer risk,rs1079866 was more strongly associated with ER + tumors, rs7821178 was equally associated with both,whereas rs2517388 was more strongly associated with ER -tumors, although differences were not statistically significant. Importantly, two candidate loci for age atmenarche, rs17188434 and rs17268785, had significantlydifferent associations with ER +and ER-tumors. Whereas both SNPs were not significantly associatedwith overall and ER +breast cancer, the former showed a statistically significant positive association with ER- tumors, whereas the latter showed a statistically signifi- cant inverse association with ER-tumor. These findings provide further support for the notion that ER+and ER- tumors are the result of different etiologic pathways[31]. Although common genetic variants that influence the intermediate phenotypes or risk factors have beenhypothesized to subsequently affect disease risk, few stu-dies have assessed the association between these geneticvariants and disease risk or, furthermore, whether these associations are mediated through the intermediate phe-notypes. Chen and colleagues [32] investigated obesity-linked genetic variants in r elation to breast cancer risk but found no statistically significant association. To ourknowledge, ours is the first s t u d yt oe v a l u a t et h ea s s o - ciations of candidate loci for age at menarche and age at natural menopause with breast cancer risk. One of thestrengths of our study is the relatively large combinedsample size achieved through international collabora-tion. We had adequate statistical power (80%) to detectan OR of 1.12 for SNPs with a minor allele frequency(MAF) of 0.10 and an OR of 1.09 for SNPs with anM A Fo f0 . 2 0 .H o w e v e r ,o u ra n a l y s i so fE R +tumors was less adequately powered, as the ER status was not avail- able for all cases, and the study had limited statisticalpower for ER -tumors. One limitation in our study is the multiple comparisons th at could lead to false-posi- tive results. Although none of the candidate SNPs witha reported association with age at menarche or age atnatural menopause survived Bonferroni correction inthe test of breast cancer asso ciation, this correction is considered to be overly conservative given that the can- didates were chosen on the basis of promising hypoth-eses. Another potential limitation of our study comesfrom differences in the study population and designsand methods of collecting risk factors and genetic mar-ker data across studies. However, the findings were gen-erally consistent across studies, arguing for therobustness of our results. Finally, as our analyses were restricted to women of European ancestry, results from this study may not be generalizable to other ethnicgroups. Conclusions In summary, in this large analysis of the association ofseveral novel candidate loci for age at menarche and ageat natural menopause with breast cancer risk, we observed that three loci - two for age at menarche and one for age at natural menopause - were significantlyassociated with breast cancer risk independently of theirassociations with each trait and independently of knownbreast cancer susceptibility loci. These associations maydiffer by tumor subtypes defined by ER status. A combi-nation of all 19 loci associated with age at menarche or17 loci associated with age at natural menopause did not appear to be helpful for identifying a high-risk sub- group for breast cancer.

Lawler1,4 1Pharmaco-epidemiology Group, Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center, VA Cooperative Studies Program, VA Boston Healthcare System;2Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine;3Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health; and4Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts Background. Observational studies linking proton pump inhibitor (PPI) exposure with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) have reported either modest or no associations. Accordingly, we studied PPI exposure and CAP in veteran patients, using a retrospective, nested case-control design. Methods. From linked pharmacy and administrative databases of the New England Veterans Healthcare System, we identied 71 985 outpatients newly prescribed PPIs between 1998 and 2007; 1544 patients met criteria for CAP subsequent to PPI initiation; 15 440 controls were matched through risk-set sampling by age and timeunder observation. Crude and adjusted odds ratios comparing current with past PPI exposures, as well as tests for interactions, were conducted for the entire and stratied samples. Results. Current PPI use associated with CAP (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.29 [95% condence interval {CI}, 1.15-1.45]). Risks were not substantially altered by age or year of diagnosis. Dementia (n 585;P5.062 for interaction) and sedative/tranquilizer use (n 5224; P5.049 for interaction) were likely effect modiers increasing a PPI-CAP association; conversely, for some chronic medic al conditions, PPI-associated CAP risks were reversed. PPI exposures between 1 and 15 days increased CAP risks, compared with longer exposures, but PPI initiation also frequentlyoccurred shortly after CAP diagnoses. Prescribed PPI doses .1 dose/day also increased PPI-associated CAP risks. Conclusions. Among the veterans studied, current compared with past PPI exposures associated modestly with increased risks of CAP. However, our observations that recent treatment initiation and higher PPI doses wereassociated with greater risks, and the inconsistent PPI-CAP associations between patient subgroups, indicate thatfurther inquiries are needed to separate out coincidental patterns of associations. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly amongelderly individuals and those with medical comorbid-ities [ 1-3]. Gastric acid suppression is purported to provide a mechanism for increasing risks for CAP byfacilitating bacterial colonization of the stomach and upper intestine, potentially leading to colonization of the upper aerodigestive tract with pathogens [ 4-7]. Among current gastric acid suppressants, proton pumpinhibitors (PPIs) provide the most potent and effectivemanagement gastroesophageal reflux,and other acid-peptic-related diseases [ 8,9]. PPIs have few overt side effects but are often initiated and con-tinued without proven indications [ 10-13]. Results from retrospective, observational studies within the past decade have been inconclusive regarding the possible association of PPI exposure with CAP [ 14-19]. Community-based studies from the Netherlands [ 14], Denmark [ 15], and Great Britain [ 16] reported an in- creased CAP risk of 50%-75% for patients currently prescribed PPIs. Conversely, 3 studies from GreatBritain [ 17] and the United States [ 18,19] failed to show such an association. Two meta-analyses of short-term, prospective PPI trials showed no association ofPPI use with respiratory infections [ 20,21], but recent studies have demonstrated increased risks of recurrentCAP [ 22] and hospital-acquired pneumonia [ 23] with Received 8 April 2011; accepted 13 September 2011; electronically published 18 November 2011.

Thus, evidence linking PPI exposure to CAP and to other respiratory infections remains unsettled. We have tested the association of PPI use and CAP in a population of US military veterans in a retrospective, nested case-control design. Our objectives were to determine whethercurrent exposure to PPIs increased risks for CAP and whetherthe duration of current PPI exposure and PPI doses influencedrisks.We believed that veteran patients, frequently burdened by chronic medical conditions, would be particularly vulnerable topneumonia and its consequences and, hence, to this possibleassociated risk for CAP with PPI use. METHODS Setting We analyzed the linked pharmacy and administrative databases from the New England Veterans Healthcare System (VISN 1)from October 1996 through September 2007. The New Englandregion consists of 8 medical centers and afliated clinics pro- viding inpatient and outpatient care. VISN 1 pharmacy les were obtained from Information Resource Management(Boston, Massachusetts). Data elements of the outpatientpharmacy les pertinent to our analysis include patient iden-tication, date of birth, drug name and dose, administrationroute, quantity, date of original prescription, days' supply, relldate(s), and discontinuation date(s). Data on comorbiditieswere captured by accessing the VA administrative databases(Patient Treatment File and Outpatient Care File) located at theAustin Automation Center (Texas). Analyses were conducted atthe Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and In-formation Center, VA Boston Healthcare System (Massa- chuetts). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the VA Boston Healthcare System. Study Design We used a retrospective, nested case-control design in whichboth cases and controls had exposure to a new PPI prescriptionand from which a denite period of observation was accruedfrom the rst PPI dispense date until the onset of a qualied CAP case or until no VA services were recorded for 18 months. PPI exposures were classied as current orpastin relation to the date of the CAP diagnosis, and comparative risks of currentversus past PPI exposures were determined for cases and con-trols for the entire sample and for stratied samples. Study Population Establishment of the cohort is described in Figure 1 .A m o n g 103 597 VISN 1 patients receiving a PPI prescription between 1 October 1997 and 30 September 2007, we identied 71 985 meeting criteria for a new outpatient PPI prescription; thisrequired that no PPI prescription had been lled in the VA inthe prior calendar year, for established VA patients, or in therst year of recorded VISN 1 treatment, for patients new to VISN 1 after 1 October 1996. These exclusions were done to establish that PPI users who developed CAP and matchedcontrols could be reasonably classied as new users and ob-served within a measurable period of PPI exposure (see ''Ex-posure Measurement,'' below). After excluding patients withmissing age and those with no follow-up time after their initialprescription, there were 70 042 patients with qualifying newPPI prescriptions. Within this population were identied 2785cases with coded pneumonia diagnoses and appropriate anti-biotic treatment so as to be classied as CAP (see ''OutcomeMeasurement,'' below), of which 1235 cases preceding theinitial PPI prescription were excluded. The resulting number of patients with CAP following PPI initiation was 1544 (6 were excluded because of a gap of $18 months following lling of the PPI prescription). Ten controls for each case were selectedby risk-set sampling on the basis of age and time under ob-servation from the initial PPI prescription . Among excluded cases, 147 patients with CAP diagnoses both before and after PPI initiation were not included in the primaryanalysis as it was felt that many of these patients would representrecurrent CAP cases, making them at risk for PPI-associatedrecurrent pneumonia [ 22]. A sensitivity analysis including these cases was conducted to determine whether there was an increasein the overall association of current PPI exposure with CAP. Outcome Measurement CAP was established from International Classication of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modication (ICD-9-CM) inpatient and outpatient diagnostic codes 480-482, 485, in-clude bacterial pneumonias, specied and unspecied, andexclude Toexclude hospital-acquired pneumonias, inpatient pneumoniaswere required to be primary admitting diagnoses. To be des-ignated as a CAP case, we required that an outpatient antibioticappropriate for treating CAP was dispensed at hospital discharge or concurrent with the coded outpatient diagnosis. Classes of conrming antibiotics included quinolones, macrolides,b-lactams, radiologic or culture conrma-tion [ 22], we considered them to be relevant evidence of CAP diagnosed and treated in practice and unlikely to bias resultseither toward or against PPI exposure. Exposure Measurement Exposure to a PPI in relation to CAP was categorized as currentif the PPI prescription end date occurred after the index case date, or as past if the prescription end date preceded the index case. Sensitivity analysis (performed using an earlier, overlappingsample of CAP cases) allowing for 15-, 30-, and 90-day intervalsbetween the PPI prescription end date and the CAP diagnosis to 34dCID 2012:54 (1 January) dHermos et al at Boston University Libraries on March 6, 2012 http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from distinguish current and past use showed no differences or trends in outcomes, so we chose the most conservative criteria. PPIagents in the VA formulary during the observation period andusual prescribed daily doses were omeprazole 20 mg, esome-prazole 20 mg, lansoprazole 15 or 30 mg, pantoprazole 40 mg, and rabeprazole 20 mg. Histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H-2RAs) were not included as a primary exposure because theywere available over the counter at reasonable costs so that theiruse either before or concurrent with PPI use was unknown. Covariates Age and comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmo-nary disease (COPD; ICD-9-CM codes 490-494 and 496),congestive heart failure (428), ischemic heart disease (410-414), diabetes (250), lung cancer (162-163.90), nonlung and nonskinmalignancies (140-203, excluding 162-163.90 and (571), dementia(294, 290.40-290.43, 290.0, and 290.10-290.13), alcohol and drugabuse/dependence 304, 305), gastroesophageal reflux and/or reflux esophagitis (530.81 and 530.1-530.3), and pepticulcer diseases (531-533), were ana lyzed as potential confounders as were VA hospital admissions in the 90 days before the indexCAP case. Medications active at b aseline, H-2RAs, systemic cor- immunomodulators/immunosuppressants, tranquil-izers/sedatives, and antipsychotics, as well as antibiotics prescribed#90 days before baseline, were similarly analyzed as covariates. Data Analysis Descriptive statistics and odds ratios (ORs) were used to charac-terize and distinguish cases and co ntrols. Conditional logistic re- gression was used for all analyses, with all stratied and subgroupanalyses performed on the entire matched study population byFigure 1. Study population selection.

We used past PPI users as the reference groups among both cases and controls. Specic stratifying variables included age group ( ,65 years and $65 years), to examine the role of Medicare eligibility, and year of CAP diagnosis (scal years 1998-2003 and 2004-2007), to account for potential PPI exposures from nonprescription for-mulations purchased over the counter during recent years. Fi-nally, we used conditional logistic regression on stratied samplesto evaluate statistical interaction for covariates. These analyseswere in some cases limited by small stratied samples andwere not necessarily expected to reach statistical signicance atP,.05, but they could show potential trends as effect modiers. We calculated unadjusted and adjusted ORs comparing du- rations of current PPI exposures before the index case. To fur-ther describe the time course of PPI use in relation to new CAPdiagnoses, we provide frequency distributions among CAPpatients that describe the timing of PPI initiation. To conductthis analysis, we included all available CAP cases, includ-ing those occurring before PPI initiation (1235 cases were ex-cluded; Figure 1) and those occurring subsequent to PPIinitiation (1544 cases). We also compared risks between 196CAP cases receiving .1 standard PPI dose per day to 434 cases receiving 1 standard PPI dose per day. This analysis excluded238 patients receiving lansoprazole, as 2 dose formulations,15 mg and 30 mg, were dispensed in varying amounts, pre-cluding our establishing ''standard'' daily doses. All analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute). We used Pvalues,.05 and 95% condence intervals (CIs) to test for statistical signicance. RESULTS Patient Characteristics The study population of 1544 cases and 15 440 controls was approximately 96% male, with a mean age (standard deviation)of 65.8 (12.2) years. ( Table 1 ). With the exception of esophageal reflux diagnoses, cases were more likely than controls to haveeach and .1 coded medical comorbidity, to have been hospi- talized#90 days before the index case date, and to be prescribed each of the designated medications.Table 1.

When the 147 cases who had CAP both before and subsequent to initiation of PPIs were included in theanalysis, the risks were modestly elevated (adjusted OR, 1.40[95% CI, 1.26-1.56]), indicating an increased PPI-CAP associ-ation with recurrent cases. Confounding and Effect Modification by Comorbidities and Medications To determine potential confounding and effect modication, adjusted risks and tests for interaction were conducted for co-morbidities and medications ( Table 3 ). Cases receiving im- munosuppressants showed the highest relative risks for currentPPI use, but the number of cases was too small (n 513) to demonstrate statistical signicance. For patients with dementia(n585;P5.062 for interaction), use of sedatives/tranquilizers (n5224; P5.049 for interaction), and, to a lesser extent, pa- tients with chronic liver disease (n 571,P5.257 for interaction) and use of antipsychotics (n 5124; P5.258 for interaction), there was possible effect modication favoring a PPI-CAP asso-ciation. Of interest, confounding by congestive heart failure,COPD, lung cancer, and chronic kidney disease diagnoses, andhaving$3 comorbidities, showed reduced adjusted risks of CAP with current PPI exposures (ie, a potential protective effect), withcongestive heart failure demonstrating effect modication ( P5 .014 for interaction). There was no evidence of confoundingor effect modication for esophageal reflux and peptic ulcer di-agnoses; for diagnoses of other chronic medical conditions,specically diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and nonlung andnonskin cancers; and for use of other medications, specicallyH-2RAs, corticosteroids, and antibiotics (data not shown). Duration of Exposure We determined the ORs for incre asing durations of current PPI exposure for predicting pneumonia, using a .180-day exposure as the reference group and including past exposure in the analysismodel ( Table 4). Those in the exposure group of 1-15 days d e m o n s t r a t e di n c r e a s e dr i s k s ,c o m p a r e dw i t ht h o s ew i t hl o n g e rexposures; this short-term expo sure group represented only 6.9% of the 868 cases who were exposed to PPIs at the time of theirpneumonia. The remaining larger group of patients with longerdurations of current PPI exposur ea l s oh a di n c r e a s e dr i s k sf o r CAP, compared with those patients with past PPI exposures. We determined the frequency distribution of CAP cases occurring both before (n 51235) and after (n 51544) PPI in itiation, and it showed a time-dependent distributions of cases ( Figure 2 ). Among 330 CAP cases occurring within 90 days before PPIinitiation, half occurred within 13 days, which is further in-dication that CAP cases were likely to occur closely before, aswell as closely after, the time of PPI initiation. Dose Effect CAP cases were more likely to be currently prescribed PPIs at doses.1 standard dose per day than at doses #1s t a n d a r dd o s e per day (adjusted OR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.06-1.65]; P5.012) (see Methods for exclusion of 238 patients prescribed lansoprazole at 15-mg or 30-mg doses) ( Table 5 ).

Three large, community- based, case-controlled studies from the Netherlands (adjustedOR, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.33-2.25]) [ 14], Denmark (adjusted OR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.3-1.7]) [ 15], and Great Britain (adjusted OR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.36-1.77]) [ 16] associated current PPI exposure with CAP. Conversely, 3 recently published studies from Great Britain [17] and the United States [ 18,19] reported no statistically signicant associations between PPI exposures and CAP. In 2 of these latter studies, only patients aged $65 years were included [18,19]. The 3 studies with negative ndings included as po- tential confounders current smoking status [ 17-19], past year hospitalizations and ofce visits [ 17,19], and a measure of functional status [ 19], variables potentially attenuating anyindependent risks conveyed by PPI use. We used common co-morbidities, medications, and recent hospitalizations as potentialconfounders, but we recognize that other key confounders mayn o th a v eb e e ni n c l u d e d . There was apparent effect modication for patients with de- mentia and for those receiving sedatives/tranquilizers, each in-dependently increasing this association, perhaps because ofimpaired swallowing and increased reflux of acid-suppressed stomach contents [ 24-26]. We also found potential confounding with chronic liver disease and immunosuppressant use, but tests for interactions were limited by small sample sizes. We cannotreadily explain our ndings that, for other chronic medicalconditions, the association between current PPI exposure andCAP was ''protective,'' but it is possible that the inherent risks forCAP with these conditions preclude any added risks incurred byTable 3 continued.

Pneumonia Risk With Proton Pump Inhibitors dCID 2012:54 (1 January) d39 at Boston University Libraries on March 6, 2012 http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from PPI exposures [ 1-3]. These seemingly contradictory ndings with respect to specic comorbidities, in this study and others, weaken the argument for a convincing PPI-CAP association inpatient populations in which multiple confounders, entered intoor omitted from analyses, could alter results. We, and others [ 14,15,17], found that short-duration cur- rent PPI use increased the association with CAP, compared withlonger-duration current use; in the other prior observational studies, dose effects were not tested [ 16,18,19]. This nding raises the question as to whether the association results from PPIs being newly prescribed for either early, nonspecic symp-toms of pneumonia, for gastric protection, or for new-onset orworsening reflux, or whether it simply occurs because patientsare in medical care settings where PPI are commonly prescribed.Our time-interval data from CAP cases that preceded PPI ini-tiation suggests that this may well be the case, as PPI initiationsfrequently follow CAP diagnoses in the context of clinical care ofsymptomatic patients. However, .90% of current PPI ex- posures in our sample were .15 days and also carried modestly increased risks for CAP, compared with risks among past users.Two prior studies [ 14,17] and ours demonstrated a PPI dose- dependent association with CAP. Whereas this nding indicatesenhanced, more-potent gastric acid suppression, it is possiblethat increased PPI dosing is in response to symptomaticgastroesophageal reflux, which might in itself increase risks forchronic aspiration and lower respiratory tract infections[27,28]. Because we found that PPI prescribing often followed CAP diagnoses, it is likely that some clinicians initiated high-dose PPIs in this clinical context. Our ndings must be viewed with caution because our ex- posure and outcome measures are subject to limitations in-herent in database dependent observational studies. We werenot able to determine PPI compliance or supplementation with other PPIs or gastric acid suppressants; however, because of the low costs of VA copayments, it is unlikely that many patientswould use non-VA-prescribed prescriptions. We could notidentify the indication for PPI use explicitly, although we col-lected an exhaustive list of conditions potentially related to PPIuse or CAP development. We did not validate our CAP caseswith documentation of radiographic ndings, which is typicallynecessary for randomized trials [ 29]. Dublin et al [ 19], using only coded CAP diagnoses, reported a 30% increased risk forCAP with PPI exposure, but this association was negated usingonly chart-reviewed, validated CAP cases. However, Gulmezet al [ 15] found no difference in increased PPI-associated risks in a comparison of patients with and patients without positivechest radiographic ndings. We required timely prescribing ofantibiotics appropriate for treatment of CAP to establishour CAP cases, but this practice, although certainly indicativeof clinically relevant CAP, may considerably vary betweenphysicians and institutions. Even without radiography orother means for case validation, it seems unlikely that mis-classications of CAP cases would bias results toward patientsreceiving PPIs. Despite these limitations, our study has considerable strengths. The veteran patient population studied is large, and our 8-year window of observation is long.

Our study design is conservative in that we used time under observation, used risk set sampling for our overall and stratied analyses, and excludedknown recurrent CAP cases. By identifying cases and selectingmatched controls only from PPI users, cases and controls likelyhad reasonably similar indications for initial PPI prescribing,although these could not be identied explicitly. As PPIs arecommonly prescribed and continued for protracted periodswithout clear indications [ 9-13], even a small or uncertain added risk for CAP could translate into many CAP cases. Along with therisks reported from observational studies for other infections,specically Clostridium difcile infection [ 30-32], other enteric infections [ spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [ 34], recurrent CAP, and hospital-acquired pneumonia [ 23], consideration of reasons for starting or continuing PPIs or for alternative gastric acid suppression may be warranted [ 10-13]. Prospective, ran- domized trials to test these as sociations would necessarily be prolonged and costly. Thus, additi onal observational studies, with well-considered potential co nfounders and targeted, strati- ed subsamples, that can further test for the existence and extentof associations of PPI exposure with serious infections areneeded.

CER has become a national priority,with considerable new research funding allocated. Cardiovascular disease is a priority area for CER. This work-shop report provides an overview of CER methods, with an emphasis on practical clinical trials and observationaltreatment comparisons. The report also details recommendations to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-tute for a new framework for evidence development to foster cardiovascular CER, and specic studies to ad-dress 8 clinical issues identied by the Institute of Medicine as high priorities for cardiovascular CER.(J Am Coll Cardiol 2012;60:569-80) \u00a9 2012 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation Comparative effectiveness research (CER) has recently emerged as a national priority, spurred by healthcare reformand economic stimulus legislation. Congress appropriated$1.1 billion for CER as part of the American Recovery andReinvestment Act of 2009 and is anticipated to enable additional annual spending of $500 million as part of thenewly established Patient-Centered Outcomes ResearchInstitute. According to congressional legislation, thePatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute will givepriority for project management to the National Institutesof Health and the Agency for Health Research and Quality.Therefore, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute(NHLBI) may have new opportunities to advance CERrelated to cardiovascular disease, which remains the leadingcause of death and disability in the United States today. The NHLBI sponsors workshops to solicit input and recommendations on important topics, so on July 13 and 14,2010, the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences convened a workshop on CER in cardiovascular disease. The workshopbrought together 25 outside experts from a variety of disci-plines (clinical trials, epidemiology, biostatistics, health servicesresearch, and clinical medicine) to discuss a range of futureopportunities that NHLBI could consider in CER as it relatesto cardiovascular disease and the specic priorities for CER incardiovascular disease that were identied by the Institute ofMedicine (IOM). The discussions at the workshop, therefore,represent the opinions and recommendations of the partici-pants and are not necessarily the policy or priorities of NHLBI.

Overview of CER Comparative effectiveness research has been dened as \"the generation and synthesis of evidence that compares thebenets and harms of alternative methods to prevent,diagnose, treat, and monitor a clinical condition or toimprove the delivery of care. The purpose of CER is toassist consumers, clinicians, purchasers and policy makers inmaking informed decisions that will improve healthcare atboth the individual and population levels\" (1). CER canfocus on care at the patient level or the system level, butregardless of its scope, CER is intended to provide infor-mation that can facilitate medical decision making andimprove health outcomes (2).There is great public value in rigorous studies comparing alternative strategies for diagnosis and treatment, as dem-onstrated by many landmark NHLBI-sponsored clinicaltrials (3-13). Nevertheless, comparative effectiveness studiesthat would facilitate healthcare decisions are not performedas often as they are needed, and gaps persist between theproduction of scientic evidence and the needs of consum-ers and healthcare providers for evidence on CER. Becausethere are limited resources to support biomedical research, itis necessary to prioritize key clinical questions that can beanswered with comparative effectiveness studies, while ex-panding as much as possible the pool of investigatorscapable of performing CER. Study Designs for CER A variety of methods are used in CER, including random- ized trials, observational studies, simulations and models,systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and collaborative poolingof individual patient data from multiple studies. Random-ized trials can be used to compare a management strategy(preventative, diagnostic, therapeutic) with the best alterna-tive strategy. Analyses of data from clinical registries,electronic health records, and administrative databases canaddress CER questions regarding situations in which ran-domization may be difcult. Whereas observational studiesusing existing data may be simpler and less expensive toconduct, they are more susceptible to bias introduced byselection of patients for alternative treatments. Statisticalapproaches to analysis of observational data can be used to Abbreviations and Acronyms CER/H11549comparative effectiveness research CT/H11549computed tomographyIOM/H11549Institute of MedicineNHLBI/H11549National Heart, Lung, and Blood InstituteRCT/H11549randomized controlled trial(s) Figure 1 Conceptual Framework for CER et al. JACC Vol. 60, No. 7, 2012 Cardiovascular Comparative Effectiveness Research August 14, 2012:569-80minimize these biases, but these methods need to be further developed. Decision models and simulations may also bevery useful methods in CER. The workshop participantsexplored the unique opportunities, strengths, and limita-tions of these methods for use in CER, as summarizedherein.Randomized trials. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) may be applied in CER to compare treatments (e.g., use of adrug, device, procedure, or a behavioral intervention), clin-ical evaluation strategies (e.g., biomarkers, imaging), health-care delivery methods (e.g., disease management programs,specialist vs. generalist care), and policy interventions (e.g.,copayments, formulary restrictions, regionalization of pro-cedures). The strengths of the RCT include its use of aprospective protocol, standardized data collection, completefollow-up, and random treatment assignment, each ofwhich enhances its \"internal validity.\" An RCT is particu-larly appropriate when a high level of evidence is required tochange practice, such as when optimal management iscontroversial, the effect of the treatment on outcomes ismodest, or the intervention is costly. Although RCT ofteninvolve highly selected patients and atypical practice set-tings, which can limit generalizability, RCT can be designedto enroll more representative patient populations and can beperformed in more typical practice settings. There are many practical barriers to conducting large, representative clinical trials in the United States. The focuson delivering care efciently and uniformly may not readilyaccommodate clinical research in routine clinical practice.Building the infrastructure to perform multicenter clinicaltrials can be difcult, time-consuming, and costly. Thus,exploring strategies to promote more efcient clinical trialsis important, such as adopting \"large practical trial designs\"or fostering the conduct of a range of CER trials by existinginvestigator or site teams. Use of real-world settings, such asprivate practice groups, community health centers, andintegrated healthcare systems, may enhance recruitment ofrepresentative patients in CER trials. Monetary barriers can impede the conduct of clinical trials, because the cost of research data collection, clinicvisits and tests, and follow-up is high. Thus, identifyingways to streamline data collection while maintaining accu-racy and validity over the length of follow-up wouldenhance the ability to conduct CER trials. Health insurersmay balk at covering the costs of clinic visits and tests forpatients in a clinical trial, which increases the cost to theresearch budget and may lead patients to drop out of thestudy. Furthermore, in some instances, nancial incentivesin healthcare may not be aligned for randomized trials; forexample, trials that randomize patients to procedures com-pared with medical therapy may result in foregone proce-dural fees. The duration of follow-up in clinical trials is alsoconstrained by cost, which limits collection of long-termdata on comparative efcacy and safety. Barriers for CER trials also include lack of time in busy practices to enroll participants in research studies and lowlevels of academic recognition for site investigators who arejust 1 member of a large trial team. Whereas institutionalreview boards are needed to protect participants in clinicaltrials, the multiplicity of jurisdictions across multisite trialscomplicates the conduct of the trial. Centralized or simpli-ed institutional review processes for multicenter studiesshould be explored, particularly for comparative trials ofexisting, approved interventions.Clinical registries. A clinical registry is the prospective collection of standardized data on the clinical characteristicsand outcomes of patients dened by a particular disease,diagnosis, procedure, or exposure. Clinical registries sharesome features with randomized trials, such as standardizeddata collection, but unlike clinical trials, they do not dictatepatient treatment by either random assignment or a strictprotocol. Clinical registries can have broader inclusioncriteria than clinical trials do, and, therefore, they may betterrepresent the diversity of patients, providers, and practicesettings found in contemporary clinical care. Clinical regis-tries occupy a middle ground between the formal structureof a randomized trial and the collection of relatively un-structured data from medical charts, electronic health re-cords, or claims data. Clinical registries have evolved from small case series to national (or international) collaborations that enroll thou-sands to millions of patients. Standardized data denitionsand data collection methods are key features of a high-quality clinical registry, as they ensure comparable levels ofdetails about each patient enrolled. Documenting out-comes\u2014particularly outcomes that occur late after a singleepisode of care\u2014is also essential if clinical registries are tobe used in CER. Longer follow-up can be obtained activelyby contacting patients (as is done in clinical trials) orpassively by linking registry data to electronic health re-cords, claims data, or state and national mortality les. Clinical registries have been used to dene contemporary practice patterns, document disparities in care, and assessthe safety of cardiovascular drugs, devices, and procedures inclinical practice. Clinical registries can also be analyzed tocompare alternative treatments, but these studies requireadvanced biostatistical methods to reduce the biases intro-duced by nonrandomized patient selection for treatment. Clinical registries may also be linked with randomized clinical trials, as when a registry prospectively collects dataon patients screened for entry into a trial or on patientseligible for a trial who decline to be randomized (14).Randomized trials can also capitalize on an ongoing clinicalregistry, which can be used to identify eligible patients andcapture clinical data. Hybrid registry trial designs may beparticularly powerful tools for CER, as they permit efcientpatient enrollment and provide information of the general-izability of trial results. The resources required to establish and maintain clinical registries have been provided by a variety of mechanisms.Professional societies have sponsored notable clinical regis-tries often supported by hospital-paid fees for participation, 571 JACC Vol. 60, No. 7, 2012 Hlatky et al. August 14, 2012:569-80 Cardiovascular Comparative Effectiveness Researchsuch as the American Heart Association's Get with the Guidelines Programs (in cardiovascular disease, heart fail-ure, and stroke), the Society of Thoracic Surgeon's NationalCardiothoracic Surgery databases (covering coronary bypasssurgery, valve surgery, thoracic surgery, and congenital heartsurgery), and the American College of Cardiology's Na-tional (including percutane-ous coronary intervention, implantable andcarotid stenting, as well as diseases such as congenitalcardiovascular disease and acute coronary syndromes). Stategovernments have also sponsored clinical registries, such asthe New York State Registry for cardiac surgery andpercutaneous coronary intervention. Clinical registries havealso been established using federal research funding (e.g.,the NHLBI-sponsored Dynamic Registry). Industry hassponsored clinical registries on particular drugs or devices(e.g., stent registries), as well of Atherothrombosisfor Continued Health] registry).Health system data. Electronic health records and the administrative records of insurers or integrated health plansare valuable sources of observational data for CER. These \"found data\" are generated in the routine practice of medicalcare for billing purposes, public reporting, or clinical care andare not produced primarily for research purposes. For instance,the diagnoses and procedures during hospitalization are re-corded using the nomenclature of the International Classica-tion of Diseases, Clinical Modication (ICD-9-CM) andreported to public authorities and health insurers. These administrative data are not subject to the standardizationand quality control applied to clinical trial or clinical registrydata, although these data are usually recorded by trainedmedical records abstractors and required for provider reim-bursement. Some integrated healthcare organizations haveadditional sources of clinical data, such as drug prescrip-tions, outpatient claims, and computerized laboratory re-sults. Linkage of several of these data sources can give a verydetailed picture of medical care provided to a representative,relatively unselected population of patients. The advent of fully electronic health records offers the possibility of capturing greatly detailed clinical informationabout individual patients, such as symptoms, vital signs, andresults of imaging studies. There are formidable technicalchallenges in extracting specic data elements from elec-tronic health records, because clinical notes are typicallyentered as free text rather than using a controlled vocabu-lary. Advances in medical informatics, such as studies onnatural language processing, will likely facilitate the use ofelectronic health records for research purposes. Neverthe-less, the use of electronic records for research purposes doesnot overcome the well-recognized fundamental limitationsof retrospective chart review studies: namely, that key datamay not have been recorded at all; and that the data thatwere recorded are unlikely to be standardized or quality controlled.Analysis of observational data. A weakness of all obser- vational CER studies (including analyses of clinical regis-tries, electronic health records, and administrative data) isthe absence of randomized assignment of treatments. Incontrast to a randomized trial, clinicians and patientsrepresented in observational databases select treatments fora variety of reasons, which may not be recorded in the chart.Treatment selection can lead to differences in patientprognosis between treatment groups, so their subsequentclinical outcomes may differ, even in the absence of atreatment effect. Methods for addressing selection biases,whether due to known or unknown factors, are evolving.One simple step is to restrict the study patient population tonewly treated patients and to patients eligible for eithertreatment; these restrictions narrow any pre-treatment dif-ferences between patients receiving alternative therapies(15). Modeling the selection of treatment by using apropensity score or a disease risk score can balance treat-ment groups on large numbers of measured clinical covari-ates (16,17). Marginal structural models with inverseweighting by propensity for treatment have been used toestimate the effect on outcomes of treatments that vary overtime, such as use of prescription drugs (18). Each of thesestatistical methods relies on adjusting for clinical character-istics that were recorded in the data and, therefore, may notadjust fully for clinical factors that were not recorded (e.g.,patient frailty or socioeconomic status) or that are difcult tocapture (e.g., degree of social support). Instrumental vari-able methods and multilevel analyses have been used in anattempt to adjust for unmeasured confounders (19-21).These approaches identify variables that are strongly relatedto the likelihood of receiving a specic treatment, but do notdirectly affect clinical outcomes (e.g., inclusion of specicdrugs in a formulary, distance to a referral hospital). Theworkshop participants recognized the need for furtheradvances in statistical methods in order to conduct high-quality CER that minimizes confounding and residualselection bias in observational treatment comparisons.Systematic reviews and decision models. Systematic re- views and meta-analyses of existing effectiveness and safetydata are an important tool for CER. Systematic reviews canidentify evidence gaps, including a lack of evidence orunclear evidence for an important clinical question, whichsuggest a new trial is warranted (22) and when there is \"toomuch evidence,\" which suggests further trials may beunnecessary (23). Network meta-analysis (mixed treatmentcomparison meta-analysis) may be used to compare inter-ventions even when direct \"head-to-head\" trials are notavailable (24). This new statistical approach is promising,but it is still being examined for its validity as a method tocompare treatments. The potential for treatment efcacy to vary signicantly according to patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, diabetes,or genetic markers) is an important dimension of CER, as 572 Hlatky et al. JACC Vol. 60, No. 7, 2012 Cardiovascular Comparative Effectiveness Research August 14, 2012:569-80it provides evidence to \"personalize\" treatment decisions. Very large sample sizes are required to investigate potentialvariation in treatment effects across populations, which canbe accomplished by pooling individual patient-level datafrom several trials. Further research could address thepractical and methodologic challenges of collaborative stud-ies that pool data from multiple studies of cardiovasculartreatments. Decision models and simulation studies are also valuable methods to foster CER. These techniques start with thebest available evidence on a clinical question and typicallyrely on the results of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, andpooling studies to provide the needed data. Models andsimulation studies are particularly well suited to identifyevidence gaps and the value of information by pinpointingwhich clinical factors have the greatest impact on the clinicaleffectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatment alternatives.Studies can subsequently be designed to address the mostimportant evidence gaps, which will be particularly valuablein meeting the CER objective of \"comparing benets andharms of alternative methods [of care].\" Proposed Framework for CER The workshop participants proposed a new framework for evidence development (Fig. 1) to foster cardiovascular CER.This framework identies gaps between the evidenceneeded for practice and the research available to support it.A \"portfolio analysis\" of the current state of knowledge, byusing clinical guidelines, evidence reviews, and decisionmodels to identify key evidence gaps, could focus CER onkey questions through a variety of research designs, includ-ing observational studies, clinical registries, and randomizedtrials. This cycle of portfolio analysis, identication of keyevidence gaps, and research addressing these gaps couldrepeat over time (Table 1). The proposed framework (Fig. 1) involves a multiple stakeholder process to identify questions for CER and isconsistent with recent changes on the political as well asscientic landscape. For example, the creation of the newPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute suggeststhat the model for setting research priorities may be chang-ing from an investigator and industry driven process to onewith broader patient and clinician input.The proposed framework implies that knowledge gaps could be identied through systematic reviews of existingevidence, meta-analyses, and decision analytic models.These types of studies could be efcient and timely oppor-tunities to focus on important comparative effectivenessstudies (Table 1). The proposed framework also implies that interactions among potential funders and stakeholders, such as theAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Centersfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention could help foster CERfocused on cardiovascular disease. The Cochrane Collabo-ration is an international organization that conducts system-atic reviews and promotes methodologic development, andit could assist in assessing evidence gaps and areas of focusfor research. The professional societies (e.g., the AmericanCollege of Cardiology, the American Heart Association,and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons) now operate clinicalregistries that may be well suited to cardiovascular CER,and they develop clinical guidelines, performance measures,and appropriate-use criteria that could potentially translateCER ndings into practice.Expand the scope of discovery. CER focuses on develop- ing scientic knowledge that will be useful during the courseof patient care. The creativity and innovation that charac-terize investigator-initiated research have served medicalscience well. However, because the research questions ofCER focus on addressing the needs of practitioners andpatients, the scope of discovery may need to expand toinclude not only specic topics of interest to individualinvestigators and experts, but also topics driven by clinicalevidence gaps. The implications of developing a CER portfolio that focuses on knowledge gaps are far reaching. The evolutionof a research question from model to meta-analysis tomega-trial to implementation underscores the contributionsof methodologic research as well as research on specicclinical questions. Whereas some clinical questions may beaddressed in large randomized clinical trials, other pivotalquestions may not be amenable to randomized studies and,therefore, require alternative methods.Create a culture of research. The broad scope of CER implies similar breadth in thinking about the researchenterprise, such that the development of new knowledgeabout optimal practice becomes an intrinsic part of thehealthcare system. Because CER aims to address patientand provider needs, health systems, providers, and patientsshould embrace the need to perform CER and recognize itsvalue. A culture of research may be fostered when it isrecognized that there is uncertainty regarding what consti-tutes optimal care, so that alternative forms of managementmay be reasonable and acceptable\u2014the concept of clinicalequipoise. While clinical systems and caregivers face chal-lenges incorporating research as part of daily practice, theyshould recognize that improving the quality of care throughdiscovery and learning from experience should be part of General Recommendations toFoster Comparative Effectiveness ResearchTable 1General Recommendations to Foster Comparative Effectiveness Research Conduct portfolio analyses in key clinical areas Identify knowledge gapsStrengthen relationships among stakeholdersLeverage the strength of different research methods: trials, registries, simulations, evidence synthesis Advance analytic methods for comparative effectiveness researchPromote knowledge discovery as part of clinical practiceFoster training and careers in comparative effectiveness research573 JACC Vol. 60, No. 7, 2012 Hlatky et al. August 14, 2012:569-80 Cardiovascular Comparative Effectiveness Researchtheir professional and institutional obligations. Integrating research into routine care might be further fostered byfocusing on quality improvement, aligning incentives withinhealth systems, and, in the larger healthcare enterprise, byestablishing policies such as coverage with evidence devel-opment and pay for performance. The collection of observational data as part of a prospec- tive clinical registry is an example of how research can beincorporated into daily practice. Clinical registries coveronly specic clinical populations, however, and a broaderknowledge base could advance CER. Fully interoperableelectronic health records, with promotion of standardizedclinical terminology, would facilitate CER, particularly ifelectronic health records, clinical registries, image reposito-ries, clinical trial data, and longitudinal claims can be linkedto create study cohorts. To this end, further development ofhealth informatics and its application to cardiovasculardisease is an opportunity to advance CER.Nurture the national CER workforce. Individuals from many distinct backgrounds are needed to meet the chal-lenges of CER, ranging from skilled investigators to inquis-itive clinicians, knowledgeable patients, and practical meth-odologists. Thus, \"team science\" is integral to the success ofCER. Paralleling the need for more diverse research part-ners is the opportunity to collaborate with nontraditionalresearch venues and partners, including those usually fo-cused only on care delivery or education, rather thanscholarly research. As CER is relatively new eld, there is a great need for more investigators who are well trained in its methods.Training, mentoring, and professional development pro-grams aimed specically at expanding the pool of investi-gators skilled in the methods of cardiovascular CER arepossible ways to cultivate this eld. Furthermore, nontradi-tional stakeholders may be valuable contributors to thedevelopment of the portfolio of CER studies. Institute of Medicine Priorities The workshop addressed 2 broad questions. 1) How might the NHLBI foster CER related to cardiovascular disease ingeneral? 2) How might the NHLBI respond to the specicCER priorities in the area of cardiovascular disease identi-ed by the IOM? In this section, we summarize theworkshop participants' recommendations on the secondbroad question\u2014what types of studies could potentiallyaddress the IOM priorities (1)? The workshop participantswere charged to identify examples of 1 or 2 study ideas foreach IOM area. NHLBI convenes working groups of experts to provide recommendations and input on specic topic areas, whichthe Institute then carefully reviews. The suggestions of thisworkshop represent a list of important areas for investigator-initiated and/or Institute-initiated projects. The Institute care-fully considers these and other recommendations as it sets itspriorities and attempts to maintain a balanced portfolio acrossits entire mission; no NHLBI funding commitment is made orimplied by inclusion of the topics in the report of thisworkshop. The workshop recognized that the NHLBI isparticularly able to organize CER studies free of conflicts ofinterest related to specic drugs, devices, or managementstrategies and has great experience in conducting comparativestudies of alternative management strategies to treat cardiovas-cular disease. The IOM priority areas discussed at the workshop include: Compare the effectiveness of treatment strategies for atrial brillation including surgery, catheter ablation,and pharmacologic treatment; Compare anticoagulant therapies warfarin, aspirin, injectable anti-coagulants) for patients undergoing procedures; Compare the effectiveness of treatment strategies for vascular claudication (e.g., medical optimization, smok-ing cessation, exercise, catheter-based treatment, opensurgical bypass); Compare the effectiveness of aggressive medical man- agement and percutaneous coronary interventions intreating stable coronary disease for patients of differ-ent ages and with different comorbidities; Compare the effectiveness of innovative treatment strat- egies (e.g., cardiac resynchronization, remote physiologicmonitoring, pharmacologic treatment, novel agents suchas CRF-2 receptors) for congestive heart failure; Compare the effectiveness of different treatment strat- egies (e.g., modifying target levels for glucose, lipid, orblood pressure) in reducing cardiovascular complica-tions in newly diagnosed adolescents and adults withtype 2 diabetes; Compare the effectiveness of traditional risk stratica- tion for coronary heart disease and noninvasive imaging(using coronary artery calcium, carotid intima mediathickness, and other approaches) on outcomes; and Compare of computed tomography (CT) angiography conventional angiography inassessing coronary stenosis patients at moderatepre-test risk of coronary artery disease. Atrial Fibrillation Atrial brillation is a highly prevalent condition associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and a high risk ofstroke. The NHLBI has previously supported comparativetreatment trials for including the completedAFFIRM (Atrial Fibrillation Follow-Up Investigation ofRhythm trial (4 ) and the ongoing CABANA (Catheter Ablation Versus Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy forAtrial Fibrillation) trial (NCT00911508). The NHLBI is alsofunding a clinical registry of atrial brillation in 2 largeintegrated health plans to address specic comparative 574 Hlatky et al. JACC Vol. 60, No. 7, 2012 Cardiovascular Comparative Effectiveness Research August 14, 2012:569-80effectiveness research issues, and it will expand on a previous atrial brillation registry (25) and epidemiologic studies ofatrial brillation. Despite these and other studies of atrialbrillation, key knowledge gaps remain, including: 1) thegeneralizability of trials to the larger population of patientswith atrial brillation; 2) whether the treatment approachought to vary depending on the subtype of atrial brillation;and 3) the effect of treatments on expanded outcomes, suchas stroke, dementia, heart failure, quality of life, healthcareutilization, and cost-effectiveness. The workshop participants recommend that 1 approach to ll these gaps could be a robust clinical registry withbroader representation of patients with atrial brillation,with a particular focus on patients with new onset disease, tobetter dene risks for adverse outcomes in relation to patientcharacteristics, subtype of atrial brillation, biomarkers, andtreatment. In conjunction a comprehen-sive decision model of atrial brillation management, asoutlined in Figure 2, could be used to identify priority areas for additional CER studies, including clinical trials. There isalso the potential to build on ongoing studies of otherconditions and treatments by adding atrial brillation as asecondary outcome measure. Anticoagulant Therapies Anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapies are increasingly used to prevent thromboembolism in patients with atrialbrillation, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism.Management of these therapies at the time of invasiveprocedures and surgery poses a difcult problem in balanc- ing the bleeding risk due to treatment and the thromboem-bolic risk due to the underlying disease (26). Furthermore,immobilization after surgery promotes venous thromboem-bolism, which is particularly increased by hip or knee jointreplacement procedures. Management decisions have beenfurther complicated by the introduction of several novelanticoagulant drugs that lack specic antidotes and whoseanticoagulant intensity cannot be reliably assessed by labo-ratory tests. The NHLBI is currently supporting theBRIDGE (Effectiveness of Bridging Anticoagulation forSurgery) trial (NCT00786474), and the GIFT (GeneticsInformatics Trial trial(NCT01006733), which tests low-intensity warfarin prop-erties following orthopedic surgery. The workshop participants felt that a large \"real-world\" registry of patients undergoing specic surgical procedures would be of benet to document risk factors for bleeding,cardiac events, and thromboembolism. This registry couldbe used to assess the effect of different treatments on thoseoutcomes, particularly among patients under-represented inrandomized trials (Online Fig. 1). Assessment of adverseorthopedic outcomes such as joint hemorrhage, peripros-thetic infection, and repeat procedures would provide crit-ical information needed to balance risks and benets ofanticoagulant treatment. The registry could capitalize onsubstantial practice variations to perform observationaltreatment comparisons and assess the effects of treatment oncost, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Figure 2 AF CER Evidence and Data Portfolio Management The general framework for CER (see Fig. 1) is applied to atrial brillation (AF). Examples of registries might include an AF clinical care registry, registry of individuals screened but not randomized to a clinical trial, or individuals followed after completion of a clinical trial. An example of an ongoing AF clinical trial is the CABANA (Cathe- ter Ablation Versus Anti-Arrhythmic Drug 1.575 JACC Vol. 60, No. 7, 2012 Hlatky et al. August 14, 2012:569-80 Cardiovascular Comparative Effectiveness ResearchPeripheral Artery Disease Lower extremity peripheral artery disease is a common, costly condition that is associated with high morbidity andmortality. The pathophysiology of exertional limb claudica-tion is analogous to that of exertional angina pectoris, butclaudication has not received as much attention as angina ineither clinical investigation or the development of new drugsand devices. There have been relatively few CER studies ofclaudication treatments, apart from the ongoing NHLBI-sponsored CLEVER (Claudication: Exercise Versus Endo- luminal with a documented lesion in a specic proximalaortoiliac site that is amenable to stent therapy ( 27). CLEVER does not, however, address the larger question ofwhether a strategy of mechanical limb revascularization(using any combination of endovascular techniques andsurgery) leads to better clinical outcomes than the alterna-tive strategy of optimal medical management (includingexercise, lifestyle modication, and drug therapy). A largepractical randomized trial comparing these distinct ap-proaches to claudication could address this priority area(Online Fig. 2). This trial could enroll relatively unselectedpatients with claudication, whether new onset or after priorrevascularization, without requiring prior angiography orany specic anatomic ndings. The major outcomes of thistrial could be patient functional capacity and quality of life,with secondary outcomes of major clinical complications,cardiovascular risk factor control, medical care utilizationand cost, and cost-effectiveness. Severe limb ischemia, including acute or chronic critical limb ischemia syndromes, represents another major clinicalmanifestation of peripheral artery disease, in which tissuenecrosis is threatened due to reduced resting blood flow.There are newer therapeutic options for severe limb isch-emia, but few reliable data on their long-term clinicaloutcomes or comparative effectiveness. Severe limb ischemiais particularly suitable for the process of priority settingoutlined in Figure 1: performing a systematic review of evidence; modeling to identify critical parameters; andcollecting observational data on epidemiology, treatmentpatterns, and determinants of clinically important outcomes.Establishment of a clinical registry of patients with severelimb ischemia could foster CER on this topic by identifyingpatient, provider, and treatment predictors of outcome.Such a registry could provide the basis for initiating subse-quent, targeted clinical trials of evaluation and managementstrategies for severe limb ischemia. Stable Ischemic Heart Disease Coronary artery disease is well recognized as a major health problem in the United States and has been the subject ofnumerous clinical investigations. The NHLBI has spon-sored pivotal CER clinical trials, including the CASS(Coronary Artery Surgery Study) (28) and BARI 2D (Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation Two,Diabetes) (NCT00006305)( 7) to compare coronary revas- cularization with medical therapy among patients withischemic heart disease. The NHLBI has also sponsoredtrials comparing bypass surgery with coronary angioplasty(BARI [29] and EAST [Emory Angioplasty Versus SurgeryTrial] [9]). Despite extensive investigation in this eld,numerous knowledge gaps persist about optimal manage-ment of patients with stable ischemic heart disease. Inparticular, prior clinical trials have required knowledge ofthe coronary anatomy prior to randomization, but thedecision to perform an invasive coronary angiogram hasoften been tantamount to the decision to perform coronaryrevascularization. The NHLBI just announced funding forthe ISCHEMIA (International Study of ComparativeHealth Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Ap-proaches), a trial that will randomize patients with stablecoronary disease and objective evidence of myocardial isch-emia to an invasive strategy of early coronary angiography ora conservative strategy of initial optimal medical therapy,with angiography reserved for development of refractorysymptoms or a clinical event (Online Fig. 3), in order toaddress a need for further evidence on this importantdecision point. In addition to a large practical trial of coronary revascu- larization, many questions remain about how to dene anddeliver optimal medical management for patients with stableischemic heart disease. In particular, it has been challengingto promote drug adherence and behavior change (diet,exercise, smoking cessation) in the setting of a busy outpa-tient practice. One approach to consider is to apply insightsfrom behavioral economics to investigate the effect of economic incentives to clinicians (e.g., structuring of pay-ment) or patients (e.g., copayments for drugs or visits, thecosts of improving exercise and diet) on clinical outcomes. As a third consideration, formal analysis of evidence gaps and opportunities in stable ischemic heart disease using theprocesses of evidence review, model building, and analysis ofclinical registries (Fig. 1) would allow the identication ofadditional opportunities for CER in this area. Heart Failure Heart failure continues to be the most common reason for hospital admission among Americans 65 years of age andolder, and the prevalence of heart failure has continued torise, even though other forms of heart disease have beendeclining. The NHLBI has sponsored numerous CER inves-tigations in heart failure, including the SOLVD (Studies ofLeft Ventricular Dysfunction) trial ( 30), the SCD-HeFT (Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure) (NCT00000609)trial (11), and, more recently, the STICH (Surgical Treatmentof Ischemic Heart Failure) (NCT00023595) trial (12). Manyother studies of the effects of drugs and devices on clinical 576 Hlatky et al. JACC Vol. 60, No. 7, 2012 Cardiovascular Comparative Effectiveness Research August 14, 2012:569-80outcome in patients with heart failure have been sponsored by industry. A hallmark of heart failure is that many patients are frequently rehospitalized to treat exacerbations of the dis-ease, at great expense to the system and considerable distressto patients and their families. There are major gaps inknowledge about how to address this problem, so theworkshop participants proposed that 1 study to consider isenhanced disease management and transition of care withmonitoring (remote or biomarker) as a means of improvingclinical outcomes. A large practical trial (Fig. 3) could enrollunselected patients with heart failure at the time of hospitaldischarge and randomize them either to usual care or toenhanced disease management with tailored therapy guidedby remote monitoring (e.g., weight, heart rate, blood pres- sure, biomarkers). An associated registry of patients withheart failure could be established in conjunction with therandomized trial to collect additional data on the fullspectrum of patients with heart failure and thereby assessthe generalizability of the trial results. The proposed study could use a cluster randomized design (31), in which clinical sites rather than individualsare randomized. The cluster randomized design is wellsuited to evaluation of interventions that target behavior orprocesses of care. Cluster randomized trials are particularlyuseful when it is difcult to conceal the nature of theintervention from the clinic staff and to mask patients to theintervention. The novel research designs that may be re-quired for CER entail unique challenges (32). Despite suchchallenges, the workshop participants encouraged use ofsuch novel research designs, as they provide several advan-tages, including simpler patient recruitment and \"real-life\" data directly applicable to clinical practice. Diabetes The incidence of diabetes continues to rise, driven in large part by the epidemic of obesity in the United States. Mostpatients with diabetes die of heart disease, yet the optimalapproach to prevention and treatment of cardiovasculardisease in patients with diabetes is not well established.Despite the recent publications of the results of theACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk inDiabetes Trial) (33), ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes andVascular Disease: Preterax Diamicron Modied Re-lease AffairsDiabetes) trial (35), long-term follow-up from UKPDS(United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) and Steno 2Study (36), and the ongoing Look AHEAD (Action forHealth in Diabetes) trial (NCT00017953), the comparativeeffectiveness of tight glycemic control versus more liberalcontrol of diabetes, of lifestyle management versus earlydrug treatment, of different initial drug treatments, and ofdifferent systems of care are all uncertain in patients withnewly diagnosed diabetes. The workshop participants felt that the IOM priority could potentially be addressed by thefollowing 2 trials. The rst trial could compare 2 strategies for initial treatment in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes:intensive lifestyle intervention versus immediate metformin(Online Fig. 4). A third arm of this trial could include bothinterventions. A second trial could focus on the comparative Figure 3 Proposed Cluster Randomized Trial for the Management of Heart Failure DC/H11005discharge; DM /H11005disease management; QOL /H11005quality of life.577 JACC Vol. No. 7, 2012 Hlatky et al. August 14, 2012:569-80 Cardiovascular Comparative Effectiveness Researcheffectiveness on cardiovascular outcomes of using different classes of glucose-lowering drugs as second agents in patients in whom metformin monotherapy fails (Online Fig. 5). Met- formin therapy is the current evidence-based standard forinitial pharmacotherapy, but multiple medications are usu-ally needed to maintain durable hemoglobin A1C control.In this trial, participants would be randomized to secondstage treatment with incretin mimetics versus a thiazolidin-edione versus a secretagogue, with insulin withheld forthird-line use. Potential outcomes in each study could include noninva- sive measures of atherosclerosis (e.g., coronary artery cal-cium), progression of diabetes, quality of life, and satisfac-tion with treatment. In light of unexpectedly higher rate oftotal mortality in the more intensively treated group inACCORD, any early differences in subclinical diseasemarkers or surrogate outcomes ought to be conrmed bysubsequent assessments of clinical outcomes. Clinical car-diovascular events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, andstroke) could be potential outcomes as well, although thegroup recognized that potentially low event rates mightrequire large sample sizes and long follow-up. Dependingon the outcome and participant characteristics, this simpletrial could range from as few as 1,000 to 2,000 to as manyas 40,000 to 50,000 participants. A registry could also be useful for post-marketing sur- veillance of cardiovascular disease events among patientsprescribed drugs to treat diabetes. Risk Stratication for Coronary Artery Disease The current paradigm for prevention of coronary disease in asymptomatic adults is based on individual risk assessmentusing a standard risk predictor (such as the FraminghamRisk Score) and intervening with drug therapy among the individuals identied as being at highest cardiovascular risk(37). The optimal management for the patient at interme-diate risk in this paradigm remains uncertain. Additionalrisk stratication of individuals at intermediate cardiac risk,with drug treatment of individuals with \"positive markers,\"may substantially improve outcomes. There are many can-didate risk markers that could be applied at the populationlevel, but coronary calcication on CT is quite promising, asit provides high levels of incremental information and riskreclassication. Consequently, the workshop participantsconsidered a large trial of coronary calcium screening amongindividuals found to be at intermediate risk on conventionalevaluation (Online Fig. 6), with individuals found to haveelevated coronary calcium receiving intensive drug therapyand lifestyle modication, and individuals without elevatedcoronary calcium scores undergoing lifestyle modicationsalone. The trial could follow patients for up to 5 years, withthe primary outcome of major cardiac events. Secondaryoutcomes could include quality of life, adherence to drugand lifestyle management, cost, and cost-effectiveness.The current paradigm of individual risk assessment in- cludes pharmacological therapy for those with elevated Framingham risk scores, but most of the high-risk groupwill not have a cardiovascular event in the subsequent 10years. Additional testing of individuals with high Framing-ham risk scores might identify a subgroup that would notbenet sufciently to justify lifelong pharmacological ther-apy. Optimal management of these individuals might beimproved by imaging to document the severity of theunderlying disease process. The workshop participants alsosuggest that a comprehensive evidence review and decisionmodeling of the application of imaging the disease substrate(e.g., by CT coronary angiography or coronary calciummeasurement) could help to further stratify risk and guidetherapy. This investigation would t within the frameworkoutlined in Figure 1 and assist in determining the potential value of larger CER studies to address this question. CT Coronary Angiography Coronary angiography can now be performed noninvasively with recent generation CT scanners, and in several caseseries, CT angiography has demonstrated high sensitivityand good specicity when compared with invasive coronaryangiography as a reference standard (38,39). These datasuggest that CT angiography may be very useful in theevaluation of patients with symptoms of coronary disease.The effect of CT angiography on clinical outcomes isuncertain, however, because visualization of coronary ob-structions may well lead to unnecessary or inappropriatecoronary revascularization, the value of detecting incidentalnoncardiac ndings is unknown, and the ionizing radiationfrom CT scanning may lead to adverse events. Conse-quently, outcome-based studies of the comparative effec-tiveness of CT coronary angiography and alternative diag-nostic strategies would address an important gap in theevidence. The NHLBI is currently funding the PROMISE(Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for the Evaluationof Chest Pain) trial (NCT01174550), which is randomizingsymptomatic patients suspected of having coronary arterydisease to either usual stress testing (functional) or CTangiography (anatomic). Another study to address this IOM priority could be a large clinical trial of patients with symptoms suggestive ofcoronary disease without high risk features, in which pa-tients would be randomized to either invasive coronaryangiography or to CT coronary angiography after a stresstest that had either inconclusive or \"not high risk\" results(Online Fig. 7). Patients in the invasive angiography arm ofthe study would receive coronary revascularization accordingto current usual care, whereas in the CT angiography ofthe study, only patients with specic (leftmain disease, severe 3-vessel disease) would be recom-mended to receive coronary revascularization (and invasiveangiography if needed to further dene coronary anatomy).The primary endpoint of this trial study would be major 578 Hlatky et al. JACC Vol. 60, No. 7, 2012 Cardiovascular Comparative Effectiveness Research August 14, 2012:569-80cardiovascular events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke), for which the noninferiority of CT angiographywould be tested. Secondary endpoints could include qualityof life, cost, and cost-effectiveness, for which superiority ofCT angiography would be tested. The workshop partici-pants suggest that any research infrastructure created for theproposed trial could be used as an \"advanced cardiovascularimaging network\" to conduct efciently other CER studiesof imaging, as has been undertaken by the CanadianAtherosclerosis Imaging Network and the Medical ImagingTrials Network of Canada. The workshop also identied a clinical registry of CT coronary angiography procedures, ideally as an extension ofthe ongoing National Cardiovascular Disease Registriessponsored by the American College of Cardiology, as afurther opportunity to promote CER on this topic. Conclusions The recent recognition of the importance of comparative effectiveness research places increasing emphasis on studiesthat directly inform and improve patient care. The Work-shop on Cardiovascular Comparative Effectiveness Researchwas designed to propose approaches for the NHLBI toconsider, using both an overall framework for CER andspecic study designs as examples. The approach to actionable research outlined by work- shop participants implies a cycle of research and its appli-cation (Fig. 1). The 4 important linked steps in this cycleare: 1) the prospective articulation of research questionsbased on identifying gaps in knowledge about optimalpatient care, incorporating input of stakeholders, includingpatients; 2) the development of evidence by a variety ofresearch methods to address key evidence gaps; 3) applica-tion of the evidence in practice guidelines and standards ofcare; and 4) determination whether quality of care andpatient outcomes are improved. Several important points follow logically from this vision, beginning with consideration of a new research paradigm.Following that, relationships can be created to identifyimportant research questions and infrastructure developedto perform studies, such as large-scale registries and CERtrials, which can foster translation of research results intopractice. The training and development of CER researchersand the creation of a culture of learning healthcare systemsare important steps in furthering CER. Finally, clear iden-tication of evidence gaps and key questions will help guidethe performance of high-quality research. The IOM has begun this process by identifying several research priorities in cardiovascular disease. This workshophas advanced this process by proposing research ideas toaddress each of the 8 IOM priority areas. These range fromsystematic reviews, to secondary analyses of existing data, toregistries, to large-scale clinical trials; each could add im-portant evidence needed to improve patient care. Theworkshop participants hope that these recommendationswill provide valuable information to investigators and fund-ing agencies as they seek to advance the nation's commit-ment to cardiovascular comparative effectiveness research.

BACKGROUND: Breast pain is a common complaint to primary care and breast specialists. Literature recom-mends imaging to provide reassurance of benign etiology. The effect of imaging on reassurance and subsequent healthcare utilization has not been described.OBJECTIVE: To determine if initial imaging for breast pain reduces subsequent utilization. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study at a hospital- based breast health practice.PATIENTS: Women referred for breast pain from 2006 - 2009. MAIN MEASURES: Imaging ordered at initial provider visit; clinical utilizatio n, defined as the number of follow-up visits, diagnostic imaging studies, and biop- sies completed within 12 months following initial visit.KEY RESULTS: Sixty-percent of women were age 40 or younger, 87% were from racial/ethnic minority groups. Twenty-five percent had imaging ordered at initial visit. Of those who received initial imaging, 75% had normalradiographic findings, yet 98% returned for additional evaluation. In adjusted analyses, women with initial imaging had increased clinic al services utilization (OR 25.4, 95% CI: 16.7, 38.6). Women with normal clinical breast exams who received initial imaging exhibited increased odds for subsequent clinical services utilization(OR 23.8, 95% CI: 12.9, 44.0). Six cancers were diag- nosed; imaging in the absence of clinical breast exam abnormalities did not result in any cancer identification. CONCLUSIONS: Initial imaging for women with breast pain increased the odds of subsequent clinical utiliza- tion and did not increase reassurance in ruling out malignancy. KEY WORDS: breast pain; mammography; breast cancer. J Gen Intern Med 27(7):817 -24 DOI: 10.1007/s11606-011-1982-4 \u00a9 Society of General Internal Medicine 2012 BACKGROUND Women often seek medical attention for breast pain due to concerns of breast cancer.1-3Breast pain accounts for 45 -70% of breast-related complaints in the primary care setting.4-6Given that breast pain as a sole complaint has low risk of breast cancer (0-3%),7-9reassurance of non- malignancy is appropriate.2,10,11Nevertheless, reaching definitive diagnosis in patients with breast pain representsa dilemma, as the causes and treatments of breast pain are inadequately defined. Current guidelines recommend imaging for breast pain if clinically indicated, such as in conjunction with a palpable mass. 12Previous research has also recommended imaging in patients in need of reassurance,9,11,13,14and suggested that after initial imaging, the majority of women require no intervention following reassurance that evaluation findings are normal.1,15No studies have examined the effect that initial imaging for evaluation of breast pain has on provider or patient assurance in ruling out malignancy, as well as subsequent clinical management in women with breast pain. The aim of the present study was to determine how imaging impacts clinical management of breast pain. We assessed whether initial imaging increases reassurance inruling out breast cancer, as measured by subsequent clinical utilization. We posited that reassurance in ruling out breast cancer would be reflected in reduced subsequent clinicalutilization. METHODS Study Setting and Population We conducted a retrospective chart review of women referred for breast pain to internists practicing in ahospital-based diagnostic breast health practice at an academic medical center from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2009. This specialty practice includes internists trainedin breast health and a triage protocol that results in the majority of benign referrals triaged to internists. 16Referrals are scheduled with a provider who follows a womanlongitudinally through subsequent breast care received. Data were abstracted from the electronic medical record (EMR) or scheduling system. This study was approved bythe Institutional Review Board of Boston University School of Medicine.Received August 15, 2011 Revised December 2, 2011 Accepted December 14, 2011Published online January 31, 2012 817Measures Initial imaging was defined as the completion of a physician-ordered diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 months of initial clinical visit. Screening mammograms were distin-guished from diagnostic mammograms through provider- input orders in the EMR. Screening mammograms were excluded from this and our outcome metric. The outcome of interest was clinical services utilization. Clinical services utilization served as a proxy for reassur-ance, and was quantified as the number of subsequent diagnostic services completed in the 12 months following initial provider visit. The following discrete clinical variableswere included in defining clinical utilization: (1) additional imaging tests completed (diagnostic mammograms, ultra- sounds, or MRIs) (2) biopsies completed (fine needleaspiration, core needle, and excisional biopsies), and (3) additional clinical visits to a breast specialist over 12 months of follow-up. These three variables weresummed to yield a summary \"clinical services utilization score. \"This summary measure was categorized into 3 levels: 0: no further clinical utilization, 1: one additional follow-up measure, and 2: two or more additional follow- up measures, all over 12 months of follow-up. The components of clinical utilization were also analyzedindividually as dichotomous variables: any receipt of additional diagnostic imaging, any biopsy completed, and categorical number of additio nal visits (no additional visits, one additional visit, and two or more additional visits), all over 12 months of follow-up. The number of cancers diagnosed during 12 months of follow-up was descriptively analyzed, including clinical presentation, clinical evaluation and diagnostic testing, and timing of diagnostic testing and diagnoses. Cancer diagno-ses were confirmed from pathology reports in the EMR. All women in the study were cross-referenced with the Boston Medical Center Cancer Registry to ensure no cancerdiagnoses were missed. Since abnormal clinical breast exam results could confound analyses by clinical indication, the study population wasstratified based on the following categories of clinical exams: (1) normal clinical breast exam, (2) mass on clinical breast exam and (3) abnormality other than mass on clinical breastexam (including breast skin changes, nipple changes, nipple discharge). Stratification in this way allowed for restricted analyses on women with normal clinical breast exams. Covariates in analyses included demographics and risk factors for breast cancer: age ( 40 or <40 years), language (English or non-English speaking), race/ethnicity (White,Black, Hispanic, or Other), insurance (private, public, or no insurance), family history of breast cancer, current hormone therapy use, and current oral contraceptive use. Race/ethnicity minority status was included as it has been associated with delays in cancer screening, 17diagnosis,18,19and treatment.19-21Year of referral was included in analyses to account for potential secular trends in imaging and diagnostic utilization. Statistical Analyses Demographic differences be tween women with and with- out initial imaging were identi fied using the chi-square test or t-test. Subsequent clinical services utilization was compared between the women who received initialimaging and those who did not. These associations were examined within each of the three strata of clinical breast exam results. Unadjusted logistic regressions determinedthe odds of each measure of clinical utilization in women who received initial imaging compared to those who did not receive initial imaging. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models assessed the effect of initial imaging on subsequent clinical utiliza- tion, controlling for demographic and clinical variables.Multivariate models were applied to the study population as a whole and the three clinical breast exam result strata. Variables that were not associated with the outcome at thep<0.05 level and variables that did not change effect estimates by greater than 10% were removed from the model. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to rule out alterna- tive explanations of findings. For women with normal clinical breast exams, we compared the subgroup with noinitial imaging to the subgroup with normal initial imaging results (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BIR- ADS) 1 or 2). Using age as a proxy for menopausal status,we conducted a stratified analysis of women less than and equal or greater than 50 years of age. Provider seen at initial visit was included in analyses to account for provider-specific practices in managing breast pain. Because of the small number of patients seen by some providers, cluster analysis was not possible. Instead, we stratified the analysesby one outlier provider with a higher rate of initial imaging compared to the other providers. All data were analyzed using Statistical Analysis System version 9.1 (SAS Institute,Cary, NC). RESULTS Breast pain accounted for 32% of new patient referrals seen by internal medicine breast providers from January 2009 - December 2009. The mean age was 39 \u00b113 years with 60% of women under age 40, 87% were of minority race/ ethnicity, 55% were English speaking, and 73% had noinsurance or public health insurance (Medicaid or Medicare) (Table 1). Twenty percent of women reported current oral contraceptive use, and 2% reported current postmenopausal818 Howard et al.: Imaging and the Clinical Management of Breast Pain JGIMhormone therapy use. Over half had a normal clinical breast exam (55%); 12% had a palpable mass noted on clinical breast exam. Receipt of Initial Imaging Twenty-five percent of wom en were referred for diag- nostic imaging at initial provider visit (Table 1). Women who received initial imaging were more likely to be white race/ethnicity ( p=0.02), English-speaking ( p=0.008), have a mass on clinical breast exam ( p<0.0001), and have a family history of breast cancer ( p=0.02) than women who did not receive initial imaging. Receipt ofinitial imaging was associated with provider seen at initial visit ( p<0.0001). When the association between provider and initial imaging was stratified by clinical breast examresults, this association was not significant in women with a mass on clinical breast exam ( p=0.06), butremained in women with normal clinical breast exams (p<0.0001). Subsequent Clinical Services Utilization Women who received initial imaging were more likely to have subsequent imaging, biopsies, additional visits, and higher clinical services utilization than women who do not receive initial imaging (Table 2). Ninety-eight percent of women who received imaging initially had additional clinical services utilization, versus 26% of women who did not receive imaging ( p<0.0001). After adjusting for clinical breast exam results, age, family history, and provider, the odds of having a higher level of clinical services utilization for women who received initial imagingwere 25.4 (95% CI: 16.7,38.6).

The variability in imaging ordering behaviors varied among both the low- and high-volume providers. The percent of patients receiving initial imaging ranged from 5 -31% among providers. Since the subjects seen by Provider 2 made up 46% of the population that received imaging, we performed a sensitivity analysis separating this provider from the other seven providers.The odd ratios of adjusted subsequent imaging was 6.3(adjusted for age and family history, 95%CI: 2.8, 14.3) compared with the adjusted OR for all other providers (7.7, 95% CI: 4.6, 13.1), suggesting that the findings were not attributable to this provider. We did not control for imaging results in our analyses, as BIRADS results were significantly associated with all outcome measures.

When comparing the 437 women with normal clinical examand no initial imaging to the 58 women who had a normal exam and initial imaging that revealed normal findings (BIRADS 1 or 2), the adjusted OR remained high at 18.0(95%CI: 9.4, 59.0), indicating that with normal imaging results, increased subsequent utilization remains. Stratifying women by age greater than 50 years (adjusted OR=12.3,95% CI: 5.2, 36.8) or less than 50 years (adjusted OR 5.4, 95% CI: 3.3, 8.821) did not show major differences in subsequent additional imaging. Breast Cancer Diagnoses Six (0.6%) breast cancers were diagnosed in this studypopulation during the study timeframe, four ductal carcino-ma in situ (DCIS) and two invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC, Tables 6and7). Cross-referencing with the hospital cancer registry revealed no additional cancer diagnoses in the studycohort. Five of the 6 women initially presented with an abnormal clinical breast exam; 4 with a mass and one with focal tenderness. Four of these women were diagnosedthrough imaging that was initiated as result of a mass found on clinical breast examination. Table 6and7shows that three of them had timely diagnostic services as a result(Cases 1, 2, 3), while one had almost one year delay due to development of cellulitis and two missed appointments (Case 4). One of these cancers (Case 3) was diagnosed inthe breast contralateral to the pain, so that only three of these four cancer diagnoses were concordant with the presenting symptoms. One woman presented with focal tenderness (Case 5) but no discrete mass on initial clinical breast exam and had diagnostic imaging that was read asnormal. At a follow-up visit 92 days later, a mass was found on the breast contralateral to the initial site of pain. The patient declined a breast biopsy twice and did not keep oneappointment, resulting in a delay in her diagnosis. Only one cancer was diagnosed in a woman who presented with a normal clinical breast examination (Case 6). This caseTable 6.

In summary, three of the women had incidental cancer diagnoses (the cancer site did not correspond with the patient-reported area of pain or clinicalfindings); three had a cancer concordant with their clinical presentation and exam findings. DISCUSSION This is the first study to date that measures outcomes in addition to cancer diagnoses in women with breast pain.Our results indicate that initial imaging in the evaluation of breast pain increases subsequent clinical utilization, regard- less of clinical breast exam findings. Women who receivedinitial imaging were significantly more likely to undergo additional diagnostic evaluation. Most importantly, women with normal clinical breast exams had increased odds ofclinical utilization if they received initial imaging, with no benefit of increased cancer detection. The findings did not change when the data was stratified by age as a proxy formenopausal status, or stratified by one provider with higher rates of initial imaging. These results support existing data demonstrating a low probability of malignancy in women presenting with breast pain as a primary complaint. 9-11The number of cancers diagnosed represents 0.6% of the study population, within the range of 0-3% previously documented in the medical literature.7-9Three of the 6 cancers were detected with initial imaging showing a lesion that corresponded with a mass at the site of breast pain; one had a negative initial mammogram with imaging three months later finding acontralateral DCIS, while two were detected through screening mammography (not considered diagnostic imaging in analyses). Diagnostic imaging in women with breast painand normal clinical exams yielded no cancer diagnoses. Previous studies in women with breast pain have sought to describe the causes, prevalence, and treatment of breastpain. Studies analyzing imaging in evaluation of breast pain have focused on cancer diagnosis as the outcome, and have demonstrated low yield of imaging in the setting of normalfindings on clinical examinations. 8-11,14,22Nevertheless, imaging has been recommended for reassurance purposes,9 with no data describing its effect on the management of breast pain. By looking at clinical utilization outcomes, we measured the effect imaging has on clinical management of breast pain. Our data show that imaging in the initialevaluation of breast pain leads to increased clinical utilization without increased breast cancer detection. While initial imaging in women with breast pain has beenrecommended for reassurance purposes, there is significant increased subsequent utilization in women who receive initial imaging, without increased diagnostic yield.Overutilization of diagnostic imaging is a concern, particularly as healthcare reform demands efforts to curtail overutilization. 23,24In addition, normal test results do not necessarily lead to reassurance, and in some cases can increase anxiety levels and do harm.25-27With efforts to improve health care quality while decreasing costs, itis important to determine if i maging for patients with breast pain is of value in reassuring patients and providers, as reflected in subsequent utilization. The factthat individual provider behaviors vary within the same clinic in the management of women with breast pain and normal clinical breast exams (this variation was absent inwomen with mass on clinical breast exam), suggests a need for establishment of guidelines for women with breast pain. Past studies have posited that the goal of imaging in breast pain is to provide reassurance of benign etiology to the patient and provider. This implies that diagnosticcertainty of non-malignancy s hould increase. Previous research has demonstrated a link between diagnostic certainty and provider clinical actions, such that reducedtest-ordering behaviors are directly influenced by providers ' increased certainty regarding diagnoses. 28-30Applying this association to our study, with reassurance and diagnosticcertainty, subsequent testing should decrease. The increased utilization observed in this study suggests the opposite, that initial imaging does not provide reassurance or increasediagnostic certainty. Several limitations should be considered when inter- preting study findings. Study data did not allow for breastcancer risk adjustment. Using a tool such as the ModifiedGail Model 31was not age-appropriate for all women and there was incomplete data for variables in the tool,including age at first pregnancy, menarche, and menopause. Clinical services provided outside of the institution were not included in analyses. Systematic data to categorize non-malignant diagnoses (i.e. fibroadenoma, cyst) were notavailable and therefore not included in analyses. Clinicalservices and additional visits during 12 months of follow-upattributed to complaints other than breast pain could not beascertained, and therefore we were not able to exclude thesevisits from analyses. A potential referral bias exists in this population in that only women with breast pain referred to a specialty practice were included. Providers in this practice have expertise in clinical breast exams and are likely to have a higher sensitivity and specificity of their exams than most primarycare providers. Markers of patient concern or anxiety were not collected and therefore could not be controlled for in analyses. Using clinical utilization as a proxy for diagnostic certainty does not elucidate whether the patient or provider is driving increased utilization. Patients who received diagnostic imaging following initial provider visit may have demonstrated a higher level of anxiety or concern than patients who did not. Similarly, providers themselves may823 Howard et al.: Imaging and the Clinical Management of Breast Pain JGIMbe uncertain about the underlying etiology of breast pain and therefore order additional diagnostic tests. Futurestudies that prospectively assess anxiety and reasoning for subsequent imaging are needed to address these concerns. While past studies have indicated the main value of breast imaging in women with painful breasts to be that of reassurance, our results show that initial imaging leads toadditional evaluation. Our results support previous research demonstrating that the prevalence of cancer in patients with breast pain is low and suggest that following normal clinicalexam, diagnostic imaging is not required to either rule out cancer or provide reassurance in ruling out cancer. As importantly, these results support the critical role of clinicalbreast exam skills in the evaluation of breast pain. Contributors: The authors thank Timothy C.

This drives the need for a credible implementation in automated data for the International Society of Throm- bosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) de nition of major bleeding. Materials and Methods: We studied 102,395 patients who received 158,511 person-years of warfarin treat- ment from the Veterans Health Administration (VA) between 10/1/06-9/30/08. We constructed a list of ICD-9-CM codes of \"candidate \"bleeding events. Each candidate event was identi ed as a major hemorrhage if it ful lled one of four criteria: 1) associated with death within 30 days; 2) bleeding in a critical anatomic site; 3) associated with a transfusion; or 4) was coded as the event that precipitated or was responsible for the majority of an inpatient hospitalization. Results: This de nition classi ed 11,240 (15.8%) of 71, 338 candidate events as major hemorrhage. Typically, events more likely to be severe were retained at higher rates than those less likely to be severe. For example,Diverticula of Colon with Hemorrhage (562.12) and Hematuria (599.7) were retained 46% and 4% of the time, respectively. Major, intracranial, and fatal hemorrhage were identi ed at rates comparable to those found in randomized clinical trials however, higher than those reported in observational studies: 4.73, 1.29, and 0.41per 100 patient years, respectively. Conclusions: We describe here a workable de nition for identifying major hemorrhagic events from large au- tomated datasets. This method of identifying major bleeding may have applications for quality measurement,quality improvement, and comparative effectiveness research. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Introduction Hemorrhage is a frequent complication of anticoagulant therapy [1]. Therefore, understanding rates of bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulation is an essential ingredient in assessing the risks andbenets of such therapy. The ability to assess rates of bleeding is im- portant for diverse applications, including comparative effectiveness studies of different anticoagulants and efforts to measure and im- prove quality of anticoagulation care. A common approach to detecting any diagnosis, especially in ad- ministrative datasets, involves using International Classi cation of Disease (ICD-9-CM) codes. In examining the accuracy of ICD-9-CM codes to identify complications of anticoagulation therapy, Arnason and colleagues reported a PPV of 87% for major bleeding, which in- creased to 96% when the bleeding code was listed as the 'most responsible diagnosis 'or the 'admitting diagnosis '[2]. This study suggests that automated data alone can be suf cient to identify true-positive episodes of major hemorrhage rivaling that of chart re- view, particularly when additional strategies are employed to boost PPV. The majority of previous studies assessing the accuracy of ICD- 9-CM codes for identifying major hemorrhage have used chart review as a gold standard [2-6].

While chart review is highly accurate, it is resource intensive. A national da- tabase of Medicare bene ciaries, for example, would require chart re- views at every hospital in the United States, which is clearly not practical. To fully harness the power of large databases to inform practice, we cannot always rely upon chart review. To our knowledge,there have been no previous attempts to adapt the ISTH de nition of major hemorrhage for use with automated data. Therefore, the objective of our study was to develop a method for identifying major hemorrhagic events in a linked Veterans Health Ad- ministration (VA)-Medicare dataset [8]. We explored the impact of different de nitions and strategies upon the apparent incidence of major hemorrhage in this automated dataset and compared the rates found in our study with those reported in previous randomized and observational studies. We expected that the results of this effort would pave the way to unlocking the power of large automated datasets to track major hemorrhage for comparative effectiveness re- search and quality assurance/quality improvement. Methods Data The data for this study included all 122,159 patients who received warfarin therapy from the VA between 10/1/06 and 9/30/08, including patients new to warfarin and those who were already experienced users. Details regarding how we built this database appear elsewhere [9]. This included demographics, ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, and dates of service (from both sources), as well as laboratory data and pharmacy records (VA data only). This study was approved by the Institutional Re- view Board of the Bedford VA Medical Center. Since we used a merged VA-Center for Medicare and Medicaid Ser- vices (CMS) dataset, we can be assured of nearly complete capture of all relevant care received by this group [8]. Out of these 122,159, 19,764 patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage program were exclud- ed, because unlike patients participating in this capitated program would not produce itemized claims data, leading to undercounting of events. After excluding patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage, our nal sample consisted of 102,395 patients who received 158,511 person-years of warfarin treatment from the VA. For this study, we de ned a period when each patient was consid- ered to be \"on warfarin \"and therefore eligible to record a bleeding event. The date of warfarin inception is taken to be the rst time war- farin is dispensed by the VA pharmacy or the rst INR test, whichever comes rst. The period begins with the latter of date of warfarin in- ception and 10/1/06; it ends at the latest date of a pharmacy ll plus 30-day grace period (to account for the duration of use) or an INR test, up to a maximum of 9/30/08. These 2 dates de ne a \"window \"for each patient, and only bleeding events that occur during this window can be included. Overview of Strategy to Identify Major Hemorrhage Our strategy was to approximate the ISTH de nition for major hem- orrhage as closely as possible [8], given the nature of our data. The ISTH denition uses the following criteria to de ne major bleeding: 1. Fatal bleeding, and/or, 2. Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ such as intracranial, and/or, 3. Bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 20 g L -1or more, or leading to transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red cells [7]. For the current study, candidate bleeding codes were identi ed from the inpatient and outpatient ICD-9-CM codes recorded in VA and Medicare datasets. We required these codes to ful ll at least one of four criteria to be considered a major hemorrhagic event: 1) bleeding associated with death within 30 days; 2) bleeding into a critical anatomic site which necessarilywould threaten life or limb; 3) bleeding associated with a transfusion of packed red blood cells or whole blood; or 4) a bleeding event charac- terized in our datasets as either the primary reason for a hospital admis- sion (VA data) or the main condition (commonly known as the \"principal diagnosis \") for which the services are provided during a hos- pital stay (Medicare data). ICD-9-CM Codes for Major Hemorrhage We began by examining the lists of ICD-9-CM codes used by several previous studies to identify major hemorrhage, including Schalekamp et al. [5], Boulanger [6],a n dA r n a s o n [2]. Thus, we began with a compre- hensive list of candidate codes building on prior research. Several codes were subsequently excluded as they were felt to not be representative of major hemorrhage, e.g. 593.81, Vascular Disorders of the Kidney. Deletion of Duplicate Events To avoid counting multiple mentions of a single event, we devel- oped decision rules for selecting a single record out of multiple re- cords close in time. For example, this might occur if the course of care for a bleeding event involved 2 locations, such as a transferfrom a non-VA hospital to a VA hospital. We considered records to de- note a single event if they occurred on the same day or within 7 days in either direction and used the same 5-digit ICD-9-CM code. We also developed an algorithm to determine which event to retain when two conflicted; details can be found in Appendix A. Finally, we developed an algorithm to assign a \"primary \"type of bleeding when codes for different types of bleeding occurred on the same date. We created ve main categories of bleeding, namely intra- cranial bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, hemarthrosis, urinary bleeding, and bleeding from the throat. It was uncommon to have bleeding codes from more than one category on the same day. For pa- tients with multiple codes within a category, we created a ranked hi- erarchy of codes within category to aid in selecting a single code for each episode. Details for this algorithm are found in Appendix B. Denition: Fatal Bleeding For the outcome of death and its date, we used the VA Vital Status Mini-File. This dataset combines multiple sources of data, including the national death index, Medicare data, and VA data to determine a single best date of death for each VA patient. The Vital Status Mini-File is considered a reliable and authoritative source for dates of death among VA patients [10]. We de ned fatal hemorrhage as a bleeding event followed by death within 30 days. However, we excluded certain categories of bleeding that were implausible causes of death, including epistaxis, hematuria, bladder wall hemorrhage, hemarthrosis, and any bleeding associated with internal or external hemorrhoids. Patients who died within 30 days of such events were not considered to have died be- cause of the bleeding. Denition: Critical Anatomic Site Bleeding into a critical anatomic site was de ned as major bleeding, because it would necessarily threaten life or limb. This included any type of intracranial hemorrhage, hemopericardium, hemoperitoneum, and any type of hemarthrosis (which would threaten limb function). We could not include retroperitoneal hemorrhage, intraspinal, intraoc- ular, and intramuscular bleeding with compartment syndrome, which are equally serious, because no ICD-9-CM code uniquely identi es these conditions. Additionally, to a large extent we have likely captured these relatively uncommon intraspinal and intramuscular bleeding episodes using the all-purpose ICD-9-CM code \"Hemorrhage NOS \" (459.0). for intracranial hemorrhage,32 G.K. Jasuja et al. Research 131 (2013) 31 -36a subset of critical-site bleeding de ned by 431, 432.0, 432.1, and 432.9. Denition: Transfusion We identi ed all transfusions of packed red blood cells or whole blood that occurred within 30 days of a bleeding event. The number of units transfused was not available. Transfusions were identi ed from surgical codes 99.0, 99.03, or 99.04 (Blood Transfusion, Whole Blood Transfusion, and Packed Cell Transfusion) or CPT codes 36430, 36431, or 36440 (Blood Transfusion Service). Denition: Inpatient Diagnosis Code In VA data, the \"primary \"diagnosis for each inpatient admission is the ICD-9-CM code for the condition that is most responsible for the patients' length of stay. In the CMS dataset, a \"principal \"code was identi ed as the diagnosis, condition, problem or other reason for the admission/encounter/visit shown in the medical record to be chiefly responsible for the services provided. We considered any ICD-9-CM code that occupied the primary or the principal position for an inpatient stay to represent a major hemorrhage. Statistical Analyses We considered any candidate event which ful lled at least one of the four criteria discussed above (fatal event, critical anatomic site, transfusion, primary reason for a hospitalization) to represent a major hemorrhage. We also performed sensitivity analyses using an alterna- tive, more restrictive de nition that omitted the criterion \"primary di- agnosis code \". We compared, in tabular form, the proportion of events retained under each de nition, strati ed by ICD-9-CM code. For these analyses, we allowed multiple events and did not censor. For age-strati ed rates of bleeding, all events were classi ed by patient's age as of Oct. 1, 2006, not age at time of event. Con dence in- tervals were obtained assuming events were Poisson-distributed. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Drs. Rose and Jasuja and Mr. Reisman had full access to the study data and guarantee the accuracy and completeness of the results. ResultsPatients Descriptive characteristics of the patients are reported in Table 1 . The study sample primarily consisted of White males, with a median age of 70 years. Approximately 74% of the sample had been using warfarin for at least one year at the time of study inception. Patients in this study had a high burden of comorbid illness; for example, 31% had heart failure, 39% had diabetes, and 14% had chronic kidney disease. The burden of mental health conditions was also consider- able: 23% of patients carried a diagnosis of depression, and 11% a di- agnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. Twenty-eight percent of patients were hospitalized at least once during the two-year study. Inclusion of Candidate Events Table 2 lists the bleeding ICD-9-CM codes for only those codes with at least 100 candidate events, and shows the number and rates for each of these bleeding event retained and the reason for their in- clusion. A full version of this table, which also includes rarer event types, is presented in Supplementary Table 1 (Online Appendix). Among 71,338 unique events, 11,240 events (15.8%) were retained. Events that would seem on their face to be relatively severe were more often retained. For example, Diverticula of Colon with Hemorrhage (562.12), 46%,43% and 42% of the time, respectively. Many candidate events, however, were contributed by event types that would only rarely have truly severe manifestations; these events were retained at much lower rates. For ex-ample, there were 30,100 episodes of Hematuria (representing 42% of candidate events), but only 4% of them quali ed as major hemorrhage by our de nition. Similarly, there were 5,927 episodes of Epistaxis, but only 6% were retained. Comparison of rates of inclusion and retention for our main de nition and the more restrictive de nition are presented in Supplementary Table 2 (Online Appendix). Population Rates of Major Hemorrhage We computed event rates by age strata for major hemorrhage, intra- cranial hemorrhage, and fatal hemorrhage for the entire 102,395 patients who received 158,511 patient-years of warfarin treat- ment from the VA ( Table 3 ). Major hemorrhage occurred with an overall rate of 4.73 per 100 patient-years. The rate of intracranial hem- orrhage, 1.29, represented 27% of all major hemorrhages, and the rate of fatal hemorrhage, 0.41, represented 9% of all major hemorrhages. There was an increasing rate of all 3 kinds of hemorrhage (any major, intracra- nial, and fatal) with increasing age. In particular, the rate of fatal hemor- rhage increased sharply above age 70. Comparison of the Present Study to other Major Studies Table 4 presents a comparison of the rates of major bleeding reported in previous observational and randomized studies with the present study.

Jasuja et al. / Thrombosis Research 131 (2013) 31 -36cohorts such as ATRIA (0.91 per 100 person-years) and ACTION (1.90 per 100 person-years) were much lower than what we found in our study. The rates for major bleeding found in randomized clinical trials ranged from 2.2 per 100 person-years (ACTIVE W, 2006) to 3.4 per- cent per year (ROCKET-AF, 2011). Rates of bleeding from earlier stud- ies (as re flected in the Linkins meta-analysis) tended to be higher (the cumulative rate of all included studies was 7.2 percent per year). Discussion The ability to perform surveillance for adverse events is a key foun- dation for any program of comparative effectiveness research or quality measurement and improvement. Major hemorrhage is an adverse event common to all types of anticoagulant therapy, and therefore the ability to identify major hemorrhage in real-time, using an automated approach, would be extremely attractive. In this study, we sought to de- velop a comprehensive de nition for identifying major hemorrhagic events among warfarin patients in a large, automated database, in a set- ting where chart review would not be possible. In our population of patients receiving warfarin therapy for varied indications from the VA, we found an overall rate of major hemor- rhage of 4.73 events/100 patient-years. The rates 1.29 and 0.41 events/100 patient-years, re- spectively. These rates of warfarin-related bleeding are similar in magnitude to the rates observed in recent large randomized trials, such as ROCKET-AF, ARISTOTLE, SPORTIF-V and RE-LY, as well as the pooled results of earlier randomized and observational studies sum- marized in a key meta-analysis by Linkins, et al. [1]. However, our rates for major bleeding were much higher than those reported in ob- servational cohorts such as ACTION, ATRIA and Euro Heart Survey; this is likely attributable to a much higher illness burden among VA patients. Taken together, these results suggest that our approach toidentifying major hemorrhage in warfarin patients may achieve similar results to other methods that have been employed. In addition, we note that the risk of any major hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, and fatal hemorrhage among this at-risk population all increased in our study with increasing age, with a generally monotonic trend. This also echoes the ndings of earlier studies [20-22]and further suggestsTable 2 Inclusion of candidate events by ICD-9-CM code. The total number of candidate events was 71,338, of which 11,240 were retained (15.8%). In this abbrev iated version of the table, only event types with 100 candidate events are shown; the full version of the table, including rarer event types, can be found in the online appendix (Supplementary Table 1) .

The main limitation of this study is that we were not able to perform chart review to con rm cases of major hemorrhage, in large part because the merged VA-Medicare dataset we used would have required us to ob- tain data from every hospital in the United States. However, as discussed above, this study represents an important effort to nd a rigorous and thoughtful approach to identifying warfarin-related major hemorrhage when a chart review is simply not possible. Our efforts borrowed heavily from previous studies that had used chart review as a gold standard [2-6]. However, no study involving chart review could have ever included a da- tabase of this size, because of the expense involved in reviewing so many charts. This study, therefore, represents an important effort to apply the results of previous (smaller) studies, which did involve chart review, to a new, larger platform, one which is ultimately necessary if automated da- tabases are to be used for such important purposes as comparative effec- tiveness and quality assurance. Because Medicare data, which largely formed the basis of our study, is also the basis for so many other studies, our approach and our results may have wide applicability. However, since our at-risk population comprised of only patients on warfarin, ndings from this study are only generalizable to patients on oral anticoagulant therapy such as warfarin and may not apply, for example, to patients re- ceiving aspirin alone. Our de nition for major bleeding was actually fairly conservative, and it seems likely that we undercounted major bleeding if anything. The ISTH de nition [7]includes a drop in hemoglobin level of 20 g L-1 to qualify an event as a major hemorrhage. We were unable to precisely characterize the time course of the hemoglobin level, particularly when using Medicare data (which does not include lab results). Therefore, he- moglobin levels were not used as a criterion for major hemorrhages in our study, and this likely resulted in considerable undercounting of events that otherwise would have quali ed. On the other hand, it is possible that our de nition overcounted cer- tain events; indeed, we cannot have avoided this entirely. In particular, our addition of a primary inpatient diagnosis code to the criteria for major hemorrhage represents an innovation, and is not contained with- in the original ISTH de nition [7]. We considered this necessary as a way to compensate partially for our inability to establish major hemor- rhage based on hemoglobin levels. In addition, this decision was supported by the nding of Arnason, et al. [2]that ICD-9 codes for hem- orrhage have a 96% PPV when they are in the primary position for an in- patient stay. To us, this choice seemed like a logical way to capture at least some of the events that would have been included had we been able to track hemoglobin values. In addition, it can of course be argued that any bleeding that causes a hospitalization (or prolongs one) is, by denition, \"major \". Those who prefer to employ a de nition more close- ly aligned to the original ISTH de nition may wish to use our variant denition, which omitted this criterion (see Online Appendix for a comparison of the main and variant de nitions). However, our maindenition ltered more severe types of events to a lesser extent and ltered less severe sorts of events much more heavily. For example, \"Diverticulosis of Colon with Hemorrhage\" (562.13) was retained 47% of the time, while \"Hematuria\" (599.7) was retained only 4% of the time. In this respect, we consider our approach a success in differentiat- ing between major and minor hemorrhagic events. In conclusion, a de nition of \"warfarin-related major bleeding \", modeled on similar parameters as the ISTH de nition and applied to an automated dataset, allowed for computation of meaningful and com- parable rates of hemorrhage. This method of extracting major hemor- rhage may also prove useful with other automated datasets similar to our VA-Medicare merged dataset, for applications including compara- tive effectiveness, quality measurement, and quality improvement.

Gifford, MD5 Abstract Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify and describe ways that a spiritually based intervention of silently repeating a mantram\u2014sacred word or phrase\u2014was used as a coping strategy for managing humanimmunodeciency virus (HIV) disease.Design: The design was a qualitative research method, the critical incident technique. Settings/location: The study was conducted at an academically afliated Veterans Affairs Hospital in southern California. Subjects: The subjects were outpatient adults living with HIV ( n=32) who were receiving care through HIV clinics, community agencies, and HIV providers.Interventions: Subjects who participated in the intervention arm of a randomized controlled trial that tested the efcacy of a 5-weekly group mantram intervention were interviewed 2 months postintervention. Follow-uptelephone interviews were specically aimed at identifying instances of mantram use, and also participantperceptions of intervention usefulness or nonusefulness.Outcome measures: The outcome measures comprised categorization and comparison of the types and fre- quency of incidents reported, describing ways that the intervention was ''helpful'' or ''not helpful'' in managing stressors of HIV disease.Results: Participants reported a total of 185 incidents. Analysis and classication of the incidents resulted in eight mutually exclusive categories, including Increasing calm and/or peace, Mastering the technique, Changingmy viewpoint, Increasing personal awareness, Adjusting behaviors, Managing physical symptoms, Increasingspirituality, and Enhancing relationships.Conclusions: This study shows support for the benets of the mantram intervention for adults with HIV. Additionally, the spiritually based mantram repetition intervention was found to be more helpful in providing a convenient, portable tool for managing a wide range of situations related to living with HIV disease. Introduction Although great strides have been made in the treat- ment of human immunodeciency virus (HIV) disease and in extending both the quality and length of life, HIV/acquired immunodeciency syndrome (AIDS) remains astressful and demanding illness. 1The psychologic and phys- ical demands of coping with complex medication regimens, side-effects of treatment, symptom severity, as well as co-morbid illnesses can be overwhelming and may influencehealth care behaviors such as medication adherence, sub- stance use, sexual risk taking, or other behaviors that influ-ence health outcomes. 1,2In addition, persons living with HIV disease often experience psychosocial challenges such as de- pression, isolation, and traumatic life events that can impactthe course of HIV disease progression. 2,3Evidence suggests that stress may hasten HIV disease progression by increasing viral replication and suppressing the immune response.4-6 Intervention studies using combinations of cognitive and relaxation therapies in the era of highly active antiretroviral 1University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, NC. 2VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA. 3Nursing Service for Research, VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA. 4Veterans Medical Research Foundation, San Diego, CA. 5Center for Health Quality, Outcomes & Economic Research, Boston University School of Public Health, Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital, Bedford, MA.THE JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE Volume 18, Number 1, 2012, pp. 76-82\u00aaMary Ann Liebert, tative measures in HIV-infected persons.7Limitations of these studies are that (1) they assessed multiple-component interventions (e.g., a variety of relaxation techniques andcognitive-behavioral strategies), making it difcult to con- clude which ones accounted for changes in health status; (2) most were conducted on samples of gay and bisexual men,thus failing to study women and heterosexuals; and (3) most were pre-experimental or had a wait-list control group rather than a comparable control group. Although research ndings are not entirely consistent, there is some evidence that spirituality predicts slower HIV disease progression. 8,9Patients who have endorsed a greater sense of spirituality after being diagnosed with HIV haveshown a slower decline in CD4 cell counts and better control of viral load over 4 years. 8 Recent attention has been directed toward developing spirituality-based interventions for managing stressors of chronic illness, including HIV/AIDS.10-12Practices such as prayer and meditation, for example, have been cited ascommonly used coping strategies by persons living withHIV/AIDS. 13-15More research on the healing aspects of spirituality is needed as new methods to measure spirituality are becoming rened.16-19 Objectives In light of the huge impact of the psychologic burden experienced by persons living with HIV/AIDS, it is impor-tant to gain a broader understanding of the specic uses that a mantram-based, spiritual intervention has on the percep- tions and behavioral actions of persons living with HIVdisease. To provide a more comprehensive picture of theusefulness of a mantram intervention developed by Bor- mann and colleagues, 20a qualitative component was added to the larger randomized controlled trial (RCT). Follow-upinterviews were conducted with participants in the mantram arm of the original study at 2 months postintervention to enhance the quality and credibility of the quantitative nd-ings. 21The interviews were specically aimed at determining how the skills learned from a mantram intervention played out in the real life of study participants. This analysis ex-amined the qualitative interview ndings. Specic objectives for this analysis included (1) identifying incidences of man- tram use following participation in a spiritually basedmantram intervention, and (2) identifying participant per-ceptions of intervention usefulness or nonusefulness. Materials and Methods Procedures In the original RCT, Bormann and colleagues examined the efcacy of a group-based mantram intervention on HIVoutcomes with a sample of HIV-infected adults receiving outpatient care through HIV clinics, community agencies, and HIV providers. 20The study was conducted through the VA San Diego Health Care System and the University ofCalifornia San Diego. Human subject approvals were ob- tained from university and VA hospital committees. In the original RCT, participants were randomly assigned to either a mantram-based intervention or to an attention- matched education control group. Participants attended aseries of 5 weekly 90-minute sessions, followed by 4 weekly automated phone calls from co-facilitators, and a nal booster session in week 10. Sessions consisted of how to (1) choose and use a mantram, (2) practice slowing down one's thinkingto help set health-related priorities, and (3) develop one- pointed attention for stress management. Participants were given The Mantram Handbook , 22a list of mantrams to choose from and course manual with homework exercises. Weekly assignments included practicing mantram repetition at non- stressful times, such as each night before sleep or whilewaiting in lines. Other strategies taught were slowing downmentally and behaviorally, to make wiser choices, set priori- ties, and decrease hurried behavior, and one-pointed attention to increase concentration for repeating the mantram or en-gaging in one task at a time. For a more complete description of the intervention, see Bormann, 2006. 20The qualitative data in this analysis were obtained through follow-up telephoneinterviews conducted at 2 months postintervention to assess the uses and sustainability of mantram practice. Based on the ndings of a larger RCT, it was anticipated that this spiritually based intervention would foster thecontinued use of positive coping behaviors in persons with HIV/AIDS. Interviews A qualitative research method, the critical incident tech- nique, 23was chosen for its ability to pinpoint specic behav- iors and benets of the mantram. This valid and reliableinterviewing format is a very practical and efcient method for obtaining information quickly and in the participants' own words. 24Critical incident interviews may be very brief, per- haps as short as 10-15 minutes. They are designed to pinpointfacts and eliminate personal opinion or generalizations. 23 They require only simple types of judgments and responsesfrom the participants, and are used to increase knowledgeabout little-known phenomena, such as mantram repetition. The critical incident technique has been applied in a va- riety of health care settings to examine patients' met andunmet psychologic needs, 25predict patient perceptions of nurse behaviors,26and gather information about extended care nursing27and long-term care facilities.28 In the current study, critical incident interviews were conducted as follows. Participants were contacted 2 months after the nal group session by a research nurse, trained inthe critical incident interviewing method. Telephone audio-taped interviews were conducted on all participants, asking them to recall specic incidents of mantram use. Participants were asked to describe as many situations as could be re-membered and to give examples of successful outcomes, as they dened it. Standard probes were used to obtain a more complete description of the context of the incident. Thecritical incident interviews lasted approximately 15 minutes and were transcribed for analysis. A critical incident expert was consulted prior to and during the study to guide themethods and analysis (e.g., taught the interviewer how to ask questions and assisted with data interpretation). Data preparation and analysis The data obtained through the critical incident interviews were analyzed through an inductive classication process developed by Flanagan. 23This careful process enabled theMANTRAM INTERVENTION 77researchers to build a comprehensive picture of the behav- ioral dimensions of mantram use.29 First, the transcribed interview data were audited to en- sure that each of the incidents included complete behavioraldescriptions and also demonstrated a linkage between what the respondent did or did not do and the resulting outcome. The members of the research team and a doctorally preparednurse with expertise in the critical incident research method made these judgments. Only 185 incidents out of 200 or 93% met Flanagan's criteria and were included in the analysis. Incidents, which were judged to be nearly identical or very similar, were grouped together. Similar groupings were then combined to form subcategories of behaviors. Subcategories were sorted and grouped together to dene more inclusivemajor categories of mantram use. Members of the research team and two doctoral-prepared nurses with expertise in HIV/AIDS and research methods independently re-sortedthe incidents, and their disagreements were used to rene and determine the nal set of eight mutually exclusive and exhaustive major behavioral categories. As a check on the comprehensiveness of the classication system, 10% of the incidents were randomly selected using a table of random numbers and were independently catego- rized by 2 expert reviewers. The percent of inter-rateragreement was 95%. Results Subjects Table 1 shows the demographic and severity of illness characteristics for the participants included in this analysis(n=32). The majority of the sample was male (78.1%) with a mean age of 44.1 years (standard deviation [SD] 6.7). Forty- three percent (43%) of the participants were nonwhite. The mean CD4 count for the sample was 517/mm 3(SD 280.43), with an average time since acquiring an HIV diagnosis of 8.3 years (SD 5.96). At the time of the study, 23 of 32 participants (71%) were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy.The majority of the respondents reported that they were never married or partnered (59.4%; n=19), while 81% ( n=22) identied with a religious group. Ap- proximately 41% of participants scored above the cutoff for depressive symptoms on the Clinical Epidemiology Study-Depression scale. Critical incident analysis A total of 185 incidents describing mantram use behaviors were obtained from 32 participants who completed themantram intervention. The analysis and classication of the incidents resulted in 8 mutually exclusive categories, and 16 subcategories. Major categories of mantram use included the following: Increasing calm and/or peace, Mastering the technique, Changing my viewpoint, Increasing personal awareness, Adjusting behaviors,Managing physical symptoms, Increasing spirituality, and Enhan-cing relationships. A review of the incidents that were sorted into each category determined the denition. The taxonomy of major mantram repetition behaviors is presented in Table 2. The largest category, increasing calm and/or peace , ac- counted for 36% of the total number of incidents. Two thirdsof the incidents placed within this category ( n=42; 64%) described behaviors where mantram repetition increased asense of peace or calm in response to an identied stressor, including waiting for a doctor appointment, encountering a stressful situation while riding on public transportation, orbeing late for an appointment because ''someone was late picking me up.'' As one of the participants stated:Table 1.Demographic Data (n=32) Variable RangeMean (yrs) SD Frequency Age 29-57 44.1 6.7 32 Years with HIV 0.5-25 8.3 5.96 32 Sex Male 25 (78%) Female 7 (22%) Ethnicity White 18 (56.3%) Black 11 (34.4%)Hispanic 3 (9.4%) Risk factors Male/male sex 18 (27.3%)Heterosexual 11 (16.7%)Don't know 8 (12.1%) IV drug use 5 (7.6%) Transfusion recipient 1 (1.5%) Education High school or less 8 (25.0%)Some college 18 (56.3%)College degree or higher 6 (18.8%) Marital Never 9 Depression (CES-D) None 13 (40.6%)Mild to moderate 6 (18.8%) Major 13 (40.6%) Identies with a religious group Yes 22 (68.8%) No 10 (31.3%) SD, standard KEMPPAINEN ET AL.When I am really frustrated or in a line or something, I don't let that bother me. I just say my mantram, and before you know it, I am right up at the front of theline. It has really worked for me. Mantram repetition was also used for managing emo- tions related to driving in heavy trafc or encountering ''road rage.'' Many participants found that briefly repeating a mantram generated a sense of calm, and reduced negativefeelings toward other drivers. Although Easwaran 22did not endorse using mantram while driving, mantram repetition appeared to be more helpful than harmful. No onereported any accidents attributed to mantram repetition while driving. The following example describes a trafc- related incident: Instead of shouting or yelling or swearing at some- body in trafc, I just start using my mantram to bringmyself off that cliff. I use it just about every time .. Instead of throwing words out the window, I can just sort of say it to myself ..I don't drive away from the situation with my blood boiling, all mad and upset,because I realize that I keep myself down and don't let myself get to that hyped-up point. Additional incidents placed into this category involved increasing calm without an identied stressor (n=11; 17%). As one participant stated: Sometimes when I get stressed out....like if I was having a really, really bad day .I deal with the anxiety and stress by using the mantram. An additional 17% of the incidents in this category described the use of mantram repetition to replace anger with a sense of peace or calm. As one participant stated: The mantram, in itself, was very helpful. It helped out in a lot of different situations .being confronted by rude people, like in the public, and to keep from promoting violence, you know, just to back off and repeat it. Two (2) additional incidents grouped within this major category describe the effectiveness of mantram repetition in calming others. The second category, mastering the technique, reflected in- cidents where subjects practiced the primary skills of themantram course intervention, including practicing training n=3; 8%). The third category, changing my viewpoint , accounted for 16% of the total number of incidents. The majority of the incidents within this category ( n=23; 77%) described circumstances where the study participants changed per- spective about a circumstance or event. As 1 participant stated: I used to stress out about going to the doctor but don't do that anymore. I say my mantram instead. I had acolon test that I put off for a year and a half. I was so afraid thinking, ''Oh my God, what if I have colon cancer?'' And I scared myself so bad. I thought I'mgoing to get this done. And I called the doctor and I scheduled it. In the past, I would have been such a drama person about this and afraid that I had some-thing before I went in. .I changed my whole thing of having a negative thing and going into a positive and not putting that much worth on it. The fourth category, increasing personal awareness, included 15 (8%) incidents that described the linkages between man-tram use and an increasing awareness of emotional and physical states. As 1 participant stated, ''It taught me to feel how different my brain felt when I was calm so then I couldsense that when I was getting angry.'' Incidents that described behavior changes related to mantram repetition were placed in the fth category. Thefollowing examples of changing behaviors include: When I get ready to eat, I turn the TV off and I just eat and just enjoy my meal. Instead of like eating and watching TV or listening to music, now I just relax andtake time for myself.I am trying to be more patient with people that are not as quick as I need them to be at the moment or when I am talking to someone who is a little slower in un-derstanding. I'm trying to also stop interrupting peo- ple and nish things for Behaviors (n=185Incidents ) Major categoryNumber of incidents Percent I. Increasing calm and/or peace (66 incidents; 36%) 1.

Within this category, eight incidents described the use of mantram repetition as a sleep aid: It helps me to use the mantram instead of just lying in bed and tossing and turning. I can use my mantram and just repeat my mantram and I fall back asleep..The next thing you know, it's the next morning. One (1) participant described the successful use of man- tram repetition to ''ease breathing'' during an episode carinii pneumonia (PCP), while a second par- ticipant reported using mantram repetition to ease physicalpain. The two remaining categories included increasing spir- ituality (n=4, 2%) and enhancing relationships (n=1). Perceptions of usefulness or nonusefulness of mantram program Of the total number of reported incidents, the majority (99%) were positive reports of instances when mantram repetition enhanced the respondent's coping. Two (2) nega- tive incidents associated with mantram use were reported,including the following: One of the things I was presented with was single task activity. I can't say that it was helpful and it was cer- tainly contrary to everything I have ever done. I nd itdifcult to utilize that concept and I don't see how it can be used effectively. I learned the futility of trying to document the timesand numbers of the mantra use. I thought it was dis-tracting and counterproductive.'' Discussion This critical incident study represents a comprehensive effort to identify specic patterns of mantram use by persons living with HIV disease following participation in a spiritu-ally based education program. This practical and efcient qualitative method allowed the researchers to gain a greater depth of understanding about the perceptions of study par-ticipants, as well as precise descriptions of behavioral out-comes of the mantram intervention. Participants reported using mantram repetition up to 2 months following the in- tervention, suggesting the sustainability of the intervention.An additional important nding is that the major categories of mantram use reflected the content of the educational program designed to teach this competency, as well as thendings of the larger RCT. Eight (8) major categories of mantram use behaviors emerged from the critical incident interviews. The majorcategories from most to least frequent number of incidents included the following: Increasing calm and/or peace, Mastering the technique, Changing my viewpoint, Increasing personalawareness, Adjusting behaviors, Managing physical symptoms,Increasing spirituality, and Enhancing relationships. The fact that these major categories of mantram use were made up of multiple, similar behaviors lends credibility to their re-ports. 23,29In addition, the reliability checks and the rigor of the critical incident technique suggest that the categories alsohave a consistent meaning to the study participants, as well as to the members of the research team who derived them.29 The largest category of mantram repetition behaviors, Finding calm or peace, reflected some ndings that were not as clearly identied in the larger RCT. For example, results from the critical incident analysis revealed that study participants used mantram repetition to manage specic stressful situa-tions and to decrease feelings of anxiety. In the quantitative measures, however, there were decreases of anxiety and perceived stress over time, but these results were found inboth mantram and control groups, and could not be attrib-uted to only the intervention. On the other hand, the quali- tative critical incident data indicated that participants used mantram repetition to manage emotions other than stress,including anger and frustration. These ndings are similar to the larger RCT, 20,30where signicant improvements were found in reducing anger, and these reductions were medi-ated by increased appraisal coping. The second most frequent category of mantram repetition behaviors, mastering the technique, described incidents where study participants continued to practice strategies taughtduring the intervention. This nding further expands the quantitative outcome results of Bormann and colleagues, 20 who found signicant relationships between frequency of mantram practice using wrist counters and quality of life, spiritual well-being, and subscales of meaning/purpose and faith/assurance. Although the frequency of mantram prac-tice may have had a valuable, therapeutic effect on psycho- logic distress, this interpretation must be viewed with caution because participants who practiced mantram morefrequently were self-selected. The majority of the remaining categories directly reflect how the group-based mantram intervention was designed topromote increased metacognitive awareness to stressors aswell as to strategies for evaluating cognitive and emotional responses to stressors. In the third most frequent category, Changing my viewpoint, participants reported that the use of mantram repetition led to changes in their primary ap- praisals of stressful events, as well as changes in their ap- praisals of methods for coping with those events. The criticalincidents in the fourth most frequent behavioral category, Increasing personal awareness, indicated that mantram repeti- tion cultivated increased metacognitive skills and heightenedawareness of stressful events and to their own internal re-sponses to stressors. A fth category, Adjusting behaviors, reflected changes in their coping skills. Linkages were noted between the major categories, Changing my viewpoint, In- creasing personal awareness , and Adjusting behaviors and the quantitative study ndings from the RCT. In a secondary analysis performed on quantitative data from the originalRCT, Bormann and Carrico 30found signicant increases in positive reappraisal coping in the mantram arm participants over the 5-week intervention period. Analysis of the critical incident data also reflects consis- tency between the eighth category, Increasing spirituality, and the quantitative ndings of the larger RCT. Bormann andcolleagues 20,31found that participants in the mantram arm RCT increased both spiritual faith/assurance and spiri- tual connectedness as well as signicant correlations be- tween of mantram practice sessions and faith/assurance).80 were found between the many behav- ioral categories and the quantitative ndings of the larger RCT, a difference was noted for the incidents in category six, Managing symptoms. A clear connection between the inci- dents in this category and the quantitative data in the larger RCT was not evident. The influence of spirituality on the management of physical symptoms, however, has receivedincreased attention in the literature. 32-34Wachholtz and Pargament35found spiritual meditation was related to greater decreases in both migraine headache frequency andseverity compared to secular meditation. Coleman and col-leagues 13,36found that prayer was used as a self-care strat- egy for managing HIV-related symptoms, including depression, fatigue, and nausea. Wolf and Abell37found that repetition of the mantra compared to a placebo mantra or no- treatment control resulted in decreased depression and anxiety in adults. Conclusions Study ndings support the integration of qualitative methods within a RCT to expand quantitative outcome re- sults, and also to gain a broader understanding of how an intervention plays out in the real life of the study partici-pants. In this study, mantram repetition was identied as a coping strategy for managing stressors associated with HIV disease. Participants applied mantram repetition to theirlives, targeting areas of most bothersome distress. Study ndings also contribute to a further renement of the spiri- tually based intervention with veterans, and lay a foundationfor use with broader populations.

We assessed quality using (1) a visit frequency based measure and (2) a self-reported assessment measuring alignment with the chronic care model. The visit frequency based measure had no signi cant association with addiction outcomes. The self-reported measure of care \u2014when care was at a CDM clinic \u2014was associated with lower drug addiction severity. The self- reported assessment of care from any healthcare source (CDM clinic or elsewhere) was associated with lower alcohol addiction severity and abstinence. These ndings suggest that high quality CDM for AOD dependence may improve addiction outcomes. Quality measures based upon alignment with the chronic care model may better capture features of effective CDM care than a visit frequency measure. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Although alcohol and other drug (AOD) dependence is character- ized as a chronic disease ( McLellan, Lewis, & O'Brien, 2000 ), its treatment in the United States is too often episodic, poorly coordinated, and dif cult to access ( Friedmann, Lemon, Stein, & D'Aunno, 2003; Institute of Medicine, 2006 ). Access issues are due to several reasons including lack of insurance, inadequate supply of available treatments in close proximity, and confusing or strict program entry requirements ( Cohen, Feinn, Arias, & Kranzler, 2007; Institute of Medicine, 2006 ). In addition, most patients with addictions have medical and/or psychiatric comorbidity ( de Alba, Samet, & Saitz, 2004; Mertens, Lu, Parthasarathy, Moore, & Weisner, 2003 ). Care for conditions in these three spheres often occurs in separate locations and systems, a fact likely responsible in part for poor quality care ( Samet, Friedmann, & Saitz, 2001 ). There is growing interest in shifting addiction treatment from an \"acute care framework \"to one that is more suitable for patients with chronic disease ( Institute of Medicine, 2006; McKay, 2009 ). Chronic disease management (CDM) models based on the principles of the chronic care model ( Wagner, Austin, & Von Korff, 1996 ) may improve the quality of addiction care ( Institute of Medicine, 2006; Saitz,Larson, LaBelle, Richardson, & Samet, 2008; Watkins, Pincus, Tanie- lian, & Klein, 2003 ). As with other chronic diseases such as depression, diabetes, and congestive heart failure ( Blonde, 2000; Gilbody, Bower, Fletcher, Richards, & 2001; Kallischnigg, 2004 ), CDM for AOD dependence has the potential to improve addiction outcomes by providing patient-centered, longitudinal care to increase the receipt of effective treatments and provide self- management support ( Wagner et al., 2001 ). Care may be delivered in aflexible manner with treatment intensity and modality responsive to fluctuations in disease severity and other patient needs. A multi- disciplinary team can track and coordinate care with the goals of addressing a comprehensive set of needs (addiction, medical, psychiatric, and social) and re-engaging patients who drop out of care. However, despite the potential bene ts of CDM for AOD dependence, few data are available about its effectiveness for people with AOD. Interest in CDM for AOD dependence parallels a realignment of primary care settings to deliver longitudinal, coordinated care for a comprehensive set of health needs, known as the patient centered medical home (PCMH) ( American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians, American Osteopathic Association, 2011 ). Increasingly, policy makers and others are recognizing the importance of addressing AOD dependence in primary care to potentially realize the bene ts of the PCMH ( Croghn & Brown, 2010 ).

Although there is growing support to integrate care for AOD dependence in primary care (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2012 ), it is not clear how AOD dependence care should be organized and delivered in the PCMH ( Croghn & Brown, 2010 ). CDM for AOD shares many of the core tenets of the PCMH and may be an effective strategy for addressing AOD dependence. Although there is evidence suggesting the ef cacy of CDM for AOD dependence, little is known about whether the quality of CDM care should be considered, and if so, how it should be measured. The quality of addiction care has been measured by visit frequency and timing-based measures. The quality of CDM has been measured by self-reported validated scales. How the quality of CDM relates to addiction outcomes is unknown; however, we do know that when offered, most patients with AOD dependence are willing to engage with CDM care ( Kim et al., 2011 ). Therefore, the objective of the current study is to examine if higher quality CDM for AOD dependence is associated with better addiction outcomes (abstinence, addiction severity). We hypothesized that receipt of quality CDM care for AOD dependence is associated with abstinence and lower addiction severity which is the primary aim of this analysis. Because CDM care is structured to increase the receipt of effective treatments, the secondary objectives are to examine whether quality CDM care is associated with higher odds of specialty addiction treatment utilization, addiction pharmacotherapy, and mutual help group attendance. The rationale for examining the latter is that mutual help group attendance is consistent with two chronic care model principles, namely the importance of helping patients develop skills and con dence to manage their addiction (i.e., a self- management plan) and of promoting involvement with communitysupport. Mutual help groups are also often thought to be important components of addiction treatment plans in the United States. 2. Methods 2.1. Study design This is a secondary data analysis of data collected during the Addiction Health Evaluation and Disease management (AHEAD) study, a randomized clinical trial of access to a primary care-based CDM clinic for AOD dependence. Details of the study have been published ( Kim et al., 2011 ). Brie fly, eligible participants were adults with AOD dependence (Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form; Kessler, Andrews, Mroczek, Ustun, & Wittchen, 1998 ) and any recent (past 30-days) opioid, stimulant, or heavy alcohol use (i.e., N21 drinks in a week or at least 2days of 5 drinks in a day for men; N14 drinks per week or at least 2days of drinking 4 for drinks in a day for women) who were willing to establish or continue primary care at Boston Medical Center. Interest in addiction treatment and readiness to change were not required for study enrollment. Recruitment occurred in several ways: screening in an inpatient detoxi cation unit, referrals from Boston Medical Center mostly from primary care clinics and the emergency department, and advertising to the general public in medical center public areas, in newspapers and on buses. After completion of the baseline research interview, subjects were randomized to either have access to the AHEAD study the CDM clinic established for that purpose or usual care. All subjects, both intervention and controls, were referred to primary care at Boston Medical Center and were given access to short-term motivational enhancement therapy (MET). All subjects could choose to access medical, psychiatric, and addiction treatment services provided by thehospital or in the community.For subjects randomized to attend the CDM clinic, research associates accompanied them to their rst visit. Subjects were compensated for study procedures completed at study entry, which included the rst visit to the CDM clinic for subjects randomized to it. Beyond the initial CDM clinic visit, subjects were neither required to attend nor compensated for additional CDM clinic visits though that clinic remained available to them. In-person research interviews weredone at 3, 6, and 12months after study enrollment. Research associates neither encouraged nor discouraged CDM clinic use. 2.2. Description of the AHEAD study CDM clinic The AHEAD study CDM clinic was located in the primary care clinic at an urban hospital. Treatment goals were to engage patients in longitudinal addiction care, to facilitate access to community re- sources including specialty addiction care, to communicate withcaregivers including primary care providers and to re-engage patients with care after relapse or loss to clinical follow-up ( Saitz et al., 2008 ). The CDM system components in the clinic included: (1) multi- disciplinary team composed of a nurse care manager, social worker, internist with addiction speci c skills, and psychiatrist; (2) informal linkages to community addiction treatment; (3) a shared electronic medical record with primary care and other medical clinicians; (4) appointment reminders and proactive callbacks; and (5) availability for drop-in care. The CDM clinic provided some services on-site and facilitated access to needed services provided elsewhere. Addiction speci c components of care available in the CDM clinic included negotiation of treatment plans, MET, a primary care adaptation of relapse prevention counseling ( Friedmann, and/or acamprosate), and referral to methadone maintenance treatment, specialty addiction treatment, and mutual help groups. Psychiatric assessment and treatment as well as case management for concrete needs such as food, transportation, and housing were also available. Although the CDM clinic was co-located with a primary care practice, it provided short-term medical care but not primary care. Instead the nurse care manager facilitated access to primary care, reminded patients to attend or complete evaluations for medical problems with the primary care physician, and coordinated medical and addiction treatment. Although the CDM clinic provided a somewhat diverse set of services, all were focused on improving addictions. All of these services have been conceptualized as such ( Saitz et al., 2008 ). The initial addiction, medical, and psychosocial clinical assessment in the CDM clinic included feedback, preventive services, initiation of addiction, short-term mental health and medical care, and additional referrals as needed. While there were overall guidelines for care, treatment was individualized based upon a patient's needs, resources (e.g., insurance), and preferences. After the care plan was in place, the nurse care manager kept in contact with the patient to assess needs and help with relapse prevention, facilitate referrals and appoint-ments, and encourage use of CDM services. 2.3. Measures2.3.1. CDM quality measures Our analytic models assessed the relationship between CDM quality and addiction outcomes. Three measures of CDM quality were used \u2014a summary of each measure is presented in Table 1 . The rst quality measure, engagement with CDM clinic care, was based on the Washington Circle (WC) quality measure for outpatient addiction treatment engagement ( Garnick et al., 2002 ). Because we were interested in evaluating care speci cally from the CDM clinic, the WC engagement measure was adapted to only include CDM clinic visits rather than outpatient addiction treatment visits. Engagement with the CDM clinic care was de ned as two or more visits to the CDM390 T.W. Kim et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 43 (2012) 389 -396clinic within 30days of \"initiation \"of care [initiation was at least one visit within 14days of the rst (\"index \") CDM clinic visit] ( Kim et al, 2011 ). This visit frequency-based utilization measure was determined prospectively using electronic medical records adapted for the clinic. Three exposure groups for the engagement analyses were developed: (1) subjects assigned (randomly to) access to the CDM clinic who engaged, (2) those assigned access to the CDM clinic who did not engage, and (3) those (randomly) assigned to not have access to the CDM clinic. The rationale for including this third group for comparison is that the speci cations of the WC measure of engagement do not include any mention of access to services; patients who receive speci ed services qualify as having engaged, and those who do not (regardless of the reason) are categorized as not having engaged. Consistent with that approach we did not restrict analyses to those with access to the CDM clinic. Both the second and third measures of CDM quality were assessed using the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC), a widely used 20-item patient-completed survey that measures the extent to which care is aligned with core features of the chronic care model ( Table 2 )(Glasgow et al., 2005 ). Higher scores indicate care with more core features of the chronic care model. Speci cally, the second quality measure was an assessment of the extent to which care received from the CDM clinic contained core components of the chronic care model. This measure (PACIC-CDM clinic) was assessed with a subset of questions from the PACIC survey (to minimize repetitiveness and subject burden during the interview and to focus on concepts most relevant to the services provided by the CDM clinic while ensuring that at least one question was asked about each core component of the chronic care model (patient activation, delivery system design/decision support, goalsetting/tailoring items, problem-solving/contextual issues, and pro-active follow-up/coordination of care). Because the questionnaire asks speci cally about care provided by the CDM clinic, it was only administered to subjects assigned to have access to the CDM clinic and recalled attending it. The third quality measure was an assessment of the extent to which care from any healthcare source was aligned with the chronic care model using the PACIC questionnaire (the complete instrument). This quality measure (PACIC-any), unlike the PACIC-CDM clinic measure, was assessed for all subjects who received any care related to AOD dependence since study enrollment. Any care included \"talking or counseling, medication, groups or other treatments \" provided in any healthcare setting, such as \"detox, hospital, emergency room, or of ce\"by any \"healthcare provider, including doctors, nurses, social workers, counselors or others. \" Both PACIC measures were determined at a 12-month interview after study entry. Given the absence of well-established PACIC score cut-offs and to avoid an assumption of linearity, both PACIC-CDM clinic and PACIC-any scores were categorized based on tertiles of the distributions. Although the PACIC was developed to assess the CDM of medical conditions, questions in the PACIC ask about highly valued components of addiction care, such as shared decision making ( Institute of Medicine, 2006 ), proactive follow-up ( McKay, 2009 ), \"encouragement to go to a speci c group \"(e.g., 12-step), and help with planning \"to take care of my illness even in hard times \"(e.g., relapse prevention counseling). In sum, the rst two quality measures, engagement with the CDM clinic and PACIC-CDM clinic, were an assessment of care provided by the CDM clinic, whereas the third quality measure, PACIC-any, reflected care provided by any healthcare provider, AHEAD study- related or otherwise. 2.3.2. Outcome measures Outcomes were assessed during interviews at 3, 6 and 12months. Abstinence, the primary outcome, was de ned as no opioid or stimulant use, or heavy drinking ( ve drinks or more per day for men; four or more for drinks per day for women) in the past 30days. Opioid and stimulant use were assessed by the substance use questions of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) ( McLellan et al., 1992 ) and heavy drinking by the 30-day timeline follow back ( Sobell & Sobell, 1995 ) calendar method. Secondary outcomes included alcohol and drug addiction severity, assessed by the alcohol and drug composite scores of the ASI. Three past 3-month addiction treatment variables (dichotomous) were examined as potential intermediate outcomes of the receipt of quality CDM: (1) specialty addiction treatment de ned as outpatient or inpatient addiction treatment excluding detoxi cation; (2) addiction pharmacotherapy de ned as medication to prevent drinking or drug use, help cut-down, or quit, excluding medication for detoxi cation; and (3) any mutual help group attendance. 2.4. Analytic strategy Descriptive statistics were used to portray the study sample at baseline. We examine the relationship between measures of CDM quality and each outcome of interest by tting separate multivariable longitudinal regression models. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression models were used to model binary outcomes (i.e., abstinence, utilization of any specialty addiction treatment, any addiction pharmacotherapy, and any mutual help group attendance). Because the distributions of alcohol and drug ASI scores were non- normal and a suitable transformation was not identi ed, each variable was categorized into multiple ordered categories. The alcohol ASI composite score cutpoints were: and N0.3). The ordered categorical data were then analyzed using GEE proportional odds models.

Kim et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 43 (2012) 389 -396odds of lower scores (i.e., better outcomes), were modeled for both cases. The GEE approach was used to account for the correlation from using repeated observations from the same subject over time. An independence working correlation was used and empirical standard errors from the GEE approach are reported for all analyses. Different analytic samples were used based on the independent variables and outcomes analyzed. A summary of the criteria used to comprise the analytic samples is presented in Table 1 . Subjects with at least one follow-up interview were eligible for all analyses. Analyses of alcohol and drug severity included only subjects with any alcohol dependence ( n=409) and any drug dependence ( n=458), respec- tively at study entry. There were additional criteria for the PACIC-CDM clinic and PACIC-any analyses. Both analyses included subjects who completed those interviews (done at 12-months). The PACIC-CDM clinic analyses, however, only included those who had been randomly assigned to have access to the CDM clinic and recalled attending it. Those without access to the CDM clinic were not included. Analyses of care provided by any health care source (PACIC-any) measure consisted of those who reported receipt of any care for AOD dependence since study enrollment with no distinction made to indicate whether subjects were in the intervention or control arms of the randomized study. All regression models were t with a single main independent variable of interest and the following covariates: age, sex, race/ ethnicity, an indicator variable for time since enrollment (3, 6, or 12months), homelessness (any night on the street or in a shelter, past 3months), and moderate to severe depression [Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score 10;Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001 ]\u2014the latter two were modeled as time-dependent variables. Alcohol and drug severity analyses also included baseline alcohol anddrug severity, respectively. Prior to regression modeling, potential collinearity among covariates was assessed by calculating the correlation between all independent variables and covariates, and no pair of variables had a Spearman correlation N0.40. Due to the exploratory nature of the analyses, no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. However, pair-wise comparisons were not made unless the global p-value for the CDM measure was statisticallysignicant ( pb.05). All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., NC, USA). 3. Results 3.1. Sample characteristics This study's analytic samples were derived from the AHEAD study randomized trial. Among the 655 eligible adults, 563 (87%) were randomized in the AHEAD intervention trial. Ninety-eight percent of those randomized completed at least one follow-up interview (89%, 87%, and 95% at 3, 6, and 12-month interviews, respectively). There was no signi cant difference between the proportion of the intervention and control groups interviewed at each follow-up. Among the 563 subjects enrolled in the AHEAD intervention trial, 553 (98%) had at least one follow-up interview (analytic sample for the CDM clinic engagement analyses). Among the 270 subjects assigned access to the CDM clinic, 249 (92%) completed a 12-month follow-up interview, attended the clinic and recalled doing so comprising the analytic sample for PACIC-CDM clinic analyses. The analytic sample for the \"any care \"(PACIC-any) analyses was 451 (those who completed the 12-month interview [532] and reported receipt of care for AOD dependence from any healthcare source since study enrollment). The analytic sample for the engagement analyses ( Table 3 ) had the following characteristics: men (73%); non-white (53%); homeless (59%); had both alcohol and drug dependence (66%); a comorbid substance abuse-related medical condition (65%); and moderate tosevere depression (84%). At baseline, a low percentage had past 3- month utilization of specialty treatment (34%) or addiction pharma- cotherapy (6%), yet nearly half had mutual help group attendance. Approximately a quarter of the subjects with access to the CDM clinic met criteria for engagement (23%). Approximately a third of the sample was abstinent at follow-up (35%, 34%, and 43% at 3, 6, and 12- month interviews, respectively) ( Table 4 ).Table 2 Summary of item content for Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC).a Chronic care model corecomponentDescription PACIC survey question Patient activation Actions that solicit patient input and involvement in decision-making1) Asked for my ideas when my healthcare provider made a treatment plan b 2) Given choices about treatment to think aboutb 3) Asked about problems with medications Delivery system design, decision supportActions that organize care and provide information for patients to enhance their understanding of care4) Given written list of things to do to improve my healthb 5) Satis ed that care was well-organizedb 6) Shown how what I did to take care of my illness in fluenced my condition Goal setting, tailoring items Acquiring information for and setting of speci c collaborative goals7) Asked to talk about my goals in caring for my illnessb 8) Helped to set speci c goals to improve my eating or exercise 9) Given a copy of my treatment plan10) Encouraged to go to a speci c group or class to help you cope with your addiction 11) Asked questions, either directly or on a survey, about your health habits Problem-solving, contextual issuesConsidering potential barriers and the patient's social and cultural environment in making treatment plans12) Sure that my doctor/nurse caring for my addiction thought about my values and my traditions when they recommended treatment b 13) Helped to make treatment plan that I could do in my daily lifeb 14) Helped to plan ahead so I could take care of my illness even in hard times15) Asked how addiction affects my life.

Kim et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 43 (2012) 389 -3963.2. Multivariable regression results No signi cant group differences were detected for the effect of engagement in CDM on abstinence or drug and alcohol addiction severity ( Table 4 ). Receipt of higher quality CDM from the clinic as re flected by higher PACIC-CDM scores was signi cantly associated with lower drug addiction severity (global p-value=.03) [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.71; 95% con dence interval (CI) 1.13, 2.59, highest vs. middle tertile]. No signi cant associations were detected between PACIC- CDM clinic scores and abstinence or alcohol addiction severity. Higher PACIC-any scores, re flecting the quality of care received anywhere, were associated with higher odds of abstinence (global p- value b.001) (AOR 1.99; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.48, highest severity (global p-value=.02) (AOR 1.68; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.45, highest vs. middle tertile). Higher PACIC-any scores appeared to be associated with lower drug addiction severity but the global association was not statistically signi cant ( p=.09). Upon examination of secondary outcomes, all measures of quality CDM care ( Table 1 ) were signi cantly associated with specialty addiction treatment utilization ( Table 5 ). Engagement was also associated with higher odds of addiction pharmacother- apy (AOR 3.55; 95% CI: 2.02, 6.25) but not with mutual help groupattendance. Each PACIC measure, re flecting care from the CDM clinic (PACIC-CDM clinic) or any healthcare source (PACIC-any) was associated with higher odds of mutual help group attendance, but neither was signi cantly associated with utilization of addiction pharmacotherapy. 4. Discussion To date, the most widely accepted measures of the quality of addiction care are based on visit frequency. In this sample of adults with AOD dependence, a measure of CDM care quality based on visit frequency \u2014engagement \u2014was not associated with abstinence or addiction severity despite being associated with receipt of speci c addiction treatments (e.g., pharmacotherapies). However, a self- reported quality measure assessing alignment with the chronic care model was associated with several addiction outcomes. Speci cally, those who received care from any healthcare source with core features of the chronic care model were more likely to be abstinent from heroin, cocaine, and heavy drinking and among those with alcohol dependence to have lower alcohol addiction severity. Those who received higher quality care speci cally from the CDM clinic were more likely to have lower drug addiction severity ( Table 6 ). The lack of signi cant associations between CDM engagement and abstinence or addiction severity is notable. Engagement with CDM care as measured by visit frequency is likely a necessary minimum rst step that can lead to receipt of known ef cacious treatments; however in this cohort, adults with comorbidity and social ills (e.g., homelessness), it was not suf cient for improving addiction outcomes. Findings were clearer and more consistent when the predictor of interest was the self-report quality measure of alignment with the chronic care model regardless of the source of care. Analyses examining care quality from any health care source are informative because individuals with AOD dependence often receive episodic acute care services (e.g., in detoxi cation units or emergency departments) rather than longitudinal comprehensive chronic care. Among patients with chronic medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, asthma, coronary artery disease, and chronic pain, higher PACIC scoresTable 3 Characteristics of subjects with AOD dependence enrolled in a trial of access to primarycare based CDM care with follow-up data ( N=553).

Our results suggest that receipt of care for AOD dependence that includes components of the chronic care model is also important for addiction treatment effectiveness. Although the quality of CDM care from any health care source was signicantly associated with abstinence and alcohol addiction severity, analyses of drug addiction severity did not quite achieve statistical signi cance. We did nd, however, that drug addiction severity was signi cantly associated with the quality of care from the CDM clinic. It is possible that this nding was related to the way that services were organized in the CDM clinic. For example, the clinic provided some psychiatric services on-site and facilitated linkage to other psychiatric services. This may have been particularly helpful forthose with drug dependence because of the higher mental health comorbidity rate for patients with drug dependence ( Grant et al., 2004 ). In addition, since drug dependence is more dif cult to treat without addiction pharmacotherapy, we postulated that greater access to addiction pharmacotherapy in the CDM clinic may have contributed to these ndings. However, we did not nd that the quality of care from the CDM clinic or from any source of addiction treatment was associated with higher odds of addiction pharmaco- therapy receipt. These differences should not be overstated and are only hypoth- esis-generating. Although there were differences in these analyses, overall, our main ndings are that regardless of the source of care, the quality of CDM care matters and that a quality assessment based upon the content of care appears to have predictive validity but a visit- based, frequency measure does not.

Kim et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 43 (2012) 389 -396utilization analyses were the same for each PACIC measure, (i.e., signicant associations for specialty addiction treatment and mutual help group attendance but not addiction pharmacotherapy) supports thending that both PACIC measures assessed similar constructs regardless of the source of care. Both PACIC measures seem to be assessing something different than the engagement measure as indicated by the engagement association with addiction pharmaco- therapy but not mutual help group attendance. All quality measures were a ssociated with higher odds of utilization of specialty addiction treatment. This is not insigni cant because successful referrals to \"off-site \"addiction treatment pro- viders with whom the CDM clinic did not have formal referral relationships can be particularly challenging ( Gurewich, Sirkin, & Shepard, 2012 ) and linkage to outside resources is an important component of chronic care models ( Wagner et al., 1996 ). This study adds to the literature supporting the bene ts of longitudinal, integrated care for patients with AOD dependence by showing that the quality of CDM can contribute to improved outcomes. ( O'Toole et al. 2011 ) found that primary care with elements of the chronic care model customized for homeless patients, of whom 70% had alcohol abuse, was associated with better medical outcomes (blood pressure, glycemic control, and lipid levels). Alcohol use outcomes were not reported. Among patients in addiction treatment, (Chi, Parthasarathy, Mertens, & Weisneret 2011 ) found that continu- ing care, de ned as having yearly primary care and specialty addiction and psychiatric care when needed, was associated with abstinence over a 9-year follow-up period. The current study contributes to this literature by examining addiction outcomes from a type of care that may facilitate receipt of primary, psychiatric, and specialty care that was also structured to provide self-management support and other elements of the chronic care model. This study has several limitations. Due to the study's observational design, it is possible that patients who were abstinent (or had lower addiction severity) tended to rate treatment more favorably. However, we used prospectively collected data to assess addiction outcomes over a 12-month study follow up period adjusted for potential determinants of care (i.e., gender, race/ethnicity, homeless- ness, and depression). In addition, the PACIC is an instrument that assesses implementation of the chronic care model rather than simply patient satisfaction. Nonetheless we cannot exclude the possibility that unmeasured factors in fluenced which participants rated treat- ment with high PACIC scores and also in fluenced addiction outcomes. We did not have information about the type of addiction treatment participants were rating. However, the question of interest was not the speci c treatment modality but rather receipt of care with core features of the chronic care model. Given that there are few data about CDM for AOD dependence, these ndings serve as a \"proof of concept \" study. Future study should examine types of care that deliver high quality CDM. Another limitation of this study is the method used to model exposure and outcome. Assessment of CDM quality was done at the 12-month study interview and addiction outcomes were measured prospectively at 3, 6, and 12-month interviews. Subjects may have rated care that was received after the addiction outcome was measured. Studies are needed to prospectively examine the receipt of care delivered before the assessment of addiction outcomes. Finally, generalizability is another consideration. The majority of participants were recruited from a detoxi cation unit and most participants had social and psychiatric co-morbidities such as homelessness and depression. This study's ndings may not generalize to primary care patients seeking addiction treatment or individuals with less social and psychiatric comorbidity. On the other hand, it is precisely these sorts of populations who need and could potentially bene t from high quality integrated and coordinated care. This study's strengths include prospective data collection and a high proportion assessed at follow-up. In addition to processmeasures of care such as receipt of addiction treatment and addiction pharmacotherapy, we examined outcomes with clear clinical signif- icance (i.e., abstinence and severity). In addition, we used a measure based on the NCQA/HEDIS quality performance measure for addiction treatment engagement to de ne engagement with the particular treatment of interest in this study, CDM. In addition, this was an innovative analysis using a tool (PACIC) not often applied to addictions care that may be increasingly used to evaluate the quality of care consistent with CDM in the patient-centered medical home. Given the need for improvement of the quality of care for patients with addictions, CDM shows some promise for improving patient receipt of effective treatments, thereby improving outcomes. These data support efforts to improve care for patients with addictions that integrate medical, mental health and addiction services, provide longitudinal coordinated care and care that pro-actively follows patients. These data also suggest that as such efforts become more common, attention will need to be paid to the quality of care \u2014how it reflects key features of the chronic care model \u2014to assure the effectiveness of primary care based CDM for AOD dependence. In conclusion, this study provides empirical data that suggest that receipt of quality CDM for AOD dependence is associated with improved processes of care and better outcomes. Furthermore, our results suggest that widely used visit-based frequency measures may be inadequate for capturing characteristics of CDM that are associated with better outcomes, characteristics better captured by self-report measures of exposure to elements of chronic care management.

Kim et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 43 (2012) 389 -396364PRIMARY CARE RESPIRATORY JOURNAL www.thepcrj.orgEditorials Individuals with chronic drug use disorders frequently have medical co-morbidities.1,2 Mertens et al. documented the high prevalence of chronic medical conditions and its associatedsignificant morbidity among insured patients in a specialtyalcohol and drug treatment clinic. 3Among alcohol or drug dependent patients on the opposite end of the socioeconomicspectrum in the USA - those without primary care who wereentering residential detoxification - 45% reported having achronic medical illness. 1One third of a comparable group reported being in fair or poor health.4Thus, it is fair to say that co-morbidity, among the socioeconomic spectrum of chronicdrug users in care, is the norm, not the exception. Despite an expanding literature on medical co-morbidities among drug using populations, respiratory diseases have not been well-studied. The bulk of the literature on drug users and respiratorydisease has focused on infectious complications of drug use, includingbacterial pneumonia, septic pulmonary embolism, and tuberculosis(TB). 5,6These medical conditions are acute or sub-acute (e.g. TB) episodic illnesses. Chronic, non-infectious respiratory diseases such asasthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) amongdrug users have not been well-characterised. Studies demonstratingthe effectiveness of disease management programmes for chronicmedical conditions such as asthma typically exclude individuals withdrug use. 7However, a better understanding of the risks of chronic respiratory diseases would inform efforts to improve the medicalassessment and treatment - both therapeutic and preventive - ofpatients who are also drug users. Such work would address atreatment gap for a population less likely to receive quality asthmacare 7and flu vaccination.8 In this issue of the PCRJ, Palmer et al. report on respiratory diseases in drug users.9Specifically, they performed a cross-sectional analysis of the association of chronic respiratory diseases and \"drug misuse\"using administrative data collected from general practices in Scotland.The authors found that drug users were more likely to have adiagnosis of chronic respiratory diseases (i.e. asthma, COPD, and\"respiratory system disease\") than a control group matched for age,gender, and economic status. Drug users were also more likely to beprescribed respiratory medications, primarily bronchodilators andinhaled corticosteroids. These associations did not appear to be fullyattributable to the high prevalence of tobacco use, since thesedifferences persisted with adjustment for tobacco use. This study'sresults are consistent with others in the literature, 1-4and Palmer et al. substantively contribute to this literature by performing their analysison a national database. 9Additionally, the use of a control group matched on key socio-demographic variables strengthens the researchdesign. Nonetheless, interpretation of study findings requires consideration of study limitations. First, substance type was unknownin nearly three-quarters of cases (72%), making it difficult to assesswhat accounts for the relationship between drug use and respiratorydisease. Second, chronic respiratory disease was defined as everhaving a diagnosis of asthma, COPD, or \"respiratory system disease\"since birth; therefore it is unknown whether the respiratory diseasepredated the onset of drug use. Third, although the exact number ofopioid users in the study is unknown, some portion of the drug\"misuser\" sample consisted of patients prescribed methadone foropioid dependence from general practices, which may have requiredfrequent office visits; therefore, respiratory diseases may have beenmore likely to be detected given the increased surveillance amongthese patients. Despite these caveats, the study raises useful questions and suggests pragmatic implications. As noted among other studies ofdrug users, tobacco use in this study's sample 9was almost universal (90%). Although the findings may not have been fully attributable totobacco use, tobacco is still the major driver responsible for respiratorydisease in this population. From a clinical perspective, given that COPDis typically under-diagnosed and under-treated in primary care, 10these findings, although not definitive, should raise awareness thatindividuals with drug addiction are at high risk of chronic respiratorydiseases. From a research perspective, determining whether or notcontributors other than tobacco exist would be of value, as it mightenable medical teams pro-actively to direct attention to other usefulevaluation and treatment. Evidence of an increased risk of chronic respiratory diseases among drug users also enhances the case for the coordination of carebetween addiction treatment providers and those addressing thesepatients' chronic medical conditions. 11Drug treatment is an opportunity for the patient not only to address drug use but also toconsider the wider health consequences of drug use includingrespiratory illness and linking patients to medical care. 12,13Raising the issue with the patient and making a plan to address this commondiagnosis might serve not only to improve their health and quality oflife but could build the rationale for the patient to make recovery apriority.

In this controversialmovie of the time, Jim Stark (played by James Dean) is a rebellious17-year-old teenager caught up in family discord who disobeys hisparents, defies the local schoolboys, and confronts the differencesand conflicts between generations. 3One would think that teenagers susceptible to anaphylaxis would possess the JamesDean-like rebellious personality, thereby accounting for the factthat adolescents with this disease are at increased risk of fataloutcomes. However, just the opposite was found in this study.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if depression and anxiety are associated with delays in resolution after abnormalmammograms and Pap tests in a vulnerable population of urban women. DESIGN: We conducted retrospective chart reviews of electronic medical records to identify women who had a diagnosis of depression or anxiety in the year prior to the abnormal mammogram or Pap test. We used time-to-event analysis to analyze the outcome of time to resolution after abnormal cancer screening, and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling to control forconfounding.PARTICIPANTS: Women receiving care in six Boston- area community health centers 2004 -2005: 523 with abnormal mammograms, 474 with abnormal Paptests. RESULTS: Of the women with abnormal mammogram and pap tests, 19% and 16%, respectively, had co-morbid depression. There was no difference in time to diagnostic resolution between depressed and not-de- pressed women for those with abnormal mammograms(aHR=0.9, 95 CI 0.7,1.1) or Pap tests (aHR=0.9, 95 CI 0.7,1.3). CONCLUSIONS: An active diagnosis of depression and/ or anxiety in the year prior to an abnormal mammo-gram or Pap test was not associated with a prolonged time to diagnostic resolution. Our findings imply that documented mood disorders do not identify an addi-tional barrier to resoluti on after abnormal cancer screening in a vulnerable population of women.KEY WORDS: depression; cancer screening; women 's health; Gen Intern Med 27(4):452 -7 DOI: 10.1007/s11606-011-1920-5\u00a9 Society of General Internal Medicine 2011 BACKGROUND Depression is associated with high overall mortality,1includ- ing increased breast cancer mortality2.T h eu n d e r l y i n g mechanism explaining the relationship between depression and increased breast cancer mortality is unknown. A possibleexplanation is underuse of screening mammography, giventhat screening mammography reduces mortality, 3,4and women with psychiatric disorders are less likely to receive standard preventive care,5,6including screening mammogra- phy.7Another possible explanation is delayed follow-up after an abnormality is detected on a screening test, since delayed diagnosis can reduce survival if cancer is diagnosed at a laterstage. Vulnerable populations of women, as defined by low income or with racial/ethnic minority status, are less likely to receive standard preventive healthcare and therefore experienceworse breast and cervical cancer outcomes. Previous studiesshowed less than 25% of these vulnerable women received adequate follow-up care after an abnormal cancer screening test. 8,9In addition, the prevalence of depression is higher in vulnerable populations,10-16and twofold higher in women than men. National annual prevalence estimates for women range between 4 -14%.17,18 Our previous work examined factors associated with delays in cancer care among a diverse population of women who received screening at urban community health centers(CHC). 19,20We found the individual CHC site was a stronger predictor of timely resolution than race, ethnic group, lan- guage, insurance status, or age.19,20We then sought to examine additional patient characteristics that may identify agroup of women who are particularly vulnerable to delayed resolution of abnormal cancer screening tests and might benefit from tailored interventions such as patient navigation.We hypothesized that depression would contribute to delays inReceived December 2, 2010 Revised July 5, 2011Accepted October 10, 2011 Published online November 15, 2011 452diagnostic resolution. In addition, since previous studies demonstrated that anxiety may result in more timely care,21,22 we hypothesized that anxiety may decrease time to resolution, and modify an association between depression and time to diagnostic resolution. Thus, our objective is to determine if depression and anxiety are independent predictors of delays incare after abnormal mammograms and Pap tests in a vulner- able population of urban women. METHODS Study Design This is a secondary analysis of data collected at baseline of the Boston Patient Navigation Research Program (PNRP), before apatient navigation intervention was implemented. 19Boston PNRP partnered with six CHCs to collect retrospective medical record data for women who had abnormal mammograms or Paptests. For this study, data were collected via chart review for psychiatric diagnoses, symptoms, and treatment for the 1-year period preceding the date of the abnormal cancer screening test. Study Population Eligible subjects in the baseline PNRP included adult womenwith an abnormal screening Pap test or mammogram performed between January 1, 2004 and December 30, 2005 at the 6 CHCs. 19Eligible mammograms included Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) scores indicating need for follow-up (BIRADS 0, 3, 4, and 5). Eligible Pap tests included cellular abnormalities indicating need for follow-up: atypicalsquamous cells of undetermined 4, 5; HGSIL), and a random of low- grade abnormalities (BIRADS 0, 3; ASCUS/HPV+; LGSIL) to obtain approximately 100 women per site. At sites with fewerthan 100 eligible cases, all eligible subjects were included. In order to prevent clustering of cases by CHC, a representative sample of equivalent numbers were selected from each center. Data Sources We previously described the details of how the data wereretrieved from the EMR and registration databases of the six CHCs. 19Socio-demographic and eligibility criteria were re- trieved automatically, while clinical outcomes and psychiatricdiagnosis and treatment data were abstracted manually bytrained research staff. Independent Variables of Interest We categorized a subject as actively \"depressed \"if either of the following criteria was documented in the EMR during the12 months preceding the abnormal test: 1) a new diagnosis ofdepression [ICD-9 diagnoses 311.x, 309.28, 309.0-309.1, 300.4] entered into the active problem list 1, or 2) depression diagnosis documented in the free-text \"Assessment/Plan\"section of office notes. By categorizing depression in this way, we ensured that depression was an active problem in the year prior to the abnormal cancer screening test. In order to furthervalidate our definition of depression diagnosis, we abstracted depressive symptom data (depressed mood, sleep disorders, anxious feelings, fatigue, impaired concentration, appetitechange, psychomotor change, social isolation, decreased in-terest, suicidality, hopelessness, other) from the EMR if documented as free-text in the \"History of Present Illness \"or \"Review Of Systems\" sections of provider notes, or listed in theProblem List during the specified time period. We categorized a subject as \"anxious \"if anxiety was documented either in the active problem list [ICD-9 diagnoses 300.0x, 300.2x] or in thefree-text sections of office notes during the specified time period. Covariate and Intervening Variables We obtained anti-depressant medication data from the medi- cation list in the EMR, and evidence that the patient receivedpsychotherapy through the following indicia: presence of anoffice note from a therapist or psychiatrist, mention of therapy in the free text Assessment/Plan section, or referral to behavioral health from the Orders section. We then categorizedsubjects into one of four mutually exclusive categories based on depression treatment: 1) anti-depressants only, 2) psycho- therapy only, 3) both anti-depressants and psychotherapy, or4) no treatment. Other psychiatric diagnoses were abstracted from the Problem Lists in the EMR, including bipolar, psycho- ses, and substance abuse. We collapsed the race/ethnicityEMR data into four mutually exclusive categories: White, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latina, or Asian/Other. Because the age distribution is very different for womenobtaining breast and cervical cancer screening (older womenin the breast cancer screening group), we categorized different age categories for the two screening populations and subdi- vided them into three age groups that had clinical significance.We categorized primary language as English, Spanish or other. We created the following three mutually exclusive categories from the primary and secondary insurance data in the EMR:no health insurance, publicly financed health insurance (Medicare and/or Medicaid), or private health insurance. Outcome Variables Our primary outcome of interest was time (number of days) from index screening abnormality to diagnostic resolution.Subjects were followed for a maximum of one year. We defined diagnostic resolution as either a definitive tissue diagnosis (biopsy with pathology report) or clinical evaluation (such ascolposcopy) indicating no further need for evaluation. Forsubjects with LGSIL pathology, we considered the initial colposcopy with biopsy to be definitive, although surveillance is recommended. Similarly, for subjects with a recommendedtwo-year surveillance for BIRADS three results, we considered diagnostic resolution as the next six-month mammogram, subtracting the six-month period for timely resolution in the453 Kronman et al.: Resolution of Abnormal Mammograms and Paps JGIManalysis23. Due to the long times to resolution and most of the cases resolving within 6 months, we censored this outcome at a maximum of 365 days. Data Analysis Women with abnormal mammograms were analyzed separate-ly from women with abnormal Pap tests, because of marked differences between the groups in age, racial/ethnic distribu- tion and characteristics of cancer screening test. Chi-squaretests were used to compare the characteristics of depressed and not-depressed women and to compare the prevalence of depression across demographic subgroups. Next, we examineddepressive symptom data in the depressed and not depressed groups to validate our definition of depression diagnosis. In the time-to-event analysis, we first compared time to resolutionwithin 365 days between depressed and not-depressed womenvia the log-rank test. We then used Cox-proportional hazards modeling to predict timely resolution incorporating all of the covariates, and an interaction term for anxiety and depression.In the final models, we included only those categorical variables with a significant univariate Cox model p-value (< 0.05), excluding the interaction term because it was not significant.In secondary analyses, we modeled separate effects for depressed women with and without treatment, because treatment for depression may modify the effect of depressiondiagnosis. To determine if depression was associated with outcome for any subgroups of our population, we stratified our analyses by insurance, age and race/ethnicity. Forwomen with abnormal Pap tests, the cumulative incidencecurves with and without depression cross at about 120 days; therefore we modeled separate effects of depression for resolution before and after 120 days, using time-dependentindicators for depression in the Cox model. Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.1. 24A two-sided p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant for reporting associations. RESULTS Among 997 women, 523 had abnormal mammograms and 474 had abnormal Pap tests. Overall, 17% had depression and 8.5% had anxiety. Of the women with abnormal mammogramand Pap tests, 19% and 16%, respectively, had co-morbid depression. As expected, women with abnormal mammograms were older (96%>40 years old) compared to the women withabnormal Pap tests (70% between ages 18 -30 years old). For both groups, depressed women were more likely to be on public insurance, and for women with abnormal mammo-grams, depressed women were less likely to be black. (Table 1) Depressed women in both study groups were more likely to have anxiety. Depressive symptoms were statistically significantly more common among women defined as depressed compared to those who were not. The most common documented symptoms in the depressed group in decreasing frequency were: de-pressed mood (57% for both women with abnormal mammo- grams and Pap tests), sleep problems (41% and 38%), anxious feelings (33% (21% and 14%), and changes in appetite (14% for either abnormal test). For depressed women with abnormal mammograms, 69% had some form of documented treatment(66% prescribed antidepressants), while 51% of depressed women with abnormal Pap tests had some treatment (45% prescribed antidepressants). The median time to resolution was 27 days for women with abnormal mammograms, and 85 days for women with abnor- mal Pap tests. Figure 1compares the time-to-diagnostic- resolution event analysis of women with and without depres-sion diagnosis. In both of these screening groups, we note delays in diagnostic resolution, with less than half receiving a definitive diagnosis within 30 days after abnormal mammo-grams, and within 90 days after abnormal Pap tests. There was no difference in time to diagnostic resolution between those with and without depression diagnosis either for women withabnormal mammograms (Fig. 1a,p=0.22 from the log-rank test) or for women with abnormal Pap tests (Fig. 1b,p=0.53). Tables 2a and b present the bivariate and multivariable findings from the Cox proportional hazard models predicting time to resolution for mammogram and Pap test abnormalities, respectively. In these analyses, a hazard ratio less than 1.0indicates longer time to diagnostic resolution. When examiningthe whole study population, neither depression diagnosis nor anxiety was significantly associated with delayed diagnostic resolution for women with abnormal mammograms or abnormalPap tests. Secondary analyses found no significant interaction between depression and anxiety for women with abnormal mammograms (p=0.64) or with abnormal Pap tests (p=0.16).The effects of depression remained non-significant when allow- ing for different effects in depressed women receiving treatment (aHR 0.8 (0.6, 1.1) for mammograms and aHR 1.0 (0.7, 1.4) forPap tests), or not receiving treatment (aHR 1.0 (0.7, 1.5) formammograms and aHR 0.8 (0.6 , 1.2) for Pap tests) for depression. Among women with abnormal Pap tests, there was no suggestion of a depression effect on time to resolution overthe first 120 days of follow-up (aHR 1.0 (0.7, 1.4)); however, there was a non-significant trend toward slower resolution for depressed women after 120 days (aHR 0.6 (0.3, 1.1), p=0.096).We performed additional secondary stratified analyses in order to examine associations within subgroups of patient socio- demographics. Separate analyses by insurance status showedno depression effect for those with public or private insurance, but demonstrated a trend of delayed diagnostic resolution for those with no insurance (HR=0.3 (0.1 , 1.0) p=0.06 formammograms and HR=0.5 (0.2 , 1.2) p=0.11 for Pap tests).There were no differences by race, ethnicity, or age. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the first examination of the relationshipbetween pre-existing depression with and without anxiety andtime to diagnostic resolution of abnormal mammograms and Paptests. In this vulnerable population seeking care at urban federally qualified community health centers, we found delays in diagnostic resolution after abnormal cancer screening. How-ever, those with a depression diagnosis did not have increased delays compared to not-depressed women. In addition, there was no significant interaction between anxiety and depression.454 Kronman et al.: Resolution of Abnormal Mammograms and Paps JGIMOur findings suggest that for women with the lengthiest delays in diagnostic resolution (> 120 days), depression maycontribute to diagnostic delays of abnormal Pap tests, but not abnormal mammograms. This may reflect differences in the populations themselves, as the populations are remarkablydifferent in age, or differences in the perceived implications of delayed diagnostic resolution. For example, a delay of several months for an abnormal mammogram may be clinically moresignificant than several months of delayed resolution for abnormal Pap tests. However, our results contrast from studies of cancer screening tests reporting depression beingassociated with less screening mammography, 2,25but not with fewer Pap tests. Prior research found conflicting effects between the relationship of cancer screening behavior and depression.This may be due to depression frequently being confounded with anxiety, and the potentia lf o ra n x i e t yh a v i n go p p o s i t e effects on health outcomes. For example, a meta-analysisfound that depressed patients were three times less likely to be adherent to treatment recom mendations for a variety of illnesses, including breast cancer, but anxiety had littleeffect 6. Patten and colleagues surveyed a large population, finding that a major depressive episode was not associated with receiving a screening mammogram in the subsequentyear; however, co-existing anxiety was not accounted for in that analysis.26Additional analytical complexities are intro- duced by differential reporting and documentation of depres- sive and anxious symptoms. Frequently, depression and anxiety symptoms are under-documented.27Even if symp- toms are documented, there remains an analytic challenge of determining if these symptoms reflect a stable psychological \"trait \"versus a temporary \"state, \"and determining which is more important in determining future health behavior and outcomes. This distinction is of particular importance when studying the outcomes of follow-up care after abnormalcancer screening, as in this study, for the negative psycho- logical states associated with receipt of an abnormal test could adversely affect the outcome of follow-up care. In addition to the analytical difficulties, the relationship of depression and cancer screening behavior could vary by populations of women. For example, in our study population of ethnically diverse, economically disadvantaged women,who already have other socioeconomic barriers to reaching timely resolution after abnormal cancer screening, 28,29our findings suggest that depression does not contribute todelays in diagnostic care, except perhaps for those who both are depressed and lack insurance. It is possible that depres- sion does delay diagnostic resolution in women not socio-Table 1.

Conversely, the women in our study were already engaged in the health care system, as having an abnormal cancer screening test was a mandatory inclusion criterion. If depression is a barrier to receivingscreening mammography and/or Pap tests in a sub-popula-tion of women, they would not have been included in our study. This study is limited by the relatively small sample size, limiting our power to detect statistical differences between the depressed and not-depressed groups. Using retrospective chart review to classify patients as depressed has the potentialfor misclassification bias in two ways, each biasing the results toward the null. First, it is possible that patients classified as \"not-depressed \"were truly depressed. In addition to known under-diagnosis of depression in primary care, 30which may be differential in vulnerable populations31and those without insurance,32there may be under-documentation of it as well, since primary care providers are frequently not reimbursed ifdepression is the primary ICD-9 diagnosis. The accuracy of using administrative data or the EMR to determine depression diagnosis ranges from 58 -83% depending on the contents of the EMR. 33,34However, our 12 month depression prevalence was slightly higher than that previously reported for depres- sion using survey tools, suggesting the possible extent towhich under-diagnosis and under-reporting of depression were limited in our study. 15,35,36Second, patients adequatelytreated for depression may be classified as \"depressed \"even though they are no longer experiencing symptoms. However, since almost all of our depressed patients had correspondingdocumented depressive symptoms, it is unlikely that a patient classified as depressed did not have depressive symptoms during the year preceding the abnormal cancer screening test.Although depression diagnosis documented in administrative data is more likely to correspond to severe and recurrent depression in patients, 37we were not able to account for the clinical severity of depression or whether it was adequatelytreated. Finally, as our data was collected via retroactive chart review, there may be some residual confounding that we were not able to account for in our analyses. This is the first examination of the relationship between pre- existing depression and time to diagnostic resolution of abnormal mammograms and Pap tests. 9Previous studies focused on screening mammography and Pap tests. Our findings did not support the notion that pre-existing mood disorders documented in the EMR delays the time to resolutionof abnormal cancer screening tests for vulnerable populations, although we did find a trend of delayed care in depressed women who were uninsured or took longer to resolve their Papabnormalities. It is possible that the timing of depressivesymptoms in relation to the time of being informed of abnormal cancer screening is a more informative predictor. Future studies should validate our results by using survey data to classifypatients 'depressive symptoms, their severity, and whether they reflect a stable psychological \"trait \"or temporary \"state. \" Our current findings are consistent with our previous work, in that individual characteristics of patients may be less important than system characteristics in determining the time to diagnostic resolution of abnormal mammograms or Paptests in vulnerable women 19,20. However, identifying which patients are most vulnerable may allow for more efficient allocation of resources, as patient-centered-medical-home models emerge and incorporate more elements of case manage-ment. Our findings imply that pre-screening the EMR for mood disorders may not be the most reliable approach to identify a group of patients at higher risk of delayeddiagnostic resolution of abnormal cancer screening tests in a vulnerable population. a b Figure 1.

Training environments are complex, composedof clinical teams, residency programmes, and clinicalunits. We examined the relationship between residents'perceptions of their training environment and disclosure of or apology for their worst error. Method: Anonymous, self-administered surveys were distributed to Medicine and Surgery residents atBoston Medical Center in 2005. Surveys askedresidents to describe their worst medical error, and toanswer selected questions from validated surveysmeasuring elements of working environments thatpromote learning from error. Subscales measured the microenvironments of the clinical team, residency programme, and clinical unit. Univariate and bivariatestatistical analyses examined relationships betweentrainee characteristics, their perceived learningenvironment(s), and their responses to the error.Results: Out of 109 surveys distributed to residents, 99 surveys were returned (91% overall response rate),two incomplete surveys were excluded, leaving 97: 61% internal medicine, 39% surgery, 59% male residents. While 31% reported apologising for thesituation associated with the error, only 17% reporteddisclosing the error to patients and/or family. Moremale residents disclosed the error than femaleresidents (p \u00bc0.04). Surgery residents scored higher on the subscales of safety culture pertaining to theresidency programme (p \u00bc0.02) and managerial commitment to safety (p \u00bc0.05). Our Medical Culture Summary score was positively associated withdisclosure (p \u00bc0.04) and apology (p \u00bc0.05). Conclusion: Factors in the learning environments of residents are associated with responses to medicalerrors. Organisational safety culture can be measured,and used to evaluate environmental attributes ofclinical training that are associated with disclosure of, and apology for, medical error. INTRODUCTION Everyone makes mistakes. Over the past decade, the medical profession has started to apply a systems approach to patient safety,recognition that coordination of individual, team, and organisational forces are needed to promote patient safety. Analysis of the root causes of an error can prevent future errors by identifying and correcting problems.1 However, in order to learn from mistakes and develop safer systems, errors must rst be identied and reported. Unfortunately, many errors are never reporte d. In one study, merely half of the house ofcers told their attending physiciansabout the most serious errors they committed. 2Underreporting of adverse events is estimated to range from 50% to 96%annually. 134Rather than dealing with mistakes constructively by reporting andlearning from them, studies indicate thatphysicians typically respond to their mistakes defensively, blaming the system, other members of the healthcare team, or even the patient. 25e7Possible explanations for underreporting medical errors include fearof litigation acting as a deterrent, 8e10and the professional medical culture that limit anindividual's willingness to discuss error. 51 1 While elements of professional medical culture are hypothesised to lead to wide-spread underreporting of medical errors, few studies have elucidated and measured aspects of medical culture that are associated with a failure to disclose, particularly in the learning environments of clinical training programmes. In contrast to medical culture, non-medical industries such as aviation and nuclear safety have traditionally valued a professional 'culture of safety', which facil- itates reporting of errors, so that individualsoperating in groups within an organisation can learn how to prevent future errors. 12 Medical educators have recently attempted toincorporate system-based thinking into their curriculum, in order to incorporate aspects of a safety culture that, along with enquiry and trust, were previously lacking in<An additional appendix is published online only.

In addition to the complexities of quanti-tatively measuring an abstract concept of 'organisational culture', 14residents train in multiple environments which are dynamic and divergent: their individual clin-ical teams (which often rotate), the academic residency training programme, and the clinical institution(s)(usually a hospital) each contributing to a trainee's overall sense of culture. This study endeavours to measure a trainee's percep- tion of their training environment as it relates to safety, and their response to committing an error. By collectingdata on both these elements, we explore the relationship between the culture of the training environment and individual behaviour. Specically, we hypothesised that house ofcers would be more likely to disclose andapologise for an error if they rate their clinical team as having an environment in which they can report errors without fear of punishment or rejection; rate their training programme as having positive attitudes about reporting and coping with errors in the workplace; and rate the hospital as having a high level of commitment to patient safety. Secondary aims of our study were to evaluate the association between individual characteris- tics of clinical trainees and, rst, disclosure of a medical error, and second, apology for the error. METHODS Study design and survey administration Anonymous, self-administered surveys were distributed to medicine and surgery residents at Boston Medical Center during educational conferences and department meetings in 2005. The distribution and retrieval proce- dures of the surveys ensured privacy and anonymity of the residents. The researchers (who were also attending physicians) were blinded as to which residents completed the survey, which ensured no conflict of interest for the researchers if asked to evaluate residents. The residents were assured that their privacy and anonymity would be protected, and that the researcherswould remain blinded to their participation status. Specically, the researchers approached a group of housestaff during an educational conference or meeting, explained the purpose of the survey, and then left the room and building. Residents who choose to participate completed the surveys and returned them in sealed envelopes to a box in the room. Those who chose not to participate returned blank surveys in sealed envelopes. At the end of each conference, a research assistant returned to the room to collect the box with the sealed envelopes. All participants received a $10honorarium, whether or not they completed the survey. The survey, database, and protocol were de-identied. To further protect participants in the event of an acci- dental breach of anonymity, a certicate of condenti- ality was obtained from the National Institutes of Health. The project was carefully reviewed and approved by the institutional review board. Survey content Our survey focused on three levels of environment that ha d the most face validity of microculture constructs within a resident's learning environment. Questions were selected from three validated surveys of organisational culture, adapted for this study to focus on the organisa- tional environment of housestaff. Since the full survey instruments were deemed too high a respondent burden, the authors carefully considered and then selected itemsfrom each survey most relevant to the study. The micro- environment of the immediate clinical team was exam- ined with ve of seven questions from the Team Psychological Safety Survey, which assesses the belief that well intentioned actions will not lead to punishment or rejection by the team (see online appendix). 15The macroenvironment of the residency programme wasassessed with 10 of the 37 items from the Error Orienta- tion Questionnaire; the items selected assess attitudes toerrors and approaches to coping with errors in the workplace (see online appendix). 16Perception of hospital management's commitment to patient safety onthe clinical unit was assessed with four of 19 items from the Patient Safety Survey (see online appendix). 17 Responses were coded with six-point Likert scales, andsummed to derive a total score for each survey. For all three scales (Team Psychological Safety, Residency Programme Error Orientation, and Managerial Safety Commitment), higher scores correlated with more posi- tive aspects of culture. In relation to error, participantswere asked to recall the circumstances of and share details regarding their most signicant medical or surgical error using open-ended text. In a multiple choice format, participants were specically asked about the following: consequences for the patient; consequences for the resi- dent; if and to whom they disclosed the error; if they had apologised for the error; and perceived causes for the error. Responses to each question were constructed from the results of a previous survey of residents regardingmedical error, conducted by Wu etal. 2In addition, resi- dents were asked to characterise their own level of distressfrom the error using a 10-point Likert scale. Analysis Univariate analysis was used to describe demographics, re sidency type, reporting rates (to colleagues and friends), apology and disclosure rates (to patients), 272 BMJ Qual Saf 2012; 21:271e 278. doi:10.1136/bmjqs-2011-000084Original research group.bmj.com on February 7, 2013 - Published by qualitysafety.bmj.com Downloaded from emotional responses of residents, types of mistakes, and consequences to and responses of both the residents and patients. Errors were classied from the written responses into one of the following categories: procedural, medical management, laboratory test follow-up, delayed diagnosis, or other/not classiable. We used c2to evaluate differ- ences between categorical variables and Wilcoxon ranksum methods for the three organisational culture scales. In order to compare the subscales with each other, theraw score was converted to a scaled score, by dividing each raw score by the maximum possible score of each subscale, and multiplying by 33.3. We then calculated an overall Medical Culture Summary score, by summing the three scaled subscores, that is, each subscale contributes one-third of the overall Medical Culture Summary score. RESULTS Surveys were distributed to 109 residents and 99 surveys we re returned, making an overall response rate of 91%. Two residents' surveys were excluded because they reported no mistake, leaving a nal population of 97 residents, 59 (61%) from internal medicine residents and 38 (39%) from surgical residents. There were 57 (59%) male residents, of which 33 (58%) were internal medicine residents and 24 (42%) were surgical residents. Two surgical residents did not report their gender, and were excluded from analyses which included gender. The most signicant medical or surgical error that was the focus of residents' responses typically occurred in an inpatientsetting and during the rst year of training ( table 1 ).Se venty-ve per cent of the residents were extremely distressed by their mistake. While 41 (42%) did notprovide an adequate description of their error to be classied, 26 (27%) were classied as medication related, 12 (12%) as procedural, 11 (11%) due to delayed diagnosis, and 9 (9%) due to inadequate follow-up to a laboratory test. Although 20 (21%) of the involved patients had no rep orted consequences resulting from the errors, common consequences included delayed treatment for 23 (24%), delayed diagnosis for 22 (23%), prolonged hospital stay for 17 (18%), medical complications for 13 (13%), and death for 13 (13%) patients. The errors resulting in patient death were largely errors involving anticoagulants, potassium balance (either not checking blood work or inadequate management of blood potas- sium level), or insulin. There were no consequences for 60 (62%) of the residents due to the error, but 30 (30%)reported some form of reprimand, 16 (16%) presented the case at a morbidity and mortality conference (which was reported as a consequence), 6 (6%) reported their work and family life was affected, and 1 (1%) was named in a law suit. The most common attributions for the error reported by residents included being too busy (32, 33%) and inexperience (31, 32%). Many resi- dents also attributed their error to having inadequate knowledge, hesitating before acting, or being too tired (table 2 ). While 30 (31%) reported apologising for the situation associated with the error, only 17 (18%) reported disclosing the error to patients and/or their family. Five residents both disclosed (29% of those who disclosed) and apologised (17% of those who apologised table 3 ). Correlates of disclosure and apology The disclosure rate was higher among surgery residents (24 %) than internal medicine residents (14%), but this difference was not statistically signicant (p \u00bc0.2). Of the residents who disclosed their error, 32 (33%) reported that it was unsupervised. Three (3%) residents reported being told by their attending not to discuss the error with the patient. Female internal medicine residents were signicantly less likely to disclose their worst medical error to patients or their families than their male counterparts (p \u00bc0.03). In contrast, more female surgery residents, 7 (58%), apologised for their error compared with male surgery residents 7 (29%), though the difference did not reach statistical signicance (p\u00bc0.1). Of the 13 errors that resulted in a patient's death, only 3 (23%) of the residents disclosed the errorto the patient and/or the patient's family, but 6 (46%) residents apologised to the patient's family. More resi- dents who made errors in medication management (8 of 26, 31%) disclosed their error than those who madeTable 1 Characteristics of residents and setting where error occurred Total N[97 N (%) Gender Men 57 (59) Women 38 (39) Unknown 2 (2) Programme Medicine 59 (61) Men 33 (56) Surgery 38 (39) Men 24 (63) Training year First year 64 (66) After rst year 32 (33) Unknown 1 (1) Setting Ward 63 (65) Ambulatory clinic 3 (3) Operating room 5 (5) Intensive care unit 22 (23) Emergency department 4 (4) BMJ Qual Saf 2012; 21:271e278. doi:10.1136/bmjqs-2011-000084 273Original research group.bmj.com on February 7, 2013 - Published by qualitysafety.bmj.com Downloaded from errors with procedures (3 of 12, 25%) or delayed diagnosis (2 of 11, 18%) (p \u00bc0.05). Correlates of organisational culture measures The Safety Culture Summary score was positively associ- ated with disclosure of medical error to the patient and/ or patient's family (p \u00bc0.04) and apology for the error (p\u00bc0.05). There was a trend of association between disclosure and higher scores on the subscales clinical Team Psychological Safety (p \u00bc0.07) and Residency Programme Error Orientation scales (p \u00bc0.07), but not for Managerial Safety Commitment (p \u00bc0.2). Report of apology to the patient and/or patient's family was notassociated with the clinical Team Psychological Safety score (p \u00bc1.0) but was positively associated with scores on the Residency Programme Error Orientation (p \u00bc0.05) and Managerial Safety Commitment (p \u00bc0.01). There were no signicant gender differences in scores for each of the subscales as well as the summary measure of safety culture. Surgery residents had higher scores on the Residency Programme Error Orientation (p \u00bc0.02) and Managerial Safety Commitment scales (p \u00bc0.05) compared with medicine residents, but there was no signicant difference between programmes in the Safety Culture Summary score ( table 4 ). CONCL USIONS Only 17% of the residents we surveyed reported discl osing their most signicant error to their patient and/or patient's family, and only 31% of the residentsreported apologising for their most signicant error. Our results suggest that factors in the learning environ- ments of the clinical team and residency programme are associated with error disclosure and apology among residents. Individual factors, such as gender and type of error, also appear to be associated with error disclosureTable 2 Characteristics of worst medical errors* Total N[97N (%) Cause of error (self-report) Too busy 32 (33) Inexperience 31 (32) Inadequate knowledge 19 (20) Other 15 (15) Hesitated too long before acting 14 (14) Too tired 13 (13) Inadequate communication 10 (10) Inadequate supervision 9 (9) Given erroneous information 9 (9) Felt overwhelmed 8 (8) Did not obtain the appropriatefollow-up test4 (4) Inadequate history 3 (3) Could not recall knowledge 2 (2) Type of error (classied by investigator) Other/could not be classied 41 (42) Medical management 26 (27) Procedural 12 (12) Delayed diagnosis 11 (11) Did not check lab test 9 (9) Consequences of error to patient Delayed treatment 23 (24) Delayed diagnosis 22 (23) None 20 (21) Prolonged hospital stay 17 (18) Medical complications 13 (13) Death 13 (13) Temporary symptoms 9 (9) Required additional medications 9 (9) Other 8 (8) Additional imaging tests 6 (6) Additional blood test 5 (5) Stressed relationship with medical providers1 (1) Consequences to resident None 60 (62) Present at M&M conference 16 (16) Reprimanded by another resident 16 (16)Reprimanded by attending 12 (12) Work life affected 6 (6) Personal life affected 6 (6) Other 3 (3) Reprimanded by administrator 2 (2) Named in lawsuit 1 (1) Error disclosure/discussion occurred with: Fellow residents 66 (68) Supervising resident 48 (49) Supervising attending 43 (44) Signicant other 22 (23) Patient and/or patient's family 17 (18) Colleagues at a conference 16 (16) Relative or friend 8 (8) ContinuedTable 2 Continued Total N[97N (%) No one 6 (6) Other 3 (3) If disclosure occurred to patient and/or family, who supervised?

Our ndings of discordance between apology and disclosure of medical error are consistent with previous studies exhibiting residents may be more willing to apologise for a bad outcome than to reveal that theyplayed a role in causing the bad outcome, resulting in a 'partial disclosure'. 1819Collectively, these ndings imply that factors that facilitate apologising for an errormay differ from influences that facilitate disclosing an error. These ndings are reflected in State laws that distinguish different components of conversations with patients about unanticipated outcomes: 'expression of sympathy' (apology), 'explanation' (disclosure), and 'admission of fault', which does not cleanly translate intoeither category. 20Additional explanations for the discordance may include the social context in which theerror occurred. For example, apologising for a systemic error that occurred would likely be easier than disclosing personal responsibility for an error, which could have greater legal and professional consequences. 19 The relationships of gender to our outcome measures are complex. More male residents disclosed error (driven mostly by male internal medicine residents) while more women apologised (driven mostly by female surgical residents). With our small sample size, denitiveconclusions about the interactions among gender, specialty and disclosure are difcult to ascertain from our data. Previous studies29have also demonstrated that individual attributes, such as gender and emotionalresponse to the error, influence the reporting rate of the error. However, in contrast to our results, women in a previous study were more likely to discuss their errors with their patients and make constructive changes intheir practice. 2Although the female residents in our study were less likely to disclose their error, the female surgical residents were more likely to apologise, consis- tent with past reports of greater empathy among female physicians.21Our results suggest that there are barriers to disclosure in the learning environments of clinicaltrainees that affect men and women differently. Further research will be needed to elucidate which barriers to disclosure and apology affect genders differentially. For example, possible barriers to disclosure may beattitudinal dwomen may feel they have more to lose than men by disclosing in order to be professionallysuccessful, or emotional dwomen may feel more of a sense of helplessness and loss of control once infor-mation is disclosed. We found surgery residents to have higher scores on the residency programme's Error Orientation Scale and the clinical unit's Managerial Safety Commitment Scalethan medicine residents, but not on the Safety Culture Summary score. This is consistent with a previous survey of residents, which found that presentations of errorscausing adverse events occurred 18% of the time in internal medicine ground rounds compared with 42% in surgery. 22The differences between these two elds are likely due to divergent regulatory and cultural factors.Historically, morbidity and mortality rounds have served as a forum where surgeons learn from poor outcomes and aspire to identify their errors, 23but this tradition is weaker in medicine training programmes.24The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education(ACGME) requires that surgery morbidity and mortality conferences present and discuss 'all deaths and compli- cations that occur on a weekly basis'. Historically, there has been no similar requirement for internal medicine. 24Without a specic requirement to do so, adverse events and errors occurring in the medicineservice may not be generally discussed. 21 Several medicine residencies have developed programmes to address the current ACGME competency on Systems Based Practice,13by teaching systems-based thinking using root cause analysis of medical errors,25 which require residents to develop an awareness ofworking in multidisciplinary teams to enhance patient safety, and participate in identifying system errors and implementing potential solutions. 13Several studies have demonstrated the benets of such educationalTable 3 Individual factors associated with disclosure and apology, by gender* and programme Yes (%) p Value y Disclosure to patient and/or patient's family?

Although such programmes are helpful, current ACGME guidelines do not require training programmes to address a thorough behavioural process of managing medical mistakes: accepting responsibility; discussing with colleagues; disclosing and apologising to patient; conducting an error analysis; and making changes in a practice settingdesigned to reduce future errors. 1 2 5 6 11 30 The ability of residents to cope with medical error may be dependent on reassurance and learning opportuni- ties provided by medical colleagues and supervisors.26 Our ndings would support this assertion, given thepositive association between our derived Medical Culture Summary score and reporting of disclosure and apology. However the low frequency of disclosure and apology suggests that more work needs to be done within ourtraining programmes to mitigate the negative effects of error to individuals, and gain potential benets from more thorough processing of errors for individuals and the healthcare system. There are several issues germane to housestaff and err ors that are not addressed by our study. Some believe that an effective apology includes offering some form ofreparation for the mistake. 31We did not examine the issue of reparation. While the literature suggests thatresident physicians who accept responsibility for their errors and discuss them are more likely to report otherimprovements in their medical practice, 2we did not examine this phenomenon. Furthermore, while disclo-sure in a timely and appropriate manner may influence a patient's decision to pursue legal action, 1e3we did not explore the relationship between our ndings and legalaction. In addition, though a doctor's emotional reac- tion to an error can last for years 32and negative emotional responses are associated with increased oddsof future self-perceived errors, 33we did not evaluate emotional reactions or predict the future likelihood of error. Lastly, we did not directly examine the extent to which subjects were trained regarding coping with medical error, and hence could not determine if this training influenced their behaviour. This study has several limitations. First, residents at only one academic medical centre were surveyed, so the results may not be generalisable. In addition, the resi-dents were surveyed during 2004 e2005, so it is possible that these results may no longer be accurate. During the past 6 years, the ACGME training requirements haveincreased their focus on systems-level thinking and training programmes have increasingly focused on reduction of error. However, the authors feel that the key ndings of this study are relevant today. The rate of safety culture change is relatively slow, as demonstratedTable 4 Safety environment factors associated with disclosure and apology, by gender* and programme Team Psychological Safety p Value yResidency ProgrammeError Orientation p Value yManagerialSafety Commitment p Value ySafety CultureSummary p Value y Median range (0e 33.3) Median range (0e 33.3) Median range (0e 33.3) Median range (0e 100) Total 26.6 25.0 25.0 76.6 Gender* 0.6 0.3 0.4 0.3 26.4 79.1 Women 26.6 24.4 25.0 76.0 Programme 0.2 0.02 0.05 0.2 Medicine 27.8 23.9 23.6 75.2 Surgery 26.6 26.1 27.8 80.5 Disclosed 0.07 0.07 0.2 0.04 Yes 28.9 26.6 26.4 81.9 No 26.6 24.4 25.0 76.0 Apologised 1.0 0.05 Yes 79.6 No 26.6 23.9 25.0 75.5 *N\u00bc95; two respondents who did not enter gender were excluded from the analysis. yp Values calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test 278. doi:10.1136/bmjqs-2011-000084Original research group.bmj.com on February 7, 2013 - Published by qualitysafety.bmj.com Downloaded from by a recent hospital survey administered by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: average composite change in safety culture to change 1% over 1 e2 years.20 An increased focus on reduction in error does nottranslate directly to increases in individual account- ability, apology or disclosure of error. Second, the modest sample size, limits opportunity for multivariable analyses as well as statistical power to detect potential associations. Third, our survey directed residents toconsider a single error. We did this to focus respondents' attention on the details of an event that they would remember clearly to gain insight into aspects of organ- isational culture. This specic error may not be repre- sentative of most errors. In addition, as most of these errors occurred during the residents' rst year of training, the expectation for disclosure and apology may be different than for the other years of training. However, a prior study that included trainees at ourinstitution suggested that the responsibility of delivering bad news often falls to junior members of the team, including rst-year trainees and medical students. 34 Fourth, the scales of organisational culture we used haverarely been used in healthcare settings. As such, the clinical signicance of our observed score differences are unclear. Despite the limitations, we successfully adapted survey tool s previously used in a business environment to measure aspects of the learning environment of clinicaltrainees which are associated with disclosure andapology for medical error. This instrument needs to be validated in other institutions before proving its value as a metric in residency programme safety culture. If vali- dated, such an instrument could be a valuable tool to assess changes in learning environments. Measuring culture and providing such feedback to leadership and staff is one of the safe practices recommended by the National Quality Forum to promote patient safety and reduce medical error. 35 Measuring culture change requires a multimodal approach, of which this instrument could make a valu-able contribution. 36Since the ability to measure medical culture, and changes to it, is immature,37our study provides baseline measurements to help move the eld further along. Developing learning environment metrics will be valuable to other institutions and training programmes in the coming years, as incremental programmatic changes in systems-level thinking and disclosure of medical error continue to impact the learning environments of residents. Our results suggest a need for training programmes to pro vide trainees with structured, meaningful ways to cope with errors to prevent negative emotional responses, as well as create learning environments that facilitate disclosure of errors. Attention may need to bepaid to explicate potential gender-related differences. All this is particularly important if, as a profession, we are to instil proper values, attitudes and responses to the inevitable occurrence of error in the next generation of physicians. As residency programmes incorporate systems-level thinking into residency education for patient safety and error prevention, it is important not to neglect the humanistic and interpersonal conse- quences of error for providers and patients. In order todo so, we need to develop measurement tools for learning environments. Further research is needed to identify successful environmental attributes that promote disclosure and healthy processing of medical errors.

Dysphagi a DOl I0.1007/s00455-0 II-9360-2 ORIGINAL ARTICLE Does PEG Use Cause Dysphagia in Head and Neck Cancer Patients? 2011/ Accepted: 19 July 2011 \u00a9Springer Scicncc+Business Media, LLC 2011 Abstract Percutaneo us endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) use is common in patients who undergo radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck cancer to maintain weight and nutrition during treatment. However, the true effect of PEG use on weight maintenance and its potential impact on long-term dysphagia outcomes have not been adequately studied. This retrospective study looked at swallowing-relat ed outcomes among patients who received prophylactic PEG vs. those who did not, and among patients who maintained oral diets vs. partial oral diets vs. those who were nil per os (NPO). Outcomes were assessed at the end of RT and at 3, 6. and 12 months post RT. A compreh ensive review of patients' medical charts for a 6-year period yielded 59 subjects with complete data. Results showed no difference in long-term percent weight change between the prophy\u00ad lactic PEG patients vs. all others, or between patients who, during RT. had oral diets vs. partial oral diets vs. NPO. However, those who did not receive prophylactic PEGs This work was done entirely at Boston University Medical Center. S. Langmore (181) \u00b7 G. P.

USA Published online: 18 August 2011 and those who maintained an oral or a partial oral diet during RT had significantly better diet outcomes at all times post RT. Dependence on a PEG may lead to adverse swal\u00ad lowing ability in post-irradiated head and neck cancer patients possibly due to decreased use of the swallowing musculature. Keywords Deglutition \u00b7 Deglutition disorders \u00b7 Head and neck cancer \u00b7 Radiotherapy \u00b7 PEG \u00b7 Weight \u00b7 Diet Dysphagia is a well-known complicat ion of radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck cancer (HNC). The incidence of dysphagia varies greatly by report, with figures ranging anywhere from 9 to 77% [I, 2]. These disparate figures are undoubtedly a result of multiple variables that may impact swallow function such as time after radiation treatment. stage of cancer, additional surgery or chemotherapy, patient characteristics, and response of the patient to the treatment. While instrumental procedures (i.e., Ouoroscopy or fiberoptic endoscop ic examination of swallowing [FEES)) can yield an objective diagnosis. more functional and more common indicators of a swallowing problem arc weight loss, diet level, and the need for a feeding tube. The need for a feeding tube in patients undergoing radiotherapy is a particula rly interesting variable since it is viewed as both beneficia l and detrimen tal for patients. ln cancer clinics across the U.S., different institutional poli\u00ad cies have prevailed. Some centers avoid placing a feeding tube unless the patient is showing signs of extreme weight loss or reported inability to swallow. Other centers place feeding tubes prophylactically in all patients (or those with advanced-stage cancer) before the RT regime even begins. Evidence for one policy over the other is lacking. Instead. 'f) Springer ) institutional precedent and anecdotal experience are more influential in guiding a physician in his recommendation. Evidence for best practice in this area is scant. The American Head and Neck Cancer Society's guidelines regarding PEGs state that \"Due to the location of their tumors and the mucosal effects of therapy, many patients with head and neck cancer are nutritionally compromised. If highly toxic therapy is planned, placement of a PEG tube prior to starting therapy enables patients to maintain nutrition during therapy and recover more quickly\" [:~]. These rec\u00ad ommendations, which appear to favor prophylactic PEG placement, come from a consensus of practitioners who were selected by the Society and are not necessarily based on evidence from well-designed research studies. In contrast to these guidelines. recent awareness of the significant dysphagia experienced by some patients after RT and the emphasis on swallowing rehabilitation have led some clinicians to believe that relying on a feeding tube during RT may adversely affect a patient's ultimate ability to swallow. This belief originates from the perception that if a person has a feeding tube during his course of RT, he will depend on it for nutrition and will stop taking anything by mouth because of pain, altered taste, and lack of appetite. While refraining from oral intake may be more comfortable for the patient, clinicians fear that the associ\u00ad ated reduction in swallowing frequency may ultimately lead to muscle atrophy and augment the severity of radia\u00ad tion fibrosis in the throat. This belief is not based on strong research either, but it is suggested from one pilot study that showed some benefit to patients who exercised their swallowing muscles during RT [-1]. The best evidence for guiding clinical practice comes from well-designed prospective or retrospective research studies. Ideally, patients who received a prophylactic PEG (placed before or during the first week of RT) would be compared to patients who received a therapeutic PEG (placed after the first week of RT) or to patients who never received a PEG and maintained a 100% oral diet. The outcome of interest would be swallowing status after a given period of time. A literature search for all such studies published between January I 991 and January 20 I 0 yielded only ten studies with acceptable evidence, including two prospec\u00ad tive randomized control trials. Four studies compared prophylactic vs. therapeutic PEG placement [.:'i-X], four studies compared prophylactic PEG to oral/no PEG patients [9, I 0]. and two studies compared prophylactic PEG to therapeutic PEG and to oral patients (or pooled therapeutic and oral patients) [I I, 12]. None of these studies reported swallow status from an instrumental swallow examination; instead, they reported weight loss, use of a feeding tube, or patient/clinician report as surro\u00ad gate indicators of swallow function. id Springer S. Langmorc et a!.: Docs PEG Use Cause Dysphagia? Looking at weight loss as a possible measure of swallow function. the literature suggested that prophylactic PEG favors less weight loss over the course of RT treatment ].:'i. (), I 0, 12-1\u00b7-1]. Only one study, albeit a randomized clinical trial, found no significant difference in BMI change at the end of RT between patients who received prophylactic PEG vs. patients with therapeutic PEG or oral diets L I 1]. Reports of comparative weight Joss for long-term outcomes were mixed. One study found no significant difference between the prophylactic PEG, therapeutic PEG. and I 00% oral diet groups at 3\"or 6 months post RT (14]. Two other studies found that prophylactic PEG patients fared better (lost less weight) than therapeutic PEG patients at 12 months post RT [7. I 2]. Diet levels were not reviewed in any of the studies. but two studies did look at swallow function via clinician/ patient rating scales. Chen et al. [14] found that signifi\u00ad cantly more patients who had been given a prophylactic PEG reported dysphagia at 3 and 6 months compared to patients who had 100% oral diets. Morton et al. 171 found that patients who had a PEG placed for longer durations, regardless of prophylactic or therapeutic nature. reported worse swallowing function at 12 months (P < 0.0 I). In summary, there is a paucity of published evidence regarding dysphagia outcomes, and adequate guidelines for PEG placement are clearly lacking. In light of the pre\u00ad liminary results of Chen and Morton suggesting PEGs may detrimentally affect long-term dysphagia outcomes, the present study was undertaken to determine if PEG use influenced long-term swallow function in HNC patients who received radiotherapy at our institution. The first aim was to determine whether patients who received a pro\u00ad phylactic PEG had better or worse swallowing function, diet scores, or weight change outcomes than patients who did not receive a prophylactic PEG. The second aim of this study was to determine whether patients who used a feeding tube for all. some, or none of their nutrition fared differently in terms of eventual swallowing ability, diet level, and weight change. The results of the second ques\u00ad tion would hopefully cast light on the question of whether the act of eating and using the muscles involved in swal\u00ad lowing would impact long-term dysphagia outcomes. Materials and Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted of all head and neck cancer patients treated with RT from January 2003 to September 2008 at Boston University Medical Center. The chart reviews were performed by three authors (KYM, SEL, GPK) using the medical center electronic database and the clinical data warehouse. An initial search of vari\u00ad ous hospital databases revealed 880 patient records. After S. Langmore et al.: Docs PEG Use Cause Dysphagia? excluding patients with ineligible cancer locations (e.g., esophagus, skin) or who did not fall within our eligibility window, a final list of 150 patients remained. Patients were then excluded from analysis if there was incomplete outcome data at baseline, incomplete outcome data at more than one time point of interest, if they received only a partial dose of RT, or if they had persistence or recurrence of HNC at the time of outcome. Of the 150 medical records, there were 59 patients who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, and for whom adequate data was available up to I year post RT. Approval from the Institutional Review Board of Boston University Medical Center was obtained prior to data collection. Age, gender, location and stage of cancer, chemotherapy. and extent of surgery were recorded for each patient. Weight, diet level, and PEG status were noted at five time periods: start of RT. completion of RT, 3 months post RT, 6 months post RT. and 12 months post RT. Diet level at each time point was categorized by 6 diet levels listed in Table I. Objective instrumental evaluation of swallowing ability would have been an excellent indicator of function, but very few patients had formal swallow studies so this could not be considered. Accordingly. our primary outcomes of interest were percent weight loss and mean diet levels over time, both representing common surrogates of swallow function and dysphagia. Percent weight loss, rather than absolute weight loss, was used to help account for vastly different body sizes. While weight at the start of RT was probably not the subject's usual weight, it was a good baseline from which change over time could be compared, especially to capture the effect of PEG use on weight during RT. However, end of RT was chosen as the baseline when recording diet level so that changes to this outcome would be a result of vari\u00ad ables other than the acute effects of RT (such as pain). The end of RT represented a nadir in diet that was experienced by almost all patients, and any tumor-related dysphagia symptoms had been resolved. So this end-of-RT nadir served as a \"normalized\" starting point from which we Table 1 Diet level categories Diet level I 2 3 4 5 6 Description NPO Partial PEG/part ial oral Liquid diet Puree and wet soft foods Edentulous or regular food with difficulty or requiring liquid wash Regular diet with no alterations needed could record changes in diet level over time between dif\u00ad ferent groups of patients. Data Analysis Two sets of analyses were conducted to determine the impact of PEG use on long-term diet level and weight change. All analyses used the same cohort of patients. although they were categorized differently depending on the question of interest. The first set of an\\llyses evaluated whether patients who received a prophylactic PEG (main independent variable) had different outcomes (%weight change and diet scores) than people who did not receive a prophylactic PEG. The second set of analyses assessed whether diet level at the end of RT for all patients (main independent variable) was associated with the two outcomes of interest. Outcomes of interest for both analyses were percent weight change and diet score at 3, 6, and 12 months after completion of RT. For each of the above analyses, generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the relation\u00ad ships of interest. The mixed-effects models were used to account for the correlation from using repeated observa\u00ad tions on the same subject. Covariates considered were chemotherapy, stage of cancer, and major surgery. How\u00ad ever, due to insufficient data in some cells, the results were adjusted only for surgery. Potential collinearity of covari\u00ad ates was confirmed by calculating the correlation between independent variables; no pair of variables had a Spearman correlation > 0.40. The association between diet status at baseline and diet scores at follow-up was evaluated in preliminary analyses using the nonparametri c Kruskai\u00ad Wallis test at each time point, and the results were con\u00ad sistent with the parametr ic regression analyses. For the diet level analysis, the Tukey-Kramer method was used to identify significant pairwise differences across the different baseline diet groups. Analyses were performed using SAS software ver. 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, C). Results Analysis I: Prophylactic PEG vs. Norrhera peutic PEG Table 2 summarizes patient descriptive characteristics 111 this analysis. Of the 59 patients in our cohort, 33 had a PEG placed at some time over the first year. The vast majority (27/33) of patients who had a PEG received it prophylac\u00ad tically (before or during the first week of RT). For this first set of analyses, these 27 patients were our \"prophylactic PEG\" cohort. Six of the 33 patients had a PEG placed therapeutically: 3 patients had a PEG placed during weeks ~Springer Table 2 Descriptive Characteri stics characteristics for prophyla ctic PEG vs. no/therapeuti c PEG analysis Age (years) Mean Range Sex Male Female PEG placement Disease stage\" II Ill IV Not staged Tumor site Oral cavity. orophary nx. and nasopharynx Hypopharynx and larynx Malignant neoplasm of Except for age. all values are other and ill-defined sites number (percent) Surgery \" Stage according to AJCC Minorh TNM Staging Guide, 2004 Major\" h Biopsy. neck dissection, and/ or tonsillectomy None < Any surgery more extensive Chemotherapy than biopsy, neck dissection.

Median duration of PEG use was 97 days or about 8 months (range = 61-2,049 days). Over the year, many patients had their PEG removed while a few had a PEG placed. The overall number of patients with a feeding tube was (I) 27/59 or46%ofall patients at the end ofRT; (2) 21/59 or 36% at 3 months after the end of RT (20 were prophylactic); (3) 14/59 or 24% at 6 months (12 prophylactic); and (4) 9/59 or 15% at 12 months (7 were prophylactic). There were 41 men and 18 women in the sample, with a mean age of 58.8 years. The most common sites for cancer were the oral cavity, oropharynx, and nasopharynx (78% in the prophylactic PEG group; 50% in the no/therapeutic PEG group).

Rates of minor, major, or no surgery were similar in both groups. In order to determin e whether the patients who received a prophylactic PEG had different outcomes over time than patients who did not receive a prophylactic PEG, percent weight loss and mean diet scores were analyzed over time. Table :; summarizes these results. Percent Weight Change Analyses were performed using linear mixed-eff ects models adjusted for surgery. Percent weight loss between the two groups was analyzed from baseline at the start of RT to the end of RT, and 3, 6, and 12 months post RT. The differences were not statistically significant across time (P = 0.19). S. Langmore et al.: Does PEG Use Cause Dysphagia?

In contrast to weight change results, the prophylactic PEG group had signifi\u00ad cantly worse diet outcomes than either the no PEG group or the therapeutic PEG group across time (P = 0.002). In summary, these two analyses showed that prophy\u00ad lactic PEG placement by itself did not significantly influ\u00ad ence long-term weight changes in head and neck cancer patients. but it did appear to affect diet level up to I year after RT. [n order to probe these findings further, the next set of analyses were conducted. Analysis U: Outcome s by Type of Nutritional Intake: I 00% PEG Diet vs. Partial PEG/Partial Oral Diet vs. I 00% Oral Diet In this patient population , diet status and feeding tube status are not always analogous . This is because some patients who have a PEG still eat a full oral diet while others are partially or completely reliant on their feeding tubes. Since some people with PEGs had consistent oral diets, we speculated that PEG placement by itself may not be the most important factor influencing long-term diet outcomes. Instead, we wondered if PEG dependence, and hence less frequent usc of swallowing musculature, may be more important in influencing long-term dysphagia. Accordingly, in this second analysis we divided our 59 subjects into three cohorts based on each individual's diet level at the end of RT. regardless of PEG status. These three groups were ( 1) 100% NPO (nil per os) (diet level 1) representing very little swallowing muscle usc, (2) partial PEG/partial oral (diet level 2) representing intermediat e swallowing muscle use, and (3) 100% oral intake (diet levels 3-6) representing most swallowing muscle use. As in the first analysis, we analyzed percent weight loss and mean diet scores between groups at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after RT. Our hypothesis was that consistent eating and swallowing during RT would help preserve a patient's ability to swallow and thus lead to a more normal long-term diet. Diet level P value Adjusted mean difference (95'7.-Cl)\" P value 0.19 -I. II ( -1.78. -0.44) 0.002 Table 4 dclineat~s descriptive characteristics in this second analysis. At the end of RT, 14 patients were I 00%\u00ad PEG dependent (forming group 1 ), 8 patients had a partial PEG and partial oral diet (forming group 2). and 37 patients had a 100% oral diet (forming group 3 ). Of the 37 patients who had a 100% oral diet. 9 had PEGs but were not using them. Overall, most patients reported only minor changes in diet prior to RT (average score was 4.8/6). By the end of RT, however, many subject's diet levels dropped dramatically, with the average diet score falling to 3.4/6 (liquid or puree/wet soft food). Patients who relied partially or completely on their PEGs for nutrition all had advanced stage Ill or IV cancer. while 71% of patients who had a I 00% oral diet had stage 3 or 4 cancer. Across all three groups, oral cavity. orophar\u00ad ynx, and nasopharynx cancers were most common , and minor surgery was a common adjuvant therapy. The dis\u00ad tribution of major, minor, and no surgery was similar in all groups. The addition of chemo agents to the radiation therapy was common, ranging from 73 to 100%. Intensity\u00ad modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and 3D/conventional radiation therapy techniques were equally represented among the groups. Percent Weight Change Percent weight change was recorded at the start of RT. the end of RT, and at 3, 6, and 12 months post RT. Figure I shows the mean change in weight over time in these three diet groups (n = 59). Longitudinal regression analyses adjusted for surgery revealed no significant difference in weight change across the three groups during the I year follow-up (see Table 5). Thus, the results were similar to the earlier analysis of weight change between prophylactic PEG users and all other patients. Change ill Diet Level Since the data suggested that PEG placement or PEG use alone may not significantly affect weight change, a major question of interest was whether the subjects who were completely dependent on their feeding tubes (Ffs) at the end of RT were able to advance their long-term diet levels ~Sp ringer S.

Using the same three groups defined by diet level at the end of RT, we analyzed mean group diet scores at 3, 6, and 12 months post RT. Preliminary Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze these data (separately by time point), and indicated significant difference s in mean diet score between the three groups at all time points (P < 0.0 I). Linear mixed-effect s models were then used to evaluate difference s in average diet score across all groups longitudinally after adjusting for surgery. Once again, there was a significant difference across all three groups (global P < 0.00 I). The post-hoc Tukey-Kramer multiple-comparisons procedure showed that both the partial PEG/partial oral group and the I 00% oral group had significantly higher mean diet scores than the I 00% PEG group over time. There were no significant differences in mean diet scores between the partial PEG/partial oral group and the I 00% oral group.

Two indicator s of adverse swallowing outcomes were investigated: percent weight loss and diet level. The results of this study showed that there was no significant differ\u00ad ence in weight loss among all groups at any time after radiation therapy. It also found that patients who had PEGs placed prophylactically , or patients who relied totally on their PEGs for nutrition, had significantly worse diet out\u00ad comes than patients who did not receive prophylactic PEGs or who continued to eat orally despite receiving a PEG. Two recent studies suggested that patients who have prophylactic PEGs or who usc a PEG for an extended period of time experience adverse outcomes [7, I-n However, this study is the first to present objective evi\u00ad dence that these patients may develop a more severe dys\u00ad phagia than patients who do not receive prophylactic PEGs or who do not rely on a PEG for all their nutrition.

The median duration of PEG placement in the group studied here was 8 months, which agrees closely with the average duration of prophylactic PEG placement reported in the literature [I 5-1 7). This is a substantial amount of time that a patient must endure an artificial means of feeding, not to mention the associated discomfort, stigma, and hindrance to social eating. The need for long-term PEG use follows a very difficult and traumatic cancer treatment and its associated morbiditie s and serves to exacerbate an already-decreased quality of life. The most common reason for placing a PEG prophy\u00ad lactically is to maintain weight, hydration, and nutrition, especially during the painful weeks of radiotherapy which can make this treatment more endurable and in some instances safer. Surprisingly, the current study did not find a significant difference in percent weight change between prophylactic PEG and no/therapeutic PEG patients during RT, in contrast to several other published studies men\u00ad tioned earlier [5, 9, I 0, 12-l.J.). The current study also found no significant differences in weight loss between the prophylactic PEG and no/therapeutic PEG patients at any time point after RT. When the groups were reorganized into three groups according to diet level at the end of RT rather than the presence or the absence of a prophylactic feeding tube, we still found no significant differences in percent weight loss among the groups. While long-term weight outcomes at 3, 6. or 12 months after RT are not often reported in the literature. the current findings were in agreement with the one other study that did investigate this outcome [ 14]. The reason for the dis\u00ad crepancy between findings from the current study and most of the literature is unclear. One may question whether ~Spr inger S. Langmore et al.: Docs PEG PEG C1l -a-Partial PEG (2) -100% Oral C3-B)I Fig. 2 Mean diet score over time in three groups defined by diet level at baseline (unadjusted at RT end. adjusted for surgery at all other time points) ~~ 6 ,------------.------------,--------- ----------------- 5 Pu<oo 12mo P<>St confounding factors such as chemotherapy, stage of cancer, or any other patient or treatment variables could have accounted for our percent weight change result~. It may be that the prophylactic PEG and the 100% PEG use groups had a greater share of these adverse factors that would have caused a significantly greater decrease in weight had they not received a prophylactic PEG and/or relied on their PEG. Such a conclusion would suggest that prophylactic PEGs and PEG reliance actually helped these patients minimize weight loss during RT as well as the other patients who did not have these other risk factors. Table 2, which summarizes the patient demographics, does not support this hypothesis. The majority of patients in all groups had stage III/IV cancer (68% of those patients without prophylactic PEG) and received chemotherapy (74% of that same group). However, while the groups looked fairly similar demographically, they were not equally matched and the limited sample size precluded us from adjusting statistica lly for any confounding variable except surgery. Therefore, this question remains unsettled. A future study addressing this paradoxical issue would be extremely interesting and incredibly useful in guiding PEG placement policies. Diet level was the other outcome investigated in this study. This is arguably the most functional and meaningful indicator of swallowing ability. Change in diet over the first year after RT has not been reported systematically in the literature, but it turned out to be very revealing in this study. When the patients were identified and grouped by the diet they were taking rather than whether they had a PEG, it became possible to study the effect on swallowing outcomes of eating and drinking orally versus depending on a PEG. The motivating question was whether consistent ~Sp ringer use of the swallowi ng musculature during and after RT determined long-term diet status. Would PEG reliance, perhaps coupled with radiation-induced fibrosis, translate into disuse atrophy significant enough to promote a chronic dysphagia? This analysis found that (I) the 100% oral group had significantly higher mean diet scores than the 100% PEG group across time, (2) the partial PEG/partial oral group had significantly higher mean diet scores than the 100% PEG group across time, but (3) there were no significant differences in mean diet scores between the partial PEG/ partial oral and 100% oral groups. These were surprising findings. First, we showed that patients who were 100% dependent on their PEGs for nutrition (and remained NPO) not only presented with worse diet outcomes over the first year compared to patients who consumed I 00% of their diets orally, but also had worse diet outcomes than patients who had a PEG but continued to take some nutrition orally. Most of those I 00% PEG users had their PEGs removed sometime over the course of the year, but their diet levels did not catch up to those of the other patients. In Fig. 2, it can be seen that the 100% PEG intake group (as defined by their diet stants at end of RT) were on average consuming only an oral liquid diet at 6 and 12 months post RT. whereas the partial PEG and I 00% oral groups were on average consuming several food consistencies. This very functional outcome is clearly meaningful to a person\u00b7 s daily life. Second, this analysis showed that patients who continued to take some nutrition orally, in spite of having a PEG. attained the same long-term diet outcomes as patients who never had a PEG. This suggests that continued oral intake during RT allows for continued usc of the swallowi ng musculature, which in turn may prevent the S. Langmore et al.: Does PEG Use Cause Dysphagia? degree of dysphagia experienced by other patients who rely entirely on their PEGs. The implication s of this study are twofold. First, the community and the individual physician should reconsider recommending prophylactic PEG placement in patients who are likely to depend entirely on the PEG for nutrition unless it is absolutely necessary. There will always be patients who benefit from a PEG and they certainly should not be denied its convenience and ability to deliver much needed nutrition. Those patients probably consist of indi\u00ad viduals who are severely malnourished. fragile, and have shown that they are not able to prevent a sharp and con\u00ad sistent weight loss. Second. and perhaps more important, when a patient is given a PEG, this study suggests that they should be strongly encouraged to continue swallowing something orally on a regular basis. If the purpose is to prevent atrophy and loss of function of the swallowing muscula\u00ad ture. it does not matter what the bolus is: the patient can simply sip water throughout the day. The point is to con\u00ad tinue exercising and moving the muscles so that they do not become atrophied, stiff, and potentially locked in by fibrotic tissue. This interpretatio n is still hypothetical and should be confirmed by larger studies that are able to control for all known confounder s. A prospective randomized clinical trial would provide the best evidence, of course, and would mitigate the limitations of the current study. Since pro\u00ad phylactic PEG placement is still the standard of care in many institutions, an RCT could feasibly be carried out whereby all prophylactic PEG patients are assigned to one of two groups. where one remains NPO and the other takes some nutrition orally throughout the duration of their PEG usc. A major improvement over the current study, and all others that have addressed this topic, would be to include formal swallow studies, a standardized diet score, and a QOL scale. The issue is too important to let the status quo stand unchallenged. Acknowledgment This work was supported by a grunt from the NIH/NCI #ROICAI20950-03. References I. Cooper JS.

Although Medicare expenditures increased in all BMI groups over this period, expenditures increased significantly faster for overweight and obese Medicare ben-eficiaries. Increasing rates of weight-related chronic con-ditions over time appeared to account for this trend. We found smaller obesity-related differences in ex- penditures than reported in previous research. 1,5,6This may be due to differences in expenditure data (claims vsestimated expenditures), costs included (Medicare onlyvs total costs), or participant age range. Our results suggest that projections related to the fu- ture costs of obesity should take into account changesin chronic health conditions among the obese older popu-lation as drivers of increased expenditures.

Emergency Department Use by Primary Care Patients at a Safety-Net Hospital In fee-for-service payment models, there are strong financial incentives for hospitals to toler- ate high levels of emergency department (ED) use, including use by established primary carepatients. Yet, as health care reform introduces globalpayment models, high levels of ED use will no longerbe financially tenable. Understanding the magnitudeof the problem of ED use by established primary carepatients is crucial to redesigning primary care deliveryand reimbursement in the United States. We had 2objectives: (1) to characterize ED use at an urbansafety-net hospital after the implementation of Massa-chusetts health reform, focusing on patients who hadprimary care providers (PCPs) and (2) to identify pat-terns of ED use that might inform the hospital-basedprimary care practices' transformation to a medicalhome, and eventually, to an accountable care organi-zation. Methods. Boston Medical Center (BMC) is an urban safety-net hospital with 8 primary care practices staffed by 105 PCPs. The practices predominantly serve a mi-nority and low-income population. We identified pa-tients who had 1 or more primary care visits from July1, 2009, to July 1, 2010, and examined their ED use overthis period. We defined frequent ED users as patients with4 or more ED visits in the past year and occasional EDusers as those with 1 to 3 ED visits in the past year.

Ap-proximately half (49.8%) of all ED visits occurred on week-days, while BMC primary care practices were open. MostED visits were for low-severity conditions. Comment. Emergency department use by primary care patients at an urban safety-net hospital was high, though most visits were of low severity. One possible reason forthis is lack of access to primary care, 4with few available appointments to see a PCP. While data on time to thirdnext available appointment, a standard measure of pri-mary care access, 5are not available for the primary care practices during the study period, other practice met-rics suggest that access may have been a problem. Forexample, missed primary care appointment rates werehigh, averaging 24.5%. High missed appointment ratesare often correlated with long wait times to schedule ap-pointments. 6In addition, monthly telephone call statis- tics show that only between 72.4% and 88.1% of patienttelephone calls were answered by the primary care callcenter over the study period. It is possible that patientscalled the practices with an urgent problem, did not havetheir telephone call answered promptly, and decided toseek care in the ED instead. Indeed, 13% of telephonecalls were abandoned by patients over the study period(patients called and subsequently hung up while they werekept on hold). The fact that nearly half of all ED visitstook place during the hours of primary care clinic op-eration further suggests that appointment availability mayhave been an issue. In addition, a sizable minority, roughlyone-fifth, of primary care is provided by residents, 7who have limited availability when they are not in clinic. It isalso possible that Massachusetts health reform has af-fected access to primary care. As newly insured patientshave entered primary care in large numbers, it is pos-sible that access to primary care has worsened for otherpatients. Massachusetts has been a bellwether for the imple- mentation of health reform and will be a bellwether forthe transformation of primary care, with the move awayfrom fee-for-service payments and the introduction ofglobal payments for health care. Overall ED volume hascontinued to increase in Massachusetts after health re-form. 8It is unclear if changes in primary care practice and payment will be sufficient to reduce high levels ofED use among patients at an urban safety-net hospital.

This information, called R3, is available as a free Android or iPhone app. From Sherin et al.5The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released a comprehen - sive report on the prevalence of sexual violence, stalking, and in - timate-partner violence (IPV) in the United States. 1 The report re - lays the alarming findings that 35.6% of women in this country are raped, assaulted, or stalked by intimate partners at some point during their lives, and approxi - mately 6% experience these events in any given year. Men are also at risk for IPV victimization: 28.5% report having been victimized at some time during their lifetime, and 5% report victimization with - in the past year. But the forms and consequences of IPV experi - enced by women and men are not the same. Women are more than twice as likely as men to experience sexual coercion in their intimate relationships (17% vs. 8%) and are twice as likely to ex - perience severe forms of physical assault by an intimate partner, such as being choked, hit with a fist, or kicked (24.3% vs. 13.8%). The most striking differences re - late to the consequences: very few men (5.2%) report ever being fear - ful of their intimate partners, in contrast to 28.8% of women, and women are almost four times as likely as men to be injured by a partner (14.8% vs. 4.0%). The costs of IPV are burden - some, for the health care system and for society. A decade ago, the CDC estimated the cost of IPV to the United States to be $5.8 bil - lion per year ($10.4 billion in 2012 dollars), and it's been esti - mated that the cost of providing health care to adult survivors of IPV ranges from $2.3 billion to $7.0 billion in the first year after the assault. The annual health care costs for women who are ex - periencing ongoing IPV are 42% higher than those for nonabused women. This finding is unsurpris - ing, given the evidence that IPV victimization of women increases the risks of injury, gastrointesti - nal disorders, chronic pain, cen - tral nervous system symptoms (including fainting and seizures), hypertension, and gynecologic problems. 2 What can physicians do about IPV? All health care providers should be alert to aspects of pa - tients' histories or symptoms that could suggest IPV and then should follow up with specific questions. According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, screening asymptomatic female patients for IPV victimization may provide benefits, with minimal adverse effects. 3 As of August 2012, new guidelines under the Affordable Care Act require insurance cover - age to include IPV screening and counseling as part of eight essen - tial health services for women at no additional cost to the patient. 4 Therefore, at a minimum, all pri - mary care physicians should now be screening female patients 12 years of age or older for IPV. Spe - cialty professional organizations recommend that obstetricians and pediatricians also consider per - forming regular IPV screening. Numerous IPV screening instru - ments may be used to begin a dialogue with the patient; one of them (known as HITS) is shown in the table. 5 Another question that may be used to start a dis - cussion about safety at home is simply, \"Are you afraid of your partner or anyone else?\" There are several steps doctors should take when patients report potential IPV. First, clinicians should acknowledge the patient's admission of abuse: we advise thanking the patient for trusting the provider with the information and expressing concern about the patient's safety. Second, we sug - gest asking the patient if he or she would like to be connected to IPV advocacy services. If pa - tients do want legal assistance, counseling, shelter, or other ser - vices, local domestic violence agencies affiliated with the state coalition are likely to be the most reliable resources (see box). Third, clinicians should offer the pa - tient the National Domestic Vio - The New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm.org at BOSTON UNIVERSITY on January 9, 2013. For personal use only.

Fourth, clinicians should consider whether child protective services are re - quired. In many states, the abuse of one parent by another does not necessitate a report to child protective services, so it's up to the clinician to determine whether a report is warranted. Clinicians should consider inviting the pa - tient to make the report directly in order to increase the likelihood that staff members at child pro - tective services agencies will view the patient as able to maintain a safe household for the children. Fifth, they should screen the pa - tient for coexisting depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. And they should use caution when pre - scribing sedatives, since the se - dating action may diminish pa - tients' physical or mental ability to defend themselves or deesca - late tensions. When patients screen negative for IPV but the provider neverthe - less suspects that they're experi - encing abuse, it's important that the provider not force disclosure. It's not critical that the patient acknowledge IPV victimization in order to benefit from the screen - ing. Asking IPV-related questions signals to the patient that the provider is caring and concerned, trustworthy, and willing to dis - cuss the topic during a future visit. Moreover, simply being asked the questions may prompt the patient to reconsider privately whether his or her relationship is healthy. And of course providers need not receive a positive screening response in order to provide universal education about IPV. Even if a patient screens negative, we would encourage the provider to state that many pa - tients do experience IPV at some point and that there are many re - sources to help people who feel unsafe in their relationships. Handing palm cards with the na - tional hotline number to all pa - tients and encouraging them to take one for a friend if they wish, for example, may be an effective way of providing help to victims who don't feel comfortable dis - closing their situations. There are several ways in which providers can do unintentional harm to patients who are experi - encing IPV. Asking no questions about IPV may signal that the provider is not a potential re - source for the patient. But the manner in which IPV victimiza - tion is documented in patient records can have ramifications for child custody cases. Detailed information about best practices for IPV documentation is avail - able from the national organiza - tion Futures without Violence (see box). In addition, providers should refrain from telling patients who are experiencing IPV what they must do (e.g., \"you need to leave\"). Only trained experts in IPV advocacy are qualified to help victims determine their own best course to safety. There is a po - tential for lethal and injurious harm, particularly when one part - ner attempts to leave the rela - tionship. For this reason, actively ensuring that the link between the patient and an IPV advocacy agency is made successfully is the best practice. Finally, it's crit - ically important that providers respect the confidentiality of pa - tients who are experiencing IPV. Not only do victims face stigma and prejudice, but employers and insurers could potentially discrim - inate against them if their status became known. IPV is now recognized as a substantial public health problem. Health care providers can play a critical role in helping to reduce and prevent IPV by screening and referring patients to appropriate resources, familiarizing them - selves with best practices related to IPV documentation and victim response, and presenting them - selves as caring and trustworthy allies for their patients who are experiencing abuse. Research has established that health care-based screenings and interventions for IPV can benefit patients, 3 and the Affordable Care Act ensures that preventive care will include these screenings for women and ado -Intimate-Partner Violence \u2014 What Physicians Can Do Key Resources National Domestic Violence Hotline, www.thehotline.org/, 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

SHORT REPORT Open Access Patients 'perceptions of their \"most \"and \"least \" important medications: a retrospective cohort study Amy Linsky1,2,3,4,5*and Steven R Simon1,2,3,4,5 Abstract Background: Despite benefits of adherence, little is known about the degree to which patients will express their perceptions of medications as more or less important to take as prescribed. We determined the frequency withwhich Veteran patients would explicitly identify one of their medications as \"most important \"or \"least important. \" Findings: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients from ambulatory clinics at VA Boston from April 2010-July 2011. Patients answered two questions: \"Which one of your medicines, if any, do you think is the most important? (if none, please write 'none ')\"and \"Which one of your medicines, if any, do you think is the least important? (if none, please write 'none ').\"We determined the prevalence of response categories for each question. Our cohort of 104 patients was predominantly male (95%), with a mean of 9 medications (SD 5.7). Regarding their most important medication, 41 patients (39%) identified one specific medication; 26 (25%) selected more than one; 21 (20%) wrote \"none \"; and 16 (15%) did not answer the question. For their least important medication, 31 Veterans (30%) chose one specific medication; two (2%) chose more than one; 51 (49%) wrote \"none \"; and 20 (19%) did not directly answer the question. Conclusions: Thirty-five percent of patients did not identify a most important medication, and 68% did not identify a least important medication. Better understanding of how patients prioritize medications and how best to elicit this information will improve patient-provider communication, which may in turn lead to better adherence. Keywords: Communication, Adherence, Veterans, Quality of care, Patient safety Findings Background and objectives Medication adherence may improve clinical outcomes, but approximately half of all prescriptions are not taken as prescribed [1-3]. Patient medication-taking be-havior is influenced by many factors, including health lit- eracy, socioeconomic status, perceived medication necessity, future health concerns and whether the drugprovides symptom relief [4-6]. Further, patients 'beliefs about their medications are dynamic and can fluctuate with changes in symptoms, competing health- and non-health-related demands and trust in the health care pro- vider [5,7]. Patient non-adherence appears to imply that some degree of prioritization of medications is occurring, although not necessarily in an explicit manner. More-over, it is unclear to what degree patients will express their perceptions of medications as more or less import- ant to their treating health care provider and whetherclinicians concur with patients 'prioritization schemas. To begin to address these questions, we sought to deter- mine the frequency with which Veteran patients wouldexplicitly identify one of their medications as \"most important \"or \"least important, \"as well as to charac- terize the medications selected.

Patients were former mem- bers of the United States military who sought and wereeligible to receive care at the VA. Data were collected by fourth-year medical students, who were individually instructed on project processes as part of their Ambu-latory Medicine Quality Improvement rotation. One student per month was assigned to the rotation. Imme- diately prior to a student-led clinical encounter, patientswere given a printout of the electronic health record (EHR) listing of their medications and asked to answer two questions: \"Which one of your medicines, if any, do you think is the most important? (if none, please write 'none ')\"and \"Which one of your medicines, if any, do you think is the least important? (if none, please write'none ').\"If needed, the student assisted the Veterans by reading the questions or writing their responses. Because the data collection was intended as a quality improvement educational project, informed consent was not obtained. One of us (AL) entered all data into an Excel database, and we analyzed only the first chronolo-gic encounter for each Veteran. Patient responses were entered exactly as written. Specific medications identi- fied by patients were classified into medication classesusing VA Drug Class Codes. Other data extracted from the EHR included patient sex, age at visit and number of actively prescribed medications. Our two primary outcomes were patients 'responses to the \"most important \"and \"least important \"questions. Responses to each question were categorized as one offour types: 1) One specific medication -the patient identified one medication only; 2) More than one medi- cation -the patient reported more than one medication, chose medications to treat a diagnosis (e.g. \"heart meds \") or wrote \"all\"; 3) None -the patient wrote \"none \"; and 4) Did not answer the question -the patient left the response blank or wrote \"n/a, \"\"don 't know, \"\"uncertain \" or\"not sure. \" We determined the prevalence of each primary out- come. Frequency counts identified the medication classes involved for responses where specific medications were chosen. Finally, we used chi-square tests to assess for associations between patient factors and choosing one specific medication as most or least important. Allanalyses were performed with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc) or Excel (Microsoft). Statistical signifi- cance was set at alpha < 0.05. This study protocol wasapproved by the Institutional Review Board of the VA Boston Healthcare System. Results Our study cohort of 104 Veterans was predominantlymale (95%), and 59 (57%) were age 65 years or older (Table 1). Lists contained a mean of 9 medications(SD 5.7). Responding to the question about their most important medication, 41 patients (39%) identified onespecific medication; 26 (25%) selected more (20%) wrote \"none \"; and 16 (15%) did not answer the question (Table 2). Answering the question about theirleast important medication, 31 Veterans (30%) chose one specific medication; two (2%) chose more than one; 51 (49%) wrote \"none \"; and 20 (19%) did not directly answer the question (Table 2). There was no association between selecting one medi- cation as most or least important and any of the availablepatient factors (data not shown). The most commonly cited most important medication classes were beta block- ers (n = 8), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors(n = 7) and anticoagulants (n = 5). The most commonly cited least important medication classes were vitamins (n = 12), non-opioid analgesics (n = 4), antilipemicagents (n = 2) and antigout agents (n = 2). Full results of medications classes identified by patients as most important and least important are shown in Table 3.Table 1 Baseline characteristics (n=104) Patient characteristics n (%) Age 65 or older 59 (57) Male 99 (95)Total number of medications [mean (SD)] 9 (5.7) *Care may have occurred previously or concurrently with present care at VA Boston.

There are several possible reasons to explain this finding. Patients may not have understood the ques-tions, leading them to choose medications to treat a particular condition -therefore not selecting a single medication -or simply to leave the response blank. Limited health literacy, reflected as poor understand- ing of their health conditions or of their medications and associated indications, may have contributed to lowresponse rates [8-10]. Without full understanding of their medical problems, the potential consequences of untreated health conditions and the possible benefits and risks ofmedication for those conditions, some patients may have been unable to make an informed selection from their medication list. This notion highlights the importance ofeducation and knowledge in enabling patients to maintain an active role in their health care decisions. Another hypothesis for the observed pattern of responses is that the use of the word \"important \"may not accurately reflect the construct that we were attempting to measure. That is, patients may have per-ceived medications as important but may not have believed that they are of a necessity or benefit to their future health to warrant full adherence. Others havedemonstrated that perceived adverse effects of medica- tions often outweigh preventive benefits of medications [11]. Competing demands, such as financial or socialobligations, may further outweigh patient perceptions of importance. Psychometric testing of the best way to assess patient prioritization of medications withreliability and validity will improve measurement in future studies. Another possible explanation for our findings is that Veteran patients were in fact able to understand and identify a medication yet they were unwilling to share these beliefs with their providers. Patients discontinueprescriptions for a variety of reasons without inform- ing their healthcare provider of this decision [12]. Improving communication between patients and pro- viders can lead to better shared decision making and better adherence [2]. Our study results need to be interpreted in the context of several limitations.

How- ever, these answers still reflect what the patient per- ceived, and it is recognized that patient beliefs areassociated with medication adherence [4]. Additionally, explicit discussions may enable providers to better rec- oncile known conflicts between what they believe isclinically best and what the patient perceives as import- ant [13,14]. Finally, the training status of providers (i.e., medical students) theoretically could have influencedpatients 'willingness to divulge their prioritization. In this study population where the mean number of medications was nine, higher than most commonlyaccepted definitions of polypharmacy [15], a minority of patients were able to express a medication as least im- portant. Better understanding of how patients prioritizetheir medications and how best to elicit this information will improve patient-provider communication and per- haps lead to discontinuation of medications that boththe patient and the clinician feel have less importance.

Introduction An estimated 3.2 million persons are chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the U.S. Although the prevalence of HCV infection is estimated at 1.6% in the U.S. [1], urban clinic populations may have an HCV prevalence as high as 8% [2,3] . HCV infection causes approximately 40% of chronic liver disease [4] and the majority of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma [5], and we can expect that there will be up to a 4-fold increase in HCV-related deaths over the next 20 years [6-8] . Effective treatment is avail- able for HCV which can lead to long-term remission of disease and decreased liver-related mortality rates, but approximately 50% of patients are not aware that they are infected [9,10] . Although the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has recommended increased HCV test- ing [11] , optimal testing strategies \u00a9 2011 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana Ltd. All rights reserved. doi: 10.1016/j.dld.2011.12.014498 A.H. Litwin et al. / Digestive and Liver Disease 44 (2012) 497- 503 The aim of this analysis is to evaluate two interventions designed to increase HCV testing for patients at risk for HCV infection and disease. There are several potential screening strategies which may be used when designing HCV testing programs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other organizations have rec- ommended HCV testing for persons with an increased risk of infection such as persons who inject drugs [4,13,14] . Risk-based approaches to testing may be efcient, because patients with identied risks such as injection drug use have a much higher prevalence of HCV infection (60-90%) [15] than the general pop- ulation (1.6%) [1]. However, risk-based screening has been limited because primary care providers often do not ask patients about HCV risk factors, testing is rarely initiated based on physician-identied risks, and patients are often reticent to disclose stigmatized risk behaviors [16,17] . Another approach to HCV screening is to identify a group of patients at higher risk without asking about stigmatized risk behav- iors. Americans born between 1945-1964 are more likely to be HCV-infected than those in other age groups [1], and we have established at the three study clinics that HCV infection is nearly 4 times more likely in this high-prevalence birth cohort compared to patients outside of this birth cohort [3]. Approximately 76% of HCV- infected Americans were born between 1945-1964, and Americans born between 1945 and 1964 have a anti-HCV prevalence as high as 4.3% [1]. Therefore, another strategy is to test all patients born between 1945 and 1964. The Hepatitis C Assessment and Testing Project (HepCAT) was a prospective evaluation funded by CDC via AHRQ ACTION of two serial community-based interventions designed to increase rates of HCV testing of at-risk or high-prevalence patients in urban primary care clinics from rates seen during baseline testing (baseline period). The rst intervention (risk-based screener inter- vention) prompted physicians with a clinical reminder sticker in the progress note to ask whether a patient had specic HCV-related risks and to order HCV tests based on the presence of these risks. The second intervention (birth cohort intervention) prompted physi- cians with a clinical reminder sticker in the progress note to order HCV tests on all patients born within a high-prevalence birth cohort (1945-1964). We hypothesized that both interventions would be associated with an increase in testing of patients for HCV. 2. Methods 2.1. Study design The study was a serial cross-sectional evaluation of two community-based interventions. We evaluated HCV testing and positivity rates during a baseline and two subsequent intervention periods. We used electronic medical record (EMR) data to examine the associations of interventions with HCV testing rates overall and within at-risk sub-groups. 2.2. Study setting The study was conducted at three community-based primary care (family medicine or internal medicine) clinics afliated with Monteore Medical Center, a university-afliated teaching hospi- tal. The three participating primary care clinics are large, urban clinics located in the Bronx, New York. Each year, 54,000 adults attend over 150,000 primary care visits to the three clinics. Physi- cians were 153 internal medicine and family medicine physicians, both attendings and residents. The clinic sites are located in eco- nomically depressed areas of the Bronx and serve patients with high rates of poverty and substance use. Reported prevalence ofHCV infection is higher in New York City than the national esti- mate and the Bronx has a higher prevalence than NYC as a whole [18,19] . 2.3. Study population We examined data on all adult patients (at least 18 years of age) who had a primary care visit to one of three clinics during at least one of the three study periods. The three study periods included the baseline period (January 1, 2008-February 28, 2008), risk- based screener intervention period (November 24, 2008-March 6, 2008), and birth cohort intervention period (March 9, 2009-June 30, 2009). We excluded patients who had been previously tested for HCV at Monteore Medical Center. 2.4. Description of the interventions 2.4.1. Components common to both interventions Both the risk-based screener and birth cohort interven- tions included: (1) on-site educational sessions for primary care providers (PCPs) and staff - delivered prior to and during inter- ventions; (2) regular communication between the research team and clinical leadership (by phone or email); and (3) environmental reminders (HepCAT buttons, pocket cards, and posters). In addi- tion, project staff visited each clinic twice-weekly to place stickers on all progress notes, encourage adherence to screening protocols, and elicit feedback from clinic staff. 2.4.2. Risk-based screener intervention The screener intervention included a risk-based screener sticker which was placed on top of each progress note (Supplementary Fig. S1). The screener prompted the physician to ask the patient nine questions related to HCV risk: behavioral risk factors (ever injected or snorted any drug); risk group associations (ever incarcerated or ever homeless); medical risk factors (transfusion or organ trans- plant before 1992, told by physician that patient had liver disease, long-term hemodialysis), and other risk factors (maternal hepati- tis C). In addition, the physician was asked to indicate whether patients ever had an elevated ALT (dened as female 20 IU/L or male 31 IU/L) [20] . These risks were chosen based on CDC HCV testing recommendations, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines and other associations reported in the literature [13,14,21] . Physicians were asked to complete the sticker at every patient visit unless previously completed, and to order an HCV antibody test if any risk was identied. Patients who were already HCV antibody positive or who had been tested within the last 12 months were not asked to be tested. Spanish trans- lations of the sticker were available in every medical ofce, and laminated versions were placed in each provider's mailbox. PCPs were supplied with a script (English and Spanish) to help standard- ize and normalize the introduction of the screening questions. This phase was conducted from November 24, 2008 to March 6, 2009 (15 weeks). 2.4.3. Birth cohort intervention During the birth cohort intervention, a birth cohort reminder sticker was placed on top of each progress note (Supplementary Fig. S2). The birth cohort reminder prompted PCPs to order HCV antibody tests for all patients born between 1945 and 1964 regard- less of any other identied risk. The risk-based screener sticker was no longer placed on top of progress notes. Spanish translations of the birth cohort sticker and provider scripts (in both English and Spanish) were available in every provider ofce. This phase was conducted from March 9, 2009 to June 30, 2009 (16 weeks).A.H. Litwin et al. / Digestive and Liver Disease 44 (2012) 497- 503 499 Table 1 Characteristics of study populations.

Data extraction We extracted demographic and clinical information dating back to March 1997, the year electronic records became avail- able, including inpatient and outpatient ICD-9 diagnosis codes and laboratory testing results. The Institutional Review Boards of Boston University Medical Center and Monteore Medical Center approved this study. 2.6. Outcome variables In these analyses, we included only patients not previously tested for HCV. Patients were considered not to be previously tested for HCV if there was no HCV antibody test result in the EMR dating back to March 1997. The primary outcome was HCV antibody test- ing during each intervention period, and we also examined rates of HCV antibody positivity. HCV antibody testing was dened as an anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) by ELISA performed either on the same date of the primary care visit or within 3 months of the initial primary care visit within the baseline or intervention periods. HCV antibody positivity (indicating past or current HCV infection) was dened as a positive anti-HCV test performed during that specied time period. 2.7. Other variables We included the following sociodemographic variables. Age was dichotomized as within the high prevalence birth cohort (born between 1945 and 1964) vs. not within the cohort. Insurance status was categorized based on primary insurance: Medicare, Medicaid, Commercial, and Self/Uninsured. Race/ethnicity was collapsed into four categories: non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black or African American, Latino or Hispanic, and other/unknown. For at-risk sub-group analysis, we examined the variables below which were dened with ICD-9 codes and/or laboratory values. ICD-9 codes were classied using the Healthcare Cost and Utili- sation Project of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qualitysystem [22] . Although a history of blood transfusion or organ trans- plant before 1992 is a known risk factor for HCV infection, the EMR did not have data on these risks, so the analysis does not include them. The following conditions were considered present if recorded at any time from March 1997 through the qualifying visit date. Substance abuse. ICD-9 code for substance abuse/dependence or positive urine toxicology for amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, or methadone. HIV. ICD-9 code for HIV infection or a positive antibody test conrmed by Western blot. Sexually transmitted disease (STD). ICD-9 code indicating gonor- rhea or chlamydia or chlamydia PCR Alcohol abuse. ICD-9 code for alcohol abuse/dependence or alcohol-related liver disease, or a serum alcohol level 80 mg/dL. HBV infection : positive serological test for anti-HBc. Cirrhosis. code for cirrhosis. End stage renal disease (ESRD). ICD-9 code for end-stage renal disease or procedure code for hemodialysis. Psychiatric disease. ICD-9 code for affective disorder, anxiety dis- order, schizophrenia, or psychosis. ALT elevation. The highest ALT value reported from March 1997 through the clinic visit date for each subject was used. Elevated ALT was treated as a dichotomous variable and dened in two different ways: (1) >40 U/L (40 U/L is a commonly used upper limit of normal for all adults) [23] and (2) >19 U/L for females and >30 U/L for males (updated upper limits of normal) [20] . Any HCV risk. Any HCV risk was dened as having at least one of the following risks as dened above: substance abuse; HIV; STD; (>40). 2.8. Statistical analysis 2.8.1. Proportion tested Chi square and ANOVA tests were used to examine differences in demographic and clinical characteristics among the baseline period, risk-based screener period, and birth cohort period.500 A.H. Litwin et al. / Digestive and Liver Disease 44 (2012) 497- 503 In each of the three periods, we determined the proportion of patients tested for anti-HCV. The proportions tested were calculated for predened age categories and demographic char- acteristics, presence or absence of at-risk sub-groups, and the presence or absence of ALT elevation. 2.8.2. Comparison of intervention HCV testing rates with baseline testing rates We compared the rates of HCV testing in the risk-based screener and birth cohort intervention periods with the baseline testing period, overall and within multiple subgroups by using chi square tests. We examined the odds of HCV testing for the risk-based screener and birth cohort intervention periods as compared with the baseline period, overall and within multiple subgroups using simple logistic regression models. To compare odds of HCV testing in each intervention period with the baseline period, we con- structed multivariate models to adjust for age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, substance use, alcohol abuse, HIV, STDs, cirrhosis, psychiatric diagnosis, and elevated ALT. To assess the influence of cross-contamination across periods, we performed multiple sensi- tivity analyses excluding patients who appeared in more than one period, and including only patients seen in more than one period, as well as all three periods. STATA/IC software, version 10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) was used for all data management and statistical analysis. 3. Results 3.1. Study population The baseline cohort (n = 6591), the risk screener cohort (n = 8981), and the birth cohort (n = 10,165) included all adult patients (at least 18 years of age) who had not been tested for anti- HCV in the past (since 1997), and who made at least one primary care visit during the baseline, risk screener intervention, or birth cohort intervention periods respectively. Demographic and clinical information for the overall study pop- ulation are summarized in Table 1. The mean age was 47.8 years (SD = 17.7). The population was primarily female (74.4%), Latino (52.4%) or African American (30.4%), and Medicaid-insured (51.7%). Overall, 15.1% had a history of psychiatric disease, 3.3% had a his- tory of substance abuse, and 1.9% had a history of HIV. The baseline period, risk-based screener period, and birth cohort period were similar with regard to most demographics and risks; slight differ- ences were observed in rates of Latino patients, insurance status, HIV, STDs, and patients with psychiatric diagnoses. 3.2. HCV testing rates in each intervention period Both intervention periods (Table 2) were associated with an increased proportion of patients tested for HCV from 6.0% at base- line to 13.1% in the risk screener phase (P < 0.001) and 9.9% in the birth cohort phase (P < 0.001). After adjustment, both interven- tions were associated with signicantly increased odds of testing aOR 2.37 1.70 (95% CI 1.50-1.92) for the birth-cohort period. To assess the influence of cross-contamination across periods, we performed sensitivity analyses excluding patients who appeared in more than one phase, and including only patients seen in more than one phase, as well as all three phases. In each sensitivity analysis, the results were similar to the primary analysis. When the analysis was stratied by clinic, each clinic experi- enced a signicant increase in the rate of HCV testing. In the clinic with the lowest baseline rate of testing, HCV testing increased almost four fold during the risk-based screener period (2.9% versus Fig. 1. Risk-based screener versus baseline forest plot. 11.3%, P < 0.001) and three fold during the birth cohort period (2.9% versus 8.7%, P < 0.001). 3.3. Sub-group analysis 3.3.1. Risk-based screener intervention Rates of anti-HCV screening increased in the following sub- groups: patients with at least one risk (5.0-12.7%, P < 0.001), elevated ALT (5.7-14.1%, P < 0.001), infection (1.6-8.5%, birth cohort P < 0.001), sub- stance abuse or dependence (17.3-25.0%, P = 0.04), alcohol abuse or dependence (9.7-22.8%, P = 0.02), and psychiatric diagnosis (4.6-12.7%, P < 0.001). Rates of HCV testing signicantly increased in all racial/ethnic groups and insurance sub-groups. There were signicant increased adjusted odds of HCV testing in almost all sub-groups (Fig. 1). 3.3.2. Birth cohort intervention Rates of anti-HCV screening increased in the following sub- groups: patients with at least one risk (5.0-7.8%, P < 0.001), elevated ALT (5.7-8.1%, P = 0.02), previous HBV infection or vaccination (1.6-5.2%, P = 0.02), 1945-1964 birth cohort (5.4-13.2%, P < 0.001), and psychiatric diagnosis (4.6-8.7%, P < 0.001). Rates of HCV testing signicantly increased in all racial and ethnic groups except Whites and in all insurance groups except those who were self-insured. There were signicant increased adjusted odds of HCV testing in almost all sub-groups (Fig. 2). 3.4. Yield of HCV testing in each phase Both interventions were associated with rates of anti-HCV- positivity that were more than three times the national prevalence of 1.6% [1]. The rate of anti-HCV-positivity was 5.3% in the risk-based screener period and 5.8% in the birth cohort period. Overall, 36 new anti-HCV+ patients (0.5% of all previously untested patients) were identied during the baseline period, 62 (0.7% of all previously untested patients) during the risk-based screener inter- vention period, and 59 (0.6% of all previously untested patients) during the birth cohort period, but the differences were not statis- tically signicant.A.H.

Fig. 2. Birth-cohort screener versus baseline forest plot.4. Discussion We demonstrated that implementation of a clinical reminder sticker as the backbone of a multi-component intervention was associated with a signicant increase of anti-HCV testing for a pop- ulation of at-risk and high prevalence patients in three large urban primary care clinics. Both the risk-based screener and birth cohort interventions were associated with signicantly increased rates of HCV testing overall, and among those with HCV-related risks. In the clinic with the lowest rate of baseline testing, there was a four- fold increase in rates of HCV testing with the risk-based screener strategy and a three-fold increase in testing with the birth cohort strategy. Both interventions were associated with a considerable yield of testing (over 5% HCV-positivity). Several recent studies have demonstrated that risk-based HCV testing can identify most HCV-positive patients through asking about specic risks, but only one study, by Zuniga et al., was integrated within routine patient care (in Veterans Health Admin- istration setting where HCV testing was mandated by a change in federal policy), and none were designed to demonstrate an increase of HCV testing in high-risk patients compared with baseline test- ing practises [1,2,24] . There are several studies which demonstrate interventions that increase HIV testing in real-world settings. An integrated package of quality improvement interventions utiliz- ing decision support (a real-time, electronic clinical reminder to502 A.H. Litwin et al. / Digestive and Liver Disease 44 (2012) 497- 503 identify patients at increased risk of HIV infection), academic detail- ing and audit feedback resulted in a doubling of HIV testing for a population of at-risk individuals who had not been previously tested at two large Veterans Health Administration health care systems [25] . Similarly, our risk-based screener intervention led to a more than doubling of anti-HCV testing in individuals with identied risks who had not been previously tested. Identication of patients who have been infected with hepati- tis C is the rst step toward increasing the number of patients who initiate HCV treatment. Patients who achieve a sustained viral response (SVR) with therapy will have long-term remission of disease, and liver-related mortality rates comparable to the gen- eral population [26-28] . In patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, regression of cirrhosis may occur in patients who are treated, and regression is associated with decreased disease-related morbidity and improved survival [27] . Identication of HCV-infected patients is urgently needed as the prevalence of hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma has increased over the past ten years, and will continue to increase through the next decade [28,29] . At the current low rates of treatment, only 14.5% of the projected 259,000 HCV-related deaths between 2002 and 2030 will be pre- vented [9,30-32] . Based on the estimates of Volk et al., if treatment rates were increased to 75% and new treatment options including direct-acting antiviral medications achieve SVR 75% of the time, we can expect that over half of liver-related deaths could be avoided [9,33-36] . Our study had several strengths. First, by utilizing the EMR to dene subgroups of patients with HCV-related risks, we were able to test the associated outcomes of a clinic-wide intervention on the entire patient population visiting the clinic during a specied period of time. Second, we found that incorporating these inter- ventions was effective even in clinics where physicians already demonstrated high rates of testing at baseline [3]. Lastly, our study may be generalizable to many other real-world settings in that our interventions did not require extensive technology and were not integrated within the electronic medical record [37] . There were several limitations to our study. First, because the overall duration of both interventions was only 31 weeks, it is unclear if either intervention is sustainable. Next, because we did not utilize a contemporaneous comparison group, we were not able to establish a causal link between the interventions and the increased HCV testing observed. Our ndings may not be generaliz- able to clinical settings outside of urban settings such as suburban private practice environments. Lastly, the study was powered to evaluate for change in HCV testing, not HCV testing yield, so we were unable to examine for differences in yield between the study periods. Future directions Future studies could investigate the effect of combining our strategies by adding the birth cohort question to the risk-based screener. Risk-based screening will allow identication of younger patients who are less likely to have comorbidities and contraindi- cations to HCV treatment, and have a better chance of SVR. Conversely, birth cohort screening will allow identication of older patients who are more likely to urgently need antiviral treatment to prevent decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. Future studies should focus on the sustainability of HCV test- ing strategies, as adherence to our risk-based screener decreased over time, and risk-based screening may be less sustainable in a busy primary care practice than a birth cohort strategy [38] . The national strategy for HIV testing moved from risk-based to univer- sal testing to increase timely identication of HIV-infected patients, and to reduce stigma [39,40] . Similarly, a universal testing strategyfor HCV testing involving a birth cohort strategy will likely increase timely identication of HCV-infected patients and reduce stigma. We must also investigate the potential important downstream ben- ets of HCV testing programs (vaccinations; reduction in alcohol use; antiviral treatment; and reductions in HCV-related morbidity and mortality) [9,41,42] . In summary, we have found that two simple clinical reminder interventions were associated with signicantly increased HCV testing rates when compared with pre-intervention testing rates. Identication is the rst step to facilitate treatment of chronic hepatitis C, and possibly prevent HCV-related morbidity and mor- tality. To respond to the Institute of Medicine's report calling for increasing HCV testing in high-risk populations [11] , HCV screen- ing programs using either a risk-based or birth cohort strategy should become integrated within primary care settings so that we may realize the potentially life-saving benets of treatment, and move actively toward eradication of HCV infection in the United States.

Keywords Thrombosis /C1Antithrombotic /C1 Guidelines /C1Clinical research Introduction Venous and arterial thrombosis cause more than 50% of deaths in the developed world ( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ fastats/deaths.htm ). Anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs are the main tools used by physicians to prevent the for-mation of pathologic clots. During the rst decade of the 21 stcentury, dozens of clinical trials have been undertaken to evaluate promising new antithrombotic agents that offerthe possibility of simpler treatment with either better ef- cacy, reduced toxicity, or both. The Fourth International Symposium of Thrombosis and Anticoagulation was held in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, from October 20-21, 2011; this congress offered its attendees the rare opportunity to network with each other whilehearing about cutting-edge clinical research and discussing its implications for clinical practice with internationally recognized experts. This scientic program was developedfor practicing clinicians in multiple specialties, and the meeting was endorsed by three major clinical research institutes: the Brazilian Clinical Research Institute, theDuke Clinical Research Institute of the Duke University School of Medicine, and Hospital do Corac \u00b8ao Research Institute. It was also supported by the Brazilian Societies ofInternal Medicine, Cardiology, Intensive Care Medicine, and Vascular Surgery, by the Latin American Group of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, and by the AnticoagulationForum from the United States. The chairmen of the meeting were Dr. Renato D. Lopes and Dr. Richard C. Becker, both from Duke University School of Medicineand the Duke Clinical Research Institute, and Dr. David Garcia from the University of New Mexico. After reading this summary of the symposium pro- ceedings, we are condent the reader will agree that the symposium met its main goal: to educate, motivate, and inspire internists, cardiologists, hematologists, and otherphysicians to thoughtfully apply the best available evi- dence to the care of their patients with (or at risk for) thrombotic disease. Platelet biology Platelets are small cellular fragments devoid of a nucleus, derived from the megakaryocytes, with diameters rangingfrom 1.5 to 3.0 lm. In steady state, platelets assume a discoidshape that completely changes during activation. The half- life of platelets in circulation is approximately 8-12 days. Platelets contain large deposits of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP); thus, they have ahigh capacity for energy metabolism that is similar to that of smooth muscle cells. However, because platelets are devoid of a nucleus, they have limited ability for protein synthesis. The main function of platelets is to ensure primary hemostasis. However, in several clinical scenarios (such as acute and chronic coronary syndromes and cerebrovascular diseases), platelets play a negative role and are considered the main elements responsible for the physiopathology ofthese serious diseases. The platelet membrane is composed of proteins, carbo- hydrates, and lipids. Lipids represent 35% of the membranecomposition and are anti-symmetrically arranged when the platelets are in steady state (not activated), with the nega- tively charged phospholipids arranged in the internal por-tion of the membrane. The external surface of the membrane is rich in receptors, among which are the gly- coprotein complex (GP) Ib/V/IX that preferably binds vonWillebrand factor (vWF); GP VI that strongly binds col- lagen; and GP IIb/IIIa that binds brinogen, allowing platelet aggregation. Also in the platelet membrane, pro-teins such as the p-selectin are expressed. These work as chemo-attractants for leukocytes. Cytoplasmic organelles are also very important for platelet function. These include dense peroxisomes (responsible for lipid metabolism), mitochondria (oxidative metabolism), lysosomes (only released in response to verypowerful stimulations; able to cause local injury), and dense granules and alpha granules. Dense granules contain calcium at high concentrations, as well as ADP, ATP, andserotonin. Alpha granules contain great variety of sub- stances with pro-coagulant, mitogenic, and inflammatory functions (e.g., vWF, brinogen, cytokines, and plateletfactor 4). The release of these granules varies according to platelet stimulation. The platelet cytoskeleton is essentially undone and remodeled during platelet activation, changing from a discoid to a spherical shape. Also during platelet activation, phyllopods are formed. Contraction of the cytoskeletoncontraction is one of the basic steps of platelet activation that allows secretion of dense and alpha granules. Platelet function can be categorized into three actions: adhesion, activation, and aggregation. An initial trigger for platelet adhesion is vascular injury, with exposure of the subendothelial content (vWF and collagen). This vascularinjury can be spontaneous or iatrogenic (e.g., during per- cutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]). Once vWF and collagen are exposed in the circulation, platelets initiateadhesion, through binding of the GP Ib/V/IX receptor to vWF and GP VI to collagen.144 R. D. Lopes et al. 123The degree of platelet activation depends on several vascular injury characteristics, such as: depth of the injury, vessel site, hematocrit level, flow speed at the site con- cerned, and vessel diameter. The activation process isinitiated right after adhesion, and both continue to occur simultaneously. Four steps are fundamental during activa- tion: mobilization of intracellular calcium (which works asthe most powerful second messenger within the platelet); cytoskeleton contraction (with change in platelet shape); secretion of alpha and dense granules (with release of platelet agonists with autocrine and paracrine action; thus, enhancing the activation signal); and exposure of nega-tively charged phospholipids in the external portion of the membrane (with consequent activation of coagulation cascade and thrombin generation). The more thromboxane (acts on P2Y P2Y 12 receptors), which stimulates more stable activation; thrombin (acts on PAR 1 and 4 receptors), which primarily stimulates activation in pathological conditions and isconsidered the most powerful agonist; and collagen (GP Ib and GP VI), which stimulates activation. Platelet aggregation is considered the nal step in platelet response to injury and involves the conformational change of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, which moves from a low-afnity steady state to a high-afnity activated state.The activated GP IIb/IIIa receptor binds brinogen, form- ing platelet-brinogen-platelet aggregates and a stable platelet plug. Platelets interact directly with the coagulation system in many ways. The interaction can be physical, such as through exposure of negatively charged phospholipids onthe external surface of the membrane, or chemical, through release of pro-coagulant granules. Platelets also interact similarly with inflammatory cells through exposure ofp-selectin, leading to recruitment of leukocytes and exposure of the CD40 receptor from the surface of macrophages. In short, platelets are important structures responsible for primary hemostasis, but play a negative role in several clinical scenarios. Platelet biology is very complex becauseplatelets have to interact with other systems, including the coagulation cascade . Measures of platelet function: are we ready to use them? In the treatment of coronary disease, inhibition of platelet activation and aggregation is critical to the prevention ofcardiovascular atherothrombotic outcomes. Clopidogrel, aP 2 Y 12receptor antagonist, improves outcomes amongpatients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and after PCI. However, clopidogrel is a biologically inactive pro- drug that requires several steps of metabolism for active effect. In part because of these activation steps, substantialinter-individual variability in pharmacodynamic response has been previously observed. Individual variation in response to antiplatelet therapies is in part predicated onintrinsic factors (such as genetic polymorphisms affecting absorption and/or metabolism of drug) and in part related to clinical factors such as patient non-compliance with therapies or drug-drug interactions. There are several methods for assessment of platelet response to therapy. The current gold standard is light transmission platelet aggregometry, which involves intro- duction of a platelet light-basedassay that ultimately assesses platelet aggregation. The requirement for high technical expertise, as well as sub- stantial processing times to generate platelet-rich plasma,render this assay an unwieldy tool for clinical use. Point- of-care aggregation tests involving whole blood samples\u2014 such as the VerifyNow assay\u2014employ the same principlesin a cartridge-based fashion and have been validated against the gold standard. The vasodilator activated phos- phorylation VASP are observed with superior inhibition of the P2Y 12receptor by agents such as clopidogrel. Yet, like light transmission aggregometry, this is a tool largely used for research purposes due to its technically demanding laboratory processes. Anotherplatelet function testing modality, the multi-plate assay, examines the degree of platelet adhesion aggregation on the sensors' surface by quantifying electrical resistancebetween the two central wires. All of the above platelet function testing modalities have been shown to correlate with reactivity unit levels [235 cardiovascular (MI), and stent thrombosis. The DoPlatelet Function Assays Predict Clinical Outcomes in Clopidogrel-Pretreated Patients Undergoing Elective PCI study compared VerifyNow to traditional light transmis-sion aggregometry and noted good correlation between these two tests in their ability to discriminate future thrombovascular outcomes. For VASP phosphorylation,low post-treatment response dened as with future risk cardiovas- cular events. Similarly for the multi-plate assay, lowresponders were associated with a higher incidence of stent thrombosis. The role of platelet function testing in tailoring therapy for individual patients remains to be elucidated. The multicenter Gauging Responsiveness With A VerifyNowIV International Symposium 145 123Assay\u2014Impact on Thrombosis and Safety (GRAVITAS) trial focused on patients who had residual high-on treatment platelet reactivity measured by VerifyNow testing to standard-dose clopidogrel (75 mgdaily) versus higher-dose (150 mg daily). Unfortunately, no differences in clinical outcomes were noted between groups, which may in part be attributed to persistently high plateletreactivity even among the higher-dose group. While this study examined the impact of dose doubling, we look to studies such as the Double Randomization of a Monitoring Adjusted Antiplatelet Treatment Versus a Common Anti- platelet Treatment for DES Implantation, and a InterruptionVersus Continuation of Double Antiplatelet Therapy (ARCTIC) trial, which will examine the role of tailored therapy using alternative agents, such as prasugrel or ti-cagrelor, that have been shown to provide more potent and consistent inhibition of platelet function. One important question that has been raised is: what is the appropriate timing of platelet function testing? In a study by Campo et al., PCI patients had serial measure- ments at baseline and at one month. Among patients whowere full responders at baseline, 4% became poor responders by 30 days; in contrast, among patients who were poor responders at baseline, 70% became fullresponders by one month. Further, patients who were poor responders both at baseline and at one month and those who were full responders at baseline but became poorresponders at one month had worse ischemic outcomes by one year. These results suggest that the 30-day time point may be a more relevant time to test. Another question is whether platelet function testing can be used to dene a therapeutic window for antiplatelet therapies similar to the international normalized ratio(INR) for warfarin therapy. To date, the ability of existing platelet function tests to predict bleeding outcomes is limited. One modestly positive study by Sibbing et al.showed that bleeding was associated with an area under the curve B188 using multi-plate technology. In summary, several testing modalities are currently available to assess on-treatment platelet response to anti- platelet therapies. While these tests provide important prognostic information for ischemic events, their potentialfor bleeding prediction appears limited. Platelet function testing may someday be helpful for therapeutic selection; however, further evidence is necessary. Vitamin K antagonists: is this the beginning of the end? For centuries, thrombosis has been recognized as a major pathological nding in many signicant and often fatal clinical conditions. Parenteral anticoagulants, specicallyunpuried heparin, led the way in the pharmacological treatment of thromboembolic diseases. Its main drawback was that it was not available for oral use. Shortly after, there came the anti-vitamin K oral anticoagulants\u2014dicu-marol and warfarin\u2014which have been used widely since the 1950s for treatment and prevention of thromboembolic diseases, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and (PE), and prevention cardiac valves, and ventricular thrombi. Use of vitamin K antagonists was, from the very beginning, recognized as troublesome due to the verynarrow therapeutic range of anticoagulation, which led to lack of protection when suboptimal and to hemorrhagic events when in excess of prescribed limits. Furthermore,many natural nutrients and medicines can interfere with the pharmacological action of vitamin K antagonists, requiring frequent monitoring of the anticoagulant status via repeatedmeasurements of the prothrombin time. The INR (a stan- dardized reporting method) must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range to maximize the benet of war-farin. Several observational studies and well-controlled trials have documented the challenges of long-term war- farin use. Among observational studies, the percent time intherapeutic range has ranged only from 50 to 55% and, in the controlled trials, from 58 to 65%. All of these difculties probably explain the under-use of oral vitamin K anticoagulants worldwide. The recent development of new oral anticoagulants with better phar- macological proles and easier use has raised hopes that, inthe near future, vitamin K antagonists will be replaced, assuming that the newer agents prove as successful in long- term surveillance as they have been demonstrated to be inrelatively short-term trials. New anticoagulants and new hematologic dilemmas The development of novel anticoagulant medications has become a high priority for pharmaceutical companies. Enthusiasm for novel agents has resulted from the obser- vation that about 50% of the population of the westernworld dies from either heart attack or stroke and that mil- lions of people have AF, many of whom are inadequately treated using current oral anticoagulants. Additionally, ourcurrent armamentarium of anticoagulants (consisting pre- dominantly of heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH], oral vitamin K antagonists, and a selection ofrelatively infrequently used newer agents such as fonda- parinux, hirudin, argatroban, and bivalirudin) are often perceived to be ''old'' and may have signicant limitationsthat restrict their use. With the exception of the oral vita- min K antagonists, all of these medications are parenteral,146 R. D. Lopes et al. 123and many are expensive. Oral vitamin K antagonists are highly effective but have a slow onset and offset of action, large between-person variability in their dose requirements, are subject to food and drug interactions, and are complexto reverse. Despite these drawbacks, the oral vitamin K antagonists have been proven to reduce thromboembolism in a wide variety of settings, including patients with AF,mechanical heart valves, MI, and after orthopedic surgery. They are also effective for the secondary prevention of DVT, PE, and MI. The ''ideal'' anticoagulant would be orally administered, have a rapid onset and offset of action, predictable phar-macokinetics and pharmacodynamics, a low propensity for food and drug interactions, be administered in xed doses, be ''reversible'' in cases of bleeding, have a wide thera-peutic window, and not require routine monitoring, but have a form of monitoring available should it be required. Oral vitamin K antagonists do not possess many of thesecharacteristics. Recent developments in the eld of anticoagulants leave us at a crossroads; many clinicians are considering whetherit is time to abandon the oral vitamin K antagonists. The rationale for reducing or eliminating use of oral vitamin K antagonists include eliminating the need for monitoring,having less variability in the dosing of the oral anticoag- ulant, and potentially reducing bleeding. However, elimi- nating oral vitamin K antagonists will be difcult. In somesettings, they are the only proven therapy (e.g., patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or those with mechanical heart valves). Additionally, oral vitamin Kantagonists are inexpensive, they have 100% brand rec- ognition internationally (thereby reducing the likelihood of medication errors), and the ability to monitor these drugsimproves compliance. Finally, oral vitamin K antagonists can be rapidly reversed. The development of novel anticoagulant medications has been facilitated by a comprehensive analysis of the coagulation cascade. Coagulation is initiated at sites of vascular injury when tissue factor binds with circulatingactivated factor VIIa. This complex converts factor X to factor Xa and factor IX to factor IXa. Factor Xa then acts in concert with factor Va to convert prothrombin to thrombin.Thrombin is the ''engine'' of coagulation. It converts brinogen to brin, facilitates a positive feedback loop leading to activation of coagulation, activates factor XIII,which cross-links brin stabilizing the clot, and has a number of other important roles in coagulation. A clear understanding of the coagulation cascade has allowed the development of highly specic inhibitors of coagulation. Initially, these agents were developed using recombinant DNA technology modeled after naturallyoccurring anticoagulants. Perhaps the best example of this is the development of the hirudins, modeled after theanticoagulant present in the saliva of the medicinal leech. More recently, knowledge of the structure of the coagula- tion enzymes has allowed the development of molecules using computer-assisted design. These molecules are oflow molecular weight, can be made orally bioavailable, and when carefully designed are highly specic to their enzyme target. Development of these agents has revolutionized theapproach to anticoagulation. Polypeptide drugs tested as inhibitors of riva- roxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran. Additional agents are under development. In general, polypeptide drugs are falling out of favor, except for their use in acute situations such as ACS or in unstable patients with extensive thromboembolic disease.These drugs are used less and less frequently because of their high cost and need for parenteral administration. Furthermore, the effectiveness of many of these drugs hasrecently been questioned. For example, recombinant acti- vated protein C was recently withdrawn from the worldwide market ( http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories- avis/_2011/2011_142-eng.php , accessed November 14, 2011). Some of these drugs (e.g., rNAPC2) are being studied for other indications, such as the treatment or prevention ofcancer. Recent research has focused on inhibition of factor Xa or thrombin, given their seminal roles in coagulation.Rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are all highly active, orally bioavailable inhibitors of coagulation. Each has been extensively tested in diverse clinical situations, and eachholds promise as a therapy for the prevention and treatment of both venous and arterial thrombosis. Dabigatran is it hasreduced bioavailability, it has demonstrated its effective- ness as an agent for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis. Novel agents should not be regarded as a panacea; although they address many of the perceived concerns with novel anticoagulants, they have their own limitations.These include cost, a lack of familiarity among the medical community (leading to the likelihood of medical error), a much less broad set of indications (given their developmentin a more restrictive regulatory environment), and a lack of antidotes or reversibility. Although there has been early work on the development of specic antidotes for both thedirect Xa inhibitors and dabigatran, none of these agents has reached even early-phase clinical trials in patients with active bleeding. Given the excitement surrounding novel anticoagulant medications, it is very likely that a great deal more researchIV International Symposium 147 123describing their utility and toxicities will be undertaken in the coming years. Antiplatelet agents under development The evolution of antiplatelet therapy over the past decade has witnessed clear advances, with the development of increasingly potent and response-consistent P2Y 12receptor antagonists, including prasugrel, and more recently ticagrelor, a non-thienopyridine agent that may offer benet through prolonged inhibition of adenosine re-uptakeby erythrocytes. A wealth of information from phase three clinical trials highlights the broad potential of new-gener- ation antiplatelet agents but also underscores the impor-tance of patient selection, aspirin dosing, and uncommon yet potentially life-threatening hemorrhagic complications involving the gastrointestinal tract and brain. These adverseevents serve as a reminder that platelets play an important role in hemostasis and the maintenance of vascular integ- rity, including the blood-brain barrier. Future investigations will likely focus on strategies and technologies to optimize patient-centered therapies and platelet antagonists that attenuate potential reparative capacity. Anticoagulation in ACS patients managed invasively: a time for change or a time of choice? Earlier studies demonstrated that the use of enoxaparin in non-ST-segment elevation ACSs (NSTE ACS) patients managed conservatively reduced the rates of death or MIby approximately 20% both at 8 and 42 days compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH). More recent studies, however, indicated that an invasive strategy with earlycatheterization and angioplasty was associated with improved outcomes compared with a conservative approach. When enoxaparin was compared with UFH inthe setting of an early invasive strategy, similar efcacy outcomes, regardless of anticoagulation therapy, were seen. In contrast, patients treated with enoxaparin had a signi-cant 30% increase in severe bleeding as evaluated by the TIMI scale. Recently, a great deal of evidence has suggested that bleeding is a major determinant of clinical outcomes in ACS patients. Both moderate and important bleeding are associated with worse outcomes after adjustment forpotential confounders. In a pooled analysis of 26,452 patients with ACS, severe bleeding increased more than ve times the odds of 30-day mortality or MI. Drugs recently developed, such as factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors, have an improved safetyprole. In the Fifth Organization to Assess Strategies in Acute Ischemic Syndromes (OASIS-5) trial, the indirect Xa inhibitor fondaparinux reduced major and minor bleeding by more than 50% in NSTE ACS patients. Thisresulted in a signicant 11% reduction in mortality at six months. Similarly, the thrombin blocker bivalirudin reduced severe bleeding by almost 40% in ST-segmentelevation MI patients, leading to a 30% reduction in all- cause mortality. This benet extended to three years of follow-up. The results of these trials indicate that safer anticoagulant drugs with similar efcacy proles are currently availableand that new treatment combinations may reduce mortality. Therefore, it is a time for change to the newer agents in ACS. At this point, it is very important that the guidelines andfuture studies focus on these new therapeutic options; cli- nicians can benet from more evidence when choosing the best clinical setting for each particular agent. Oral anticoagulants after ACS Current guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy after ACS, but the risk of recurrent ischemic eventsremains elevated in these patients. Meta-analyses of clini- cal trials on the addition of warfarin to aspirin after ACS indicate that this intervention is associated with a reducedrate of ischemic events at the cost of increased risk of major bleeding. Moreover, warfarin therapy requires fre- quent monitoring and is also associated with food and druginteractions. With the development of oral agents that directly inhibit thrombin or drugs that are direct inhibitors of factor Xa, a new opportunity for secondary preventionafter ACS has emerged. These agents have predictable dose-dependent pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and, therefore, do not require frequent monitoring. Somehave also been shown to be effective and safe in the management of AF. Dabigatran, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, was compared with placebo on top of dualantiplatelet therapy in the Reduction by Dutasteride of Clinical Progression Events in Expectant Management (REDEEM) phase two trial in 1861 patients. The admin-istration of newly developed direct factor Xa inhibitors on a background of single or dual antiplatelet therapy has also been evaluated by phase two trials. In the Rivaroxaban inCombination With Aspirin Alone or With Aspirin and a Thienopyridine in Patients With ACSs (ATLAS ACS TIMI-46) trial, different doses of rivaroxaban were com-pared with placebo in 3491 patients. Darexaban was also evaluated in the dose-ranging Study Evaluating Safety, Tolerability and Efcacy of YM150 in Subjects With ACSs(RUBY) trial with 1279 patients, and apixaban was eval- uated in the Apixaban for Prevention of Acute Ischemic148 R. D. Lopes et al. 123Events (APPRAISE) dose-ranging trial with 1714 patients. The results of these phase two trials in patients after ACS are remarkably consistent, by showing a dose-dependent increase in major bleeding with little or no signicanteffect on the reduction of cardiovascular events. In agree- ment with these ndings, a phase three trial, APPRAISE-2, with 7392 patients, was prematurely terminated because ofan increase in major bleeding events with apixaban in the absence of a counterbalancing reduction in recurrent ischemic events. The role of factor Xa inhibitors in the secondary pre- vention after ACS became even more complex after theresults of the ATLAS-ACS 2 TIMI 51 trial, which evalu- ated more than 15,526 patients randomized to placebo or to two doses of rivaroxaban. Results of this highly anticipatedtrial demonstrated that ACS patients receiving standard therapy, including dual antiplatelet therapy, may benet from the addition of the factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban,although at the cost of some additional bleeding compli- cations. Both rivaroxaban doses reduced the primary end point of cardiovascular death/MI/stroke at the cost ofincreased bleeding rates. The 2.5-mg twice-daily dose had the better benet/risk balance, due to lower bleeding risk, than the 5-mg twice-daily dose. Surprisingly, the lowerdose of rivaroxaban resulted in a signicant reduction in death from cardiovascular causes (2.7% vs. 4.1%, P=0.002) and in all-cause mortality (2.9% vs. 4.5%, P=0.002). These benets were not observed in higher- dose rivaroxaban, and the difference between the two doses of rivaroxaban was signicant. Rivaroxaban-treatedpatients experienced more major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage than controls, but without a signicant increase in fatal bleeding. It is possible that the addition ofvery-low-dose anticoagulation with rivaroxaban may rep- resent a new treatment strategy in patients with a recent ACS. However, it is important to note that the ATLAS-ACS 2 trial had relatively small percentages of elderly patients, female patients, and patients with impaired renal function, suggesting that the results may not be entirelyreplicated with higher-risk patients in the real world. In summary, as mentioned in the editorial by Matthew Roe and E. Magnus Ohman, ''a new era of secondaryprevention after an ACS has begun and will be character- ized by the need to balance ischemic versus bleeding risks when selecting the type, number, and duration of anti-thrombotic therapies for individual patients.'' New antiplatelet agents in ACS patients: how should we choose? Treatment options for patients with ACS continue to expand. Most recently, two new potent oral inhibitors ofthe platelet P2Y 12receptor, prasugrel and ticagrelor, were found clinical trials to be superior to clop- idogrel in preventing death, MI, or stroke in patients pre- senting with ST-segment elevation MI and NSTE ACS andare now available for clinical use. However, their avail- ability only adds to the complexity of treatment selection. Considering combinations of oral and intravenous (IV)antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, and their use and timing relative to the use and timing of PCI, there are at least 144 different possible combinations for treatment of an indi- vidual patient. Given this complexity, a number of factors should be considered in selecting therapy. First and foremost, the evidence supporting efcacy and safety of the agent must be considered. In the Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE)trial, clopidogrel reduced the risk of death, MI, or stroke relative to aspirin alone by 20% with acceptable incre- mental bleeding. However, the CURE trial was conductedprior to the current era of invasive treatment for NSTE ACS and did not include ST-segment elevation MI patients. In addition, clopidogrel levels and plateletresponsiveness to clopidogrel are highly variable across patients, in part related to polymorphisms in CPY2C19, an enzyme in the cytochrome P450 system responsible forconverting clopidogrel from a pro-drug to its active form. Unfortunately, there is no evidence to date that increasing the dose of clopidogrel is effective in reducing clinicalevents in patients with reduced function polymorphisms of CYP2C19 or in reducing death, MI, or stroke in ST-seg- ment elevation MI and NSTE ACS patients overall. Like clopidogrel, prasugrel is a thienopyridine and administered as a pro-drug, but is more potent than clopi- dogrel in inhibiting platelet function with less variability inresponse across individuals. Additionally, prasugrel is less susceptible to the effects of CYP2C19 polymorphisms than clopidogrel. Ticagrelor is a non-thienopyridine, reversible inhibitor of the P1Y 12receptor that is more potent than clopidogrel and is administered as the active drug. Briefly, comparedwith clopidogrel in patients with both NSTE ACS and ST- segment elevation MI, prasugrel (administered after coro- nary anatomy was known and PCI was planned) and ti-cagrelor (administered as upstream therapy) reduced the risk of death, MI, or stroke by 19 and 16%, respectively, over treatment of approximately 12 months. Importantly,treatment with ticagrelor resulted in a signicant 21% reduction in cardiovascular mortality. Efcacy results were consistent across major subgroups, with a possibleenhanced benet of prasugrel among diabetic patients and reductions in stent thrombosis with both agents. There was a signicant treatment-by-region interaction in the PlateletInhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, such that the point estimate for treatment effect favored clopidogrelIV International Symposium 149 123in North America. Subsequent analyses suggested that aspirin dose explained the majority of the difference in treatment response by region, and ticagrelor now carries a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) black box warningfor use only with low-dose aspirin ( \\100 mg). Although there was a higher rate of major bleeding with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel, there was noincrease in intracranial or life-threatening bleeding. How- ever, prasugrel resulted in a 32% higher rate of major bleeding than clopidogrel, which included signicant increases in life-threatening and fatal bleeding and an increase in intracranial hemorrhage in patients with priortransient ischemic attack or stroke. Net clinical benet was also not favorable for prasugrel in patients over age 75 years and those with body weight \\60 kg. Therefore, prasugrel has an FDA black box warning restricting use in these subgroups. A practical consideration in selecting treatment is cost, particularly with the expectation that clopidogrel will become available in generic form in May 2012. Present pricing for consumers in the United States is approximately$200 per month for clopidogrel, $215 per month for prasugrel, and $260 per month for ticagrelor. Compliance is also a practical concern. Both clopidogrel and prasugrelwere developed for once-daily dosing, but ticagrelor was developed to be given twice daily, which may affect compliance in some patients. Additionally, ticagrelor cau-ses symptomatic dyspnea in some patients, which may lead to lower compliance. Selection among the new antiplatelet agents and clopi- dogrel should consider local practice patterns, including such things as what agents are available in institutional formularies and in local pharmacies and how familiarphysicians at the treating facility are with the properties of the agents and their potential benets and risks. Finally, a systematic approach is recommended for oral antiplatelettreatment selection that considers these factors, as well as local interventional and referral patterns, and that simpli- es the approach to selection of all antithrombotic therapyfor treatment of ACS at an institution. Bleeding and mortality in patients with ACS Bleeding occurs commonly during the treatment of ACS, an observation that has been made in both clinical trials as well as in observational registries of community practice. However, the incidence of bleeding depends on the de-nition applied, and unfortunately varying denitions have been applied historically across trials. For example, in the TIMI trials, major bleeding is dened as fatal or life-threatening bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, hemoglobin g/dL, or hematocrit drop C15%. In contrast, theAcute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy denition of major bleeding includes intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular, or access-site hemorrhage requiring surgical intervention, hematomas C5c m i n diameter, as well as more conservative hemoglobin drops depending on whether an overt source of bleeding is observed. The use of blood product transfusions has beenvariably incorporated into these denitions as well and contributes further to the variation and incidence of bleeding due to varying institutional thresholds for trans- fusion. The Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) assembled a working group to provide standard-ized bleeding denitions for cardiovascular clinical studies. This group acknowledged several challenges in creating a universal bleeding denition but proposed a consensusclassication for bleeding evaluation or treatment. Type II bleeding includes clinically overt signs of bleeding that are actionable but do not meet criteria for other BARCbleeding. Type III is clinical, laboratory, and/or imaging evidence of bleeding with specic health care provider response. Type IV includes coronary artery bypass graft(CABG)-related bleeding, and Type V is dened as fatal bleeding. Bleeding has important prognostic complications as it has been associated with an increased longitudinal risk of mortality. The severity of bleeding correlates with worse outcomes. Bleeding is costly, not only because it prolongslength of hospitalization, but also because it is associated with additional diagnostic and treatment interventions. Bleeding can also result in decreased use of evidence-basedtherapies. In a study of patients with ACS, patients who developed bleeding complications were less likely to be discharged on antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin and thi-enopyridine. Six months after a bleeding event, these patients remained less likely to receive these evidence- based therapies. Even nuisance bleeding is associated witha high rate of antithrombotic treatment discontinuation. Bleeding also often leads to the transfusion of blood products. Tremendous variation in transfusion practicesexists across health care organizations. However, a com- mon theme is that older patients, female patients, and patients with renal insufciency are more likely to receivetransfusion therapy. Transfusion in the ACS setting has been independently associated with worse outcomes. Appropriate thresholds for transfusion have not been wellestablished within the cardiovascular arena. The only ran- domized clinical trial on this topic was conducted by the Canadian Clinical Trials group in 1999, which randomized838 critically ill patients to a liberal versus restrictive transfusion strategy. No difference in 30-day mortality was noted between transfusion strategies, although there was asuggestion of benet for the more liberal strategy among patients with coronary disease.150 R. D. Lopes et al. 123There is increased focus on bleeding avoidance strate- gies. First and foremost would be the prediction of bleeding risk. The Can Rapid Risk Stratication of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes with Early Imple-mentation of the American College of Cardiology/Ameri- can Heart Association Guidelines (CRUSADE) bleeding risk score was developed and validated in a cohort ofpatients with NSTE ACS, and it identied eight clinical factors that are associated with increased bleeding risk: female sex, prior history of diabetes, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, or clinical and laboratory evi- dence of risk including lower creatinine clearance, higherheart rate on admission, lower systolic blood pressure on admission, and lower admission hematocrit. A key rst step to bleeding avoidance is the appropriate dosing of anti-thrombotic therapies. Patients who are older or who have worsening renal function are particularly vulnerable to excess antithrombotic dosing. Appropriate dosing, partic-ularly in these high-risk patients, may alleviate the rela- tionship between these risk characteristics and increased bleeding risk. The use of safer antithrombotics may also beconsidered. Bivalirudin, for example, has been well studied in both the ST-elevation and NSTE ACS settings and has been shown to have efcacy comparable with the tradi-tional combination of heparin and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors but an enhanced safety prole with reduced bleeding risk. Arterial access for cardiac catheterization may also play arole in bleeding avoidance. The recent Radial Versus Femoral Access for Coronary Angiography and Interven- tion in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes (RIVAL)study compared clinical outcomes between patients who underwent radial versus femoral arterial access. Although the primary outcome of death, MI, stroke, and non-CABG-related major bleeding at 30 days was not signicantly different between groups, secondary outcomes, including the occurrence of large hematomas or major vascularaccess site complications, were substantially reduced with radial access. In summary, bleeding is an important event associated with increased mortality among patients with ACS, and bleeding avoidance should be prioritized while reducing ischemic risk with antiplatelet interventional therapies.Strategies that achieve this balance are associated with improved survival. Thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients Critically ill patients have an increased risk of DVT due to their acute illness, procedures such as central venous catheterization, and immobility. Among patients in theintensive care unit (ICU), DVT is an important problem because thrombus propagation and embolization can leadto potentially fatal PE. The effects of with UFH on venous bleeding, and other outcomes were uncer- tain in critically ill patients. To address this question, TheProphylaxis for Thromboembolism in Critical Care (PROTECT) trial (NCT00182143) was planned. PROTECT was a randomized, stratied, concealed international trial comparing subcutaneous injection of UFH 5000 IU or the LMWH dalteparin 5000 IU once daily plus once-daily placebo for the duration of the ICU stay. The objectives of PROTECT were to examine, among medical-surgical critically ill patients, the effect of theLMWH versus heparin on the primary outcome of proxi- mal leg DVT and the following PE, thromboembolism (DVT orPE), of VTE or death, bleeding, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Patients were followed up to death or hospital discharge. Venous thromboembo-lism events were included after ICU discharge. All patients, families, clinicians, research personnel, outcome adjudicators, and the trial biostatistician were blinded toallocation. Data were analyzed according to the intention- to-treat principle. The main results of the PROTECT trial suggested that there was no signicant between-group difference in the rate of proximal leg DVT, which occurred in 96 of 1873 patients (5.1%) receiving dalteparin versus 109 of 1873patients (5.8%) interval proportion of patients with pulmonary emboli (a key secondary outcome measure) was signicantly lower with dalteparin (24 patients, 1.3%) than with patients, 2.3%) CI,0.30-0.88; P=0.01). There was no signicant between- group difference in the rates of major bleeding (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.75-1.34; P=0.98) or death in the hospital (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.80-1.05; P=0.21). Does aspirin have a role in venous thromboembolism prevention? Patients undergoing orthopedic surgery are at high for VTE. Anticoagulant agents (e.g., LMWH or fondaparinux) signicantly reduce the risk of VTE after orthopedic sur-gery, but the role of aspirin in VTE prevention has been controversial, in part because platelets are thought to be less important than brin in venous thrombosis. Guidelinespublished by the American Academy of Orthopedic Sur- geons recommend aspirin as one of several acceptable VTE prevention strategies for the majority of patients undergo-ing major orthopedic procedures. In contrast, the eighth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians'IV International Symposium 151 123Evidence-based Guidelines on Antithrombotic Therapy strongly recommends that aspirin notbe used for VTE prophylaxis. A recent systematic review of all evidence relevant to aspirin suggests that aspirin is almost certainly more effective than placebo for the prevention of VTE following orthopedic surgery. The most important data come fromtwo sources: a meta-analysis published by the Anti-Platelet Trialists' Coalition (APTC) in 1994 and the Pulmonary Embolism Prevention (PEP) study published in 1999. The APTC meta-analysis included data pooled from almost 9000 patients who had participated in VTE preventiontrials following orthopedic surgery, as well as other clinical settings. Although the results indicated that, compared with placebo, aspirin reduced the rate of PE by more than 50%,the validity of the ndings was questioned because many of the trials from which these data were abstracted had serious methodologic flaws (e.g., open-label design, sub-optimalDVT detection methods, non-uniform antiplatelet drugs and doses across studies). The PEP trial was undertaken to address the fact that many physicians (especially non-surgeons) had rejected the APTC results. Over 17,000 patients in ve countries were ran- domized to receive either aspirin 160 mg or placebo, startedpre-operatively and continued for 35 days. The majority of patients underwent surgery to repair a hip fracture, but about one quarter of participants had an elective total hip arthro-plasty. This well-designed, very large randomized trial with almost 100% follow-up for clinical end points found that aspirin reduced the risk of fatal and non-fatal PE; the relativeeffect was very similar to that seen for aspirin in the APTC meta-analysis. Based on data from PEP and APTC com- bined, it appears that, compared with placebo, aspirin couldprevent 5-10 PEs per 1000 patients treated. Aspirin use following major orthopedic surgery would be expected to increase the number of patients who require transfusion byapproximately 3-6 per 1000. Although a few direct com- parisons between aspirin and anticoagulant agents in this setting have been published, the available evidence is toosparse and too inconsistent to draw denitive conclusions about the net clinical benet (or harm) of anticoagulants versus aspirin in this setting. Pending further study, it seemsreasonable to conclude that aspirin should have some role as a VTE prevention strategy after orthopedic surgery; without more data, however, we can expect ongoing disagreementabout the patients for whom it would be most appropriate. Should patients with cancer receive primary VTE prophylaxis? The association between cancer and thromboembolic phe- nomena has been recognized since 1865. It was Armand Trousseau (1801-1867) as a sign of occult pancreatic cancer, but there is wide variation in the relative risk of VTE in different cancers. The presence of an active cancer should be one of the leading risk factorsrecognized by physicians when assessing VTE risk during hospitalization. In the algorithm used for electronic alert to prevent VTE created by Kucher and colleagues, the pres-ence of cancer carries a score of 3, while a score C4 reflects a high thrombotic risk. Some other scores evaluate the VTE risk in patients with cancer and on chemotherapy. The most important single message is that physicians should perform a systematic evaluation of each cancerpatient, taking into account both factors linked to the patient (such as age, type and stage of the disease, previous history of VTE, known thrombophilia), as well as factorslinked to the treatment (type of chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or an anti-angiogenic agent, such as thalidomide in association with corticosteroids, immobilization duringhospitalization, and surgery). VTE is one of the most frequent complications in cancer patients (4-20%). The risk of VTE is 3-5 times higher incancer patients undergoing surgery than in those without cancer, and, as a consequence, among hospitalized cancer patients who die, one in every seven do so from PE. Also,when cancer patients develop a thrombotic event, they have a three-fold increased risk of recurrence, even years after the rst VTE episode. Compared with similar patients withoutmalignant disease, cancer patients have twice the incidence of bleeding during anticoagulant treatment. Furthermore, the development of VTE is independently associated with lowersurvival rates. At the same time, there is growing evidence that the use of anticoagulants lowers the risk of death; however, this hypothesis requires further research. With regard to preventing thromboembolic disease in cancer patients, the patients who have been studied most often are those undergoing surgical intervention for theircancer. Low-dose UFH and LMWH are effective in pre- venting both DVT and fatal PE in general and in onco- logical surgical patients undergoing laparotomy. It hasbeen demonstrated that cancer itself is a risk factor for the development of perioperative bleeding complications independent of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis type. Cancer patients admitted to the hospital but not under- going surgical intervention should be treated as other acutely ill hospitalized medical patients and provided withthromboprophylaxis when appropriate. The use of routine anticoagulation for patients with central venous catheters is no longer recommended. Although older studies suggestedthat the use of low-dose vitamin K antagonist or LMWH was associated with a benet in reducing the frequency of thrombosis associated with central catheters, some morecontemporary studies with the same agents fail to demon- strate a benet.152 R. D. Lopes et al. 123At least three major guidelines for thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients have been published in recent years\u2014the European Society for Medical Oncology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the American College ofChest Physicians, 8 thedition\u2014and may help physicians in their clinical practices. Some of the key points about pri- mary prophylaxis in cancer patients are as follows: LMWH, low-dose UFH, and vitamin K antagonist are not routinely indicated to prevent catheter-related thrombo-sis or during chemotherapy, if patients are ambulatory, except in multiple myeloma patients receiving thalido- mide or lenalidomide low-dose UFH or LMWH or fondaparinux in cancer patients undergoing medium and large surgical procedures is recommended. VTE prophylaxis should be maintained for at least 7-10 days and considered for up to 28 days in curative pelvic and abdominal cancer procedures. Routine use of prophylaxis should be considered in cancer patients hospitalized with an acute medicalillness. Managing anticoagulation in patients undergoing surgical procedures: diminishing bleeding and ischemic risks Excessive bleeding leads to early instability and postopera- tive complications, and blood transfusion is clearly related tolate mortality after cardiac surgery. Measures to prevent bleeding and avoid blood transfusion are very important to improve surgical outcomes. Preoperative anticoagulationand antiplatelet therapy comprise one of the six major risk factors for prediction of surgical bleeding. Consequently, there are two situations in which coagu- lation status must be managed prior to surgical procedures to diminish bleeding and ischemic risk: in patients using an anticoagulation agent and in those receiving dual antiplatelettherapy. Aspirin is not a problem anymore. Although in the past it was recommended to cease aspirin use 3-5 days prior to surgery, this is no longer the case as guidelines now rec- ommend that aspirin be administered prior to CABG because it has been shown to be related to better surgical outcomes.Thus, aspirin may be avoided only before special surgical procedures such as ophthalmic or intra-cerebral procedures. Anticoagulants Warfarin is by far the most widely used anticoagulant. In some regions, fenprocoumon is preferred because of its longer half-life. Newer agents, such as dabigatran, apix- aban, and rivaroxaban, for example, have not yet beencompletely incorporated into the routine clinical arma- mentarium. Anticoagulants are mostly used for preventing arterial and pulmonary embolism in atrial brillation, for implanted mechanical valves, DVT, and PE. The mainadvantages of the newer anticoagulants are that they do not require monitoring and have a shorter half-life, which could facilitate management around the time of a surgicalprocedure. But there is very limited published evidence regarding those new drugs in surgery. Warfarin might not be interrupted for low-risk endo- scopic procedures. For patients at high risk for thrombosis who undergo procedures with low bleeding risk, it is rec-ommended to stop use 3-5 days preoperatively. When the thrombosis risk is high and there is also high bleeding risk, it is recommended to stop warfarin 3-5 days preopera-tively and monitor the INR. In the presence of an implanted mechanical heart valve, there is need to employ a bridge therapy prior to surgery, interrupting warfarin and intro-ducing unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin until the moment of the procedure, and restarting warfarin the day after surgery. In this setting, a practical approach toperioperative anticoagulation would be: Discontinue war- farin 5 days preoperatively if INR is between 2 and 3 and for 6 days if INR is between 3 and 4.5. Observe that agingis associated with a slow resolution of anticoagulant effect. Antiplatelet drugsAs already mentioned above, earlier guidelines recom- mended interruption of aspirin use some days prior to anyoperation. This is no longer true, especially in cardiac sur- gery, because with modern management, bleeding is seldom related to aspirin administration. Current guidelines do notrecommend aspirin interruption, and the recently published American College of Cardiology/American Heart Associa- tion guideline for CABG surgery includes a Class I recom-mendation for the administration of aspirin in patients who are not taking it and who are undergoing CABG because it is related to better surgical outcomes. Thienopyridines are related to postoperative bleeding and should be avoided or require specic management during the perioperative period. Because there are somedifferent characteristics between the two most commonly used drugs of this class, they will be commented on sep- arately below: Clopidogrel This is the most widely used ADP P2Y 12inhibitor. Because its effect on platelets is irreversible, its use must be interrupted 5-7 days preoperatively, providing sufcient time for theplatelet population to be renewed. The impact of exposure to clopidogrel in patients with ACS requiring coronary arteryIV International Symposium 153 123bypass surgery was studied in a multicenter analysis for the end points of reoperation, major bleeding, and length of hos- pital stay. It was found that the adjusted risk for reoperation was 9.80 (95% CI: 2.18-43.95; P=0.01) in the clopidogrel patient group. Interestingly, the management of patients undergoing CABG on clopidogrel seems to be improving, as bleeding and associated mortality have been reduced in recentreports as compared with the last two decades. There is vari- ability in the patient's response to clopidogrel, due to genetic characteristics. For this reason, some would argue that there is a place for point-of-care testing to evaluate its action in the individual patient, although there is no formal recommenda-tion for such testing. More studies to clarify the role of these tests in this setting are warranted. Prasugrel As with clopidogrel, this drug irreversibly binds the ADP P2Y 12receptor. It has not been used as frequently as clopi- dogrel because it was more recently approved for clinical use. The Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Out-comes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel- Thrombolysis (TRITON-TIMI) to be rather efcacious despite a higher bleedingtendency in ACS. In patients receiving CABG, however, prasugrel was related to a 21.9% incidence of surgical bleeding, compared with 4.1% related to clopidogrel. It isreasonable to recommend stopping prasugrel for at least 7 days prior to CABG and to take special precautions to prevent perioperative bleeding. Ticagrelor This drug has some advantages over the above-mentioned thienopyridines because its eff ect is reversible and diminishes within 48 h, so that major surgical procedures can be donewithout fear of excessive bleeding. In the PLATO trial for ACS, ticagrelor was related to reduc tion of vascular death and MI but not stroke, compared with clopidogrel. There is little clinicalevidence regarding the impact of ticagrelor on surgical out- comes. In a recently published a nalysis comparing ticagrelor with clopidogrel in the PLATO trial, among patients receivingCABG for whom ticagrelor/placebo was to be withheld for 24-72 h and clopidogrel/placebo for 5 days preoperatively, there was reduced cardiovascu lar and total death without an increase in major bleedin g in the ticagrelor group. Perioperative management in patients under dual antiplatelet therapy As aspirin can be safely maintained during the surgical period, management is focused on the second antiplateletdrug. Taking clopidogrel as the paradigm drug and adjusting management for the others drugs, general mea- sures can be summarized as below. It is recommended as Class I in Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)/Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiolo- gists (SCA) guidelines to stop medications that inhibit the platelet P2Y 12receptor before operation to decrease bleeding events. The timing of discontinuation depends on the pharmacodynamic half-life for each agent, as well as the potential lack of reversibility. European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines state that, for pre-operative management of patients treated with dual anti- platelet therapy and considered for cardiac and non-cardiac surgery, one should proceed as follows: (1) emergent case:proceed surgery; case'' clinical (3) elective: wait until completion of mandatory dual antiplatelet regimen. The decision-making process should balance the risk of thrombosis against the risk of bleeding, leading to continued use of aspirin ?clopidogrel in low bleeding risk cases and con- tinued use of aspirin but stopping of clopidogrel or even of both drugs in high bleeding risk cases. The above-mentioned large meta-analysis on safety of clopidogrel being continued until CABG in ACS proposes an algorithm: (1) For stable elective CABG with no drug- eluting stent: stop clopidogrel for [5 days; (2) elective CABG in the presence of drug-eluting stent implanted for \\1 year: consider operating on clopidogrel or switch to IV tiroban plus heparin as a bridge to surgery;(3) For non-elective CABG in emergent or urgent ACS: operate on clopidogrel, unless it is a reoperation, there is a bleeding disorder, or troponin is negative, favoring amultidisciplinary decision. Lysine analogues, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, and tran- examic acid are very useful as they reduce total blood lossand decrease the need for blood transfusion during cardiac procedures and are indicated for blood conservation as Class I (Level A) in STS/SCA guidelines. Their effect isbenecial, even in routine CABG cases, for reducing postoperative thorax blood drainage. It might be advisable and is accepted in some centers for emergency ACSpatients facing an intervention to avoid antiplatelet drugs until an anatomical coronary arteries diagnosis is obtained for deciding to proceed with a percutaneous intervention orsurgery, or even excluding a non-coronary cause, such as aortic dissection, maintaining free use of aspirin and heparin. Finally, some practical management tips based on sur- gical experience and previous literature are listed below: If possible, delay surgery for 3-5 days (clopidogrel or prasugrel) or 2-3 days (ticagrelor) if the patient is154 R. D. Lopes et al. 123relatively stable, balanced against severity and instability. If the patient is stable but the lesion is critical, give IV UFH until the effect of the antiplatelet drug wears off. No prophylactic preoperative transfusion of blood products. Do not stop heparin and give a full dose of heparin before bypass. Use tranexamic acid 10 mg/kg before surgical incision, plus 10 mg/kg on beginning of bypass. Generously use platelet transfusion after administration of protamine if diffuse bleeding, 0.2 units/kg. In the post-operative period, proceed to judicious surgical re-exploration, platelets infusion, and tranex-amic acid when needed. Use reduced hemo-dilution under normothermia, mod- ied ultraltration; minimize cardiopulmonary bypasscircuits and priming. Employ good operative technique, including topical hemostasis, plus sealants or biological glues. Improve blood salvage methods and neutralize heparin with protamine on a titration basis. Venous thromboembolism in heart failure patients: how should we manage this special population? Venous thromboembolism and congestive heart failure (CHF) are among the most commonly encountered medical conditions, particularly in the elderly and hospitalized population. It is well recognized that CHF patients developa hypercoagulable state that involves abnormalities in all three components of the Virchow's triad, which places these patients at an increased risk for VTE. Unfortunately,VTE has generally been regarded to be an end point of secondary importance in large, randomized CHF trials, and therefore, its actual incidence in this population has notbeen well studied. Multiple autopsy studies have conrmed a very high prevalence of VTE in CHF patients. A case-controlledstudy has also shown that CHF is an important risk factor for VTE in ambulatory outpatients and that the risk pro- gressively increases with worsening of the ejection frac-tion. Large, randomized CHF trials have suggested in retrospective analyses that the incidence of PE in mildly symptomatic ambulatory patients is probably low ( \\1%/ year). On the other hand, hospitalized CHF patients with impaired mobility have an incidence of VTE as high as 21%, although most of the events are asymptomatic distalDVT. In a recent prospective study involving severe CHF patients admitted to a coronary care unit, PE was diagnosed in 9.1% during the hospitalization period, despite adequateprophylaxis in 70% of the cases. It is also important that PE patients with CHF have a higher mortality than those without CHF, and that PE is an independent predictor of death and rehospitalization in CHF patients. The diagnosis of VTE in CHF patients is an increasingly frequent and challenging problem. There is a substantial overlap in symptoms and signs of both conditions, andsome of the diagnostic tests for VTE do not perform as well in the heart failure population. D-dimer levels are already elevated in the majority of CHF patients; thus, its utility for suspected VTE in this population is severely compromised. Lung scintigraphy is often non-diagnostic, but computedtomography maintains its accuracy and is the preferred imaging test to evaluate suspected PE in CHF patients. The therapeutic options in CHF patients with VTE are the sameand include the commonly used anticoagulants, brino- lytics, and catheter or surgical embolectomy. Nonetheless, comorbidities, numerous medications, and renal dysfunc-tion\u2014all commonly seen in CHF patients\u2014pose serious challenges to the management of patients with PE. In summary, CHF is an important risk factor for VTE, with an incidence that varies widely from \\1% to 20% depending on the severity of the disease and the clinical context. Both conditions negatively affect each other'sprognosis, and therefore a high index of suspicion should be maintained in patients presenting with decompensated CHF. The preferred method for conrming and excludingthe diagnosis of PE in the CHF population is the computed tomography scan. Treatment should be promptly initiated once the diagnosis is suspected, and careful attentionshould be paid to the choice, dosing, and management of antithrombotic therapy, as several physiologic abnormali- ties place these patients at a particularly high risk ofbleeding complications. Anticoagulation in atrial brillation: an important issue Atrial brillation strokes are associated with a 30-day mortality of 24%. Warfarin has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke by 66%. Despite its proven efcacy, warfarinis underused in clinical practice. The dose response of warfarin is affected by age, sex, weight, liver function, dietary vitamin K, drugs, and pharmacogenomic factors.The narrow therapeutic window, coupled with a highly variable dose response, mandates frequent monitoring of the INR, which poses a barrier to warfarin's effectivenessin clinical practice. Several alternatives to warfarin have been evaluated in clinical trials. The rst, dabigatran, is a direct oral thrombin inhibitor. Both rivaroxaban and apix-aban inhibit factor Xa. All three of these agents reduced the risk of stroke (composite end point of ischemic andIV International Symposium 155 123hemorrhagic stroke) among patients with AF. The reduc- tion in intracranial hemorrhage is unprecedented and is one of the most remarkable features of these drugs. Apixaban and the lower dose of dabigatran (110 mg) also reducedmajor extracranial bleeding compared with warfarin. These new oral anticoagulants are characterized by shorter half- lives compared with warfarin, do not require monitoring,and have fewer drug interactions. The degree of renal clearance is an important distinguishing feature of these drugs, as is the dosing frequency. Approximately 80% of dabigatran is eliminated by the kidneys, 66% of rivarox- aban (36% as unchanged apixaban are dosed twice daily, and riva- roxaban is taken once daily. Translating the efcacy of the novel anticoagulants from randomized trials into clinical practice will require heightened vigilance around medication adherence and changes in renal function. Creatinine clearance needs to bemeasured prior to initiation of these agents and then peri- odically throughout the duration of therapy. Although drug interactions are signicantly less common with the newanticoagulants compared with warfarin, all are substrates of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter, so the potential for interaction with P-gp inhibitors and P-gp inducers exists. Inaddition, both apixaban and rivaroxaban are metabolized via CYP3A4. The short half-life and rapid onset of action obviate the need for perioperative bridging in mostinstances, but also highlight the importance of hemostasis prior to initiation following invasive procedures. The safety of these agents in combination with dual antiplatelet ther-apy warrants further study. In addition, data are needed regarding reversal of these anticoagulants in the setting of trauma, urgent surgery, and major hemorrhage. The abilityto monitor the anticoagulant effect in select clinical situa- tions remains a priority for real-world practice. The new oral anticoagulants represent a major advance in the pre-vention and treatment of thromboembolic disease. Current and planned studies will continue to inform their optimal use. Stroke and bleeding in atrial brillation: how should we assess them? The prevalence of AF in the United States is expanding rapidly. By 2050, estimates project that there will be over 5 million Americans with AF. Patients with both paroxysmal and persistent AF face elevated risks for stroke and sys-temic emboli. This risk can be successfully mitigated if patients are treated with chronic anticoagulation, yet use of such therapy can also cause serious bleeding eventsincluding intracranial hemorrhage and even death. Thus, selection of anticoagulant therapy should ideally beindividualized, guided by a patient's specic risks for stroke with AF and bleeding with anticoagulation. These risks can now be accurately estimated used sev- eral published risk prediction models. The CHADS 2risk score uses a simple additive sum of ve clinical features (CHF, hypertension, age C75 years, diabetes, and stroke [weighted =2]) to stratify risk for stroke in AF. The CHAD 2-VASc score extends this simple risk score by adding in three additional risk factors: vascular disease, age 65-75 years, and sex =female). This modication pro- vides for slightly more accurate risk estimation, particu- larly among lower-risks groups. Clinical trials havedemonstrated that the benets of warfarin therapy are lin- early associated with patient risks. Based on these data, current U.S. and European guidelines recommend initiationof anticoagulation in all patients with moderate-to-high stroke risk. The risks of bleeding with warfarin therapy are also associated with certain patient-related risk factors, which can be summated using published risk scores. These include the HAS-BLED, ATRIA, and HEMORR2HAGESbleeding risk scores. While these scores can stratify risk, the scores are often based on retrospective factors (such as labile INR results), thereby limiting their use in prospec-tively selecting a given patient for drug initiation. These bleeding scores also unfortunately demonstrate that many patient factors associated with stroke risk (including age,hypertension, and stroke) are also risk factors for bleeding. For example, the choices for anticoagulation therapy in older patients with multiple comorbidities will require atrade-off of high benet and high risks. The individualization of therapy does not end with these risk factors but is also determined, in part, by provider andsystem factors. For example, concomitant medications can also raise a patient's risk for bleeding. Specically, com- bining use of aspirin and/or an ADP-inhibitor with warfarincan substantially raise a patient's risk for bleeding. Addi- tionally, the effective and safe therapeutic window for warfarin therapy is narrow. Therefore, close patient mon-itoring and appropriate dose titration are needed to achieve optimal results. However, data indicate that this is rarely achieved in current U.S. clinical practice, where patients onwarfarin are within the recommended therapeutic range less than 55% of the time. Newer anticoagulant therapies, including the direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) and thenew factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban and rivaroxaban), offer the promise of reducing anticoagulation-related bleeding risks, particularly the dreaded risk of intracranial hemor-rhage. Yet, while these novel drugs may not require such careful therapeutic titration, patients must still closely and continuously adhere to instructions for the drugs to be safeand effective. These later points emphasize the importance of considering patient, provider, and system factors when156 R. D. Lopes et al. 123selecting AF treatment, as well as highlight future oppor- tunities for quality improvement in AF care. Triple therapy Overlapping indications for antithrombotic therapy may lead to the need for ''triple therapy,'' dened currently as aspirin, clopidogrel, and oral anticoagulation. As the population ages, more patients will have both ACS and AF; accordingly triple therapy may be used more frequently. Prior studies have shown that, with more anti-thrombotic therapy, risk of bleeding increases. Many antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs are part of the foun- dation for treatment of ACS and AF, making the decisionabout the right combination of these agents challenging. However, limited evidence is available to guide therapeutic decision-making about triple therapy. Registry information,subgroup analyses from clinical trials, and overviews of single-center experiences have been published, but no randomized trials evaluating different strategies of tripletherapy have been completed. Multiple guidelines and consensus statements from national societies provide recommendations for cliniciansconcerning the use of triple therapy. A simple flow diagram can be used by physicians to guide decisions about the need for dual antiplatelet therapy or triple therapy based on theassessment of patient bleeding and stroke risk. Five addi- tional factors should be considered: (1) use of the lowest dose of antiplatelet therapy; (2) use of bare metal stentsversus drug-eluting stents minimize the duration of antiplatelet therapy; (3) optimal INR within a range of 2.0-2.5; (4) gastric protection with proton-pump inhibitors;and (5) minimization of the duration of triple therapy. It is also important to re-evaluate regularly the need for triple therapy. The risk of stent thrombosis will decrease overtime, whereas bleeding risk will remain constant. The ongoing What is the Optimal Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients with Oral Anticoagula-tion and Coronary Stenting (WOEST) trial is a prospective, multicenter, open-label randomized trial that aims to determine whether the combination of oral anticoagulantsand clopidogrel 75 mg/d reduces the risk of bleeding and is not inferior to triple therapy (clopidogrel ?oral anticoag- ulants ?aspirin) with respect to the prevention of throm- botic complications. The primary outcome of the study will be the occurrence of bleeding up to 30 days and one year. Major adverse cardiac events will be the secondary out-comes. Sample size is 496, and the estimated study com- pletion date is October 2011 ( www.clinicaltrials.gov , NCT00769938). The Triple Therapy in Patients on After Drug-Eluting Stent Implantation (ISAR-TRIPLE)study, an interventional, randomized, open-label to compare the six-week versus six-month clop- idogrel treatment regimen in patients with concomitant aspirin and oral anticoagulants following drug-elutingstenting. The composite of death, MI, denite stent thrombosis, stroke, or major bleeding will be the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes will be the composite ofcardiac death, MI, stent thrombosis, or ischemic stroke, as well as major bleeding complications. Estimated enroll- ment is 600, and the completion date is July 2012 (www.clinicaltrials.gov , NCT00776633). These two stud- ies will also provide important insights about the use oftriple therapy in clinical practice. The optimal antithrombotic strategy for patients with ACS and AF who do or do not undergo PCI is stilluncertain. Based on the available data, triple therapy offers the best protection against stroke and myocardial events but at the cost of increased bleeding. Currently, tripletherapy dened as aspirin plus clopidogrel plus warfarin should be administered for the shortest period possible. Triple therapy may be redened in the near future with newP2Y 12inhibitors such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, newer antiplatelet agents such as PAR-1 inhibitors, other oral factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban or apixaban, andantithrombin agents such as dabigatran. Recent data suggest that some new antithrombotic agents under development have signicant potential toimprove anticoagulant therapy. Their uptake and use will depend mostly on efcacy, safety, and cost relative to current medications. Moreover, a careful balance of anti-thrombotic efcacy and bleeding risk is now recognized as essential. Forecasting the death of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin may be still premature, however. How toapply therapies, even when they have been shown to pro- vide benets in trials, will continue to be a major challenge in clinical practice. Finally, the optimal duration of tripletherapy use and the population that may benet the most from it also need to be dened. How to manage anticoagulation in AF patients undergoing cardioversion The reversion of an abnormal heart rhythm to its normal state was rst described by Bernard Lown in 1961. Theinitial experience with by several clinicians prac-ticing at prominent institutions, who documented successes and potential complications, among them systemic embo- lism and stroke. Guidelines for the management of AF and atrial flutter to include the peri-cardioversion period have beenIV International Symposium 157 123formulated by national and international organizations and underscore the importance of anticoagulant therapy to minimize the risk of cardioembolic events that can be life- threatening or life-altering. While either IV or oral anti-coagulants can be used as thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing cardioversion, there are two fundamental tenets of effective therapy. First, a sufcient intensity of antico-agulation must be achieved at the time of the procedure. Second, a threshold level of anticoagulation must be maintained during a vulnerable period of varied duration after successful restoration of normal sinus rhythm. The limitations of bleeding risk prediction rules in clinical practice Clinicians prescribe anticoagulant therapy when they decide that the risks of such therapy (major bleeding) areoutweighed by its benets (thrombosis prevention). Esti- mating the benets of anticoagulation is relatively straightforward, especially in patients with AF, where thewidely accepted CHADS 2score correlates well with annual stroke risk. To help clinicians determine the trade-offs associated with anticoagulation, several groups havederived prediction models that use patient characteristics to stratify an individual's annual risk for major bleeding. Although the development of these bleeding risk predictionmodels has helped clinicians by identifying factors (e.g., concomitant antiplatelet therapy, anemia, renal/hepatic failure, history of stroke) that are independently associatedwith an increased risk of warfarin-associated major bleeding, the models themselves are of limited value in clinical practice for a number of reasons. First, the majorityof patients with AF stand to gain so much benet (by reducing the risk of ischemic stroke) from warfarin that almost no calculated risk of bleeding should preclude a trialof anticoagulation. But even for the minority of AF patients whose absolute stroke risk reduction from warfarin is low (e.g., CHADS 2score =1), where these bleeding risk cal- culators seem more applicable, their use is impractical. All bleeding risk models estimate the annual likelihood that a patient will experience major bleeding. Unlike AF-relatedstroke (which is fatal or severely disabling more than 50% of the time), the ''major bleeding'' predicted by these models represent clinical events within a spectrum thatincludes both simple blood transfusion as well as fatal intracranial hemorrhage. Because warfarin-related major bleeding is fatal in fewer than 10% if cases, it is difcult toknow how to weigh the information generated by a bleeding prediction model against the benet of reducing the risk of ischemic stroke. Even if the trade-offs were more straightforward, several of these bleeding risk scores are, unlike the CHADS 2score,difcult to remember and/or calculate. In the case of the HAS-BLED score, we must know whether the patient has ''labile INR values''\u2014this is information that cannot be known to the clinicians who are trying to decide whether toinitiate warfarin treatment. In the case of the model pub- lished by Shireman, the equation used to dene bleeding risk is so complicated that the authors admit clinicianswould be unable to commit it to memory. Other models are incomplete: the ATRIA bleeding risk score does not account for concomitant antiplatelet therapy, a factor known to increase the risk of warfarin-associated major hemorrhage more than two-fold. Finally, none of the neworal anticoagulants being studied (or recently approved) for stroke prevention in AF has been evaluated by these bleeding prediction models. In summary, there is no doubt that the benets of anti- coagulant therapy must be balanced against the risk that they might cause major bleeding. That notwithstanding, forthe reasons outlined above, the currently available bleeding risk scores/models have limited utility in everyday clinical practice. Thromboprophylaxis for medical patients: should it be the default? Medical thromboprophylaxis reduces the risk of DVT, PE, and fatal PE. There is excellent quality evidence that medical prophylaxis is under-prescribed, resulting in otherwise avoidable episodes of VTE. Use of medicalprophylaxis has been endorsed by numerous peer organi- zations and is the focus of initiatives such as Required Organizational Practices of Accreditation Canada ( http:// www.accreditation.ca/upload edFiles/ROP%20Handbook. pdf, accessed November 14, 2011). However, it is clear that not all medical patients require thromboprophylaxis. Some patients have contraindications to anticoagulant therapy (such as those who have active bleeding and those with severe acquired or congenitalbleeding disorders). Mechanical forms of prophylaxis (such as intermittent pneumatic compression devices or graduated compression stockings) might be used in suchpatients; however, their efcacy has never been tested in well-performed prospective studies. Extrapolating from other situations, mechanical prophylaxis reduces the risk ofVTE but is associated with the potential for toxicity, including reduced mobilization, spread of infection, and skin ulceration. Mechanical forms of prophylaxis are alsopoorly tolerated by most medical patients. More importantly, and the focus of recent evidence, is the observation that many patients in the hospital are atvery low risk of VTE. When prophylaxis is administered to these patients, it results in the potential for toxicity158 R. D. Lopes et al. 123(bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), as well as expense with little likelihood of benet (because the background rate of VTE is sufciently low so that it is unlikely to be lowered further by therapy). There is no doubt that all patients admitted to the hos- pital should receive consideration for the administration of anticoagulant prophylaxis or mechanical prophylaxis.Adherence to this recommendation will be an enhanced by the use of preprinted orders, computerized prompting, and a multidisciplinary approach to care wherein multiple individuals take responsibility for ensuring the provision of optimal prophylaxis. When patients are considered to be atsufciently low risk, then documentation of the rationale for non-administration of prophylaxis should be provided. This could take the form of a note in the chart or a specicnotation in the computerized order entry system discussing why prophylaxis is not being administered. Various authors have attempted to provide guidance for clinicians with respect to patient selection for prophylaxis. In a widely referenced paper, Dr. Charles Francis has proposed that a combination of age more than 40 years,anticipated limited mobility of three or more days, and at least one other risk factor provide sufcient likelihood of VTE to warrant prophylaxis. Conditions associated withincreased risk include, but are not limited to, CHF, MI, stroke, inflammatory bowel disease, and a history of pre- vious VTE, recent surgery, trauma or immobilization,obesity, central venous catheterization, known acquired or inherited thrombophilic states, and, potentially, estrogen therapy. Patients meeting three or more criteria shouldprobably receive prophylaxis. In many hospitals, this will encompass nearly all patients; however, there remains a small subset of patients who do not meet criteria and whoprobably have a sufciently low risk of VTE that the use of antithrombotic prophylaxis cannot be justied. The case against routine prophylaxis was probably most compellingly made by Barbar and colleagues in a recently published paper. One thousand one hundred and eighty consecutive patients were followed after admission to aninternal medicine service for the development of VTE over 90 days. A previously validated scoring system was used to assign patients to various risk classes for the developmentof VTE. Fully 711 patients were found to have a low risk of venous thromboembolism, of whom 659 (93%) did not receive any VTE prophylaxis. Among the 711 patients,there were two clinically apparent episodes of venous thrombi embolism, one occurring in the 659 patients who did not receive prophylaxis and one occurring in the 52patients who did. These observations argue compellingly against the use of routine prophylaxis because the admin- istration of routine heparin or LMWH to the 659 patientswould have exposed them to the potential for toxicity without hope of further reducing the very low risk of VTEobserved in this study. There is absolutely no doubt that bleeding rates would ''swamp'' the potential benet of a reduction in the rate of VTE. In summary, the administration of pharmacologic or mechanical thromboembolism prophylaxis is a critical consideration for all patients admitted to the hospital. Many patients harbor signicant risks for venous throm-boembolism, and all such patient should be treated with effective forms of pharmacologic prophylaxis. However, a signicant proportion of patients will have a sufciently low risk of VTE that the risks and costs of pharmacologic and mechanical prophylaxis cannot be justied; in suchpatients, documentation of the rationale for the omission of therapy is required, but venous thromboembolism pro- phylaxis should consist simply of aggressive mobilizationand early discharge from the hospital.

Yet, current global birth practices tend to not adequately address this challenge. Here, we discuss the pathophysiology of hypothermia in the newborn, its prevention and therapeutic options with particular attention to resource-limited environments. Newborns are equipped with sophisticated mechanisms of body temperature regulation. Neonatal thermoregulation is a critical function for newborn survival, regulated in the hypothalamus and mediated by endocrine pathways.Hypothermia activates cellular metabolism through shivering and non- shivering thermogenesis. In newborns, optimal temperature ranges are narrow and thermoregulatory mechanisms easily overwhelmed, particularly in premature and low-birth weight infants. Hyperthermia most commonly is associated with dehydration and potentially sepsis. The lack of thermal protection promptly leads to hypothermia, which is associated with detrimental metabolic and other pathophysiological processes. Simple thermal protection strategies are feasible at community and institutional levels in resource-limited environments. Appropriate interventions include skin-to-skin care, breastfeedingand protective clothing or devices. Due to poor provider training and limited awareness of the problem, appropriate thermal care of the newborn is often neglected in many settings. Education and appropriate devices might foster improved hypothermia management through mothers, birth attendants and health care workers. Integration of relatively simple thermal protection interventions into existing mother and child health programs can effectively prevent newborn hypothermia even in resource-limited environments. Journal of Perinatology (2012) 32, 317-324; doi:10.1038/jp.2012.11; published online 1 March 2012 Keywords: newborn; neonatal; hypothermia; thermal protection Introduction The need for thermal newborn protection has long been known, as alluded to by Soranus of Ephesus (98 to 138 AD) in his four-volume treatise 'On Diseases on Women', which demonstrates the importance of keeping newborns warm.1The Bible provides probably the most well-known example of thermal protection of the newborn in Luke 2: 7, 'And she brought forth her rstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger.' Yet, in current times, the majority of the almost 4 million newborns globally who do not survive their rst month of life2die of complications associated with hypothermia, such as prematurityand severe infections (mostly sepsis and pneumonia). 3As two recent reviews have acknowledged, neonatal deaths related to hypothermia are relatively neglected, but considered easily preventable with attention to warmth, feeding and infection management.4,5This article focuses on the diagnosis of hypothermia and management of thermal protection of newborns in low-resource environments. We review mechanisms of neonatal thermoregulation, discuss the pathophysiology of newborn hypothermia and present simple strategies of thermal protection for the newborn. Neonatal thermoregulation The normal body temperature of a newborn infant is usually dened as ranging between 36.5 and 37.5 1C (97.7 to 99.5 1F).6A series of observational randomized trials starting in the late fties7,8 showed that keeping babies warm reduces mortality and morbidity,and spurred further research on the pathophysiology of thermoregulation in newborns. Thermoregulation is a biologicalpriority for homeothermic species. 9Newborns, particularly preterm and low-birth weight (LBW) infants, have limited capacity for thermoregulation during the rst weeks of life. The optimal environmental temperature is termed thermal neutral temperature, at which metabolic requirements of the organism are minimal.10 Both a decreased and an increased core temperature increase themetabolic rate of newborns, 11who have only very limited ability to maintain a normal temperature and easily become hypothermic or hyperthermic. Although hyperthermia also increases energy needs,hypothermia seems to carry a higher risk of complications. 12Received 28 September 2011; revised 21 December 2011; accepted 24 January 2012; published online 1 March 2012Correspondence: Dr K Lunze, Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.

All rights reserved. 0743-8346/12 www.nature.com/jpWhen the infant's body temperature decreases in response to sudden exposure to cold extrauterine environments, signals from peripheral and central thermoreceptors reach the hypothalamus through afferent pathways.13The resulting norepinephrine triggers nonshivering thermogenesis, or lipolysis of brown adipose tissue, which is the main homeothermic heat production mechanism in newborns. Heat production occurs through uncoupling ATP synthesis via the oxidation of fatty acids in themitochondria, utilizing uncoupled protein. 14 Afferent temperature information is processed in the hypothalamus. Thermoregulation requires an intact central nervous system,15and impaired thermoregulation, either hypo- or hyperthermia, can be indicators of central nervous system damage. The hypothalamus has a central role in regulating the autonomic, somatic and endocrine systems to maintain a normal body temperature. Decreasing body temperatures trigger a release of thyroid-stimulating hormone, which leads to an increase in thyroxine and consequently triiodothyronine. The resulting norepinephrine release causes anduncoupling of mitochondrial oxidation in the brown adipose tissue, further generating heat production. 14The latter process is ineffective in preterm infants, because it depends on the amount of brown fat as well as levels of the enzymes 50/30-monodeiodinase and thermogenin, which build up only later in fetal development.13 Shivering is not regularly involved in a newborn's reaction to cold stress.16Another mechanism of heat production is infant behavior:10the irritable baby prompts the mother to hold the baby, drying, cuddling and swaddling him or her, thus preventingheat loss. Newborns are unable to maintain their body temperature on their own without thermal protection. Although a newborn's thermoregulation is as complex as in adults if not more sophisticated, as discussed above, their range of optimal or even tolerable body temperature is narrower. A newborn placed naked in an environment of 23 1C at birth suffers the same cold as does a naked adult at 0 1C. 17Without thermal protection, human neonates are functionally poikilothermic, that is, they change their body temperature according to environmental temperatures. In newborns placed in a colder environment, core temperaturedecreases at a rate 0.2 to 1.0 1C per minute and nally may lead to death from cessation of metabolic activities. 10 Pathophysiology of newborn hypothermia The World Health Organization (WHO) denes hypothermia as a temperature below and proposes the following classication:17Mild hypothermia, caused by cold stress, is classied as a body temperature range from 36 to 36.51C (96.8 to 97.7 1F) and is considered a cause for concern,17 because the exposed infant begins to lose more heat than he or she can produce.13Moderate hypothermia is a body temperature from32 to 36 1C (89.6 to 96.8 1F), indicating danger and requiring warming of the baby. According to the WHO classication, a body temperature of <32 1C (89.6 1F) is considered severe hypothermia, or cold injury, with a potentially grave outcome, and needs immediate skilled attention. Heat loss occurs in several ways. The most common scenario is that of a wet baby who is not dried, and in whom evaporation of fluid from the skin leads to heat loss. Evaporation often occurs withamniotic fluids during the rst minutes of life or with water after a baby is bathed. The energy loss is substantial: immediately at delivery, when the environmental temperature surrounding the baby drops from 37 1C in the maternal womb to the usually less warm air temperature, evaporative heat loss begins at a rate of 0.58 kcal ml /C01fluid evaporated.10 A baby placed naked on a cold surface loses heat through conduction. A newborn exposed to cool surrounding air or draughts will lose heat through convection. Radiation from cool objects next to the baby (for example, a cold wall) can also lower its body temperature. Unlike in adults, sweat secretion has little orno role in the thermoregulation of a newborn or preterm baby. 18 As all data on hypothermia are from observational studies and prospective randomized trials without treating hypothermia are not permissive, the direction of causality for factors associated with hypothermia is not entirely clear. Some argue that lowering body temperatures might increase metabolic processes to generate heat, which could lead to hypoglycemia and hypoxia in response to increasing energy demands.13As hypothermia and hypoglycemia both exacerbate hypoxia, this would reinforce a vicious circle19and could on one hand explain the mortality associated with hypothermia. However, studies have shown that hypothermia is not a risk factor for neonatal hypoglycemia in analyses adjusted for confounders such as LBW or anemia.20On the other hand, hypoglycemia is common among newborns in resource-limited settings20and, instead of being a consequence, could rather be a cause of hypothermia. Similarly, with regard to the reported associations of hypothermia with infections and organ failure,21,22hypothermia might be either a consequence or a cause of severe infections. Clinically, hypothermia is an indicator for severe infectionsanalogous to hyperthermia, or fever. In fact, neonatal hypothermia is associated in an unclear direction of causality with various pathologies such as surfactant inactivation, increased morbidity from infection, abnormal coagulation, delayed readjustment from the fetal to newborn circulation, hyaline membrane disease and intraventricular hemorrhage in LBW infants. 23 In contrast, mild therapeutic hypothermia has emerged as a neuroprotective strategy in the treatment of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Recent randomized controlled trials have shownthat therapeutic hypothermia initiated within 6 h of birth reduces death and disability in these infants. 24Induced under controlled clinical conditions, therapeutic hypothermia has been discussed asThermal protection of the newborn K Lunze and DH Hamer 318 Journal of Perinatologybeing benecial and outweighing the adverse effects in term newborns with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy25and during or after cardiac surgery.26 Neonatal hyperthermia Heat is transferred in utero via the placenta through umbilical arterial blood flow and via the uterus through amniotic fluid to the fetus.14At birth, fetal temperature is usually 0.5 to 1.0 1C higher than the mother's27and increases not only with elevated maternal temperatures due to prolonged labor, prolonged rupture of the membranes or other infectious etiologies (chorioamnionitis, urinary tract infection, and so on), but also with nulliparity and epidural analgesia.28 The most common cause of elevation of body temperature in the newborn is dehydration.29Rehydration is both therapeutic and diagnostic if the newborn improves. Elevated temperatures in the neonate rarely reflect intrauterine or perinatal infections. Among the 1 to 2.5% of newborns presenting with hyperthermia, <10% have culture-proven sepsis.10In septic newborns, temperature instability more frequently presents as hypothermia. The exact mechanisms that lead to fever in some septic neonates and normal body temperatures in others are ill understood. Infection is thought to produce fever mediated through cytokines such as interleukin1. Antipyretics are effective in reducing the temperature by modifying the central set-point of the hypothalamus. In hyperthermia due to environmental overheating, antipyretics are ineffective, and newborns are appropriately managed by reducing the environmental heat exposure. Central malformations and intracranial hemorrhages, or congenital pathologies such as syndrome,30are rare causes of newborn hyperthermia. Where thermoprotective devices are used, inappropriate incubation and exposure to radiant warmers are common causes of neonatal hyperthermia,10especially when makeshift apparatuses such as light bulbs, hot stones, and so on, are used. These are usually not designed and tested for safety and efciency, and we discourage their use in favor of skin-to-skin care (SSC). Management of newborn hypothermia Qualitative inquiries into current thermal practices Although lack of equipment is a problem for high-risk neonates in resource-poor settings, knowledge of hypothermia diagnosis andmanagement is another concern. For example, only about half of 160 surveyed health care professionals in India could dene neonatal hypothermia correctly or considered it a signicant problem, and <20% knew how to correctly record a newborn's temperature. 31A multinational study showed that knowledge on thermal control, especially concerning the physiology of thermoregulation and criteria for dening hypothermia, wasinsufcient and thermal control practices were frequently inadequate.23 Qualitative research on newborn care can help shed light on the beliefs and attitudes underlying potentially detrimental or harmful practices. Most published studies indicate that high-risk home delivery and newborn care practices that lead to heat loss, such as insufcient heating of the birthplace, placing of the uncovered newborn on the ground or other cold surfaces, delayedwrappingFpartly with unclean clothes Fand early bathing, remain common in resource-limited settings both in rural and urban areas, in facilities and during home births. 5,32,33 Heating the birthplace is a critical issue for home births. Studies from Nepal reported that the birthplace was heated in only slightly over half of the settings,34often only after birth.35Wrapping the child prevents heat loss from evaporation, whereas bathing promotes heat loss. Less than half (46%) of the babies were wrapped within the rst 10 min after birth, and almost all of them were bathed within 10 min (89%) or half an hour (96%) after birth.34In another study, only 64% of the babies were observed to be wrapped within half an hour after birth, and almost all were bathed within 6 h after birth.35 In a study from Tanzania, the practice of bathing newborns immediately after delivery was shown to be motivated by concerns about 'ritual pollution'.36In Ghana, early bathing was linked to reducing body odor in later life, shaping the baby's head, and helping the baby sleep and feel clean, and informants felt that changing bathing behaviors would be difcult, especially as babies are bathed early in facilities.37A study from Dhaka, Bangladesh, explained that babies are typically bathed soon after birth to purify them from the birth process.38Several studies, from Uganda,39Ghana37and India40suggested that in the absence of health facilities prepared to deliver essential newborn care, community members would accept thermoprotective practices such as SSC. Clinical presentation It has been estimated that prompt recognition of hypothermia and re-warming of hypothermic infants will avert up to 40% of neonatal deaths.41Newborn hypothermia presents with a combination of low core temperature and cold skin, pallor (acrocyanosis), tachypnea (respiratory distress), hypotonia, lethargy or irritability, poor feeding or vomiting. The non-specicclinical presentation and the complex process of thermoregulation discussed above imply a number of differential diagnoses such as infectious etiologies, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage or other central nervous causes, hypoglycemia, endocrine causes, or (maternal) drug side effects. Other factors potentially underlying hypothermia include prematurity, cardiovascular diseases and other congenital anomalies.Thermal protection of the newborn K Lunze and DH Hamer 319 Journal of PerinatologyDiagnosis Initial assessment should include a history of the baby's exposure to cold and whether the baby has been appropriately clothed and protected.18Although a rectal digital thermometer is used in many studies as standard method to measure a newborn's core temperature, this measurement site is associated not only with discomfort and disturbance to the newborn, but also with risks such as rectal perforation and vagal stimulation with resulting arrhythmias, bradycardia and apnea.42 The axilla is a less invasive, alternative site that provides reasonably accurate measurements. Mercury-in-glass, gallium-in- glass, digital thermometer, analogous electric thermometer, chemical thermometer and infrared thermometer are all accurateinstrument options, with the latter being less hazardous and quicker than the former. 43Most developed institutions use tympanic thermometers, which have recently shown to be a quick and accurate method to measure a newborn's body temperature,44 whereas simple rectal thermometers are used in most resource-limited settings. WHO recommends frequent measurements, from every hour in a seriously ill baby, two to four times per day in a small or very small baby, to once daily in an infant progressing well. 18However, due to their cost, thermometers are often not available in low-resource environments. Moreover, illiteracy and inability to read Arabic numbers have been a challenge to thermometer use. In the absence of a measurement device, human touch of feet and abdomen has been used as a proxy for body temperature. Studies in India and Nepal have shown human touch to be reasonably reliable for the detection of hypothermia when health workers were trained for these investigations.45-49Mothers, however, seem to have a far lower sensitivity than health workers. Only 24% of mothers in India were able to correctly identify hypothermia.50 A device based on color indicators developed to detect hypothermia without the use of thermometers was previously found to accurately indicate hypothermia when used by health workers or mothers.51,52Its usefulness for some parts of the developing world and the feasibility for illiterate health workers to read the device have been debated.53,54 Therapeutic goals of thermal care The therapeutic goal of thermal care is to keep the newborn in the thermoneutral zone, or thermal neutrality, the environmentaltemperature range in which the organism has least oxygen consumption. 9No single environmental temperature is optimal for all babies. In general, the smaller and more premature a newborn is, the less its ability to regulate cold and heat. The optimal environmental temperature thus depends on the maturity (usually estimated by the gestational age) and age of the newborn. Weight, body temperature and skin perfusion as well as clothing of theinfant and air humidity also factor in, so that the optimal environmental temperature can be hard to determine. It is narrow, especially in LBW or sick babies, and generally ranges from 32 to 361C.55It follows that a temperature appropriate for a healthy term baby can be too cold for a preterm infant (and, conversely, what is appropriate for the preterm infant can be too warm for the term baby). In general, most newborns at birth, if left wet and naked, cannot tolerate an environmental temperature of <32 1C. However, if the baby is immediately dried, put skin-to-skin with the mother and covered, the delivery room temperature can be as low as 25 to 28 1C.17 Prevention of newborn hypothermia WHO recognizes maintaining a normal body temperature as a primary principle of newborn care and recommends thermal protection for all infants, with special attention for sick, premature, or small for gestational age infants, for example, <2.5 kg at birth or born before 37 weeks gestation.18Several methods can be used for warming the baby and maintaining the baby's body temperature (Table 1). The WHO proposes a 'warm chain', a set of 10 interlinked procedures carried out at birth and during the following hours and days. To be implemented in institutions and (in an abridged form) at home, the warm chain aims to minimizethe risk of hypothermia in newborns, and includes warming the delivery room, immediate drying, SSC, early and exclusive breast- feeding, postponing bathing, appropriate clothing and bedding, placing mother and baby together, and in institutions warm transportation, warm resuscitation, and training and awareness raising. 17 WHO recommends warming the delivery place in preparation for a birth (to at least 25 1C) and to keep the birthplace free from draughts. After delivery, it is crucial to devote some attention to the baby. The rst and most substantial heat loss occurs through evaporation of amniotic fluid. Therefore, at birth, recommendedrst steps to prevent hypothermia are to immediately dry and cover the newborn, even before the cord is cut. While being dried, the baby should be on a warm surface, preferably the mother's chest or abdomen in skin-to-skin contact. The infant should then be clothed or covered, especially the head, 56and kept in a warm environment, again usually best with the mother. Bathing should be delayed. Draughts, cold surfaces or nearby cold sources such as windows or walls should be avoided as they contribute to heat loss via convection and radiation. Early breastfeeding, ideally within an hour after delivery, should be encouraged if possible and if not contraindicated. SSC with the mother, for LBW infants also known as kangaroo mother care, most of the time is appropriate to ensure thermal protection of the baby.57It requires minimal instructions and, when culturally accepted, can relatively easily be applied even in a community or home setting.58Thermal protection of the newborn K Lunze and DH Hamer 320 Journal of PerinatologyTreatment of newborn hypothermia According to current WHO guidelines for the treatment of cold babies, moderate hypothermia should be treated by SSC.18In severe hypothermia, rewarming the baby with an appropriate and available method in a health care facility setting is warranted, as close monitoring of vital signs including temperature and respiratory rate are essential parts of the management. Blood glucose should be controlled and hypoglycemia under 45 mg dl/C01 (2.6 mmol l/C01) should be treated accordingly. When treating for sepsis, all IV fluids should be given warm. The infant can be discharged once a stable normal temperature is sustained and there are no other issues. Upon discharge, the mother should be counseled to prevent hypothermia at home as discussed above. There is a relative scarcity of data documenting the effects of recommended thermal newborn care. A recent meta-analysis showed that SSC in conjunction with breastfeeding and recognition of danger signs substantially reduced neonatal mortality in hospital-born preterm babies (birth weight <2000 g) in hospital, and was highly effective in reducing severe morbidity, particularlyfrom infection. 59A study from Western India, in which 36.9% of hospitalized newborns were hypothermic, reported a decrease in this rate to 3.9% with kangaroo mother care.60However, in many countries there is resistance from health professionals, mothers and families related to local cultural practices.61Although evidence on the effectiveness of SSC in community-based settings is scarce,40,62 it is estimated that SSC can avert up to 20% of newborn deaths.63In the large Gadchiroli trial in India on home-based neonatal care assessing the outcome of sepsis management, case management included thermal protection of the newborn, andhealth care workers were given a thermometer, baby clothes and head cover, a blanket and a sleeping bag. Although the study included other interventions and was not specically designed to prove a particular effect for hypothermia management, it showed a reduction in neonatal and infant mortality by nearly 50% among a malnourished, illiterate and rural study population. 64A study from Nepal that found a high incidence of hypothermia suggests that simple interventions including immediate drying and another treatment (breast contact, radiant heater and mustard oil massage, or swaddling with an inner layer of plastic wrap) could lower the incidence of hypothermia 2 h after birth from 78 to 23% and 24 hafter birth from 49 to 18%. 65In Zambia, we recently showed that training traditional birth attendants in newborn care with special emphasis on resuscitation and simple thermal protection (wiping the newborn dry and wrapping the dried infant in a separate piece of cloth) along with an intervention to provide early treatment of possible sepsis reduced mortality rates at day 28 after birth by 45%.66 Low-cost, low-tech treatment of newborn hypothermia The use of incubators for thermal protection of newborns has been reported for more than 150 years, since the Parisian obstetrician Jean Louis Paul Denuce \u00b4in 1857 engineered his couveuse, a deviceTable 1 Management of hypothermia, modied from WHO 200318 Method Selection and use Advantages Risks or disadvantages Availability SSC by mother or other personManagement of stable babies with moderate hypothermia, and forhypothermia preventionMother can closely monitor other person can provide SSCNot appropriate for critical conditionsHome and institutional Kangaroo mother care with LBW babiesManagement of stable LBW babies weighing 1.5-2.5 kg, and forhypothermia preventionMother can closely monitor.

In 1878, his local colleague Ste\u00b4phane Tarnier, using a modied warming chamber for the rearing of poultry, found a decrease in neonatal death rate from 66 to 38% among infants with birth weights <2000 g.67 Today, postnatal care devices (isolettes or infant warmers) combine the features of incubators and radiant warmer beds and have evolved with many features, including automated temperature and humidity regulations,68oxygen supplementation and light therapy.11,69Although benecial in resource-replete settings,70 utilization of their complex features requires electricity,concentrated oxygen supply, centralized suction and ongoing skilled maintenance. Priced at about US$15 000 to $36 000, 71these devices are not affordable for most of the developing world. Simplied versions, such as water-lled mattresses or Indian made, low-cost radiant warmers are power-dependent and not appropriate for resource-limited settings. Polyethylene occlusive skin wrapping is a useful and effective method for delivery room management,72 but mostly limited to immediate post-delivery care and protectionduring transport. A number of postnatal care devices for resource-limited settings are currently in development, some including more sophisticated temperature and humidity regulations. Examples are the 'mkat,' 'Life Raft Incubator,' and 'Neo.nurture', projected to be priced between US $200 and US $625 per unit. 73The 'Embrace Global', projected to be priced at a US $25 price, is a life vest style incubator in a 'sleeping bag' design.74The heat source is a pouch-containing phase change material, which keeps its temperature relatively constant over an extended period of time. The pouch is warmedelectrically or by the user simply pouring hot water into a compartment, upon indication by a thermal strip. It can fully open to double as a heat mattress. With some models electricity independent, it can be used both at the institutional and community levels, and serve as visual reminders to mothers and other caretakers, birth attendants and health care workers. Devices such as these, although more costly than education alone, might thus foster improved hypothermia management by transporting a behavioral message to the end user, for example, promoting SSC. Distributed commercially or donated, they could help to raise awareness and enhance perception of the burden of newbornhypothermia. Conclusions Thermal protection of the newborn can relatively easily be achieved by warming of the delivery room, immediate drying, wrapping the infant after birth and keeping him or her in close contact with the mother, that is, kangaroo mother care or SSC, immediate and frequent exclusive breastfeeding, delaying of bathing until the infant is physiologically stable, and appropriate warm clothing. These behavior steps represent simple, low-cost measures, whichshould be integrated into holistic mother and child health packages. Birth practices even in high-risk environments remain poor, so that interventions must primarily focus on participatory education about hygiene, infection prevention and management, as well as practices to avoid hypothermia. Low-cost, low-technology devices might be helpful in supporting and implementing these practices. Clinical effectiveness and implementation trials will have toinvestigate which intervention packages and messages for the thermal protection for newborns work best in a given environment, and how to optimally integrate them into existing maternal and newborn health programs.

Magnani, MD,a,bCarlee MA,cJoanne PhD,e,fand Emelia J. Benjamin, MD, ScMa,b,g,hFramingham, Boston, and Charlestown, MA Background Early menopausal age is associated with risk of cardiovascular events including myocardial infraction, stroke, and increased mortality. Relations between menopausal age and atrial fibrillation (AF) have not been investigated.We examined the association between menopausal age and AF. Methods Framingham Heart Study women 60 years old without prevalent AF and natural menopause were followed up for 10 years or until incident AF. Menopausal age was modeled as a continuous variable and by categories ( b45, 45-53, and N53 years). We used Cox proportional hazards regression to determine associations between menopausal age and AF risk. Results In 1,809 Framingham women (2,662 person-examinations, mean baseline age 71.4 \u00b1 7.6 years, menopausal age 49.8 \u00b1 3.6 years), there were 273 unique participants with incident AF. We did not identify a significant associationbetween the SD of menopausal age (3.6 years) and AF (hazard ratio [HR] per SD 0.94, 95% CI 0.83-1.06; P= .29). In a multivariable model with established risk factors for AF, menopausal age was not associated with incident AF (HR per SD 0.97, 95% CI 0.86-1.09; P= .60). Examining categorical menopausal age, earlier menopausal age ( b45 years) was not significantly associated with increased AF risk compared with older menopausal age N53 years (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.74-1.94; P= .52) or menopausal age 45 to 53 years (HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.93-2.04; P= .11). Conclusion In our moderate-sized, community-based sample, we did not identify menopausal age as significantly increasing AF risk. However, future larger studies will need to examine whether there is a small effect of menopausal age on AFrisk. (Am Heart J 2012;163:729-34.) Younger age at menopause has been associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, andmortality. 1,2In the Nurse's Health Study, menopausalageb40 years and early menopause (age 40-44 years) were associated with up to 1.5- and 1.4-fold increased riskof cardiovascular events compared with menopause 55 years. 3Conversely, older menopausal age ( 53 years) has been related to decreased mortality secondary toischemic heart disease. 4Prospective cohort studies have further related earlier age of menopause toincreased risk for all-cause mortality. 2,5,6 Given the association between menopausal age and cardiovascular events, we sought to examine the relationbetween age of menopause and atrial brillation (AF). Atrial brillation has profound social and medical burdens, increasing mortality and eliminating the survivaladvantage that women have over men. 7Identifying risk factors for AF in women therefore has signi cant public health importance.8To our knowledge, the association between AF and age of menopause has had limitedinvestigation. We considered that the myriad endocrino-logic and vascular changes accompanying menopausewould predispose women toward increased AF risk. Weconsequently hypothesized an increased risk of AF forwomen experiencing menopause at a younger age and, inparticular, that cardiac events may mediate the increasedrisk for developing AF.From theaNational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's and Boston University's Framingham Heart Study, Framingham, MA,bSection of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston University, Boston, MA,cDepartment of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA,dSection of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston University, Boston, MA,eCardiovascular Research Center, Massachu- setts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA,fCardiac Arrhythmia Service, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA,gPreventive Medicine Section, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, andhEpidemiology Department, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA.Dr. Magnani is supported by American Heart Association Award 09FTF219028.

To have 10-year follow-up, the present study used data from women attending the original cohort examination cycles 11 (1968- 1971), 17 (1981-1984), and 23 (1992-1996), and offspring cohort examination cycles 1 (1971-1975), 3 (1983-1987), and 6 (1995- 1998). Participants were included in the present analysis when they reached 60 years or older. Age 60 years was used as the minimum age because women were expected to have reached menopause by that age. Before exclusions, the sample was composed of 4,159 participant examinations. Participants were excluded if they had prevalent AF (n = 180), that is, been diagnosed with AF before study entry at 60 years of age; unreliable age of natural menopause secondary to oophorecto- my with or without hysterectomy (n = 1,190); unknown age of menopause (n = 1); menopausal age b40 years (deemed premature ovarian failure,10n = 39); estrogen use before menstrual cessation (n = 17); or lacked complete data on key AF risk factors (n = 70). We used cross-sectional pooling to construct the data set consistent with previous Framingham Heart Study analyses of AF,11such that study participants without incident AF included in the analysis were eligible to reenter the analysis for subsequent 10-year intervals. Study participants were followed up prospectively for incident AF for a maximum duration of 10 years after each baseline examination. Participants providedwritten informed consent at each examination. Study protocols and all examination cycles were approved by the institutional review board of the Boston University Medical Center. Clinical assessments Participants underwent a physician-administered medical interview, history, and examination at each Framingham Heart Study examination.12Body mass index was calculated from weight in kilograms divided by height in square meters and systolic blood pressure as the mean of 2 seated measurements obtained during a standardized examination. Hypertension treatment was established by self-report of prescribed medica- tions. Heart murmurs of clinical signi cance were scored as at least grade 3 of 6 systolic or any diastolic murmur recorded by a Framingham Heart Study physician at the standardized exami- nation. The electrocardiographic (ECG) PR interval was calculated from the 12-lead resting ECG as previously de- scribed.13Heart failure was adjudicated by 3 Framingham Heart Study physicians according to established major and minor criteria.14Covariates were selected for inclusion in the present analysis from a previously published AF risk prediction model.11 Atrial brillation was determined by presence of AF or atrial flutter on ECG or Holter monitoring obtained at a Framingham Heart Study examination, external clinician visit, or during hospitalization, and all available outside visits to clinicians for cardiovascular diagnoses. Incident AF was adjudicated by at least 2 Framingham Heart Study cardiologists.Age of menopause Age of natural menopause was established by a standardized, physician-administered interview at each examination. Women were queried about their menstrual status, whether periods had stopped for 1 year or more; age periods stopped, cause, de ned as natural, surgical or other; history of gynecologic surgery (hysterectomy and oophorectomy, including number of ovaries removed); and use of hormone-replacement therapies. Natural menopause was de ned as the natural cessation of menses for 1 year. Menopausal age was categorized as age b45, 45 to 53, andN53 years after examining the distribution of menopausal age in a prior Framingham Heart Study analysis.15Women with a history of surgical cessation of menstrual periods were excluded because of lack of reliability of ascertaining menopausal age, consistent with prior Framingham Heart Study analyses of menopausal age as an exposure for cardiovascular outcomes.16 Statistical analyses We summarized continuous variables with means, SDs, medians, and interquartile ranges and examined distributions graphically. Distributions of categorical variables were exam- ined by frequency. Menopausal age was modeled as a continuous measure (in years) and using categories de ned by age cutpoints: b45, 45 to 53, and N53 years. Atrial brillation incidence rates were determined by determining the number of events per menopausal age category per 1000 person-years. The association between the SD of menopausal age and incident AF was determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with censoring at 10 years. Models were adjusted for risk factors associated with AF, including body mass index, systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment, PR interval, signi cant murmur, and prevalent heart failure. Age was not included in the model because of its collinearity with age of menopause. Risk factors were measured for participants entering each 10-year risk assess- ment at the baseline examination. We then constructed cumulative incidence curves using menopausal age as a categorical variable. A 2-sided Pvalue of b.05 was considered statistically signi cant, and all analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Results The study cohort consisted of 1,809 unique Framing- ham Heart Study participants with 2,662 examinations.The mean age was 71.4 \u00b1 7.6 years, and the mean age atnatural menopause was 49.8 \u00b1 3.6 years ( Table I ). There were 273 incident AF events in follow-up. The unadjustedincidence rates per 1000 person-years were 15.8 in the menopausal age b45 years category, compared with 11.5 and 13.3 in the menopausal age 45 to 53 and N53 years categories ( P= .24 between different age categories) (Table II ). When examining menopausal age as a continuous variable, we did not observe a statistically signi cant730 Magnani et alAmerican Heart Journal April 2012association between menopausal age and risk of incident AF (P= .29). Similarly, when examining menopausal age categories, earlier menopausal age ( b45) was not associated with increased AF risk compared with oldermenopausal age N53 years ( P= .52) or when compared with menopausal age 45 to 53 years ( P= .11). In multivariable analysis incor porating established risk factors for AF, age of menopause was not signi - cantly associated with incident AF in the above analyses (Table III ). The cumulative incidence curves demonstrated no signicant differences in incident AF across the 3 categories of menopausal age over 10-year follow-up(Figure 1 ). The log-rank test did not reach statistical signicance as well ( P= .24). Following the above results, we conducted an analysis to determine the effect size that we werepowered to detect. Assuming 80% power and given ournumber of observed AF events, we would haverequired a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.84 to observe a signicant association between increasing menopausal age and decreased risk of incident AF. In contrast, ourobserved HR was 0.93.Discussion We hypothesized an association between menopausal age and 10-year risk of incident AF in a prospective, community-based cohort and, speci cally, that decreased age of menopause would result in increased incident AFrisk. Our hypothesis stemmed from the establishedassociation between earlier menopausal age and aug-mented risk for cardiovascular events. A second rationale was the cardiovascular adaptation and remodeling by complex vascular and endocrinologicTable I.

Hypertensionincreases in prevalence as women age, 18is common across ethnic and racial groups,19,20and is a chief risk factor for AF in community-based studies.21,22Hyperten- sion has been associated with increased left ventricularhypertrophy and mass in postmenopausal women 23and increases risk for heart failure.24Both hypertension and heart failure are associated with AF.25Obesity has risen in prevalence in adults, and in the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 33.6% ofwomen 60 years old had a mean body mass index of 30 kg/m 2.26Menopause results in redistribution of fat depots,27including epicardial fat,28which has been demonstrated as associated with increased risk for AF.29 The interaction of such diverse anthropometric andclinical factors with AF risk in postmenopausal womenmerits continued investigation. The nal rationale for our hypothesis was the association between menopause and risk factors for AF. Inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein) are associ- ated with increased risk of cardiovascular events inwomen, 30-32have been related to menopausal status,33 and similarly have been associated with AF.34Postmen- opausal hematologic changes include increased hemato-crit, greater plasma viscosity, and higher brinogen levels, which may enhance risk for cardiovascular diseaseand AF 35; in the Women's Health Study, brinogen has recently been associated with increased AF risk.36 Sex-speci c differences in the incidence of AF and cardiac arrhythmias are well described,37,38and epidemi- ologic data have observed that AF is less prevalent in women than men.39Incident AF, in general, occurs at an older age in women than men.21Sex differences in atrial electrophysiology are demonstrated by decreased noninvasive assessment of atrial electrophys- iologic function \u2014in with men. 40The study of sex-speci c electrophysiologic differences from hormonal in fluences, speci cally estrogen, is ongoing. Estrogen receptors have been in animal andhuman cardiac structures. 41,42Mice receiving ovariecto- mies had decreased atrioventricular nodal conduction, as measured by PR and AH intervals, compared with those receiving estrogen or intact animals.43In human studies, there is age-associated methylation of the estrogenreceptor gene alpha in atrial tissue, suggesting down-regulation of estrogen receptor expression. 44Modeling of cellular differences in cardiac repolarization has demon-strated female cells having increased potential forarrhythmogenic early after depolarizations comparedwith male cells. 45 Further studies are necessary to assess other cardiovas- cular markers (eg, natriuretic peptides, left atrial param-eters, P wave indices), their association with menopausal age, and if they modify AF risk in postmenopausalwomen. Remaining questions concern estrogen expo-sure, receptor activity, and modi cation of atrial electro- physiology across the spectrum of menopause. Our study has multiple strengths. It was conducted in a community-based cohort with routine examinationsoccurring every 2 to 8 years. Such frequent contactprovided an opportunity for longitudinal assessments andfacilitated the cross-sectional pooling used in this study.We included participants only 60 years old, thereby verifying that all participants had achieved menopause, and facilitated follow-up in older age when participantswere at increased risk for incident AF. Participants withmenopausal age b40 years were excluded because of concern for premature ovarian failure. In addition, theFramingham Heart Study's routine collection of variedmedical and clinical records yielded the identi cation of incident AF. The present study has several limitations. Framingham Heart Study participants were mostly older andprimarily of European descent; the generalizability of ourndings to younger women and other races and ethnicities is unknown, particularly given racial differ-ences in AF incidence. 46,47A chief limitation is our lack of power given our sample size and number of incidentevents. A larger cohort may have a greater number ofevents, thereby obtaining higher power and the abilityto determine smaller risks between menopausal age andincident AF. In fact, we determined that our studywould have required approximately 1,400 events inorder for the HR of 0.93 to reach statistical signi cance. Furthermore, we did not examine postmenopausal hormone-replacement therapy and its potential effects on AF risk. Inclusion of hormone use will be essentialfor larger studies exploring the association betweenmenopause and AF. Our results may further suffer fromrecall bias in reporting age of natural menopause.However, as we recorded age of menopause before thedevelopment of AF, such recall bias is unlikely to bebiased by occurrence of AF. Such random misclassi ca- tion would have biased our results toward the null. It isalso possible that women had unrecognized episodes ofparoxysmal AF, resulting in misclassi cation of outcome status. More extensive rhythm monitoring, challenging in a community-based study, would be necessary tocapture paroxysmal AF. To our knowledge, the present study is the rst to examine the relation between menopausal age andincident AF. Although we did not observe a signi cant association between menopausal age and AF risk,studies in larger cohorts may have increased power toexplore such a potential association. Atrial brillation carries tremendous social and medical burdens, and thenumber of older adults in the United States continues732 Magnani et alAmerican Heart Journal April 2012to increase. Identi cation of novel risk factors will serve public health efforts by enhancing risk strati cation and prevention initiatives. References 1. Gordon T, Kannel WB, Hjortland MC, et al.

Kraemer, Richard Saitz, Kendall J. Bryant, and David A. Fiellin Background: Brief measures of unhealthy alcohol use have not been well validated among people with HIV. We compared the Alcohol Use Disorders Identication Test (AUDIT) to reference stan- dards for unhealthy alcohol use based on 30-day Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) and Composite Inter- national Diagnostic Interview \u2014Substance Abuse Module (CIDI-SAM), among 837 male HIV-infected and -uninfected patients in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study. Methods: Three reference standards were (i) Risky drinking \u2014b a s e do nT L F B >14 drinks over 7 consecutive days or >4 drinks on 1 day; (ii) Alcohol dependence \u2014based on a CIDI-SAM diagnosis; and (iii) Unhealthy alcohol use \u2014risky drinking or a CIDI-SAM diagnosis of abuse or dependence. Various cutos for the AUDIT, AUDIT-C, and heavy episodic drinking were compared with the reference standards. Results: Mean age of patients was 52 years, 53% (444) were HIV-infected, and 53% (444) were African American. Among HIV-infected and -uninfected patients, the prevalence of risky drinking (14 vs. 12%, respectively), alcohol dependence (8 vs. 7%), and unhealthy alcohol use (22 vs. 20%) was simi- lar. For risky drinking and alcohol dependence, multiple cutos of AUDIT, AUDIT-C, and heavy episodic drinking provided good sensitivity ( /C2180%) and specicity ( /C2190%). For unhealthy alcohol use, few cutos provided sensitivity /C2180%; however, many cutos provided good specicity. For all 3 alcohol screening measures, sensitivity improved when heavy episodic drinking was included with the cuto. Sensitivity of measures for risky drinking and unhealthy alcohol use was lower in HIV-infected than in uninfected patients. Conclusions: For identifying risky drinking, alcohol dependence, and unhealthy alcohol use, AUDIT-C performs as well as AUDIT and similarly in HIV-infected and -uninfected patients. Cutos should be based on the importance of specic operating characteristics for the intended research or clin- ical use. Incorporating heavy episodic drinking increased sensitivity for detecting alcohol dependence and unhealthy alcohol use. Key Words: AUDIT, HIV, Veterans, Alcohol-Related Disorders, Mass Screening. \"UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL USE\" includes any amount of drinking above \"low risk\" drinking andspecically includes risky drinking, alcohol abuse, and alco- hol dependence (Bradley et al., 2009; Saitz, 2005). Unhealthy alcohol use is common in HIV-infected individuals and con- tributes to adverse health consequences (Conigliaro et al., 2003; Saitz, 2005). Alcohol consumption can influence HIV disease progression by impacting patients' adherence and response to antiretroviral treatment (Baum et al., 2010; Samet et al., 2006). Despite these ndings, and the potential that even low levels of alcohol consumption may cause harm among those infected with HIV (Braithwaite and Bryant, 2010; Sullivan et al., 2011), there are no detailed studies com- paring the operating characteristics of standard alcohol screening measures between HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals or validating the use of alcohol screening mea- sures and identifying appropriate cutos to use for HIV- infected patients. This creates a problem for researchers and clinicians in deciding which measures should be used to iden- tify and characterize unhealthy alcohol use among HIV- infected individuals. To conduct meaningful research on alcohol use and related consequences in those with HIV infection and to identify patients who may benet from counseling or phar- macologic interventions, researchers and clinicians need valid and feasible measures for identifying unhealthy alcoholFrom the Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion (KAM), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsbur gh, Pennsylvania; Division of General Internal Medicine (ACJ, DAF), Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut; Veterans Aging Cohort Study Coordinating Center (ACJ, DAF), West Haven VA Healthcare System, West Haven, Connecticut; Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (ACJ, DAF), Yale University School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecti- cut; Department of Medicine (KLK), Center for Research on Health Care, Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Department of Medicine (RS), Clinical Addic- tion Research and Education (CARE) Unit, Section of General Internal Medicine, Boston Medical Center and Boston University School of Medi- cine, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Epidemiology (RS), Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts; and National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (KJB), Bethesda, Maryland.

For instance, certain pharmacotherapies are indicated primarily for those who meet criteria for alcohol dependence.There are many instruments designed to identify those whomay be at increased risk for unhealthy alcohol use, including brief screening measures such as the Alcohol Use Disorders Identication Test (AUDIT; Babor et al., 1989). More time-intensive methods such as the 30-day Timeline Follow Back(TLFB; Sobell et al., 1988a) and the Composite Interna-tional Diagnostic Interview \u2014Substance Abuse Module (CIDI-SAM; Compton, 1993) provide more denitive infor-mation about unhealthy alcohol use. Many prior studieshave evaluated the use of the AUDIT for identifying various types of unhealthy alcohol use and have identied appropri- ate cutos to use in various populations (Babor et al., 1989;Bradley et al., 1998a,b; Gordon et Gual Reinert 2002; Rubinsky et al., 2010;Saunders et al., 1993; Schmidt et al., 1995) but not in anHIV-infected population. The aim of this research was to determine the performance of various screening instruments and thresholds for 3 types of alcohol use in a large cohort of HIV-infected and -unin- fected patients receiving primary care. The 3 drinkingcategories evaluated are (i) risky drinking (Fleming, 2004/2005), (ii) alcohol dependence (Diagnostic and StatisticalManual of Mental Disorders [DSM]), and (iii) unhealthyalcohol use (Saitz, 2005). MATERIALS AND METHODS Setting and Subjects Subjects were male participants of the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS), a prospective multisite observational study focusedon the role of alcohol use on health in HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals (Justice et al., 2006a), funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. VACS is an ongoing study con-ducted at 8 Veterans Aairs facilities (Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore,Maryland; Bronx, New York; Houston, Texas; Los Angeles, Cali- fornia; New York City, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Washington, District of Columbia). HIV-infected individuals arerecruited from Infectious Disease clinics that provide primary medi-cal care at the participating sites. All HIV-infected patients present- ing to each participating site are eligible. Uninfected controls are recruited from the General Internal Medicine clinics at the samesites and are matched to the demographics of the HIV-infected sub- jects on 5-year age blocks, race/ethnicity, and gender. Subjects in this analysis are 837 male VACS participants enrolled from June2002 to February 2004 who were part of a substudy designed toassess alcohol use and the validity of alcohol screening measures. VACS participants were asked to participate in the substudy if they had reported having at least 1 alcoholic drink in the past year. Thestudy was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each site. Measures of Alcohol Use Collected in VACS The AUDIT was collected via self-administered paper survey at the 1-year follow-up (Babor et al., 1989). The CIDI-SAM and 30-day TLFB were administered via telephone interview shortly after the 1-year follow-up paper survey. The CIDI-SAM operationalizes the diagnostic criteria DSM-III, DSM-III-R, of psychoactive substance use disor-ders (Compton, 1993; Kessler et al., 1998). CIDI-SAM data were used to identify both lifetime and current (past 12 month) alcoholabuse and dependence disorders. The alcohol 30-day TLFB, a vali- dated calendar-based method whereby subjects provide retrospec- tive estimates of their daily drinking was used to collect informationon alcohol consumption over the 30 days prior to the telephone interview. The TLFB has been evaluated in clinical and nonclinical populations and is validated when administered in person and bytelephone (Maisto et al., Gordon et al., 2001; Reinert and Allen, 2002; Saunders et al., 1993; Schmidt et al., 1995) was administered during the 1-year follow-up survey andincludes the 3-item AUDIT-C, an instrument that consists of the 3consumption items of the AUDIT (Bush et al., 1998; Dawson et al., 2005; Gual et al., 2002). The AUDIT-C has similar sensitivities and specicities for identifying unhealthy alcohol use to the AUDIT(Bradley et al., 1998a,b; Gual et al., 2002) yet is shorter. We used the third item of the AUDIT, which asks: \"How often do you have 6 or more drinks on 1 occasion?\" with response oralmost daily\" to identify patients with heavy episodic drinking. Those who indicated that they consumed 6 or more drinks (chose response option of \"less than monthly\" or more frequently) wereclassied as \"ever\" heavy episodic drinkers. Heavy episodic drinkinghas been associated with many adverse health eects including injuries, 1995; Naimi et al., 2003;Raj et al., 2009), and among those with HIV, it has been associated with decreased medication adherence (Braithwaite et al., 2008). To determine whether we could improve the performance of theAUDIT and AUDIT-C measures with reference standard measuresby incorporating the single heavy episodic drinking item from the AUDIT, we also created composite measures that were positive if the AUDIT measure was greater than a specied cuto orif the per- son reported any heavy episodic drinking in the past year. Thesemeasures represent a broader spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use than do an AUDIT cuto or heavy episodic drinking alone. We used ICD-9 codes to identify subjects diagnosed with alcohol dependence. We also used ICD-9 codes to identify subjects with analcohol-related diagnosis, which included ICD-9 codes reflecting alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, or problems stemming from excessive alcohol consumption (e.g., alcoholic cirrhosis). The alco-hol-related diagnosis ICD-9 codes used were based on the work of Piette and are listed on the VACS web site (www.vacohort.org) (Jus- tice et al., 2006b; Piette et al., 1998). Patients were considered tohave a diagnosis of alcohol dependence or an alcohol-related diag-nosis if they had at least 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient alcohol-related ICD-9 codes ever and within the 12 months prior to and including the date of the follow-up telephone interview. Requiring at least 1inpatient or 2 outpatient ICD-9 codes has been shown to improvethe accuracy of these codes (Justice et al., 2006b). Alcohol Reference Measures for Risky Drinking, Dependence, and Unhealthy Use We used established reference standards (\"gold standards\") for risky drinking, alcohol dependence, and unhealthy alcohol use.The reference standard for risky drinking was based on the 30- day TLFB assessment of amounts that increase the risk for health consequences. We dened risky drinking as consuming>14 drinks over any consecutive 7-day period or >4d r i n k si n 1 day based on the guidelines recommended by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism to identify those at risk for alcohol-related problems (Fleming, 2004/2005). The refer-ence standard for past year alcohol dependence was based on the CIDI-SAM diagnosis of dependence. We chose to use a depen- dence-only reference measure instead of dependence/abuse2 MCGINNIS ET AL.because certain treatments and pharmacotherapies are indicated primarily for those who meet criteria for alcohol dependence.Unhealthy alcohol use in the past year w a sd e n e da sh a v i n ga CIDI-SAM diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence in the past year or meeting criteria for risky drinking based on TLFB inter-view. Analysis We describe demographic characteristics for the VACS partici- pants who completed the CIDI-SAM. Using the 3 reference mea- sures, we calculated sensitivity, specicity, positive predictive value(PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), percent agreement, andkappa statistics for measures of alcohol use for both HIV-infected and -uninfected participants. We compared the following alcohol measures to the reference standard for risky drinking and unhealthyalcohol use: AUDIT, AUDIT-C, heavy episodic drinking, AUDIT or heavy episodic drinking, and AUDIT-C or heavy episodic drink- ing. For the unhealthy alcohol use reference standard, we also com-pared ICD-9 diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence in the pastyear. We compared those measures as well as the following mea- sures to the reference standard for dependence: ICD-9 codes for alcohol diagnoses and an AUDIT dependence score (from items 4to 6 of the AUDIT). The AUDIT and AUDIT-C cutos tested arebased on prior research (Babor et al., 1989; Bradley et al., 1998b). Analyses were carried out using Stata 10.0 (College Station, TX). RESULTS Subject Characteristics All subjects were men. Age and percentage with HIV were similar between the substudy sample ( n=837) and the entire VACS cohort ( n=6,467), although those in the analytic sample were more likely to be White than overall VACS par- ticipants (33 vs. 22%). Of the 837 in the analytic sample, halfwere HIV-infected, which is consistent with the study designtarget to recruit a similar number of HIV-infected and-uninfected patients. Race/ethnicity was 8% Hispanic, 33% and 5% other. How-ever, compared with uninfected subjects, HIV-infected were younger (average age, 50 vs. 54 years). On the basis of the TLFB, 13% reported risky drinking amounts in the past 30 days. Seven percent of subjects metcriteria for past year alcohol dependence based on the CIDI-SAM. On the basis of a combination of TLFB-determinedrisky amounts and CIDI-SAM-determined alcohol use dis-orders, 21% had unhealthy alcohol use. The prevalence ofvarious levels of unhealthy use and alcohol measures is shown in Table 1, and there are no statistically signicant dierences in these alcohol measures between HIV-infectedand -uninfected subjects. Alcohol Screening Measures and Risky Drinking For HIV-infected and -uninfected subjects, sensitivity was 80% or greater between the TLFB reference standard for risky drinking and the following measures and cutos: AUDIT 4 +(80 vs. 86%), AUDIT 5 +or heavy episodicdrinking (83 vs. 84%), AUDIT 4 +or heavy episodic drinking vs. 90%) AUDIT-C 3 +(83 vs. 90%), AUDIT- (83 vs. 88%), and AUDIT- C3+or heavy episodic drinking (85 vs. 94%). Specicity was 90% or greater for AUDIT 8 +(92 vs. 94%), AUDIT 7 + (90 vs. 92%), +(96 vs. 95%), AUDIT-C 5 +(92 vs. 94%), heavy episodic drinking less than monthly (94 vs.94%), and at least monthly heavy episodic drinking (98 vs. 97%) (Table 2). The kappa statistics for these comparisons ranged from 0.28 to 0.61, indicating fair to moderate agree-ment (Landis and Koch, 1977). Alcohol Screening Measures and Alcohol Dependence For HIV-infected and -uninfected subjects, sensitivity was 80% or greater between the CIDI-SAM reference standard,for alcohol dependence in past year, and the following mea- sures and cutos: AUDIT 4 +(83 vs. 81%), AUDIT 8 +or heavy episodic drinking (83 vs. 78%), AUDIT 7 +or heavy episodic drinking (83 vs. 81%), AUDIT 6 +or heavy episodicTable 1.

Among HIV-uninfected, the kappa statistics are 0.06 and0.10 for the alcohol-related ICD-9 diagnosis and dependence alone, respectively. Otherwise, kappa statistics ranged from0.17 to 0.43 indicating slight to moderate agreement (Landisand Koch, 1977). Alcohol Screening Measures and Unhealthy Alcohol Use For HIV-infected and -uninfected subjects, sensitivity was 80% or greater between the reference standard for unhealthyalcohol use and the following measures and cutos: AUDIT-C2+(86 vs. 96%) and AUDIT-C 3 +or heavy episodic (71 vs. 83%). Specicity was 90% or greater forAUDIT 8 97%), AUDIT-C 5 + (94 vs. 96%), heavy episodic drinking less than monthly(96 vs. 95%), at least monthly heavy episodic drinking (99vs. 98%), and alcohol-related ICD-9 diagnosis (94 vs. 92%)(Table 4). For the alcohol-related ICD-9 diagnosis, kappastatistics are 0.16 and 0.02 for HIV-infected and -uninfectedrespectively. Otherwise, kappa statistics range from 0.27 to0.57 indicating fair to moderate agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977). DISCUSSION In this sample, the prevalence of various types of unhealthy alcohol use were similar among HIV-infected and-uninfected adults. Compared with the reference standards,the AUDIT-C can identify risky drinking and unhealthy alcohol use with over 80% sensitivity at the best-performing cutos among both HIV-infected and -uninfected patients.Using the AUDIT-C combined with any heavy episodicdrinking in the past year (item 3 of the AUDIT-C) improvessensitivity for detecting both risky and unhealthy alcohol usecompared with using the AUDIT-C alone. High specicityfor risky drinking and unhealthy alcohol use can be obtainedusing various AUDIT-C cutos and even using the heavy episodic drinking single-item question alone. We note that sensitivity is higher for most cutos for risky drinking thanfor unhealthy alcohol use. We believe this is because alcoholabuse and dependence are included in the denition forunhealthy alcohol use, and they may be more dicult todetect with AUDIT-based measures than risky drinkingalone. For both risky drinking and unhealthy alcohol use,many cutos provide moderate agreement or better based on the kappa statistics. For identifying those with alcohol dependence, the AUDIT performs better than the AUDIT-C and combiningheavy episodic drinking with the AUDIT cutos results inhigher sensitivity. Using a cuto of AUDIT 6 +or heavy epi- sodic drinking resulted in sensitivity of HIV-infectedand 81% for HIV-uninfected. High specicity for alcoholdependence can be obtained using high cutos for the AUDIT (20 +and 16 +), the AUDIT-C (10 +and 8 +), the AUDIT dependence score of 4 +, and the ICD-9 code for dependence in the past year; however, sensitivity is low (14 toTable 2.

Many cutos provide fair agreement or better based on the kappa statistics. Our ndings are consistent with other studies that have reported on recommendations for AUDIT and AUDIT-Ccutos for unhealthy alcohol use. The standard cutos rec-ommended for AUDIT range from 5 or more to 8 or more,and those recommended for the AUDIT-C range from 3 ormore to 6 or more for various types of unhealthy alcohol use (Bradley et al., 1998b; Bush et al., 1998; Gordon et al., 2001; Gual et al., 2002). Additionally, our nding that theAUDIT-C performs as well as the longer AUDIT for identi-fying those with risky drinking and unhealthy alcohol use isconsistent with ndings of other researchers (Bradley et al.,1998b, 2009; Gordon and Saitz, 2004; Gordon et al., 2001).We demonstrate that adding a heavy episodic drinking com-ponent improves sensitivity compared with AUDIT cutos alone without adding additional burden to the patients or survey respondents as this question is already included aspart of the AUDIT. We found that the prevalence of risky drinking is slightly higher in the HIV-infected subjects based on the TLFB, butthe percentage of patients identied with risky drinking isslightly lower among the HIV-infected subjects based on thevarious cutos of AUDIT, AUDIT-C, and heavy episodic drinking. For risky drinking and unhealthy alcohol use, we are uncertain as to why sensitivity is lower among the HIV-infected compared with uninfected. One study reported thatthose with HIV used alcohol at lower usual levels but withgreater variability compared with those who were HIV-unin-fected (Braithwaite et al., 2008). Perhaps this dierence indrinking patterns between HIV-infected and -uninfected pro-vides some insight into the dierences in sensitivity. More likely, however, there may be a social desirability bias caus- ing the HIV-infected patients to underreport their alcoholconsumption. For alcohol dependence, agreement is particularly low for the ICD-9 codes for the HIV-uninfected (kappa /C200.10) compared with the HIV-infected subjects (kappa =0.23 to 0.26). Although we realize that alcohol-related diagnosesoften are underreported, we are surprised to see a lower level of agreement among the HIV-uninfected subjects given that the prevalence of all alcohol measures includingthe ICD-9 measures are similar between the HIV-infectedTable 3.

Perhaps HIV-infected patients are screened more frequently or aggressively because ofincreased surveillance for the potential negative interac-tions of alcohol use with medications and/or othercomorbidities, such as hepatitis C. This study has several strengths. It uses a large U.S. multisite cohort of racially/ethnically diverse HIV-infectedand -uninfected patients with multiple measures of alcohol use. Many studies have evaluated and identied the optimalcutos to use for the AUDIT and the AUDIT-C to identifyrisky drinking amounts, alcohol dependence, and the spec- trum of unhealthy alcohol use. However, no other studies that we are aware of have evaluated these measures in anHIV-infected population. This study provides new informa-tion regarding the performance of commonly used screeningand diagnostic instruments among HIV-infected subjects, animportant population that is at higher risk for adverse out-comes from alcohol use. For many studies and clinical set-tings, it is important to have brief tools for evaluating alcohol use to help minimize participant burden and maxi- mize time and resources, especially when one is attempting tocollect information on a variety of behaviors. In clinical set-tings especially, patient assessments need to be brief becauseof patient and provider time constraints. This study has several limitations. First, our study sam- ple was restricted to Veterans receiving medical care and,because the majority of our cohort is men, we limited the analysis to men. Similar studies should be conducted on cohorts of HIV-infected and -uninfected women. The meanage of our study population is 52 years, and this should beconsidered when applying these ndings to older or youn-ger populations. For risky drinking, we compared theAUDIT, which captures data for the previous year, withthe TLFB, which captures drinking information over theprevious 30 days. On the basis of these diering time frames, we might expect to see lower prevalence of risky drinking identied by the TLFB, especially if we are incor-porating heavy episodic drinking, which we expect to havereported more frequently over the past year in the AUDITthan in the past 30 days on the TLFB. How much preva-lence diers would depend on how consistent drinkingbehavior was over time; furthermore, the AUDIT asksabout typical drinking that is likely aected by recent (e.g., past month) behavior. In any case, sensitivity should not be impacted by the time frame discrepancy between measuresbecause the screening test covers a longer time than the ref-erence standard. However, specicity could be lowerbecause of some individuals not meeting criteria for riskydrinking over the past 30 days on the TLFB, but meetingrisky drinking criteria based on AUDIT or AUDIT-Cduring the previous year. Although our results demonstrate that agreement is simi- lar between HIV-infected and -uninfected subjects for identi-fying participants on the spectrum of alcohol use, we cannotbe sure that screening tests administered in person as 1 to 3items as part of clinical care will perform the same as thescreening tests asked as part of a research survey that is self-administered.

Of note, for unhealthyalcohol use, few cutos provide sensitivity /C2180%; however, many cutos provide good specicity. For identifying alco-hol dependence, the highly specic AUDIT dependencescore and the ICD-9 diagnosis codes are not recommendedwhen sensitivity is important, such as for screening measures by physicians. However, in the absence of other sources of alcohol data, ICD-9 codes can be useful where specicity isimportant and sensitivity is not (e.g., when evaluating costlyand/or time-intensive interventions). In summary, for both HIV-infected and -uninfected patients, briefer measures of alcohol use provide reasonablesensitivity and specicity for risky and unhealthy use com-pared with the longer more resource intensive measures. The incorporation of heavy episodic drinking from question 3 of the AUDIT with AUDIT and AUDIT-C cutos improvessensitivity for identifying risky drinking, alcohol dependence,and unhealthy alcohol use compared with using AUDIT andAUDIT-C cutos alone. For many research and clinical pur-poses, the briefer measures should be sucient, at least forscreening purposes, and then more time-intensive measurescould be utilized to follow-up on positive screens. Cutos can be chosen to maximize sensitivity or specicity as appro- priate to the clinical or research application. For alcoholdependence, the briefer measures may not be adequate formore than broad screening; a more intensive measure, suchas the CIDI-SAM, may still be necessary when sensitivity isimportant. However, when specicity is important and sensi-tivity is not, brief tools can be used when identifying peoplewith alcohol dependence.

M cKEE Family Medicine Research Programs, Department of Family Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, USA MICHAEL K. PAASCHE-ORLOW Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Inadequate health literacy and limited English proficiency are associated with poor health care access and outcomes. Despite what appears to be an interaction phenomenon\u2014whereby the rate of inadequate health literacy is particularly high among limited English proficiency populations\u2014researchers in health literacy and limited English proficiency rarely collaborate. As a result, few health literacy instruments and interventions have been developed or validated for smaller linguistic populations. Interventions to improve health outcomes for people with low health literacy and limited English proficiency show great potential to alleviate many of the health disparities currently experienced by some of the most disenfranchised individuals in our health care system, those from smaller linguistic minority groups, including Deaf American Sign Language users. It is critical for health literacy and limited English proficiency researchers to work together to understand how culture, language, literacy, education, and disabilities influence health disparities and health outcomes. It is important to ensure that research is collaborative and inclusive in order to broaden the reach of future interventions to smaller linguistic minority populations. The health care system is struggling to care for an increasingly diverse patient population (National Center for Education Statistics, 2001; Smedley, Stith, & Nelson, 2003; U.S. Census Bureau, 2011). It is unfortunate that the details of this diversity, including language preference, literacy, and culture, have in general been examined independently. Few studies have concurrently explored health literacy and limited English proficiency (LEP). A recent PubMed search by the coauthors using the health Downloaded by [Boston University] at 10:03 05 February 2013 8 M. M. McKee and M. K. Paasche-Orlow literacy and LEP as MeSH keywords generated 5,158 health literacy references and 595 LEP references, but only 36 overlapping references. The paucity of publications on this topic underscores the need for better collaboration between these fields. More than 90 million Americans have inadequate health literacy (Nielsen- Bohlman, Panzer, & Kindig, 2004) and more than 24.5 million Americans experience LEP (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010), not accounting for people with LEP among the population of unauthorized or undocumented immigrants in the United States (Passel & Cohn, 2011). In addition, this estimate does not include approximately 500,000 Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users (Harrington, 2004; Schick, 1988). It is not well established what proportion of LEP individuals have inadequate health literacy, but overall it is thought to be higher than that of fluent English speakers (Berkman et al., 2004; Nielsen-Bohlman et al., 2004). Several populations at risk for LEP (no English spoken before starting school, Hispanic adults, and those with disabilities) are overrepresented among those with below basic prose literacy on the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (Baldi, 2009). However, more important than establishing a precise prevalence estimate of inadequate health literacy and LEP is to understand their health consequences. In isolation, both pose significant barriers to health care communication (Baker, Parker, Williams, & Clark, 1998; Fernandez et al., 2004; Graham, Jacobs, Kwan-Gett, & Cover, 2008; Paasche-Orlow & Wolf, 2007; Schillinger et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2005). Together, the damaging effects of inadequate health literacy and LEP on health communication and outcomes are likely magnified (Sudore et al., 2009). This may be due to synergistic negative effects in phenomena such as socioeconomic position, access to care, access to information, as well as perceived and experienced discrimination (Egede, 2006). Quality measures mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services heavily rely on improved patient communication and outcomes (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2012). There is great interest among hospitals, managed care, and outpatient health centers to develop effective communication strategies to deal with diverse patient populations. Many of these approaches will require interventions to deal with the complexities of handling patient populations who experience LEP and inadequate health literacy. Unfortunately, the current research environment is poorly equipped to provide innovative approaches and interventions to increase the ability of a health consumer with LEP and inadequate health literacy to make appropriate health care decisions. Researchers must work together to understand how culture, language, literacy, education, and disabilities all play elemental roles in promulgating health disparities and health outcomes. Benefits of Collaborative Research Despite an increasing number of interventions designed to improve health knowledge, and disease management, few studies evaluate whether these interventions are reproducible in smaller language minority populations and among individuals with a range of health literacy (Sarkar et al., 2008; Schillinger et al., 2008). Many interventions intended to address LEP may also be appropriate for those with low health literacy as well as the converse. The hybridization of LEP and health literacy research would further enhance the ability to develop novel approaches and interventions that can potentially be interchangeable for diverse communication needs. Furthermore, health literacy research could greatly benefit from the infusion of transdisciplinary approaches provided in the fields of linguistics and cognitive science. LEP research Downloaded by [Boston University] at 10:03 05 February 2013 Health Literacy and the Disenfranchised 9 could gain from standardized measures and instruments available and emerging in health literacy research. LEP research has demonstrated the benefits of language concordance and the use of interpreters including higher rates of appropriate health care visits, improved treatment adherence, and improved satisfaction (Graham et al., 2008; MacKinney, Walters, Bird, & Nattinger, 1995; McKee, Barnett, Block, & Pearson, 2011; Regenstein et al., 2008; Timmins, 2002). Interventions involving the use of community health workers, health coaches, language interpreters, and language-concordant providers are common approaches for LEP populations. However, it is unclear whether these interventions can improve health literacy among these populations. In addition, novel approaches for inadequate health literacy through the use of technology (e.g., virtual health coaches) have not yet been adequately examined in LEP populations. Health information technologies have promising potential to tailor health information to language and cultural needs and help people access to health materials in a variety of modalities when and where they may be needed (Munoz et al., 2009). Further research is needed to determine how this can be applied effectively for people with LEP and inadequate health literacy. Populations Who May Benefit From Collaborative Research Spanish-speaking populations, by virtue of their size, have garnered the majority of LEP and non-English health literacy research funding in the United States. Despite the fact that more than 376 languages are used in the United States, a review of the literature reveals very few of these studies extend beyond English and Spanish. Schillinger, Bindman, Wang, Stewart, and Piet (2004) demonstrated that even when accounting for language barriers, inadequate reading and health literacy were highly prevalent in one Latino population sample; only 55% of Hispanics have a high school diploma, and only 10% have a bachelor's degree (Schillinger et al., 2004). Inadequate health literacy may be even higher for smaller linguistic minority groups as a result of a paucity of accessible media and patient education. Certain immigrant populations and Deaf ASL users live in relative isolation. These populations provide unique research challenges and opportunities because of reduced social interactions with the media and limited contact with allopathic norms, public health and prevention messaging, and health education. These groups experience poor patient-provider communication and frequently rely on inaccurate and inconsistent information from their social networks and the Internet (McKee et al., 2011; Valentine & Skelton, 2009; Vernon & Lynch, 2003). Deaf ASL users, in particular, present a unique study population because they struggle with poor communication (i.e., due to hearing loss), language discordance, and possibly inadequate health literacy partly because of decreased opportunities to correct misinformation, and limited health surveillance (McKee et al., 2012). Deaf ASL users are considered an LEP population by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001); yet, they are rarely included in health literacy and LEP research studies. This is likely due to limited health and demographic information about Deaf ASL users, scarcity of adapted and validated research surveys and instruments in ASL, difficulty recruiting and accessing this population for research, inadequate supply of Deaf ASL proficient investigators, and concern about handling potential cognitive issues when present. Downloaded by [Boston University] at 10:03 05 February 2013 10 M. M. McKee and M. K. Paasche-Orlow The exclusion of linguistic minorities is ultimately due to the fact that they are minorities. The research funding and the workforce are limited. Investigators want to have the largest possible impact and have research products that reach a critical mass. Although smaller language populations may be challenging to recruit and study, they are often most in need; work with such populations underscores a striking absence of health information accessible in languages beyond English and Spanish. Rudd and Anderson (2006) argued that existing health literacy interventions can be modified to apply to at-risk individuals and that environmental evaluations of health care systems to reduce literacy and language barriers could benefit a broad array of patients. The same approach to currently existing health literacy and LEP research tools and interventions can help identify critical steps needed to create greater inclusivity in research. Future Implications LEP and health literacy researchers should design research that advances knowledge regarding the intersection between these fields of inquiry. Approaches likely to promote this agenda include the following: Funding agencies should encourage collaboration between researchers through targeted requests for applications for research that incorporates both fields. Researchers should place special emphasis in developing tools and disseminating interventions that can be readily adapted and translated into languages for vali - dation and use in other populations. Institutional review boards should give special consideration to smaller linguistic minority populations, including Deaf ASL users, to ensure that research is inclu - sive whenever possible. LEP and health literacy investigators should design research that implements novel strategies using information technology and other methods to lower com - munication barriers and bridge health care gaps more effectively and efficiently. Opportunities for collaboration and dissemination of innovative cross-disciplinary approaches, such as symposia and conferences with a special emphasis on bringing health literacy and LEP investigators together should be advanced. Academic institutions and research facilities should increase the number of researchers and staff from diverse backgrounds to improve recruitment of chal - lenging-to-reach populations and provide greater social and cultural awareness necessary to establish rapport with targeted populations. Conclusion The fields of LEP and health literacy have largely functioned as separate silos of research, failing to address the needs of these unique and underserved populations in the U.S. health care system. It is clear that collaboration is needed between experts in these fields to help develop a variety of interventions and tools to assure the most vulnerable patients are not left behind. Without attention to the interaction between health literacy and LEP populations are at great risk for experiencing increasing health disparities. Given that language and health literacy are integral to patients' ability to comprehend and act upon health recommendations, it is crucial to find ways to understand the joint effects of these phenomena. Researchers should view health literacy through Downloaded by [Boston University] at 10:03 05 February 2013 Health Literacy and the Disenfranchised 11 multicultural and multilingual lenses to help develop novel communication strategies and technologies that can be implemented in the increasing number of linguistic minority and LEP populations, including Deaf ASL users in the United States.

Liebschutz, MD, MPH Abstract In primary care (PC), patients with post-tra umatic stress disorder (PTSD) are often undiagnosed. To determine variables associated with treatment, this cross-sectional study assessed 592 adult patients for PTSD. Electronic medical record (EMR) review of the prior 12 monthsassessed mental health (MH) diagnoses and MH treatments [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor(SSRI) and/or 1 visit with MH professional]. Of 133 adults with PTSD, half (49%; 66/133) received an SSRI (18%), a visit with MH professional (14%), or both (17%). Of those treated, 88% (58/66) had an EMR MH diagnosis, the majority (71%; 47/66) depression and (18%; 12/66) PTSD. The odds of receiving MH treatment were increased 8.2 times (95% CI 3.1 -21.5) for patients with an EMR MH diagnosis. Nearly 50% of patients with PTSD received MH treatment,yet few had this diagnosis documented. Treatment was likely due to overlap in the management ofPTSD and other mental illnesses.

Mental health (MH) treatment for PTSD includes pharmacotherapy and/or specialized MH counseling with structured cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy.5-9Recent practice guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association recommend selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as rst-line pharmacotherapy for patients with PTSD, given that they alleviate symptoms of PTSD, have few side effects, and also treat the comorbid depression, anxiety, and panic disorder that frequently co-occur with PTSD.5,10Few randomized trials have been completed to evaluate the ef cacy of one type of treatment (i.e. pharmacotherapy vs. psychotherapy) over another; however, current guidelines state that, since pharmacotherapy has lower effectiveness forPTSD than MH counseling, it is prudent for prescribing clinicians to also refer patients forappropriate counseling. 6,7,10,11 A literature review helped to identify some factors that are associated with recognition of mental illness and therefore with receipt of treatment for mental illness. First, more severe psychologicaldistress increases the odds that a patient will be diagnosed with a MH disorder. 1,4,12But little is known about whether this principle applies to PTSD in PC practice. It seems reasonable, however,to suspect that patients with more severe PTSD symptoms would be more likely to receive MHtreatment. 1,4,11,12Secondly, PC physicians are more likely to recognize depressive symptoms (and are more likely to mislabel patients with lone PTSD as having depression).13Thus it seems also likely that comorbid depression (with PTSD) might increase the likelihood of receiving MHtreatment. 13Finally, patient disclosure of trauma-associated symptoms to a medical professional seemed to also increase the likelihood of receiving MH treatment.1,6,7,12-14 To better understand factors associated with receipt of PTSD treatment by PC patients, a cross- sectional study of patients in PC was conducted assessing PTSD diagnosis and reviewing patients ' medical records for MH diagnoses and PTSD treatments. Given the therapeutic overlap (i.e., SSRIpharmacotherapy) in the management of PTSD and depression, it was hypothesized that somepatients with PTSD might receive MH treatment despite the fact that they are not recognized ashaving PTSD. In fact, it was thought that these patients might be mislabeled in the medical record Avenue, 2nd Floor, Boston, MA 02118, USA. Ellen C.

It was also hypothesized that PTSDsymptom severity and trauma-associated symptom disclosure would be associated with receipt oftreatment for PTSD. Methods Study design This secondary data analysis examines participants who met diagnostic criteria for current PTSD during a cross-sectional study completed at the PC clinics of an urban, safety-net, academicmedical center. 2This analysis had three key components. First, validated measures established the overall prevalence of interview-diagnosed PTSD, PTSD symptom severity, and depressive symptoms.15Second, participants 'electronic medical records (EMRs) were reviewed for the presence of four MH diagnoses, SSRI prescriptions, and documentation of visits with MH professional in the prior year. Finally, logistic regression tested the associations between receipt ofMH treatment and the hypothesized independent variables. A detailed description of study methodsfor recruitment and assessment can be found elsewhere; relevant methods are summarized below. 2 The Boston University Medical Center 's Institutional Review and the HIPAA Privacy Review Boards approved the study. A Certi cate of Con dentiality was obtained from the National Institutes of Health. Recruitment and enrollment From February 2003 to September 2004, adult patients awaiting PC appointments were approached and screened for eligibility by trained research assistants. Patients were eligible if they spoke English, were 18 -65 years old, and had a scheduled appointment with a PC clinician. Of the 753 eligible patients, 607 (81%) enrolled in the study.2This analysis is limited to the 133 patients with a current (past 12 months) diagnosis of PTSD made using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview(CIDI) Version 2.1 PTSD Module. 16,17Patients who participated in the study provided written informed consent, were compensated $10, and received safety referrals at the end of the interview. Assessments and data Interview assessments Research assistants collected demographic data and administered a series of validated interview questionnaires. They administered CIDI to assess for current PTSD and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to measure depressive symptoms.15-17PTSD symptom severity was the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C).18,19Participants were asked speci cally whether they had ever disclosed that they suffered from trauma-associated symptoms to a medical professional, dened as a PC physician, MH professional/therapist, other physician, nurse, or social worker. EMR data All study subjects were patients at an academic medical center which maintains a comprehensive EMR. All outpatient encounters (PC clinical encounters and emergency department visits), inpatient discharge summaries, diagnoses, and prescriptions are documented in the EMR and areavailable for review. MH services are available at the same academic medical center and visits with 192 The Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research 39:2 April 2012an MH professional are also documented in the EMR; however, restrictions do not allow for the specic contents of these visits (i.e., type of therapy performed) to be viewed. Using standardized data-collection forms, medical students and residents trained in chart abstraction, and supervised byan academic internist, reviewed each participant 's EMR, starting from 12 months prior to the date of entry into the study. The EMR was reviewed for MH diagnoses and prior year MH treatments(prescription of an SSRI and/or greater than or equal to one visit with MH professional). 20,21MH diagnoses included ICD-9-coded PTSD, depression, anxiety, and panic disorder in a patient 's problem list and/or in a clinician 's typed assessment from any given visit (excluding MH visits). With respect to visits with MH professional, the type of MH professional seen and the type ofbehavioral therapy received was not available for review. However, MH professional could enterMH diagnosis into a patient 's problem list and/or prescribe an SSRI, both of which would appear in the EMR and be available for review for this study. Main variables The primary dependent variable was receipt of MH treatment in the prior 12 months .M H treatment was de ned as receipt of either an SSRI prescription and/or greater than or equal to one visit with a MH professional, as these are treatments that could be effective for PTSD. There were four main independent variables of interest. MH diagnoses in the EMR included PTSD, depression, anxiety and/or panic disorder. More severe PTSD symptoms was a categorical variable indicating the highest quartile of the distribution of all participants' PCL-C scores. 19Comorbid depression was de ned as a PHQ-9 score of nine or greater, based on published scoring cutoffs from the PHQ- 9 derived from studies correlating past two week depressive symptoms with a diagnosis of major or other depression.15Disclosure of suffering from trauma-associated symptoms to a medical professional was a dichotomous variable.15,18,19Covariates of interest included the sociodemo- graphic factors age, sex, race (black vs. other), marital status, education level, employment status, and annual income. Insurance status was not included in the model as more than 99% of participants had coverage for the types of utilization studied via federal, state, or private insuranceor through an uncompensated care pool ( \"free care \"). Statistical analysis Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted using t-tests for continuous data and the Chi- square ( 2) test for categorical data. To determine factors associated with patients receiving MH treatment, logistic regression was tested for associations between the dependent variable, the mainindependent variables of interest, and potential confounding factors. The latter were selected if theyhad statistically signi cant associations with the outcome in bivariate analyses ( pG0.05) or, in the cases of more severe PTSD symptoms and comorbid depression, due to prespeci ed hypotheses. Results Characteristics of patients with PTSD Of the 133 participants (all with current PTSD by diagnostic interview), the mean age was 41 years (SD=11; ***Table 1). Eighty-two (62%) were female and 75 (56%) were black. Almost half had never been married, 40 (30%) had less than 12 years of education, and 83 (62%) wereunemployed or on disability. Eighty- ve (67%) participants earned less than $20,000 annually. The majority (71%) also had comorbid depression by diagnostic interview.

The majority (88%) of participants who received MH treatment had at least one mental illness diagnosis documented in the EMR, most commonly depression (71%). For participants with research interview-diagnosed PTSD alone ( N= 39) and PTSD and comorbid depression ( N=94), p=0.9) and depression (44% vs. 52%, p=0.4) were similar. Receipt of MH treatment Nearly half of the participants received MH treatment in the prior year: 23 (17%) had both an SSRI prescription and at least one visit with MH professional; 24 (18%) received only an SSRIprescription; and 19 (14%) had no SSRI medication but at least one visit with MH professional(mean number of visits was 4.5 with a range of 1 -50; Fig. 1). Predictors of receipt of MH treatment In bivariate analyses, age and sex were not signi cantly different between those who received MH treatment compared to those who did not. Fewer black patients received MH treatmentcompared to all other racial groups combined, while more Caucasians and Hispanics did receivetreatment. A signi cantly higher proportion of treated patients were unemployed or on disability.

Range 1 -50 196 The Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research 39:2 April 2012Among participants with more severe PTSD symptoms and those with comorbid depression as determined from the research interview, there was no statistically signi cant difference in the proportion that received MH treatment. Compared to untreated subjects, a higher proportion oftreated ones reported that at some point they had disclosed suffering from trauma-associated symptoms to a medical professional. In addition, a signi cantly higher proportion of treated participants had a diagnosis of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and/or panic disorder in their EMR (Table 1). In adjusted analyses, the odds of receiving MH treatment were increased 8.2 times (95% CI 3.1 - 21.5) for participants with an EMR MH diagnosis, even if the patient did not speci cally have PTSD documented in the EMR. Disclosure of trauma-associated symptoms to a medicalprofessional increased the adjusted odds of receiving MH treatment by 2.6 (95% CI 1.1 -6.4). Being unemployed or on disability was also statistically signi cant (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1 -6.7). Although attenuated in adjusted analyses, black patients were less likely to receive MH treatment.Race, as well as other factors hypothesized to be clinically relevant (more severe PTSD symptomsand comorbid depression as determined by the research interview), were not statistically signi cant in this analysis (Table 2). Discussion Among a sample of urban PC patients with PTSD, few patients had this diagnosis listed in their medical record. However, despite not having documented PTSD diagnoses, nearly 50% receivedMH treatment: either an SSRI and/or a visit with MH professional. In addition to a diagnosis ofPTSD, any MH diagnosis (depression, anxiety, panic disorder) in the EMR, disclosure of trauma-associated symptoms to a medical professional, and being unemployed or on disability, were allassociated with receipt of MH treatment. Initially factors that might be associated with receipt of MH treatment were selected from the literature. The rst two hypotheses were that having more severe PTSD symptoms and/or having comorbid depression (by research interview) would correlate positively with participants receivingMH treatment. These hypotheses were not supported in either bivariate or adjusted analyses. Onepotential explanation is that participants who received MH treatment may have improved as aresult of the treatment and thus had less severe symptoms at the time of assessment for this cross-sectional study. Another plausible reason for these ndings is the cross-sectional design of this study that, by de nition, did not allow for prospective observations of participants over time. 14 Table 2 Factors associated with receiving PTSD treatment1 Factor Odds ratio29 5%C I EMR MH diagnoses 8.21 3.14. -21.52 Disclosure of trauma -associated symptoms 2.61 1.06 -6.43 Unemployed/on disability vs. employed/student 1.32 0.50 -3.51 1Adjusted odds ratio via logistic regression modeling including factors statistically signi cant in bivariate analysis 2As compared to patients who did not receive prior year PTSD treatment consisting of SSRI and/or visit with MH professional PTSD Treatment MELTZER et al. 197Meredith et al.22found that lack of time and patient nancial burden were the strongest barriers to diagnosis and treatment of PTSD among PC physicians, not doubt of the diagnosis. While prospectively Kessler et al.14demonstrated that while some patients with depression and anxiety are not recognized as suffering from mental illness at an initial consultation, over time, they are diagnosed and receive treatment. The next hypothesis tested was that some patients with PTSD receive MH treatment despite the fact that they are not actually diagnosed as having PTSD, likely due to recognition of a comorbid mental illness or misdiagnosis of PTSD. In this sample, 29% of patients had lone PTSD and 71%had comorbid PTSD and depression by research interview. Interestingly, EMR documentation ofPTSD was low among all patients (1 in 10). However, 50% of the sample had depressiondocumentation in the EMR. Patients with both PTSD and depression were more frequentlydiagnosed as suffering from depression. Patients with lone PTSD (i.e., no depression) were commonly diagnosed incorrectly as suffering from depression. These data are consistent with the ndings of Samson et al., who demonstrate that among PC patients with PTSD, it is the symptomsof depression or anxiety that are more likely to be recognized and treated. 13It may be concluded that, in spite of not being appropriately diagnosed with PTSD, many patients receive some MHtreatment simply due to therapeutic overlap in the management of common mental illnesses. 2,3,5,7,8 However, insuf ciently treating patients with PTSD may result in partially treated PTSD and its associated comorbidities.23-25 While rst-line pharmacotherapy for PTSD, depression, and anxiety/panic disorder is a SSRI, consensus statements recommend that patients with PTSD also have specialized MH counseling,with structured cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychotherapy, as part of a comprehensivetreatment plan. 5-10This contrasts to depression, for which monotherapy with antidepressants is recognized by current guidelines as an effective rst-line treatment for patients with mild, moderate, or even severe major depression.26,27In clinical trials of patients with PTSD, CBT is superior to SSRI treatment, with 50% of patients achieving remission with lone CBT versus 30%with lone SSRI treatment. 11Thus consensus guidelines suggest that PC patients with PTSD ought to be referred for psychological treatment.8,9In this study, it is likely that most participants who received a visit with MH professional did not receive CBT or other speci c psychotherapy, as the mean number of visits (4.5) was fewer than the number of visits typically necessary for CBT instudies of PTSD (9 -12 sessions). 28 Ultimately, there is a signi cant bene t to focused PTSD treatment, as incomplete treatment leads to suboptimal outcomes. Patients with partially treated PTSD (termed Partial PTSD),although less symptomatic than those who meet criteria for full PTSD, still suffer from clinicallymeaningful symptoms and are at increased risk for suicide. 3,23-25,29-33In addition, patients with untreated anxiety disorders, including PTSD, more frequently utilize healthcare and generate substantial direct and indirect costs.34The United States Preventive Services Task Force currently does not offer any recommendations on screening for PTSD.35Until formal guidelines are available and more physicians are pro cient in diagnosing PTSD, the ndings of this study suggest that physicians consider inquiry about trauma-associated symptoms for those with anxiety or depressive symptoms, or those in high prevalence populations (e.g., returning military or pastsubstance dependence) to facilitate identi cation of PTSD and thus referral to appropriate treatment. 36Prospective trials are needed to establish the evidence base for routine inquiry. Another nding merits discussion. Being unemployed or on disability was also signi cantly associated with receipt of MH treatment. Patients with PTSD (and anxiety disorders) as well asmore signi cant impairment (i.e., are on disability) more frequently utilize healthcare. 3,4 Perhaps it is this increase in uti lization which, as Kessler et al.14suggests, ultimately leads to the accurate diagnosis of PTSD. Once diagnosed, patients with PTSD who are unemployed ordisabled, may also be more available to partake in treatment compared to their employedcounterparts. 14 198 The Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research 39:2 April 2012Although the relationship was attenuated when adjusted for other factors, blacks were less likely to be diagnosed with PTSD and less likely to receive MH treatment. Perhaps the fact that cultural differences exist in the experience of psychological trauma can partially explain this phenom-enon. 37Others studies show similar ndings and posit that a patient 's race may actually affect a physician 's awareness of mental illness.38Further investigation into this phenomenon is needed in order to develop interventions to reduce this disparity. Perhaps physicians are hesitant to assign a diagnosis of PTSD for fear that the stigma of a MH diagnosis may exacerbate the symptoms of mental illness or lead to discrimination.39However, studies have shown, and physicians should be counseled, that there is a therapeutic bene t for patients in the accurate recognition of mental illness.12Ormel et al. examined recognition of mental illness by general practitioners in the Netherlands. In addition to the fact that patients recognized ashaving mental illness were more likely to be treated, compared to those who were not recognized, recognition on its own had positive effects on patient psychopathology and social functioning. 12 Ormel suggests that the key elements present in the process of mental illness recognition, acknowledgement, re-interpretation, and social support, form the therapeutic basis for thesepositive results. 12 This study has several limitations. The study was conducted at an urban, academic safety- net hospital, with the majority of participant s unemployed, or on disability, and earning less than $20,000 annually. This may seem to make the results less generalizable to other practicesettings. However, there are numerous similar practice settings in US cities. Furthermore, historically studies examining patients with mental illness in other PC settings similarlydemonstrate that those with mental illness have higher rates of disability affecting both socialand occupational functioning. 40,41The cross-sectional study design does not allow for patients to be followed over time. This does limit the types of inferences one can make. Forexample, during the interview, patients wer e asked whether they have ever disclosed to a medical professional that they suffer from trauma-associated symptoms. For those patientswho both answered af rmatively and also received MH treatment, one cannot assume this disclosure was made prior to receiving treatment. Although prior research shows that a known history of trauma is highly correlated with receipt of MH treatment, the temporal relationship in this study is not known and one cannot assume causality. 7Another aspect of the study design, the EMR review, provided some limitations. There was no data on thelength or content of treatment that patients received, nor whether patients were adherent totheir treatments. In addition, it is not known whether some patients received MH treatmentprior to the year before the study interview. Such information might have captured additionaltreatments for PTSD, however it is also not known whether patients had a diagnosis ofPTSD more than a year prior to the study interview. Thus the added value of such information is unclear (this study examined utilization during the time period that coincides with the diagnostic information available). The EMR did not allow for the capture ofinformation on patients who may have been offe red, yet refused, MH treatment. In addition, it is not known if any participants sought MH treatment outside of the study facility. Giventhat a large percentage were unemployed or on disability and earned less than $20,000annually, it was speculated that they were less likely to utilize MH services outside of thesafety-net hospital. Finally, as there wa s no access to the content of visits with MH professionals, it was not possible to evaluate the type of therapy that may have been received. However, using validated measures to assess for PTSD at the time of entry into the study allowed for the study of patients with cu rrent mental illness and to evaluate the types of treatment they received while they had a documented diagnosis. Most importantly, thesedata provide new insight into factors that impact whether or not a PC patient with PTSDreceives MH treatment, and demonstrate the need for further research examining both patientand physician related barriers to PTSD diagnosis and treatment. PTSD Treatment MELTZER et al. 199Implications for Behavioral Health Among urban, safety-net hospital PC patients with current PTSD, half received some sort of MH treatment in the prior year, de ned as a SSRI and/or a visit with MH professional. However, rather than a diagnosis of PTSD in their EMRs, many patients were identi ed as suffering from depression, anxiety, and/or panic disorder. Thus it appears as though treatment was often fortuitously received due to therapeutic overlap in the management of PTSD and other commonmental illnesses (speci cally depression). Encouraging PC patients to disclose if they suffer from trauma-associated symptoms may improve PC identi cation and treatment of PTSD. Future research, focused on strategies to reduce patient and physician barriers to disclosing trauma and aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of PTSD in PC, is essential to advancing the delivery of MH treatment to those suffering from this disabling condition.

No evidence-based methods exist to identify prescription drug use disorder (PDUD) inprimary care (PC) patients prescribed controlledsubstances. Aberrant drug-related behaviors(ADRBs) are suggested as a proxy. Our objectivewas to determine whether ADRBs documented inelectronic medical records (EMRs) of patients pre-scribed opioids and benzodiazepines could serve asa proxy for identifying PDUD. Design. A cross-sectional study of PC patients at an urban, academic medical center. Subjects. Two hundred sixty-four English-speaking patients (ages 18-60) with chronic pain receiving /H113501 opioid analgesic or benzodi- azepine prescription in the past year, were recruitedduring outpatient PC visits. Outcome Measures. Composite International Diag- nostic Interview dened Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnoses of past year PDUD and no disorder.

Conclusions. EMR documentation of ADRBs is common among PC patients prescribed opioids orbenzodiazepines, but unsystematic clinician docu-mentation does not identify PDUDs. Aberrant Drug-Related Behaviors; PrimaryCare; Chronic Pain IntroductionChronic pain is a common presenting problem in the primary care (PC) setting; approximately 22% of PCpatients report chronic pain [1]. past twodecades, opioid prescribing for chronic noncancer ratesof opioid and legal pros-ecution of physicians [2-6]. Benzodiazepine prescribinghas similarly become a topic for debate, not only due torisks for medication abuse and diversion but also becauseof the association of benzodiazepines to opioid-relateddeaths [7]. Given that PC physicians (PCPs) provide thevast majority of psychoactive substances nationally [8],they must take great care in the decision to prescribethese medications and monitor for side effects to avoidsuch negative outcomes. In addition, PCPs must assessfor risk of prescription drug use disorder (PDUD), denedas abuse of or dependence on prescription opioids andprescription benzodiazepines and/or any illicit substanceand/or opioid and/orbenzodiazepine pharmacotherapy [9,10]. One suggestedmethod of assessing for drug-relatedbehaviors (ADRBs) medicine dene ADRBs as behaviors sug- gesting out of control use of medications, one hallmark ofaddiction. Examples of such behaviors include insisting ona medication by name, claiming non-narcotic medications\"do not work,\" buying medications off the street, makingfrequent emergency visits for pain medications, asking foran early rell, and spending extensive time discussingmedications [11]. ADRBs may also include taking a medi-cation in a manner not prescribed\u2014e.g., taking someoneelse's medication, unsanctioned dose escalations, mul-tiple prescription locations, or different providers writing prescriptions [11]. Finally, in addition to behaviors that aresuggestive of a patient taking medication in an out ofcontrol manner, some behaviors suggest medicationdiversion, the transfer of legally obtained drugs into illegalchannels\u2014where patients exchange or sell their prescrip-tion drugs to someone else [4,12]. It is worth noting thatwhen ADRBs do occur, there can be multiple possibleexplanations for the behavior and hence consideration ofa differential diagnosis of their etiology is appropriate, withPDUD being one of several plausible explanations [13]. Currently, experts recommend monitoring patients pre- scribed chronic opioids for ADRBs based on the assump-tion that ADRBs indicate medication misuse, diversion, oraddiction [14-19]. However, the evidence supporting thisassumption is very limited: studies using ADRBs haverelied on physician recall and/or documentation of ADRBsin a patient's chart as a proxy for PDUD [20-23]. In orderto establish an evidence base for the use of ADRBs as aproxy for PDUD in patients with chronic pain prescribedopioids and benzodiazepines, we compared chart docu-mentation of ADRBs with a systematically obtainedpatient diagnosis of PDUD. MethodsStudy DesignThis was a cross-sectional study of PC patients with chronic pain who were recruited from the PC clinics ofan urban, academic, safety-net medical center [24,25].Safety-net hospitals in the United States care for poorand vulnerable populations who may be uninsured orunderinsured and include disproportionate numbers ofunderrepresented minorities [26]. We collected data fromparticipants by an in-person interview with a trainedmember of the research team and by a subsequent elec-tronic medical record (EMR) review for abstraction ofprescription opioid and benzodiazepine data to assessentry criteria, as well as to identify any documentation of15 prespecied behaviors considered by experts tobe concerning for addictive disease [10,11]. Furtherspecic details of study methods have been publishedpreviously [24,25]. SettingResearch interviewers recruited patients waiting for scheduled PC visits. Interviewers were physicians,master-level professionals, college graduates, and collegestudents who underwent 60 +hours of interview training. All participants were approached in the waiting rooms ofthe hospital-based PC practice [25]. Recruitment and EnrollmentOf the 833 (40.0%) patients eligible for the study based on explicit criteria, i.e., were 18-60 years of age, spokeEnglish, endorsed pain of at least 3-month duration,reported use of any analgesic medication, including over 1437ADRBs Do Not Identify PDUDthe counter or prescription, in the prior month, and had a scheduled PC appointment, 589 patients (70.7%) agreedto participate. Informed consent was obtained from eli-gible patients, and participants were compensated $10for the one time interview. The Boston University MedicalCenter Institutional Review Board approved the study. All EMR entries from 12 months prior to study entry were reviewed looking for documentation of any opioid or ben-zodiazepine prescription; a comprehensive list of allincluded medications has been previously published[24,25]. Standardized chart abstraction forms were used.EMRs were comprehensive including notes from all clinicvisits, all emergency department records, all inpatientdischarge summaries, phone calls, and an institutionalpre-scription database. This data analysis was based on the264 (44.8%) study participants who were prescribed anopioid pain reliever and/or a benzodiazepine in the 12months prior to their interview. Measures and Key Variables Independent Variable: PDUD PDUD was dened as per DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for current (past year) abuse of or dependence on prescriptionopioids and prescription benzodiazepines [10]. Alsoincluded in this denition was any illicit substance and/oralcohol dependence while receiving opioid and/or benzo-diazepine pharmacotherapy. During the interview portion,participants were assessed using the Composite Interna-tional Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) v.2.1 module on DrugDisorders to diagnose drug use disorders [27]. Criteriafor drug abuse included social, physical, or legal con-sequences from use. The criteria for drug dependenceincluded compulsive use, health consequences, andphysical dependence (i.e., tolerance or withdrawal). Physi-cal dependence alone did not sufce to meet the diagnosis.The CIDI short form was used to measure current alcoholdependence; current alcohol abuse and past alcohol usedisorders were not measured in order to reduce respon-dent time burden [27]. Thus, participants with PDUD mayhave a lone prescription opioid and/or benzodiazepinedisorder, a lone substance use disorder (SUD) (an illicit drugdisorder and/or past year alcohol dependence) whilereceiving prescription opioids and/or benzodiazepines, or acomorbid prescription opioid and/or dis-order along with another SUD (i.e., comorbid illicit drugdisorder and/or past year alcohol dependence) [27]. While it may be questioned whether a lone SUD while receiving prescription opioids and/or benzodiazepinestruly constitutes PDUD, this is a denition that has beenused clinically and also suggested by experts in painand addiction [10,28,29]. However, this was taken intoaccount and a sensitivity analysis was conducted, inwhich those with a lone other SUD while prescribed anopioid and/or benzodiazepine were analyzed as a uniquegroup. As this analysis yielded similar results, for simplicitythe data presented are from a two-group analysis com-paring those with PDUD as dened above to those with no disorder. Nicotine dependence was not included in thevariable SUD. Dependent Variable: ADRBs Two years of EMR data were reviewed for each participant in order to assess ADRBs, records from 12 months priorto and poststudy entry, looking for documentation of 12prespecied behaviors. These behaviors were recognizedin the published literature as signs of potential addiction ordiversion in patients prescribed controlled substances[11]. While our list of behaviors was based on the workof Portenoy and meant to represent the concepts he rstput forward, our nomenclature was slightly modied.Standardized chart abstraction forms were used. Statistical AnalysisUsing Fisher's exact test, frequencies of each ADRB and cumulative numbers of ADRBs were compared betweenparticipants with PDUD and no disorder. ResultsThe demographic characteristics of the 264 participants, stratied by the presence or absence of PDUD, arepresented in Table 1. Twenty-three percent (61/264) ofstudy participants met criteria for current PDUD. We foundfew demographic differences between the two groups(i.e., age, gender, race, and education). Characteristicsincluded mean age of mid-40s, majority African American,and over two-thirds with 12 or more years of education. Atleast 50% of each group, with and without PDUD, werereceiving disability payments and over 95% of each grouphad severely disabling pain [30]. However, participantswith PDUD were more likely to have the following charac-teristics: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depres-sion, smoker, past time in jail, and a family history ofsubstance abuse (Table 2). Among patients receiving prescriptions for opioids in the prior 12 months, 15% received the equivalent of 20 tabletsof 5 mg oxycodone in /H113492 lls, 12.6% received 21-60 in /H113493 22.7% 61-150 tablets in /H113493 lls, and 49.6% received >150 tablets or >3 lls of any amount (e.g., four prescriptions of 20 tablets each). The majority ofthose in the last category received >6 lls. Of those receiv- ing benzodiazepines in the prior 12 months in one or moreprescriptions (N =66), 17% received less than 30 15% received 101-200 received benzodiazepine prescriptions from outside psychiatrists,for which specic pill counts and lls were unavailable. Of the 15 behaviors assessed, only \"appearing intoxicated or high\" was documented more frequently in the EMRs ofparticipants with (N =10, 16%) vs no disorder (N=8, 4%), P=0.002. However, the frequency was low and this behavior was present in the charts of those with nodisorder (Table 2). Indeed most participants in both groups 1438Meltzer et al.had at least one ADRB (85%, P=1.0). With respect to the remaining 14 behaviors, the frequency of any one docu-mented behavior was not signicantly different amongpatients with PDUD and with no disorder. An urgent visit forpain was the most common aberrant behavior, but fre-quency did not differ between the two groups (PDUD vs noPDUD\u201482% vs 78%, P=0.6). Early rell was present in about 15% of both groups of patients. The remainingbehaviors were present in 15% or less of participants. Withrespect to cumulative behaviors, patients with PDUD donot have signicantly more documented ADRBs in theirEMR (Figure 1). Rather, having one or two behaviors in thechart was common; over 80% of the patients with andwithout PDUD had at least one behavior in their chart andalmost 40% in both groups had two ADRBs. Discussion By using patients' EMRs and research interviews, this study investigated whether ADRBs documented inpatients' charts reflected a diagnosis of PDUD. If docu-mented ADRBs were indeed viable indicators of PDUD,then the EMR abstractions would have revealed signicantdifferences in patients' charts; patients with a diagnosis ofPDUD would have had more ADRBs documented in theirmedical charts than those with no diagnosis. The datareveal no differences; ADRBs as noted in routine PC prac-tice do not identify patients with PDUDs. Despite thethoughtful clinical insight that went into the developmentof these recommended \"clinical pearls,\" empirically theydo not yield the desired outcome, identication of patientsthat should be of great concern to the clinician. However,the negative results of this study nevertheless do provideinsight about physician recording in the EMR and suggestthat relying on nonsystematic documentation to identifyaddiction or diversion is not useful.Table 1 Demographic characteristics of PC participants with chronic pain and analgesic medication use stratied by prescription drug use disorder (PDUD) (N Disorder PValue N=61 (23%) N =203 (77%) (year) 45.9 Female gender 49% 58% 0.24Race stratied by prescription drug usedisorder BehaviorPDUD No Disorder P ValueN=61 N =203 N (%) N (%) Appears intoxicated/high 0.002 Use someone else's medication off the (5%) 3 (2%) 0.1 Extensive time discussing medication3 (5%) (4%) 1.0 Involvement in an 0.07 of prescription non-narcotics do not work1 (2%) 8 (4%) 0.7 Try to get scripts from other MDs1 (2%) 3 (2%) 1.0 Urgent visit for pain 50 (82%) 159 (78%) 0.6 Early rell 9 on medication name7 22 (11%) 0.8 Lost medication 5 (8%) 11 (5%) 0.5 Increase dose without authorization4 (7%) 12 0.6 stolen medication3 (5%) 1439ADRBs Do Not Identify PDUDClinicians prescribing opioids for patients with chronic pain are aware that some degree of ADRBs may occur duringthe course of treatment. Accordingly, the provider shouldbe aware that there is a differential diagnosis for ADRBs, ofwhich PDUD is only one potential explanation [31].Included in this differential is pain that is not adequatelycontrolled, leading patients to increase their dose of medi-cation without authorization and the subsequent need foran early rell [31]. For example, randomized opioid is not con-sistently effective; thus, patients with uncontrolled painmay take additional medication in an effort to nd relief[32,33]. In addition, some patients with adequately con-trolled pain may hoard medications, fearful of a time whenthe pain may suddenly worsen [11,34]. This too can lead toearly rells and even use of multiple prescription locations.Finally, a pain flare can send a patient to the emergencydepartment in an effort to nd relief. Thus, patients withoutPDUD can also plausibly have ADRBs documented in theircharts. This study found that this is in fact the case, andthese events do occur at a comparable frequency asADRBs in patients with and without PDUD. The presenceof these behaviors in those without PDUDs has been referred to as a pseudoaddiction, in which the aberrantbehaviors will resolve once the pain is adequately treated[13]. It is clear that the patients in this study did not haveadequately controlled pain, as over 95% of both groups ofpatients had severely disabling pain. Perhaps if the painwere better treated, then a true difference in documentedADRBs would exist between the groups. Alternatively, assuggested by Portenoy and McCarberg and Passik,perhaps many of the behaviors considered to be concern-ing are really more benign and not truly associated withaddiction or diversion [11,31]. One documented behavior warrants a deeper investiga- tion. From the 15 ADRBs examined, only appearing intoxi-cated or high was documented more frequently in the EMRs of patients with PDUD. Any time a clinician sus-pects a patient of being intoxicated or high, further evalu-ation is warranted. Recently published guidelines offerclinicians a framework for safely initiating and continuing toprescribe opioids [9]. It is suggested that at every clinicalvisit, the patient is assessed for any risks associated withthe opioids as well as any benets received from themedication. Prescribing ought to continue when the ben-ets of a medication outweigh its potential risks, thusensuring an ethically equitable distribution of benets andburdens [35]. If a patient seems to be intoxicated or high,concern arises that the potential risks to the patient, aswell as society, outweigh any benets. In this situation,titration off of the opioid or benzodiazepine combined withthe provision of adjunctive therapy for pain and/or anxiety,as well as referral to substance abuse treatment and/orpsychiatry, is likely most appropriate [36]. The other 14 ADRBs were not signicantly different between the groups. As this study examined documentedbehaviors, the negative results suggest that relying onunsystematic physician documentation is not useful foridentifying patients with PDUD. Rather, in order to deter-mine if ADRBs can be useful to monitor patients forPDUDs, a reasonable next step would be to assess imple-mentation of standardized clinical assessment tools intoclinical practice. Although it may appear that ADRBs are not useful in detecting PDUD, the nonsystematic collection of ADRBsmay be the problem rather than the ADRBs themselves[37]. Validated tools have been studied to predict misuseof substances while being prescribed opioid analgesiafor chronic noncancer pain [9]. For example, theScreener and Opioid Assessment for Patients withPain is a tool to help risk-stratify patients at the Figure 1 Cumulative aberrant drug-related behaviors amongparticipants with prescriptiondrug use 1440Meltzer et al.initiation of opioid therapy [20]. The results provide an idea of how closely a patient ought to be monitoredduring treatment [20]. In addition, the Current OpioidMisuse Measure (COMM) provides a means for ongoingrisk estimation via standardized assessment of aberrantbehaviors [38]. The present authors have studied theCOMM and caution that clinical assessment tools mayperform differently in distinct patient populations, as thesensitivity and specicity of some tools may vary with theprevalence of disease [24]. As this study demonstrates,ADRBs as recorded in a patient's EMR are not associ-ated with PDUD. Thus, caution should always be utilizedwhen monitoring any patient for the development ofPDUD, even when standardized assessment tools are inplace. As Butler et al. stress, the purpose of these toolsis not to serve as the basis for punitive measures [38].Rather, they are to help clinicians have a means for con-sistent patient assessment and to limit the need to relyon haphazard documentation. Finally, the results demonstrate that patients with PDUD were more likely to suffer from PTSD and/or depression, tobe current smokers, to have ever been in jail, and to have afamily history of substance abuse. The present authorshave previously explored these clinical risk factors forPDUD [25]. In addition, as previously reported, over 30% ofpatients without PDUD also suffered from comorbid mentalillness, smoked, had been in jail, and had a family history ofsubstance abuse [25]. Clearly, there is a signicant burdenof comorbid mental illness in patients with chronic pain,offering further support of the need for an interdisciplinaryapproach to the management of chronic pain [36]. This study has limitations. All participants with PDUD may not have been properly identied through inadequacy ofthe study instruments or through inaccurate reporting onthe part of study participants. This would lead to misclas-sication bias, in which patients with PDUD are inappro-priately labeled as having no disorder, serving to bias theresults toward the null hypothesis [39]. In addition, toler-ance to and withdrawal from opioids and benzodiazepinescan be a naturally occurring phenomenon but are none-theless included in the diagnostic interview for PDUD [10].This would serve to bias results away from the null hypoth-esis. Finally, the CIDI does not assess for drug diversion, aspecic risk related to prescription opioids and benzodi-azepines [5,12,40]. Even with its acknowledged limita-tions, the CIDI has been used widely and is considered tobe a well-validated diagnostic instrument [27]. The samplesize was small and included only 61 patients with PDUD.Even if a larger sample size revealed statistically differentndings, individual ADRBs would likely have little predic-tive value in diagnosing PDUD, as the majority of patientswithout a substance disorder also demonstrated each ofthe behaviors. Two years worth of chart entries werereviewed for each study participant, thus providing data toexamine cumulative numbers of behaviors exhibited,which were not signicant. However, when we looked at acombined number of behaviors, we did not stratify themand look at a hierarchy of more severe behaviors. Overall,the results contribute to the recognition of the potentiallimitations of documented ADRBs and suggest a need to utilize a standardized approach to patient assessment asa potentially more informative way to gain clinical insightfrom ADRBs. ConclusionAmong PC patients with chronic pain receiving prescrip- tion opioids and/or benzodiazepines, having at least oneADRB documented in the EMR is almost universal. Inaddition, frequencies of most individual behaviors aresimilar among those with and without PDUD. Reliance onnonsystematic documentation of ADRBs to identify PDUDin PC patients with chronic pain may not be useful. Basedon these ndings, physicians and researchers should becautious before using documented ADRBs in the EMR asa proxy for PDUD. Prospective studies, in which ADRBsare systematically assessed, are needed. Only then canwe determine the true signicance of these behaviors. References 1 Gureje O, Von Korff M, Simon GE, Gater R.

Friedman, M.D. Published online: 14 January 2012 #The Society of Behavioral Medicine 2012 Abstract Background Hypertension is more prevalent and clinically severe among African -Americans than whites. Several health behaviors influence blood pressure (BP) control, but effective, accessible, culturally sensitive interventionsthat target multiple behaviors are lacking. Purpose We evaluated a culturally adapted, automated telephone system to help hypertensive, urban African - American adults improve their adherence to their antihyper- tensive medication regimen and to evidence-based guidelines for dietary behavior and physical activity.Methods We randomized 337 hypertensive primary care patients to an 8-month automated, multi-behavior intervention or to an education-only control. Medication adherence, diet, physical activity, and BP were assessed at baseline and every 4 months for 1 year. Data were analyzed using longitudinalmodeling. Results The intervention was associated with improvements in a measure of overall diet quality (+3.5 points, p<0.03) and in energy expenditure (+80 kcal/day, p<0.03). A decrease in systolic BP between groups was not statistically significant (2.3 mmHg, p=0.25). Conclusions Given their convenience, scalability, and ability to deliver tailored messages, automated telecommunicationssystems can promote self-management of diet and energy balance in urban African -Americans. Keywords Behavioral intervention .Cultural adaptation . Hypertension Introduction In the USA, the prevalence of hypertension is significantly higher among African -Americans compared to Whites. Although the majority of US Blacks who have hypertension receive medical care and antihypertensive medication, only 58% of them achieve adequate blood pressure control [ 1]. Multiple well-designed studies have shown that lifestyle interventions delivered in-person can improve adherence toantihypertensive medication regimens, to regular physicalactivity, to a healthful diet, and to weight control recommendations \u2014all of which can reduce elevated blood pressure [ 2-4]. Nonetheless, these programs are not suitableStudy registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ID: Heeren :R. H.

Minority groups of low socioeco- nomic status (SES) may encounter additional barriers includ- ing logistical obstacles (e.g., unreliable transportation), costconsiderations, and cultural incongruence of intervention content or delivery [ 5,6]. The current public health challenge is to design and implement health programs that can be delivered easily tothe millions of patients with hypertension in a practical, low- cost manner. Tailoring these programs to the needs, barriers,and ethno-cultural characteristics of specific populations can help maximize their impact [ 7]. Studies from our group and others have shown that computer-based, telephone intervention systems can beefficacious in changing patients 'health-related behaviors, including medication adherence for hypertensive patients [ 8], physical activity [9 ,10], and dietary behaviors [ 11]. However, most of these have targeted single rather than multiple behaviors, and few have been culturally adapted.The purpose of this study was to evaluate an automated, culturally adapted, multi-behavior intervention that can be used on a public health scale to promote hypertension self- management in urban African -Americans of low socioeco- nomic status. The primary study hypothesis was that the intervention group would experience greater improvements in these behaviors than the control group. Our secondary hypothesis was that mean blood pressure (BP) woulddecrease more in the intervention than control group. Methods We conducted a two-armed randomized controlled trial (intervention vs. usual care control) of a novel automated telephone counseling system designed to promote three health- related behaviors that affect blood pressure control: (a)adhering to the antihypertensive medication regimen, (b) following the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet [ 2], and (c) engaging in regular physical activity [ 12]. Participants were drawn from the adult primary care practices of a large, urban safety-net hospital and fromfour affiliated community health centers. Inclusion criteriawere as follows: (a) African -American by self-report; (b) a diagnosis of hypertension on the active problem list of thepatient 's medical chart; (c) a current prescription for 1 antihypertensive medications; (d) 1 primary care office visits in the previous 2 months; (e) two elevated clinic BP readingsin the previous 6 months (systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg among non- diabetic patients, and 130/80 among diabetic patients); and (f) age 35 years. Patients were ineligible if they werepregnant, or had a medical condition that precluded moderate exercise or for which the DASH diet was contraindicated. Patients were also excluded if they scored 7 out of 7 on amodified version of the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, indicating high baseline medication adherence [ 13], had a terminal illness, psychiatric or cognitive disorder, or no access to a telephone. Potentially eligible patients were identified by searching the electronic medical records of the participating clinicalsites for patients who met the inclusion criteria (a -f) above. Primary care providers were then asked to review lists oftheir potentially eligible patients and remove those with anyexclusion. The remaining patients were sent a letter on behalf of their primary care provider that described the study and were asked to return a postage-paid postcard if they didnot want to be contacted by study staff. Those who did not opt-out were contacted by phone, the study was explained to them, and they were screened for eligibility. All participantsprovided informed consent. Based on power analyses and projected attrition, we sought to randomize 360 patients expecting 300 to complete the 8-month study assessment thusproviding sufficient power to analyze the three primary behavioral outcomes. Intervention: Telephone-Linked Care for Hypertension in African -Ameri cans The intervention was a totally automated, computer-based, interactive telephone counseling system called Telephone-Linked-Care, designed to monitor, educate, and counsel African -American adults with hypertension and to provide summary data regularly to the patient 's primary care provider [8-10]. The intervention incorporated principles of social cognitive theory [ 14], the transtheoretical model of behavioral change [ 15], and motivational interviewing [ 16], and was tailored to the user 's values. Content was also adapted to cultural characteristics of culturally African -American adults (i.e., not Caribbean -American, Black -Hispanic, etc.). This group-level cultural adaptation was guided by a conceptualframework targeting \"surface \"and\"deep\"structural domains, and by ethnic mapping [ 17] in focus groups of potential users. S urface structure adaptation involves matching inter- vention materials and messages to observable, \"superficial \" characteristics of a target population including familiar or preferred people, places, language, music, food, locations, and clothing. In this study, surface adaptation included using pre-recorded speech from African -American voice profes- sionals to deliver the automated telephone counseling mes- sages. Deep structure can be viewed as the underlying rationale for surface structure preferences. It denotes the cultural values, social, histor ical, and psychological forces that influence how a given health behavior is viewed by the targetpopulation. For example, inviting an African -American adultann. behav. med. (2012) 43:62- 73 63to join a neighborhood walking group may have greater deep structure appeal than suggesting he/she walk alone due to the cultural priority of community well-being observed inAfrican- American subgroups [ 18]. In ethnic mapping, we presented focus group members with foods, activities, and health recommendations and askedto rate them on a continuum from \"Mostly a black thing \"(e.g., dancing) to \"Mostly a white thing \"(e.g., skiing, yoga) and we included material in automated telephone scripts, accordingly.These scripts were then pre-tested by potential users of the system and their feedback was incorporated. New script elements emerged from focus group material related to topicssuch as dance as an effective method to combine fun and healthy exercise, and using low-cost community resources, home-based exercise, or mall-walking to achieve a safe placeto exercise. Another new element addressed concerns over \"sweating out \"one's hairdo as a barrier to exercise: \"Some hairstyles can get messed when you sweat or swim in a pool. It 's nice to look good, but it 'sa l s o important to be healthy. Consider a low-maintenance style that will look good on you and hold up well with an active lifestyle, like a short natural cut or braids. Ask your hairstylist 's opinion the next time you visit. And remember \u2014regular exercise can help you look good too. \" The automated telephone intervention delivered one call per week for 32 weeks. The first three calls introduced thethree targeted behaviors and their role in BP control, and described the system. Subsequent calls were arranged as modules on medication adherence, physical activity, and diet,and were delivered in the order chosen by the participant. Each call consisted of (a) an introduction, (b) a section for reporting health information collected on study-issued homemeasurement devices (pedometers, sphygmomanometers, weight scales), and (c) theory-based interactive education and counseling on the targeted behavior. The physical activity module consisted of 12 calls to increase levels of moderate-or-greater intensity physicalactivity and was adapted from our previously evaluatedautomated telephone systems to promote physical activity [9,10]. The diet module consisted of nine calls \u2014one overview call and two calls for each of four topics: fruits and vegetables, fiber, sodium, and fat. The content of these calls was designed to promote the DASH diet [ 2]. The medication adherence module consisted of eight calls and was adapted from a successful prototype from our group [8]. Study staff monitored participant use of the system and contacted those who did not call to assist or re-engage them with the system. In addition, participants and their primary care providers received printouts of the participant 's progress in each health behavior. These were sent at the beginning and end of each of the three behavioral modules and were designed to reinforce the intervention.Randomization Groups Patients who screened eligible by telephone attended an in-home study visit for the purpose of health education, baseline assessments, and randomization. At this visit, participants received a 75-page resource manual that describedhypertension, listed dietary recommendations, heart healthy food recipes, and local resources for exercise, and provided information to support antihypertensive medication adherence.They received a 20-min education session based on the content of this manual, and were given a pedometer and a digital weight scale (Healthometer, model # HDR900KD01).Participants completed baseline study assessments and were then randomized to the automated, telephone-linked behavioral intervention plus standard pri mary medical care, or to the control condition of standard primary medical care alone. Randomization was accomplished using a random number generator to assign subjects to one of the two groups. Neitherparticipants nor research assistants knew the group assignment until after baseline assessments were complete. After group assignment was revealed, intervention group members receiveda digital home BP monitor (Omron, model # HEM711AC), were trained to use it, and were trained to use the automated telephone system. AssessmentsAssessments were completed by trained research assistants at the participant 's home except for a handful done in the study office for logistical reasons. The three primary study outcomes were change in (a) diet quality, (b) leisure timephysi cal activity of moderate-or-greater intensity, and (c) adherence to the antihypertensive medication regimen from baseline to the end of the 8-month intervention period. The secondary outcome was change in BP. All outcomes wereassessed at baseline (randomization), 4, 8 (end-of-intervention), and 12 months. Other assessments included weight, height, psychosocial characteristics, and users' perceptions of the automated telephone system (see Table 1for a list of demographic, medical, and social characteristics assessed,and for information about how they were measured andcategorized). Physical activity outcomes were assessed with the interviewer-administered 7-day physical activity recall [ 19]. The main physical activity outcomes were (a) minutes per week of moderate-or-greater intensity physical activity, (b) total energy expenditure per day (kcal/day) [ 20], and (c) whether the participant met the joint Centers of Disease Control and Prevention \u2014American College of Sports Medicine recommendation of at least 150 min of moderate- or-greater physical activity per week [ 12]. In order to validate self-reported physical activity, 48 participants wererandomly selected to wear an accelerometer (CSA Actigraph,64 ann. behav. med. (2012) 43:62- 73model # W7164LS) for 3 days before the baseline and 8-month assessments. Diet outcomes were assessed with the picture-sort Food Frequency Questionnaire [ 21]. Five diet outcomes were derived and were analyzed as continuous variables and ascategorical variables denoting whether or not the participant reported consuming recommended levels. The outcomes and their categorical cut-offs are as follows [ 22]: (a) percent of total calories derived from fat ( 30%); (b) percent of total calories derived from saturated fat ( 7%); (c) grams of fiber (25 g/day); (d) servings of fruit and vegetables (F&V 5 servings); and (e) milligrams of sodium (NA 2,400 mg/day). A composite diet quality score was constructed that combined the five diet outcomes using an approach similar tothat used in previous research [11 ]. Each diet outcome variable was converted into a score from 0 to 100, with higher scoresindicating healthier dietary intake. Participants received ascore of 100 if they met or exceeded the dietary recommen- dations described above for total fat, saturated fat, and fiber. However, for fruit and vegetab les and sodium intake, a score of 100 points was based on stricter DASH diet recommenda- tions [ 2]:10 fruit and vegetable servings/day and 1,500 mg NA/day. As there are no published criteria to anchor the unhealthy end of the five component dietary outcome scales listed above, we assigned a score of zero to values 95th percentile for fat and sodium i ntake in baseline data, and 5th percentile for fiber and F&V. These values were 50.5% ofcalories from total fat, 16.9% of calories from saturated fat, 9.2 g/day of fiber, 1.5 servings/day of F&V, and 7,663 mgNA/day. This approach captured most of the variation in the sample and reduced the effect of outliers. Next, scores between 0 and 100 were set using a linear transformation (e.g.,a value halfway between the criteria for 0 and 100 would receive a score of 50). The overall Diet Quality Score was set as theTable 1 Characteristics of the sample at baseline by randomization group Variable Group Automated telephone intervention ( n=169)Control(n=168) Gender (% female) 65.7 75.0 Age, years, mean (SD)56.3 (10.6) 56.8 (11.4) Education, years, mean (SD)12.0 (2.5) 12.4 (2.8) Body mass index, kg/m 2, mean (SD)34.4 (8.6) 34.3 (8.4) Married or living together (%)35.7 34.7 Employed full- or $20 K/year$10- $20 (%) Comfortable with \"19.2 20.3 Enough for bills but not\"extras \"19.2 20.3 Cut back in order to pay bills23.7 24.2 Not enough to pay all bills 37.8 35.3 Insurance (%) Medicare/medicaid 53.8 49.4 Free carea19.5 25.3 Otherb24.9 24.7 Self-pay 1.8 0.6 Medications, total numberc, mean (SD)5.1 (3.0) 5.0 (3.3) Medications, number for blood pressure, mean (SD)1.9 (0.8) 1.9 (0.8) Diabetes (%) 40.7 35.8 Stroke (%) 11.2* 4.2*Co-morbidity index d, mean (SD)5.8 (3.8) 6.2 (4.7) Health literacy scoree, mean (SD)51.7 (20.5)g54.3 (18.4)g Primary outcomes Diet index score, mean (SD)53.9 (17.6) 55.8 (17.0) Moderate-or-greater (860.7) 3188.5 (820.3) Medication Adherence f, mean (SD)4.93 (1.6) 4.77 (1.4) Secondary outcomes Systolic blood pressure, mean (SD)130.6 (19.8) 131.8 (18.6)Table 1 (continued) Variable Group Automated telephone intervention ( n=169)Control(n=168) Diastolic blood pressure, mean (SD)80.9 (12.5) 80.3 (11.8) *p<0.05 aHealth Safety Net (Free Care) funding program for underinsured Massachusetts state residents bEmployee-sponsored, self-insured, and other products cTotal 7-item version 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale [ 13] gScores correspond to a 7th -8th grade reading levelann. behav. med.

Medication adherence was assessed using a 7-item version of the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale[13]. Scores could range from 0 to 7, with higher scores indicating better adherence. BP was measured with the Welch Allyn Spot Vital Signs Monitor (Model # 4020-00) by trained research assistants during each home visit using a research protocol similar toother studies [ 23]. These BP monitors were calibrated at the beginning of the study and annually thereafter. Participantswere instructed to sit quietly for 5 min before each reading.At the first home visit a reading was taken in each arm, and the arm with the highest blood pressure was chosen for all subsequent readings. At each visit, three readings were takenin the designated arm and the mean of the last two was used for analysis. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were analyzed as continuous outcome variables inseparate statistical models. Each was also analyzed as the dichotomous variable ( \"high\"or\"controlled \")a c c o r d i n gt o national guidelines [ 24]. Specifically, among non-diabetic participants SBP values 140 mmHg and DBP values 90 mmHg were considered \"high\". The corresponding BP cut-off for diabetic participants was 130/80 mmHg. Weexamined another dichotomous BP outcome that considered BP\"controlled \"when both the SBP and DBP values were below the recommended cut-off, and \"high\"when one or both of these values exceeded its cut-off. Data Analysis The distributions of the primary outcome variables were examined and adjustments were made to normalize the data when appropriate. For diet outcomes, we eliminated asunreliable all Food Frequency Questionnaire results where the total caloric intake appeared unrealistically low (<800 cal/day) or high (>6,000 cal/day). Consequently, 15(1.3%) were eliminated for low values and 30 (2.6%) for high values. Results from the remaining sample across the five dietary behaviors were normally distributed except fora few high outliers. These remaining outliers were capped at three standard deviations from the mean, which affected only 32 (0.6%) of the 5,705 total observations. The distribution of minutes of moderate-or-greater physical activity had a large positive skew; therefore, log-transformedvalues were used in analyses. Non-transformed means arepresented for ease of interpretation. At baseline, the distribu- tion of total energy expenditure (kcal/day) and medication adherence scores were approximately normal. Preliminary analyses found a h igher rate of drop out in the intervention group than among controls, and our primaryoutcome analyses used an intent-to-treat approach to minimizethis potential bias [ 25]. Missing data were imputed using the last value carried forward. For cases where data were availableat time points before and after the missing value, the mean ofthese two values was used. Results of analyses that considered only participants who were asse ssed at the 8-month, end-of- intervention time point (i.e., th e available-cases analyses) were similar to results from the intent-to-treat analyses. The two study groups were compared on demographic and outcome variables at baseline using ttests for continuous characteristics and chi-square tests for categorical character-istics. Regression models for longitudinal data were used to analyze the effect of randomization group on the change inprimary outcomes from baseline to each of the three follow- up assessment time points (i.e., 4, 8, and 12 months). As we hypothesized that intervention effects would be greatest atthe end of the intervention, our primary focus was on changes in outcome through the 8-month assessment. Variables on which the groups differed significantly atbaseline (e.g., stroke history) or that were likely to independently affect the outcome were included as covariates in each analysis. These included gender, age, perceivedfinancial well-being, education, diabetic status, and stroke history for all analyses (see Table 1). Other covariates were included for particular outcomes as appropriate (e.g., season for physical activity and diet outcomes). Random effects li near regression models were used for continuous outcome measures. Generalized estimating equations logistic regres- sion models were used for categorical outcomes. SAS version 9 was used for all analysis. Dose -response analyses were conducted for participants randomized to the treatment group by calculating the Pearson correlation between the number of completed automated telephone calls and out-comes at 8 months. Analyses were repeated separately for the subset of patients with type 2 diabetes. Results Study Participants Participant recruitment and follow-up occurred from October 2003 to July 2007. Figure 1displays the flow of potentially eligible participants thro ugh the study. Of the 1,816 individuals who were contacted by phone and invited toparticipate in the study, 684 (35.8%) refused to participate, 651 (37.7%) did not meet eligibility criteria, and 144 (7.9%) were lost to follow-up before the baseline assessment. Ofthose not meeting eligibility requirements, 161 (24.7%) were excluded because of a perfect medication adherence score on the 7-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale at theeligibility screening telephone call. The remaining 337 (18.6%) were confirmed to be eligible and were randomized. Table 1displays sample characteristics at baseline. Of those66 ann. behav. med. (2012) 43:62- 73randomized, 70% were female, 35% had a live-in partner and 37% reported a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Of the 99%who reported health insurance, 79% had Medicare/Medicaid or state-subsidized coverage. The sample 's SES status was low: 84% had an annual income <$30,000, 27% worked full time, and the average duration of education was 12.2 years. Mean medication adherence was low in both groups, but almost 20% of participants had an adherence score of six orgreater at baseline indicating higher adherence [ 13]. Interven- tion group participants reported more moderate-or-greaterphysical activity per week than controls (162.4 min. vs.126.3 min., p=0.04), and a greater percentage of the intervention group met national moderate-or-greater physicalactivity recommendations (38.5% vs. 26.2%, p<0.02). In addition, more intervention group participants than controls reported a history of stroke (11.2% vs. 4.2%, p<0.02). Participant Attrition By the 8-month assessment, 61 (18.1%) of the 337 randomized participants had become lost to follow-up resulting in a sample size of 276. Sixty-seven percent ( n=41) of these had dropped out by the 4-month visit. The dropout rate was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (21.9% vs. 14.3%, p=0.07), and all of these differential dropouts occurred by the 4-month assessment. We compared dropouts to completers on the characteristics displayed in Table 1and found that participants who dropped out by the 8-monthassessment were more likely to be male (44.3% vs. 26.4% of completers, p=0.006). Those who met recommendations for physical activity at baseline dropped out at the same rate across groups, but those who did not meet the recommenda- tion dropped out at twice the rate from the intervention groupas from the control group (25.0% vs. 12.1%, p=0.01). Lastly , we examined if those who dropped out from the interventiongroup were different from control group dropouts on otherfactors. The only significant difference was the control group dropouts were more likely to be diabetic than intervention group dropouts (50% vs. 22.2%, p=0.03). Use of the Automated Telephone System Overall use of the automated telephone system was modest: 26 (15.4%) did not call the system at all, and 8 (4.5%) connected with it but did not complete a call. The meannumber of completed automated telephone calls was 9.0 of the 32 planned calls, and for those who completed at least one call the mean number of completed calls was 11.4. Eight percent of the intervention group completed at least 80% of the 32 planned calls. Participants with diabetescompleted 24% more calls than non-diabetic participants (10.8 vs. 8.2, p=0.08). Use of the three modules was nearly identical. Among intervention group members, 75 (44.4%) completed at least one diet module call. For medication adherence and physical activity the numbers were 75 (44.4%) and 77 (45.6%), respectively. Participants completed a mean4 Month Follow-Up (n=281) Assessed at 12 mo.

Their choice of which module to do first was equally distributedacross modules. We examined whether any of the following 11 patient characteristics predicted patterns of system use: age, gender,income, perceived financial well-being, education, health literacy, number of medications, presence of diabetes or stroke, total number of comorbidities, employment status, presence ofa live-in partner, and number of household occupants. We found that none of these variables significantly predicted whether or not an individual used the system. Amongintervention group participan ts who completed at least one automated telephone call, age ( r=0.22, p=0.009) and greater perceived correlated positively with the number of calls made. In a multiple linear regression model containing all 11 patient characteristics, only perceived financial well-being ( p=0.02) was an independent predictor of number of completed automated telephone calls. Multivariable Analysis of Outcome MeasuresTable 2presents the change in adjusted means and propor- tions from baseline to the 8-month (end of intervention) assessment for the primary and secondary outcome variablesby study group. No significant intervention effects wereobserved at the 4- and 12-month assessments. Adjusted group means for continuous outcome variables across all fourassessment time points are graphically presented in Fig. 2. Dietary Outcomes At the 8-month assessment, there was a significant improve- ment of 3.5 points (or 0.25 SD, p<0.03) in the overall diet quality score in the intervention group vs. controls. Among the five diet component subgroups, fiber intake improved significantly in the intervention group vs. controls (relativeimprovement of 2.29 g/day, p<0.02). Favorable changes were also observed for other diet components, but none ofthese reached statistical significance. Physical Activity Actigraph readings from the subsample at baseline and at 8 months correlated with self-reported leisure time moderate- or-greater physical activity p<0.05), thus providing objective validation of the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall questionnaire data. There was no significant difference between groups in leisure time moderate-or-greater physical activity or in the percentage meeting the recommended Table 2 Change in the primary and secondary outcomes from baseline to the end of the intervention period (month 8) within and between groups Variables Within-group change scores from baseline to the end of interventionDifference in change scores between groups Automated telephoneintervention ( n=169)Control ( n=168) Primary outcomes 3.54* MOD+PAa(min/week) 3.44 2.77 6.21 >150 energy expenditure (kcal/day) 43.8 36.2 80.0* Medication Adherence Scoreb0.45 0.26 0.19 Secondary Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) 2.06 0.25 2.31 Achieved controlc(%) 0.7 1.9 1.2 Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) 1.28 0.1 1.18 Achieved controlc(%) 6.4 5.1 1.3 Achieved control of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (%)5.8 5.0 0.8 *p<0.05 aMod+PA \u2014moderate-or-greater intensity leisure time physical activity bFrom the 7-item version of the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale [ 13] cSystolic blood pressure defined as <140 mmHg (<130 mmHg if diabetic). <90 mmHg (<80 mmHg if diabetic) dMeans and proportions are adjusted for covariates used in the specific regression model (see text)68 ann. behav. med.

Medication Adherence Although the treatment group 'sa d j u s t e d7 - i t e mM o r i s k y Medication Adherence Scale scores improved by 0.19 points relative to controls, this change was not statistically significant (p=0.25) in the intent-to-treat analysis.

Blood Pressure When analyzed as continuous variables, the largest decrease in both SBP and DBP in the intervention group vs. the controlgroup occurred at the 8-month assessment (-2.3 mmHg, and - 1.2 mmHg, respectively); however, neither difference was statistically significant. Similarly, there was no statisticaldifference between groups in the proportion who achieved control of SBP, DBP, or both. Diabetics Though there were no pre-specified hypotheses for diabetic participants, we examined intervention effects in this sub- group both because the automated telephone intervention contained material tailored specifically for diabetics withhypertension, and because BP control is especially important in this population. In the intervention group, participants who reported type 2 diabetes used the automated telephone systemmore and had a lower attrition rate than those without diabetes.

For example, in the full sample there was no appreciable effect on minutes of moderate-or-greater physical activity, but among diabetics there was an increase of 37 min/week in the intervention group vs. controls at 8 months ( p<0.18). Similarly, among diabetics mean SBP decreased by 6.21 mmHg and DBP 1.51 mmHg in the intervention group vs. controls ( p=0.1 andp=0.43, respectively). Dose Response There was a dose -response relationship between the number of completed diet calls and improvement in the overall diet quality score ( r=0.31, p=0.008). There were no significant dose-response relationships for the other outcomes. Acceptability of the Automated Telephone System At the 8-month assessment, participants who completed at least one intervention call were surveyed on their experiencewith the automated system [ 26]. Responses to key summary questions were on a scale from 1 to 5 with 5 being the mostfavorable rating. The mean score for the question \"How satisfied were you with the automated telephone system? \" was 3.7. For \"How helpful did you find the system? \"it was 4.1, and for \"How helpful did you find the information the system provided? \"it was 4.2. The most frequent reasons reported for missing or skipping automated calls wereparticipant related such as not being home when the system called (77%), being too busy (56%), or having major life disruptions (36%). By contrast, system-related reasons formissed calls were reported less often. Examples include \"The system wasn 't right for me \"(16%), and participants having problems accessing the system (14%). Several baselineparticipant characteristics correlated with users 'opinions of the automated telephone system. Those with lower educa-tional attainment rated it as more enjoyable, helpful, useful,friendly, personal, and informative (r =0.19 -0.29, p=0.002 - 0.02). After controlling for edu cational attainment, the system was rated as more flexible by users with lower vs. higherperceived financial well-being ( r=0.19, p=0.04). Discussion The intervention was associated with statistically significant improvements in the primary outcomes of overall diet quality and energy expenditure, and with modest improvements in BP that were not statistically significant (Fig. 2). For all outcomes, positive effects did not persist 4 months after the intervention had ended. There was a dose -response effect on diet quality in the intervention group. Diabetic subjects in theintervention group had a significantly lower dropout ratethan non-diabetics. They also tended towards greater use of the intervention and greater improvements in most outcomesthan non-diabetics though these differences were not statistically significant. In prior studies from our group, single automated telephone interventions targeting physical activity, diet, or medicationadherence alone were each found effective [ 8,9,11]. Al though the current intervention combined content from these successful single-behavior prototypes, the observedeffects were smaller overall. This difference may relate to differences in the study sample (e.g., proactive recruitment inthis study versus volunteer-based in our prior studies) and study protocols (greater participant burden and attrition due to the need to assess multiple behaviors vs. a singlebehavior). It may also reflect fundamental differences in adherence caused by the effort and complexity of making more than one lifestyle change [ 27]. Nevertheless, a recent meta-analysis found that computer-tailored interventions targeting up to three health behaviors can be as effective as those targeting only one [ 28]. With respect to multi-behavior interventions, a further consideration is the relative impact of delivering each modulesequentially vs. simultaneously. The scant literature on this issue is mixed. In one study comparing simultaneous and sequential interventions among 289 blacks with hypertension,there was evidence that the simultaneous approaches were superior for sodium reduction and smoking cessation [ 29]. In contrast, findings from another trial among 315 female smokers supported a sequential over a simultaneous approach to multiple behavior changes including diet, exercise, and smoking cessation [ 30]. In our study we delivered each module sequentially, but required all participants to check and report their home blood pressure readings throughout follow-up. A subsample also chose to measure and reporttheir weight regularly. Such longitudinal self-monitoring constituted a \"simultaneous \"intervention that spanned the three behavioral modules and may have helped participants form connections between the content of each module. In this study, maximal intervention effects were seen at 8 months for several outcomes despite the fact that eachbehavioral module lasted only 2 -3 months. This suggests that subsequent modules may have reinforced positivechanges initiated during earlier modules, even though eachmodule targeted a different behavior. This phenomenon is akin to the \"co-variation \"of effects described in other multi-behavior interventions where improvements in a targeted health behavior are associated with improvements in other targeted or even non-targeted behaviors [ 31]. Indeed, the first three automated calls were designed not only to introduce the three behavioral modules, but also to emphasize the complementary role of each behavior in blood pressure control. Making these explicit connections70 ann. behav. med. (2012) 43:62- 73between the three behavioral modules early may have enabled mutual reinforcement of behavioral messages later on. More research is needed to elucidate how messagestargeting one behavior can be used to reinforce messages targeting other behaviors in multi-behavior change inter- ventions whether modules are delivered sequentially orsimultaneously. What is clear from the literature and from our results is that positive behavioral changes decay toward baselinelevels once the intervention is withdrawn [ 32]. A more intensive intervention or booster sessions following anintervention can slow this decay [ 32]. An advantage of automated counseling systems such as the one we report here is that they can be easily modified to deliver a more intensive intervention (i.e., to increase content and contactfrequency), and to help maintain positive behavior change by providing booster contacts after the primary intervention ends. In retrospect, providing intermittent reinforcement ofpositive behavior changes throughout the intervention may have maintained or increased earlier improvements and been more effective. The low overall rates of system use in this study likely limited intervention effects. Factors such as lower incomeand educational attainment and the presence of social - environmental obstacles have been shown to predict lowersubject participation in research studies [ 5,6]. There was little socio-demographic variation in our study sample and no baseline characteristic predicted system use vs. non-use, but participants who reported greater perceived financialhardship used the system less often than those who felt more financially secure. This is despite the fact that those with greater perceived financial hardship actually rated thesystem as more flexible than subjects who felt more financially secure. This suggests that those who experiencegreater financial stress and its attendant life disruptions mayparticularly appreciate the flexibility and accessibility of computerized health promotion systems such as ours. Even though their life circumstances may make it difficult forthem to fully utilize these systems, it is conceivable that their engagement in more rigid, traditional, face-to-face programs would be even lower. Similarly, we found thatparticipants with lower educational attainment rated the system more favorably than more educated users in the areas of information content, applicability, and in their overallexperience. Efforts were made to develop an intervention that was acceptable to a wide range of literacy levels. The system 's ability to identify and address the user 's knowledge gaps and to allow users to repeat conversations within modules mayhave enhanced its appeal among participants with less formal education. Further qualitative work is needed to identifybarriers to engagement in automated behavior change programs. Several additional issues may have reduced observed intervention effects. First, baseline values for several out-comes were unexpectedly high, which made it more difficult to achieve substantial improvements in the intervention group on these outcomes. Despite selection criteria designed tocreate a sample with uncontrolled BP and low adherence to self-care recommendations, mean baseline BP was only 131/ 81; 36% and 37% met recommendations for fruit andvegetable intake, respectively; and 32% met recommended guidelines for physical activity. In fact, 47% more participants in the intervention group met physical activity guidelines thanin the control group (38.5% vs. 26.3%). This chance occurrence meant that a greater proportion of intervention group participants were advised to maintain rather thanincrease their levels of physical activity, and that downward regression to the mean for physical activity was more likely in this group. Additionally, since participants with low baselinephysical activity were twice as likely to drop out of the intervention group than were control participants, the potential impact of upward regression to the mean was decreased inintent to treat analysis, also reducing physical-activity-related intervention effects. The limited impact of the intervention on our three behavioral outcomes made it especially difficult to see anintervention effect on BP \u2014a secondary outcome of this study \u2014especially in the context of limited power. In our sample, there was less than 80% power to detect a difference in SBP of 7 mmHg between the experimentalgroups. The relationship between behavior change and resulting physiologic change is complex and depends on both the magnitude and duration of the observed behavioralchanges. Further, BP reductions achieved by multi-behavior interventions are typically smaller than the sum of the reductions observed for their components when deployedalone. For example, the Trials of Hypertension Prevention Phase II study [ 27] showed an intervention combining weight loss and sodium restriction was associated with a smaller reduction in diastolic BP vs. controls at 6 months (2.8 mmHg, p<0.001) than the sum of the two component interventions when deployed singly ( 2.7 mmHg for weight loss alone, p<0.001, 1.6 for sodium alone, p< 0.001). In the PREMIER trial [ 4], adding the original DASH diet to an \"established \"regimen consisting of weight loss, limited sodium and alcohol intake, and increased physical activitydid not significantly reduce systolic BP further ( 0.6 mmHg vs.\"established \",p=0.43). Conclusion This study is the first to evaluate a culturally adapted, computer-based telephone counseling system for African - Americans that targets three health-related behaviors for the self-management of hypertension. It was associated with modest improvements in several study outcomes, butann. behav. med. (2012) 43:62- 73 71effects were hampered by high baseline attainment of goal levels for several principal study outcomes and by low system use. Nevertheless, computerized technologies likethis one provide an opportunity to deliver behavior change programs on a public health scale at relatively low cost, and to tailor health messages to both ethnic/racial group andindividual-level characteristics. Although our automated system was developed using input from African -Americans in Boston, it was designed to address obstacles that are likely to pose barriers to a broader segment of urban African - American of low socioeconomic status as well. As such, ourresults can be generalized to other urban settings in the USA.In addition, the content of the intervention can be further culturally adapted to reflect the cultural themes of specific African -American communities. More research is needed to better understand what combination of system features and user characteristics may lead to improved hypertension self- management among urban African -Americans of low SES.

PAASCHE-ORLOW Section of General Internal Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine/Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Low health literacy is associated with higher mortality, higher rates of hospitalization, and poor self-management skills for chronic disease. Early, unplanned hospital reutilization after discharge is a common and costly occurrence in U.S. hospitals. Still, few studies have examined the relation between health literacy and 30-day hospital reutilization rates. The authors examined the association between health literacy and 30-day reutilization of hospital services (readmission or return to the emergency department) in an urban safety net hospital, and conducted a secondary analysis of data from the control arm subjects of the Project RED and the RED-LIT trials. Health literacy was measured using the REALM tool. The primary outcome was rate of 30-day reutilization. The authors used multivariate Poisson regression analysis to control for potential confounding. Of the 703 subjects, 20% had low health literacy, 29% had marginal health literacy, and 51% had adequate health literacy. Sixty-two percent of subjects had a 12th-grade education or less. Subjects with low health literacy were more likely to be insured by Medicaid ( p < .001); Black non-Hispanic (p < .001); unemployed, disabled, or retired ( p < .001); low income ( p < .001); and less educated (high school education or less, p < .001). The fully adjusted incidence rate ratio for low health literacy compared with adequate health literacy was 1.46 (CI [1.04, 2.05]). Low health literacy is a significant, independent, and modifiable risk factor for 30-day hospital reutilization after discharge. Interventions designed to reduce early, unplanned, hospital utilization after discharge should include activities to mitigate the effect of patients' low health literacy. Nearly 20% of Medicare patients are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge (Jenks, Williams, & Coleman, 2009). Known predictors of early readmission include the following: lower socioeconomic status (Weissman, Stern, & Epstein, 1994), history of prior hospitalization (Van Walraven, Mamdani, Fang, & Austin, 2004) and advanced age (Cho, Lee, Arozullah, & Crittenden, 2008; Marcantonio et al., 1999), Downloaded by [Boston University] at 11:44 05 February 2013 326 S. E. Mitchell et al. length of stay greater than 7 days (Krumholz et al., 1997), a high burden of comorbid illnesses (based on Charlson score; Librero, Peiro, & Ordinana, 1999), and specific diagnoses (e.g., depression, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction; Krumholz et al., 1997; Mitchell et al., 2010; Parashar et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2008). Meanwhile, a streamlined discharge process designed to enhance patient safety during care transitions can reduce 30-day postdischarge hospital utilization as much as 30% (Jack et al., 2009). The 30-day rehospitalization rate has emerged as an important indicator of hospital quality, particularly because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services introduced a series of new reimbursement policies that include decreasing payments to hospitals with high rates of rehospitalization and bundled payment schemes in which accountable care organizations will be paid less for subsequent hospital utilization within 30 days. Thus, there is great interest in identifying modifiable risk factors for rehospitalization that could be used to refine intervention models and lead to improvements in quality of care, patient outcomes, and cost savings. Low health literacy has been linked to poor health outcomes, particularly for patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, cancer, depression (Lincoln et al., 2006), HIV/AIDS (Kalichman & Rompa, 2000), and heart failure (Peterson et al., 2011). Health literacy , defined as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information, skills, and services needed to make informed health decisions and take informed actions, affects many Americans (Paasche-Orlow, 2011; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000). An estimated 26% of the U.S. population has low health literacy, and an additional 20% has marginal health literacy (Paasche-Orlow et al., 2005). Health literacy barriers are often associated with greater risk of hospitalization (Baker, Parker, Williams, & Clark, 1998), higher rates of self-reported poor health status (Baker, Parker, Williams, Clark, & Nurss, 1997) decreased knowledge of one's medical condition, poor medication recall, nonadherence to treatment plans, poor self-care behaviors (Evangelista et al., 2010), and increased all-cause mortality (Wolf, Feinglass, Thompson, & Baker, 2010). Patients with low health literacy also are more likely to report unsatisfactory patient-doctor communication at the time of discharge, suggesting that some physicians may be insensitive or unaware when their patients are having difficulties comprehending discharge instructions (Kripilani et al., 2010). Although several of these factors have been linked to an increased risk for 30-day rehospitalization, very limited evidence has been presented to demonstrate the independent association between low health literacy and hospital reutilization within 30 days of discharge. This study examined the relation between health literacy and hospital reutilization within 30 days of discharge at the Boston Medical Center. The Boston Medical Center is the largest safety net hospital in New England, providing a spectrum of medical services to an urban, socially and economically diverse population. We hypothesized that low health literacy would be an independent risk factor for early unplanned hospital reutilization after discharge for general medical patients (i.e., adult patients admitted for acute general medical conditions such as pneumonia, unstable angina, pancreatitis, acute renal failure). Method We conducted a secondary analysis of the Project RED (Re-Engineered Discharge) and RED-Lit clinical trial data sets (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00252057) to assess the association between health literacy and the rate of subsequent 30-day hospital reutilization. The original Project RED included 738 participants and Downloaded by [Boston University] at 11:44 05 February 2013 Health Literacy and Postdischarge Utilization 327 RED-Lit included 802 participants. All Project RED studies enrolled English- speaking patients 18 years or older who were admitted to a general medical unit at the Boston Medical Center. Study subjects were required to have telephone access and be able to convey an understanding of study procedures and other consent elements in English. Participants were excluded if their admission was planned, they were on suicide watch, transferred from another health facility or were deaf or blind. Outcome data was not used in the secondary analysis if participants withdrew consent, died during the index admission, or were not discharged to the community. The combined sample included 1,540 patients from the control and intervention arms with complete information for the primary independent variable of interest\u2014 health literacy\u2014and the outcome variable\u201430-day hospital utilization. We used a final sample of 703 patients identified from the control arms of each of these trials. Subjects from the intervention groups were excluded to eliminate effect modification introduced by exposure to the intervention. Key Outcome Variables The primary outcome variable for this analysis was a combined count measure of emergency department and hospital utilization events by a patient within a 30-day period after the index discharge. We also examined the emergency department revisit and hospital readmission count outcomes separately for the purposes of identifying factors associated with these distinct events. The number of utilizations ranged from 0 to 15; however, we top-coded to a count of 8 to avoid undue influence of outliers. We collected outcome data using the Boston Medical Center electronic medical record or participant self-report obtained by phone interview after 30 days. Both reutilizations of the Boston Medical Center and other hospitals and emergency departments were included. Primary Independent Variable We measured health Literacy using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), which is a 66-item validated word recognition test (Davis et al., 1993). The REALM assigns a grade level of literacy, with scores of 0-18 corresponding to literacy of third grade or below, 19-44 to 4th- 6th grade, 45-60 to 7th-8th grade, and 61-66 to 9th grade or above. For the purposes of our analysis, the two categories of lowest literacy were combined because of the distribution of scores. We administered the REALM in person to study participants. Statistical Analysis Descriptive Statistics We performed bivariate analyses to assess the unadjusted relation between demographic and clinical characteristics and the three REALM categories of health literacy. The crosstabs reflect the results of chi-square tests. We then conducted Poisson regressions for all three outcome variables (combined reutilization, rehospitalization and return to the emergency department) to control for potential confounding. Predictors were included into the multivariable Poisson regressions on the basis of their effect on the association between health literacy and the outcomes, as well as the significance of their independent associations with the outcomes. Predictors were chosen from: age, gender, Downloaded by [Boston University] at 11:44 05 February 2013 328 S. E. Mitchell et al. marital status, income, insurance, employment, education, race, having a primary care physician, being homeless in the 6 months before the index admission, evidence of depressive symptoms, frequent utilizer status, length of stay, and medical comorbidity. Adjusted Charlson Score for Comorbidity Because of differences in the methods used to calculate Charlson scores between the RED and RED lit trials, we calculated a correction factor using a linear transformation procedure to adjust for the inconsistency in the distributions of Charlson scores for the combined analytic dataset. Charlson scores for the RED Lit II sample were calculated in a manner that accounted for comorbid conditions using all available records. For Project RED and RED Lit I, this process did not include outpatient record review. To derive a comparable Charlson score for the complete dataset, we calculated a z-score for each RED-lit II participant's observed score using the mean and standard deviation for the RED-lit II sample. Adjusted Charlson scores were then calculated for RED and RED-lit I (using the mean and standard deviation of this sample) to correspond to the z scores from the more comprehensively calculated sample. Adjustment for Confounding We constructed multivariable Poisson regression models using thorough backwards selection processes for each of the three outcome variables. We included certain variables (e.g., race, education, insurance) into the models because of their established relations with the variables of interest. We used SAS 9.1 to conduct the analysis with two-sided tests with p < .05 to judge significance. Results Of the 703 subjects, 138 (20%) patients had low health literacy ( 6th grade or REALM score of 0-18), 207 (29%) had marginal health literacy (7th to 8th grade or REALM score of 19-44) and 358 (51%) had adequate health literacy ( 9th grade or REALM score of 45-60). Study participants' mean age was 49.2 years of age, which did not differ by REALM score (see Table 1). Patients with low health literacy were more likely to be insured by Medicaid ( p < .001); Black ( p < .01), unemployed, disabled, or retired ( p < .001); low income (<$40,000/year, p < .001); and less educated (high school education or less, p < .001). Of subjects, 29% ( n = 206) were frequent utilizers, defined as two or more admissions in 6 months before index admission. The mean length of stay for the index admission was 2.8 days and did not differ significantly by REALM score. The mean Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 0.6, with a majority of the sample reporting a score of 0. There was no relation between comorbidity and health literacy. The unadjusted 30-day postdischarge hospital reutilization incidence rate ratio for subjects with low health literacy compared to subjects with adequate health literacy was 1.76 (95% CI [1.21, 2.55]). After adjusting for potential confounding using a multivariate Poisson regression analysis\u2014which included education, gender, marital status, income, race, affiliation with primary care provider, homelessness, depression, frequent utilizer status, age, length of stay, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index\u2014 we found that patients with low health literacy are 1.46 times (95% CI [1.04, 2.05]) more likely than patients with adequate health literacy to return to the hospital or emergency department within 30 days.

Mitchell et al. than nonutilizers (incidence rate ratio = 2.04 [1.58, 2.62] p < .0001) and those who were homeless in the 6 months before their index admission were 1.54 times more likely than those who were not homeless (incidence rate ratio = 1.54 [1.14,2.08] p = .0053; see Table 2) to return to the hospital or emergency department. Female gender (incidence rate ratio = 0.75 [0.58, 0.96] p = .02) and Black race (incidence rate ratio = 0.73 [0.55, 0.98] p = .04) were both associated with lower risk for early hospital reutilization. In subanalyses of the outcome variable, we used multivariate Poisson regression to examine incidence rate ratios for emergency department visits and hospital readmissions separately. We found that, compared with patients with adequate health literacy, low health literacy patients were 1.71 times more likely to be readmitted to the emergency department ( p < .05) and 1.67 (95% CI [0.98, 2.83], p < .06, times more likely to be readmitted into the hospital within 30 days of index admission. Discussion Concern about 30-day unplanned hospital reutilization is warranted as these events correlate with higher morbidity, mortality, and costs and is being used as a marker of the quality of hospital care (Ashton, Del Junco, Souchek, Wray, & Mansyur, 1997). Our study suggests that patients with low health literacy are more likely than patients with adequate health literacy to return to the hospital or emergency department within 30 days of discharge. These results were robust and health literacy remained an independent predictor of hospital utilization within 30 days of discharge after adjusting for a range of potential confounding phenomena, including education level. This study adds to growing evidence demonstrating the negative consequences of limited health literacy on patients' health and well-being (Davis & Wolf, 2004). It also establishes a link between health literacy and the process of care transitions, which has emerged as a centerpiece of efforts to improve quality and decrease cost. There are several potential reasons as to why patients with low health literacy may return to the hospital soon after their discharge relative to those with higher health literacy levels. Health literacy may prevent patients from understanding their discharge instructions\u2014including proper comprehension of their diagnosis and the treatment regimen (Anonymous, 2009; Williams et al., 1995). Williams and colleagues who showed that patients with low health literacy misread medication dosing (23.6% incorrect) and appointment slips (39.6% incorrect) in a survey of hospitalized patients while those with adequate literacy did well on these tasks. Patients may also have difficulty managing self-care instructions after hospital discharge, such as understanding symptoms of medication side effects and how to mitigate such phenomena, appreciating early signs of disease exacerbation and responding appropriately, and accessing and utilizing routine and urgent outpatient services. These issues may all contribute to how health literacy is related to returning to the hospital. Our results bring attention to the need for interventions designed to decrease the rate of unplanned hospital reutilization to focus on health literacy. Such interventions can augment the level of patient and family education and guidance that is provided. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality offers an evidence-based toolkit to address health literacy titled, \"Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit.\" The toolkit notably addresses four strategies for overcoming health literacy barriers. These include the following: (a) using easily understood spoken communication, (b) modifying written communication, (c) teaching self-management and empowerment, and (d) bolstering patient's support systems.

E. Mitchell et al. Quality's approach advocates for creating an environment in which patients of all health literacy levels can thrive. Some of these methods include the following: drawing pictures, using plain (nonmedical) language, and using the teachback approach (Brach et al., 2012; Koh et al., 2012; Weiss, 2003). Limitations Major strengths of the present study are the reasonably large dataset and the broad range of covariates available for analyses. However, several limitations should be noted. First, this study was conducted using data from clinical trials implemented at a single safety net hospital; therefore, results may not be generalizable to other patient populations. Further, reutilization events outside of the Boston Medical Center were collected by subject self-report but were not independently confirmed. However, we were able to confirm 91% of all events by medical record review. Last, although we attempted to account for known confounders, other factors may also exist and could remain unaddressed. Conclusion Our study suggests that low literacy is significantly associated with a higher rate of 30-day postdischarge hospital utilization. Patient health literacy plays an influential role in health outcomes and low health literacy can be a significant barrier to patients' safe transitions from hospital to home. Future directions include interventions to improve patient education for care transitions, reduce the health literacy burden of the discharge process, and remove unnecessary complexity from critical self-care tasks.

Patients and Methods: Patients admitted for substance abuse treatment between 1994 and 2006 were studied. Socio- demographic data, alcohol and drug use characteristics and clinical variables were obtained through hospital records. Blood samples for biochemistry, liver function tests, CD4 cell count, and serology of HIV and HCV infection were collected at admission. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyze the predictors of FIB-4 increase. Results: A total of 472 (83% M, 17% F) patients were eligible. The median age at admission was 31 years (Interquartile range (IQR) 27-35 years), and the median duration of drug use was 10 years (IQR 5.5-15 years). Unhealthy drinking ( .50 grams/ day) was reported in 32% of the patients. The FIB-4 scores were significantly greater in the HCV/HIV-coinfected patients (1.14, IQR 0.76-1.87) than in the HCV-monoinfected patients (0.75, IQR 0.56-1.11) (p ,0.001). In the multivariate analysis, unhealthy drinking (p = 0.034), lower total cholesterol (p = 0.042), serum albumin (p ,0.001), higher GGT (p ,0.001) and a longer duration of addiction (p = 0.005) were independently associated with higher FIB-4 scores in the HCV-monoinfected drug users. The effect of unhealthy drinking on FIB-4 scores disappeared in the HCV/HIV-coinfected patients, whereas lower serum albumin (p ,0.001), a lower CD4 cell count (p = 0.006), higher total bilirubin (p ,0.001) and a longer drug addiction duration (p ,0.001) were significantly associated with higher FIB-4 values.

Becausethe complications of liver disease mainly occur in patients withadvanced-stage fibrosis, assessing chronic hepatitis C early isessential when evaluating at-risk patients [2]. In Westerncountries, more than 50% of new HCV infections are associatedwith drug abuse. However, this particular population also has lower rates of clinical assessment and chronic hepatitis C treatment. Given the likelihood of new and more effectivetreatments, drug abusers with chronic hepatitis C would benefitfrom simple, non-invasive measurements of liver fibrosis. The cofactors associated with chronic hepatitis C progression differ among studies; alcohol abuse, male gender, age at infection,body mass index, and coinfection with human immunodeficiencyvirus infection (HIV) and Hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) have been related to more rapid disease progression [1-5]. In HCV/ HIV-coinfected individuals, CD4 cell counts below 200 cells/ mL have been associated with liver fibrosis progression [6]. In parallel,highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been shown toreduce liver-related deaths [7,8]. In HIV-negative patients, it is well established that alcohol abuse and HCV infection have a synergistic effect on liver fibrosis.However, there are conflicting results regarding the independent effect of alcohol on liver damage in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients [6,9,10]. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for assessing fibrosis [11]. However, assessing liver disease through an invasive procedure is unlikely in patients with substance abuse [12]. Furthermore,eligibility for chronic hepatitis C treatment in this population islow compared with eligibility in other populations [13,14]. To PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e46810a certain extent, the evolution of liver disease in drug abusers parallels the natural history of chronic hepatitis C. Several non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis have been proposed as alternatives to liver biopsy. Some of these markersreflect the modified extracellular matrix turnover that occursduring fibrogenesis [15,16], whereas others reflect alterations inhepatic function [17,18]. FIB-4 was initially described in 2006[18], and since then, it has been proposed as reliable marker offibrosis in both HCV-monoinfected and HCV/HIV-coinfectedindividuals [18,19]. FIB-4 correlates well with liver biopsy in patients with and without advanced fibrosis [20,21]. Moreover, non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis have been proposed aspredictors of all-cause and liver-related mortality [22,23]. Although abuse of alcohol and illegal drugs is frequent in patients with HIV infection and HCV infection, it is unclear hownon-invasive liver fibrosis tests may reflect disease progression. Inthis study, we hypothesize that certain clinical and laboratorycharacteristics may influence a simple index of fibrosis and that thecofactors associated with elevated FIB-4 scores may differ betweenHCV-monoinfected patients and HCV/HIV-coinfected patients.Hence, the primary objective of the study was to characterize theputative differences in risk factors for elevated liver functionbiomarkers between HCV-monoinfected and HCV/HIV-coin-fected patients. Patients and Methods Study Population This was a cross-sectional study of patients admitted for substance abuse treatment between 1994 and 2006. The de-mographic and drug use characteristics were recorded througha structured questionnaire administered by a physician the day ofadmission. Questions related to drug and alcohol abuse included:(i) the main drug of abuse (type of drug, age at first use, duration ofdrug use and route of administration), (ii) poly-drug use (yes/no)(iii) alcohol consumption: do you regularly drink alcohol? (yes/no);if yes, do you drink 5 or more standard drinks per day?. Astandard drink unit contains 12-14 grams of alcohol andunhealthy alcohol consumption was defined as a daily alcoholintake$50 grams (g) [24,25] in the 6-month period prior to admission. All participants gave written informed consent. Themethods used in this study complied with the ethical standards formedical research and principles of good clinical practice definedby the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki. Thestudy was approved by the Ethics Committee of the HospitalUniversitari Germans Trias i Pujol. Routine laboratory parameters, including liver function tests and serology for HIV infection and HCV infection, were analyzedat admission. Other characteristics of admission for substanceabuse treatment have been described elsewhere [26]. The liver function tests and biochemical parameters were assessed using an Olympus 5200 Multichannel chemistry analyzer.The procedure, which remained the same throughout the study, was based on the reference method recommended by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry. HIV infection was identified by an enzyme-linked immunosor- bent assay. Repeatedly reactive samples were confirmed by theWestern immunoblot technique. HCV infection was assessed prior to or during admission by a second- or later-generation enzyme immunoassay (OrthoDiagnostics, Raritan, NJ). recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA HCV Emeryville, (COBAS AMPLICOR, Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branch- burg, NJ). Outcome The primary outcome was the FIB-4 score, which was calculated than 1.45 indicate lack of liver fibrosis with a negative predictive value of 90% and a sensitivity of 70% [18]. FIB-4 scores greater than 3.25 indicate significant liver fibrosis with a positive predictive value of 65% and a specificity of 97% [18]. Statistical Analysis All of the analyses were conducted separately for the HCV- monoinfected (N = 228) and the HCV/HIV-coinfected (N = 244) individuals. We used medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) to describe the quantitative variables and absolute frequencies and percentages to describe the qualitative variables. The distribution of FIB-4 score was strongly skewed to the right (i.e., there were several very high values); we therefore normalized it for analysis purposes using a logarithmic transformation. We used multiple linear regression models to determine the FIB-4 predictive values of the variables. There were three types of predictors: (1) binary, which included sex, alcohol use, and HBsAg;(2) continuous on a natural (additive) scale, which included body mass index (BMI), CD4 cell count, total cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase, and duration of drug use; and (3) continuous on a logarithmic (multiplicative) scale, which included total bilirubin, serum albumin, and GGT. The decision to analyze a variableusing a logarithmic scale was based on the need to reduce the undue influence of high values in predictors with strong right skewness. The interpretation of the regression coefficients differed among the three types of predictors. Specifically, the regression coeffi-cients of the binary variables represented the percentage FIB-4 difference between those with and without the condition; the regression coefficients of the additive continuous variables represented the percentage FIB-4 difference associated with an unitary increase or decrease in the variables, and the regressioncoefficients of the multiplicative continuous variables represented the percentage FIB-4 difference associated with an increment or decrement in the variables. The intercept represented the expected FIB-4 score in an individual with zero values for all of the predictors. The test results were considered to be statistically significant if the resulting P- value was,.05. The statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software, version 15.0.1 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Results Patients were eligible for this study if they had chronic HCV infection (N = 544). Patients with aminotransferase levels 10 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range (N = 5,1.0%),patients who had received HCV antiviral therapy (N = 6,1.1%) and patients with antecedent of decompensated liver cirrhosis (N = 10,1.8%) were excluded. In addition, patients with an HCV- RNA level below the limit of detection ( ,50 IU/mL) wereLiver Fibrosis in Drug Users with Hepatitis C PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e46810excluded (N = 9, 1.7%). Finally, patients with outlier laboratory values and those with incomplete data for calculating FIB-4 scorewere also excluded (N = 42, 7.7%). After these exclusions, thestudy population consisted of 472 patients and 244 patients (52%)were coinfected with HIV. Table 1 shows the descriptive statisticsat admission for the entire group and for the HCV-monoinfected(N = 228) and HCV/HIV-coinfected (N = 244) subgroups. Over- all, 17% of the patients were women, the median age at admission was 31 years (IQR 27-35 years), the median BMI was 22 kg/m 2, the median duration of drug use was 10 years, and unhealthydrinking was reported in 32% of the patients. In addition todecreased CD4 cell counts, the HCV/HIV-coinfected patientshad a longer median drug use duration, an increased frequency ofunhealthy alcohol intake, lower levels of total cholesterol, higherlevels of GGT and a higher prevalence of HBsAg than thoseinfected with HCV only. The median AST and ALT levels and platelet counts were 35 U/L, 47 U/L, and 180 610 9/L, respectively. Thirty-one percent of the HIV-positive patients were receiving antiretroviral therapy at admission, and 48% had never received antiretroviral therapy. The median FIB-4 score at admission was 0.93 (IQR 0.65- 1.46); it was significantly higher in the IQR 0.76-1.87) than in the HCV-monoinfectedpatients (0.75, IQR 0.56-1.11). Figure 1 shows the distribution of the FIB-4 scores in the two groups on both natural and logarithmic scales. As can be seen in the bottom panels of Figure 1, the log-transformed FIB-4 scores approximately followed a normaldistribution, rendering normally based methods appropriate forthe analysis.Regression Analysis of FIB-4 (Log Scale) We conducted univariate regressions of the variables shown in Table 1 against the log-transformed FIB-4 scores; only the variables that define FIB-4 were not used in the univariate regressions. The two columns with univariate headings in Table 2show the results of the univariate analyses separately for the monoinfected and coinfected patients. In the univariate models for the HCV-monoinfected patients, unhealthy alcohol use, higher BMI, longer duration of drug use, lower cholesterol, higher bilirubin, lower albumin, and higher GGT were significantly associated (p ,0.05) with higher FIB-4 scores. In the coinfected patients, higher FIB-4 scores were found to be significantly associated (p ,0.05) with a longer drug use duration, lower cholesterol, higher alkaline phosphatase, lower CD4 cell count, higher bilirubin, lower albumin, and higher GGT. For each group, the variables that showed significant relation- ships in the univariate analyses were used in a multivariate model. In the multivariate model for the HCV-monoinfected patients, unhealthy alcohol use (p = 0.034), longer drug use duration (p = 0.005), lower cholesterol (p = 0.042), lower albumin (p,0.001), and higher GGT (p = 0.001) continued to be signifi- cantly associated with higher FIB-4 scores. In the coinfected patients, longer drug use duration (p ,0.001), lower CD4 cell count (p = 0.007), higher bilirubin (p ,0.001), and lower albumin (p ,0.001) were significantly associated with higher FIB-4 scores. Longer drug use duration and lower albumin levels were significantly associated with increased FIB-4 scores in both groups.By contrast, unhealthy alcohol use was strongly predictive of high FIB-4 scores only in the HCV-monoinfected group; similarly, high Table 1.

Although the primary aim of the study was the characterization of the variables that were associated with FIB-4 increase in HCV- monoinfected and HCV/HIV-coinfected, the intercepts of the multivariate models provide a means of comparing a hypotheticalHCV-monoinfected individual with a hypothetical HCV/HIV-coinfected individual, assuming that both have 900 CD4 cells/ mL and that all of the other variables are equal. The slightly increased FIB-4 intercept value (0.778 in the monoinfected and 0.875 in the coinfected patients) was not statistically significant (p = 0.218).However, for each decline of 100 CD4 cells/ mL among the coinfected patients, there was a significant FIB-4 increase of 3.6%(p = 0.007) (Table 2). To further characterize the differential effect of unhealthy alcohol use on FIB-4 scores, Figure 2 shows the distributions of theFIB-4 scores in the four groups by alcohol consumption and HIVcoinfection. Figure 2 shows box plots that are graphically enhanced to show the 2.5 th,5th,1 0th,2 5th,5 0th,7 5th,9 0th,9 5th and 97.5thpercentiles of the FIB-4 distribution. It is clear from Figure 2 that the primary difference was between the non-drinkingHCV-monoinfected patients and the other three groups. Inparticular, the increased FIB-4 score due to unhealthy alcohol use among the HCV-monoinfected patients was similar to theeffect of HIV-related immunodeficiency among the non-drinkers. The additional increase in FIB-4 among the coinfected individuals with unhealthy alcohol use was small and not significant(p = 0.695). Discussion Individuals with histories of drug use account for the majority of new hepatitis C infections in Western countries. This population isat risk for liver fibrosis, and a number of disease progressioncofactors highlight the relevance of medical assessment. Evaluatingliver fibrosis via non-invasive tests early in the course of drugaddiction may increase the proportion of patients who are eligiblefor treatment. This study of young adults with chronic hepatitis Cshows that the factors associated with higher FIB-4 scores clearlydiffered between the HCV-monoinfected and HCV/HIV-coin-fected individuals. The main contribution of the study is related to the fact that unhealthy alcohol use had a differential effect on FIB-4 values ifpatients have hepatitis C alone or HCV/HIV coinfection.Unhealthy alcohol drinking has been regarded as a majorcontributor to the progression of liver disease in the setting ofchronic hepatitis C [27] and, a synergistic effect between HCVand alcohol has been proposed [28]. However, even though Figure 1. Distribution of FIB-4 score and log FIB-4 score according to HCV-monoinfection and HCV/HIV-coinfection. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0046810.g001Liver Fibrosis in Drug Users with Hepatitis C PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e46810alcohol use is among the cofactors related with liver fibrosis in coinfection in studies with liver biopsy [6,29], the present andother studies that have used non- invasive methods to estimatefibrosis [9,10], does not detect an additional effect of alcoholdrinking on the FIB-4 of HCV/HIV-coinfected patients.In coinfected patients with unhealthy alcohol consumption, the FIB-4 does not reflect the negative impact of alcohol intake onliver fibrosis. Therefore, clinicians may not be able to assess theimpact of ethanol nor can advise the patient on the risk of diseaseprogression. On the contrary, unhealthy alcohol use is reflected inTable 2.

Unhealthy alcohol use in the HCV-monoinfected patients and HIV-related immunodeficiency in the HCV/HIV-coinfected patients are the most important cofactors associated with fibrosis progression in the respective populations. In addition, we found that drug use duration and serum albumin were correlated with the FIB-4 scores of both the monoinfected and coinfected patients, whereas unhealthy alcohol use, GGT and total cholesterol were associated with higher FIB-4 scores only in the monoinfected patients. The effect of HIV-related immunodeficiency in the coinfected patients was strong (an increase of 3.5% in the FIB-4 score for every 100 CD4 cells/ mL decrease). Furthermore, we did not observe differing FIB-4 values between the HCV-mono- infected and coinfected individuals with CD4 cell counts above 900 cells/ mL. This observation suggests that FIB-4 elevation is associated with immunoactivation and the resulting decrease of CD4 cell counts in HCV/HIV-coinfected drug users. The relationship between HIV-related immunodeficiency and liver fibrosis progression has been described in coinfected patients [6,29,30]; in fact, treating HIV/AIDS with HAART has been shown to reverse the effect of HIV-related immunodeficiency inpatients with chronic hepatitis C [7,26,29,31]. In this study, decreased serum albumin and increased total bilirubin were associated with elevated FIB-4 scores. This finding may facilitate identifying a subpopulation of patients at increased risk for cirrhosis. It is well known that albumin and bilirubin are key components of the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score that clinicians use to assess decompensated liver cirrhosis. In individuals with history of injection drug use, the duration of injection use is a surrogate for the duration of HCV infection [32]. As expected, the duration of drug addiction in this study was related to increased FIB-4 scores. It has been reported that HCV infection itself lowers both low- density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol and that patients treated for chronic hepatitis C had larger increases in LDL andtotal cholesterol from baseline [33]. Interestingly, the current study did not find a significant association between cholesterol levels andFIB-4 scores among the HCV/HIV-coinfected patients. This study has a number of limitations that should be mentioned. First, the alcohol intake assessment was limited toone categorical variable ( .50 g/day, #50 g/day in the 6-month period before admission), and there was no information on thehistory and complications of alcohol consumption. In previousstudies, however, recent alcohol consumption has been treated asa dichotomous variable using a threshold of 40-50 grams of ethanol per day or using the definition of heavy alcohol intake provided by the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse andAlcoholism (NIAAA) [6,9,10]. Second, we used a single measure-ment of laboratory parameters to calculate the FIB-4 scores whichprecluded examining the evolution of fibrosis over time. Further-more, nearly half of the patients had normal aminotransferasesvalues, as has been previously described for IDUs [34]; despite thelack of correlation between liver enzyme alterations and liverdamage, it is possible that FIB-4 scores are affected by normal liverenzymes [20]. Third, the HAART status of the HIV-positivepatients was represented by a qualitative covariate, whichhindered an analysis of the effect of antiretroviral treatment onFIB-4. In summary, this study shows that unhealthy alcohol use strongly influence FIB-4 in HCV- monoinfected patients, whereasin the context of HCV/HIV coinfection, HIV-related immune depression exerts a major negative role on FIB-4 results, with no significant worsening by alcohol intake.

To identify genetic variants associated with the ankle-brachial index (ABI), a noninvasive measure of PAD, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study data from 21 population-based cohorts. Methods and Results\u2014Continuous ABI and PAD (ABI /H113490.9) phenotypes adjusted for age and sex were examined. Each study conducted genotyping and imputed data to the /H110152.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HapMap. Linear and logistic regression models were used to test each SNP for association with ABI and PAD using additive genetic models. Study-specific data were combined using fixed effects inverse variance weightedmeta-analyses. There were a total of 41 692 participants of European ancestry ( /H1101560% women, mean ABI 1.02 to 1.19), including 3409 participants with PAD and with genome-wide association study data available. In thediscovery meta-analysis, rs10757269 on chromosome 9 near CDKN2B had the strongest association with ABI ( /H9252/H11005/H110020.006, P/H110052.46/H1100310/H110028). We sought replication of the 6 strongest SNP associations in 5 population-based studies and 3 clinical samples (n/H1100516 717). The association for rs10757269 strengthened in the combineddiscovery and replication analysis (P/H110052.65/H1100310/H110029). No other SNP associations for ABI or PAD achieved genome-wide significance. However, 2 previously reported candidate genes for PAD and 1 SNP associated withcoronary artery disease were in more than 40 000 individuals identified 1 genome wide significant association on chromosome 9p21 with ABI. Two candidate genes for PAD and 1 SNP for coronary artery disease are associated with ABI. (Circ Cardiovasc Genet. 2012;5:100-112.)

AnABI/H113490.90 is indicative of definite PAD. 7In previous work, the Ankle-Brachial Index Collaboration demonstrated a reverseJ-shaped relationship of ABI with mortality and coronary events,with a low risk ABI ranging from 1.11 to 1.40. 8 Clinical Perspective on p 112 Little is known about genetic susceptibility to PAD, but familial aggregation and heritability estimates suggest asignificant genetic component. 9-13A study of 112 biological candidate genes identified only 2 single nucleotide poly-morphisms (SNPs) in NOS3 significantly associated with ABI. 14The candidate gene approach to identify novel genetic variants for PAD has been limited by modest study samplesize, relatively small number of genes examined, and lack ofreplication in independent samples. 13 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led suc- cessfully to the discovery of novel genetic variants for severalcommon diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD). 15 The association between genetic variants on chromosome9p21 and CAD has demonstrated replication, 16,17 persistent association across race or ethnicity,18and association with other vascular diseases.19-21 phenotypes, such as ABI, are sparse. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysisof GWAS findings for ABI within an international consor-tium of 21 population-based cohort studies that included41 692 participants of European ancestry, among whom 3409participants had PAD (ABI /H113490.90). We conducted replica- tion analyses of our strongest findings in over 16 000 indi-viduals from population-based cohort studies and clinicallybased samples of PAD. We hypothesized that this approachwould lead to the unbiased identification of genetic variantsassociated with ABI. Further, we hypothesized that somegenetic variants for ABI would be identical to those reportedto be associated with CAD or its risk factors given sharedunderlying biological pathways, while some genetic variantswould be associated uniquely with PAD. Methods Discovery Studies Our analyses were conducted within the international Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE)Consortium, 22and included 4 of the 5 original CHARGE cohorts: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC, n/H110057630), the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS, n /H110053193), the Framingham Heart Study (FHS, n/H110053572), and the Rotterdam Study (RS-I,n/H110055169 and RS-II, n/H110051642). Ten additional population-basedcohorts joined the collaboration for analysis of ABI phenotypes: theFamily Heart Study (FamHS, n/H110051736), Genetic Epidemiology Network of Study (GENOA, n /H11005991), Gutenberg Heart Study (GHS, n/H110053122), Aging, Body n/H11005 1564), the Invecchiare in Chianti Study (InCHIANTI, n /H110051612), NijmegenBiomedical Study (NBS, n/H11005544), and the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP, n/H11005543). A further 6 studies derived from popu- lation isolates also were and the Orkney Complex Disease Study (ORCADES,n/H11005693). For all studies participating in the meta-analyses, eachparticipant self-identified as European or European-American andprovided written informed consent, and the Institutional ReviewBoard at the parent institution for each respective cohort approvedthe study protocols. More detailed study-specific information isprovided in the online-only Data Supplement Methods. Ankle-Brachial Index Phenotypes Ankle and brachial blood pressure measurements for each partici-pating study were obtained from the baseline examination or the firstexamination in which the measurement was obtained. Details on theABI protocol used and the calculation performed in each study areprovided in online-only Data Supplement Table I. To calculate theABI for each leg, the systolic blood pressure at each ankle wasdivided by the systolic blood pressure in the arm. If the systolicblood pressure was measured in both arms, the higher arm readingwas used in the ABI calculation. If replicate readings were obtained,the mean of the 2 measurements for each limb was used to calculatethe ABI, with the exception of InCHIANTI, which used the higherof the 2 readings of each measurement set to calculate the ABI. Thelower of the ABIs from the 2 legs was used for analysis. In ARIC andFamHS, the ABI was measured in only 1 leg, chosen at random.Participants with an ABI /H110221.40 were excluded because this high ABI may represent medial sclerosis, fibrocalcific disease secondaryto diabetes mellitus, or other causes of noncompressible vessels. To maximize the sample size and the power to detect genetic variants with modest effects, and to examine the entire range of ABIvalues given the recent evidence of increased cardiovascular diseaserisk associated with ABI values up to 1.1, 8we examined the continuous range of ABI /H110211.40. As a secondary analysis to provide a clinical phenotype, we defined PAD as ABI /H113490.90 and conducted a case (ABI /H113490.9)/control; ABI /H110220.90 and /H110211.40) comparison analysis. Genotyping and Imputation Different genotyping platforms were used by the 21 studies (online-only Data Supplement Table II). Each study imputed the genotype\"dosage\" (0 to 2) for the expected number of alleles for /H110152.5 million Phase II HapMap participant (available at http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/software.html),24GHS, InCHIANTI, SHIP used IMPUTE,25and all other cohorts used MACH (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MaCH/). Statistical Analysis We devised a GWAS analysis plan for the ABI and PAD phenotypesthat each study independently implemented. Sex-specific and age-adjusted residuals of ABI were created from linear regression modelsand used as phenotypes in the analysis. No transformation of the ABImeasure was performed before analysis. In FHS, residuals also wereobtained separately in the original and offspring cohorts. Multi-sitestudies (ARIC, CHS, and FamHS) additionally adjusted for fieldstudy site. Each SNP was tested for association with ABI in additivegenetic models using linear regression. The Amish Study, FamHS,FHS, and GENOA cohorts used linear mixed effects toaccount for familial correlations. Croatia-Vis, \"mmscore\" function ofthe GenABEL package for R statistical software for the associationtest under an additive model. This score test for a family-basedassociation takes into account pedigree structure and allows unbiasedestimations of SNP allelic effect when relatedness is present betweenexaminees. Logistic regression adjusting for age and sex was used totest each SNP for association with the PAD phenotype. The FamHS,Murabito et al Genome-Wide Meta-Analysis of Ankle-Brachial Index 101 at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from FHS, and GENOA cohorts used generalized estimating equations clustering on family to account for family correlations. A genome-wide meta-analysis using a fixed effects approach with inverse variance weighting was then conducted in METAL26[www. sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/metal] for 2 669 158 SNPs in the meta-analysis, excluding the population isolates (2 670 732 SNPs includ-ing the population isolates) that met imputation and quality controlcriteria (online-only Data Supplement Table II). Before meta-anal-ysis, genomic control was applied to each study. The association ofABI per each additional risk allele was quantified by the regressionslope ( /H9252), its standard error [SE( /H9252)], and the corresponding proba- bility value. We calculated a meta-analysis odds ratio for each of themost significant SNP associations for PAD. The meta-analysis oddsratio estimates the increase in odds of PAD for each additional copyof the risk allele of the SNP. SNP associations were considered to besignificant on a genome-wide level at P/H110215/H1100310 8.27,28 Standardized gene and SNP annotations were created using a PERL script.29We also tested for heterogeneity of study specific regression parameters using Cochran Q statistic. Because of concerns about heterogeneity,we conducted analyses of nonisolate studies and of the full group ofstudies. We selected SNPs for replication using results from themeta-analysis, excluding the population isolates, because the avail-able replication samples did not include isolates. We excluded SNPassociation results if the total meta-analysis sample was less than20 000 and if the average minor allele frequency of the SNP was/H110215%. Replication We sought to replicate independent SNP associations for ABI thatattained genome-wide significance (1 region), SNPs with suggestiveassociations (5 regions, P/H1102110 /H110025), and bioinformatics data support - ing the signal. The bioinformatic analyses are described in detail inthe online-only Data Supplement Material. In addition, we sought toreplicate 1 SNP associated with both ABI and PAD at P/H1102110 /H110024. The replication studies included 5 population-based studies and 3clinically-based studies, including a total of over 16 000 participants:the Bruneck Study (n/H11005786), the Copenhagen Multi-Ethnic Study of Health and ExaminationSurveys Cardio- vascular Intermittent Claudication (CAVASIC, n Study, Genetic Determinants of Peripheral Arterial the Linz Peripheral Arterial Disease (LIPAD, n/H11005671) Study. Each collaborating study was provided with a SNPlist and a detailed analysis plan. MESA and PREVEND used in silico genotyping (online-only Data Supplement Table II), the the SNPs using Taqman assays heterozygosity demonstrated all with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium atthe nominal 5% test-level (online-only Data Supplement Table III). 30 Examination of Candidate Genes Associated With Peripheral Artery Disease and Coronary ArteryDisease/Myocardial Infarction We selected candidate genes for ABI or PAD from the published literature using PubMed search terms \"([ankle-brachial index] OR[peripheral arterial disease]) AND polymorphism.\" Association stud-ies with at least 100 cases and 100 controls were included regardlessof whether the original study results were positive or negative. Usingthe discovery meta-analysis results for ABI, we then identified themost strongly associated SNPs based on probability values withinthe gene region /H11006100 kb upstream or downstream of the candidate gene. Because of the high correlation of imputed genotypes, theeffective number of loci were calculated for each region 31using the genotype scores from the KORA F4 Study (online-only DataSupplement Methods). Bonferroni correction of probability valuesthen was applied in each region using the effective number of loci.Subsequently, false discovery rates (FDR) were calculated usingthese corrected probability values, accounting for the number of generegions examined (online-only Data Supplement Methods). Lastly, we examined the association with ABI of 30 SNPs strongly associ-ated with CAD in recent GWAS. 32-34 Our ABI discovery meta-anal- ysis did not include 2 of the 30 SNPs (rs17465637 and rs3798220),and we were unable to identify proxy SNPs available in our data.Using the probability values for the 28 SNPs in our discoverymeta-analysis, we then calculated the FDR for each CAD SNP,accounting for the 28 regions examined. Results Study Sample The study sample included 41 692 participants of European ancestry (56% women, 6256 from population isolates) withABI data and genome-wide genotyping. Participant char-acteristics at the time of ABI measurement for each cohortare provided in online-only Data Supplement Table IV.Across the studies the mean age ranged from 41.8 years to73.8 years, the mean ABI ranged from 1.02 to 1.19, and8.2% (n/H11005 3409) had PAD (ABI /H110210.9). Characteristics of the replication samples were similar to the discovery set(online-only Data Supplement Table V). ABI-SNP Associations We conducted a meta-analysis with (n /H1100541 692) and without (n/H1100535 434) the population isolates (online-only Data Supple- ment Figures I and II, QQ-plots and Manhattan plots ,and study-specific lambdas ranged from 0.997 to 1.044). Ourprimary meta-analysis excluded studies from population iso-lates because of concern for study heterogeneity and the lackof availability of replication samples from isolates. Thestrongest SNP association for ABI was isolates, online-only Data SupplementTable VII). Among the 96 SNP associations for ABI withP/H1102110 /H110025, 79 were located in the chromosome 9p21 region (online-only Data Supplement Table VI). The ABI SNPrs10757269 is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD), withseveral SNPs in the region previously reported be associ-ated with CAD or myocardial infarction (r 2/H110220.8), but this ABI SNP is not in LD with SNPs previously associated withthe type 2 diabetes mellitus (Figure 1). We repeated themeta-analysis to examine the association between ABI andrs10757269, first adjusting for CAD and then excluding individuals with CAD among the nonisolate studies. Theassociation remained but was no for CAD: P/H110055.56/H1100310 /H110026; excluding CAD: P/H110053.79/H1100310/H110025). Next, we sought to replicate the association between rs10757269 and ABI in both population-based andclinically-based samples (n/H1100516 717). The magnitude anddirection of the association in the replication studies wassimilar to the discovery set ( /H9252/H11005/H110020.0035, P/H110050.0176), pro- viding evidence of replication. In the combined stage 2discovery plus replication meta-analysis, the ABI-rs10757269 association became stronger (P/H110052.65/H1100310 /H110029). The study-specific estimates of effect for the discoverystudies, population isolates, replication studies, and overalldiscovery plus replication meta-analyses are presented inFigure 2. Two studies among the population isolates (theAmish Study and Croatia-Split) had effect estimates in the102 Circ Cardiovasc Genet February 2012 at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from opposite direction to the other studies. None of the other SNP associations for ABI achieved genome-wide significance.The significance of the associations for the additional SNPschosen for replication diminished in the discovery plusreplication meta-analysis (Table 1, online-only Data Supple-ment Table VII). PAD-SNP Associations None of the SNP associations for the PAD phenotype(defined by an ABI /H113490.9) achieved genome-wide signifi- for online-only Data Supplement Table VIII). Thestrongest association was found for rs6584389 on chromo-some 10 near the PAX2 gene (odds ratio 1.17, 95% confi- dence interval 1.10, 1.25, P/H110052.34/H1100310 /H110026). Of note, the chromosome 9 SNP rs10757269 association with PAD was ina direction consistent with the ABI association but did notachieve statistical significance (Table 1, /H9252/H110050.0849, P/H110050.004, increasing the odds of PAD).Overlap in SNP Associations for ABI and PAD While the directions of effect for the ABI SNPs in Table 1 were consistent with the PAD association result (lower ABI,increased odds of PAD), there was little overlap in the topassociations for the 2 phenotypes. Only 3 regions marked bySNPs in or near IDE (10q23-q25), DAB21P (9q33.2), and GRAMD1C (3q13.31), in addition to the chromosome 9p21 region, showed association with both ABI and PAD at theP/H1102110 /H110024level (online-only Data Supplement Table IX). SNP rs7100623 in IDE demonstrated the strongest novel associa- tion ABI ( tP/H1102110/H110024; however, the associ - ation probability value was not significant in the replicationstage, and diminished in the combined discovery plus repli-cation meta-analysis. Examination of PAD Candidate Genes Among the 55 candidate genes or regions previously tested for association with ABI or PAD, 8 regions showed nomi-nally significant probability values (P/H110210.05) after correctionTable 1.

After accounting for the number of regions examined using a falsediscovery rate (FDR /H110210.10), we found evidence of 9p21 locus (rs1333049) reported to be associated with ABI(Table 3). 35We found no evidence of association between ABI and any of the other candidate genes previously testedfor association with ABI or PAD (online-only Data Supple-ment Table X). Examination of Coronary Artery Disease/ Myocardial Infarction Candidate Genes Among the 30 SNPs previously reported by GWAS to be associated with CAD or myocardial infarction, 28 SNPs wereavailable in our discovery meta-analysis of ABI, and 2 ofthese SNPs demonstrated an association (FDR /H110210.10) with ABI, CDKN2B Supplement Table XI). Discussion Our GWAS meta-analysis for ABI conducted in more than 40 000 adults of European ancestry has several notablefindings. First, we identified and replicated 1 genome-widesignificant association between a SNP in the chromosome9p21 region and ABI. No other ABI-SNP associationsachieved genome-wide significance. Second, in our discoverysample, over 3000 adults had PAD (ABI /H113490.9); however, none of the SNP associations were significant. Third, the directions of effect were consistent across the 2 pheno-types for the most significant ABI SNPs (lower ABI,increased odds of PAD): however, we observed minimaloverlap in the top SNP associations for ABI and PAD.Finally, the effect size for the 9p21 SNP was modest. Theassociation itself is, however, intriguing, and may provideinsights into the biological mechanisms contributing togeneralized atherosclerosis. Chromosome 9p21 Locus and Atherosclerosis Susceptibility Common genetic the locus are associated strongly with myocardial infarction and CAD,17,33,36 and confer risk for other atherosclerotic diseases including stroke,19cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysm,20,21 and clinically diagnosed PAD; however, the relation with PADwas diminished when coronary artery disease cases wereexcluded. 20SNP associations at the 9p21 locus with subclin- ical measures of atherosclerosis have been conflicting. Ini-tially, no association was observed with carotid intima-medialthickness or flow mediated dilation in young or olderadults; 37,38 however, more recent reports demonstrate an association with the development and progression of carotidatherosclerosis 39and with the suggestion of a stronger effect in men.40To further investigate the ABI-9p21 SNP associa- tion noted in this study, we conducted the meta-analysis afteradjusting for CAD and after exclusion of individuals withCAD. Not surprisingly, the association persisted but was no Figure 1. Genomic context of the genome-wide signicant signal at chromosome 9p21 plotted against the /H11002log10Pvalues. r2is between the top signal (rs10757269) and each SNP is shown. SNPs previously reported from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to be associated with coronary artery disease (CHD, arrows), type 2 diabetes (T2DM, arrows), and Pvalue for association with ankle- brachial index are shown. Chromosome positions are based on build hg18.104 Circ Cardiovasc Genet February 2012 at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from longer genome-wide significant. Both CAD and PAD are manifestations of underlying atherosclerosis, and nearly twothirds of individuals with PAD have coexisting coronary orcerebrovascular disease. 41One previous report conducted in 3 studies of older adults identified an association between avariant at 9p21 and lower ABI, as well as an increased risk forPAD. 35The primary effect of the chromosome 9p21 region may be on the atherosclerotic process itself, and there arelikely to be many other factors, both genetic and environmen-tal, that determine whether it manifests as CAD, PAD, oranother clinical atherosclerotic phenotype. The primary bio-logical mechanism underlying the association with ABI isunknown but appears to be independent of 2 major PAD riskfactors, diabetes and smoking, as the ABI SNP in the 9p21region we identified is not in linkage disequilibrium with theSNPs in the region associated with diabetes risk 42,43 or smoking-related behaviors.44The mechanism may be related to modulation of platelet reactivity,45atheroma formation, plaque instability, thrombosis, or biological processes not yetidentified. 46The SNP associated with ABI is Ankle-brachial index-chromosome 9p21 (rs10757269) association: study-specic estimates of effect for the discovery studies, population isolates, replication studies, and overall discovery and replication meta-analyses.

CDKN2B is abundantly expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions,47and animal models suggest that altered CDKN2A/B expression results in abnormal regulation of vascular cell proliferation.48Func- tional studies reveal a long noncoding RNA at this locusnamed ANRIL, and a mouse model has confirmed theessential role of ANRIL in regulation of CDKN2B expression through a cis-acting mechanism. 49,50ANRIL is implicated in proliferation and senescence. PAD Candidate Genes We performed a literature search to identify all candidategene regions previously investigated for association withPAD or ABI, irrespective of whether the association wasreported to be positive or negative. This approach revealed 2further associated gene regions: DAB2IP andCYBA. DAB2IP rs13290547 was not only associated also with PAD (P/H110053.62/H1100310 /H110025and 2.2/H1100310/H110025, respectively; online- only Data Supplement Table X). The DAB2IP gene encodes an inhibitor that is involved in the regulation of cell survivaland proliferation. One variant in the DAB2IP gene (rs70254486) recently has been detected in a GWAS ofabdominal aortic aneurysm. 51That study also detected an association with PAD as a secondary end point in 3690 casesversus 12 271 controls (P /H110053.9x10 /H110025). The same SNP showed an association with CVD within a meta-analysis ofcase control studies. 52TheCYBA gene is involved in NADPH oxidase regulation, which contributes to oxidative stress andplays a key role in the pathophysiology of coronary disease.Only 1 report investigated a SNP (rs4673) in this gene forassociation with PAD among 324 cases and 295 controls, butdid not find an association. 53Our study found an association of rs3794624 (r2/H110050.5 with rs4673) with continuous ABI, which may indicate that the earlier study likely lacked powerto find this association. None of the other gene regions had sufficient evidence for association with continuous ABI inour meta-analysis. Another very wide-reaching approachdesigned to systematically examine a large number of genesrelated to intermediate phenotypes of atherosclerosis, regulation, metabolism, inflamma-tion, oxidative stress, vascular wall biology, obesity, anddiabetes, found only eNOS to be significantly associated withABI. 14This gene could not be confirmed by our candidate gene examination. Coronary Candidate Genes Besides the chromosome 9 locus, 1 other SNP reported to beassociated with coronary disease in recent GWAS alsoshowed an association with ABI in our study; rs1122608 inLDLR. The LDLR gene plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis, and mutations at this gene have been shown toinfluence LDL cholesterol levels and the subsequent risk forcoronary disease. 54The association of LDLR gene with ABI in our study is a confirmation of the shared biologicalpathways underlying both subclinical and clinically apparentdisease. Strengths/Limitations Our meta-analysis represents the largest collaborative effort to date to identify genome-wide SNP associations for varia-tion in ABI and PAD (ABI /H113490.90), and our findings suggest the absence of common variants with large effects on ABI.Use of ABI as our primary phenotype has major advantagesof detecting asymptomatic PAD, as the ABI is an objectivemeasurement, whereas clinical PAD requires subjectivesymptoms of exertional leg discomfort and mobility of theindividual. However, several limitations of our meta-analysismerit comment. The blood pressure measurement protocoland ABI calculation was heterogeneous across participatingstudies. While protocols were standardized within each study,Table 3. Literature-Reported Candidate Genes for Peripheral Artery Disease and Coronary Artery Disease and Their Association With Ankle-Brachial Index in the CHARGE GWAS Discovery Sample (Population Isolates effective lociPValue CorrectedFalse Discovery Rate PAD genes ABI. Chr indicates chromosome. Candidate genes for PAD were selected for testing with ABI if an association study with at least 100 cases and 100 controls was available in the literature, independent of whether the study was positive or negative. Genes for CAD were considered only for testing with ABI if they were identified by recent GWA St ob e genome-wide significantly associated with CAD. The table shows only the genes which showed an experiment-wise significant association with ABI after correction for multiple testing. The entire list of genes can be seen in online-only Data Supplement Table X and XI for PAD and CAD genes, respectively. Due to the high correlation of imputed genotype scores, the effective number of loci was calculated for each PAD gene region (31) using the genotype scores from the KORA F4 Study. Bonferroni correction of Pvalues then was applied in each region using this number. Furthermore, the corrected Pvalue thresholds of significance for 28 CAD loci (tested in online-only Data Supplement Table XI, /H9251/H110050.05/28, 1.85/H1100310/H110023) and 55 PAD loci (tested in online-only Data Supplement Table X,/H9251/H110050.05/effective number of loci) were calculated. We also calculated a false discovery rate (FDR) using the corrected Pvalues accounting for the number of gene regions examined. An FDR /H110210.10 defined evidence of a significant association.106 Circ Cardiovasc Genet February 2012 at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from the studies were not designed to be fully standardized and comparable across studies (online-only Data SupplementTable I). This phenotype heterogeneity may have impactedour ability to detect associations. Furthermore, for manystudies, information about a previous revascularization inter-vention was not available. This lack of data may have resultedin the misclassification of some of the most affected personsby placing them into an ABI range of unaffected individualsand consequently reducing our power to detect true associa-tions. Our sample was restricted to individuals of Europeanancestry, and thus our findings cannot yet be generalized toindividuals of other race or ethnic groups. Furthermore, somePAD susceptibility variants may be race or ethnic specificand only can be uncovered through the study of non-Europeans. For example, African-Americans have a higherprevalence of PAD that cannot be attributed to traditional ornovel risk factors. 55This observation raises the hypothesis that polymorphisms unique to African-Americans partiallymay be responsible for the higher prevalence of PAD. 55We did not evaluate gene by environment interactions, whichmay be especially relevant for cigarette smoking, a strong riskfactor for PAD, 56and a factor known to interact with other genes to modulate atherosclerosis.57 Conclusions In conclusion, a common variant near the CDKN2B gene in the chromosome 9p21 locus is associated with a lower ABI. PAD represents a diffuse form of atherosclerosis associatedwith increased risk for death and incident CVD events. Thus,the identification of genetic variants associated with ABI mayprovide an important opportunity not only to unravel thebiological basis of PAD, but also to improve our understand-ing of the causes of the variation in degree of atherosclerosisfrom 1 arterial bed to another. Additional studies are war-ranted to identify the causal variants in the 9p21 locus and tocharacterize their functional significance. The search forgenes influencing predilection to PAD remains elusive, andalternative approaches are warranted.

Interactions of functional with smoking on aortic atherosclerosis.Circ Cardiovasc Genet. 2008;1:107-116. CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE Little is known about the genetic susceptibility to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study findings for the ankle-brachial index (ABI), a noninvasive measure of PAD, within aninternational consortium of 21 population-based cohort studies that included over 40 000 participants of European descent,and conducted replication analyses in over 16 000 individuals from population-based cohorts and clinically-based studiesof PAD. We identified and replicated 1 genome-wide significant association between a genetic variant in the chromosome9p21 region and a lower ABI. Common genetic variants in the 9p21 locus are associated strongly with coronary arterydisease and confer risk for other atherosclerotic diseases. Therefore, the primary effect of the 9p21 region may be on theatherosclerotic process itself, and there are likely many other factors, both genetic and environmental, that determinewhether it manifests as coronary disease, PAD, or another clinical atherosclerotic phenotype. The primary biologicalmechanism underlying the association with ABI is unknown but appears independent of 2 major PAD risk factors, diabetesand smoking, as the ABI single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the 9p21 region we identified is not in linkagedisequilibrium with the SNPs in the region associated with diabetes or smoking-related behaviors. PAD represents a diffuseform of atherosclerosis associated with increased risk for death and incident CVD events. Identification of genetic variantsassociated with ABI may provide an opportunity to unravel the biological basis of PAD.112 Circ Cardiovasc Genet February 2012 at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 1 Supplemental Material Association between chromosome 9p21 variants and the Ankle -brachial Index identified by a meta -analysis of 21 genome -wide association studies Joanne M.

Study Specific Phenotype and Genotype Information 1.1 D iscovery cohorts : non -isolated populations 1.1.1 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) The ARIC study is a predominantly bi -racial prospective study of the etiology and natural history of subclinical and clinical atherosclerosis among 15,792 middle -aged men and women, aged 45 to 64 years old at recruitment in 1987 to 1989 (1). Study participants were selected as a probability sample from four US communities: Forsyth C o, NC; Jackson, MS; seven northwestern suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington C o, MD. African -Americans were over- sampled in Forsyth CO and were exclusively sampled in Jackson. Participants were examined at baseline with collection of medical, social, and demographic data and at three triennial follow -up exams, the last of which occurred in 1999. Annual follow -up continues to ascertain vital status as well as CHD and stroke, including hospitalizations and deaths. GWAS data are available from 8 ,861 self -identified white ARIC participants. 1.1.2 Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) The CHS is a population -based cohort study of risk factors for CHD and stroke in adults age 65 years and older conducted across four field centers in the United States (2). The original predominantly Caucasian cohort of 5201 persons was recruited in 1989 -1990 from a random sample of people on Medicare eligibility lists and an additional 687 African -Americans were enrolled subsequently for a total sample of 5 ,888. DNA was extracted from blood samples drawn on all participants at their baseline examination in 1989 to 1990. Ge notyping was performed from 2007 to 2008 at the General Clinical Research Center's Phenotyping/Genotyping Laboratory at Cedars - Sinai on the 3 ,980 CHS participants who had consented to genetic testing and were free of CVD at baseline. A total of 1 ,908 pers ons were excluded for lack of available DNA or prevalent coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, valvular heart disease, stroke, or transient ischemic attack. Because the other cohorts were predominantly white, the Af rican -American participants were excluded from this analysis to limit the potential for false positive associations due to population stratification, leaving 3397 Caucasians successfully genotyped, 3291 had measures of ABI. 1.1.3 Family Heart Study (FamHS ) The Family Heart Study (https://dsgweb.wustl.edu/PROJECTS/MP1.html) was begun in 1992 with the ascertainment of 1,200 families, half randomly sampled, and half selected because of an excess of coronary heart disease (CHD) or risk factor abnormalities as compared with age - and sex -specific population rates (3). The families, with approximately 6,000 individuals, were sampled on the basis of information on probands from four population -based parent studies: the Framingham Heart Study, th e Utah Family Tree Study, and two ARIC centers (Minneapolis, and Forsyth County, NC). A broad range of phenotypes were assessed at a clinic examination (exam 1) in broad domains of CHD, atherosclerosis, cardiac and vascular function, inflammation and hemostasis, lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure, diabetes and insulin resistance, pulmonary function, and anthropometry. Approximately 8 years later, study participants belonging to the largest pedigrees were invited for a second clinical exam. A total of 2,767 Caucasian subjects in 510 extended families were examined. This sample is the focus of the genome- wide association study (GWAS). at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 3 A two -stage design was adopted for the GWAS. In the first stage, 1016 subjects were chosen, equally distributed betwe en the upper and lower quartile of age - and sex -adjusted values for coronary artery calcification, assessed by CT scan. These subjects were chosen to be largely unrelated; 34% of the subjects were from unique families, while 200 other subjects had 1 or more siblings selected into the sample, yielding a sample of 465 unrelated subjects. The remaining family members ( n=1,753) will be genotyped in the second stage for replication of the top hits from the first stage. 1.1.4 Framingham Heart Study (FHS) The F HS is a National Heart Lung and Blood Institute contract -funded observational cohort study initiated in 1948 to examine the determinants of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors (http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/ ). The Original Cohort comprised 5 ,209 men and women, aged 28 - 62 years at enrollment who have undergone routine biennial examinations (4,5). In 1971, 5, 124 Offspring of the Original Cohort participants and Offspring spouses, aged 5 to 70 years, w ere enrolled into the Framingham Offspring Study and have been examined approximately every 4 years (6,7). In the 1990s, DNA was obtained for genetic studies from surviving Original cohort and Offspring particip ants. Routine examinations for all FHS cohorts included a standardized physician administered medical history interview and physical examination, direct measurement of cardiovascular risk factors, laboratory assessment, and various questionnaires and nonin vasive cardiovascular tests specific to the given examination cycle. Cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a panel of senior investigators using previously reported criteria. FHS examinations were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Bosto n University Medical Center and all participants provided written informed consent. 1.1.5 Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy Study (GENOA) The Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP), established by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in 1996, joined existing research networks that were investigating hypertension and cardiovascular diseases ( http://public.nhlbi.nih.gov/GeneticsGenomics/home/fbpp.aspx ). One of the four FBPP networks is the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA), which recruited hypertensive, Caucasian sibships for linkage and association studies to investigate genetic contributions to hypertension and hypertension - related target organ damage. Sibships containing at least two individuals with clinically -diagnosed essential hypertension before age 60 years were recruited from Rochester, Minnesota. After identifying each hypertensive sibship, all members of the sibship were invited to partic ipate regardless of their hypertension status. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and approval was granted by participating institutional review boards. Participants were diagnosed with hypertension if they had either 1) a previous clinical diagnosis of hypertension by a physician with current anti -hypertensive treatment, or 2) an average systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90 on the second and third clinic visit as stipulated by the Joint National Committee -7 guidelines (8). Exclusion criteria were secondary hypertension, alcoholism or drug abuse, pregnancy, insulin -dependent diabetes mellitus, or active malignancy. 1.1.6 Gutenberg Heart Study (GHS) The Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) is designed as a population -based, prospective, observational single - center cohort study in the Rhein -Main -Region in western Mid- Germany to evaluate and improve cardiovascular risk stratification. It also investigates cancer, eye diseas es, diseases of the immune system at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 4 and the metabolism. The sample was drawn randomly from the governmental local registry offices in the city of Mainz and the district of Mainz- Bingen. The sample was stratified 1:1 for gender and for urban and rural residence with equal strata for decades of age. Individuals between 35 and 74 years of age were enrolled, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Exclusion criteria were insufficient knowledge of the German language, and physical or psychological inability to participate in the examinations at the study center. All participants underwent a five hour examination including a biobanking in the study center. Follow -up examinations are carried out after 2.5 and 5 years. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee and the local data safety commissioner and the sampling design by the federal data safety commissioners. All subjects gave written informed consent. 1.1.7 Health, Aging, and Body Composition(Health ABC) Study The Heal th Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study is a NIA -sponsored ongoing cohort study of the factors that contribute to incident disability and the decline in function of healthier older persons, with a particular emphasis on changes in body composition in old age. Health ABC enrolled well- functioning, community -dwelling black (n=1281) and white (n=1794) men and women aged 70 -79 years between April 1997 and June 1998. Participants were recruited from a random sample of white and all black Medicare eligible residents in the Pittsburgh, PA, and Memphis, TN, metropolitan areas. The key components of Health ABC include a baseline exam, annual follow -up clinical exams, and phone contacts every 6 months to identify major health events and document functional status between clinic visits. GWAS data are available from 1663 white participants. 1.1.8 Invecchiare in Chianti (InCHIANTI) Study The InCHIANTI study is a population based longitudinal study designed to investigate the causes of decline in mobility in o lder subjects (9). The study sample comprises 1,453 individuals of white European descent and is representative of the older population aged 65 years and older supplemented with at least 30 men and 30 women for each 10 year age group from 20 to 70 years from two small towns from the Chianti region in Tuscany, Italy. Interviews were conducted at the participants' homes by three experienced interviewers. Within three weeks, participants attended a study clinic for blood drawing tests, having fasted for at least 8 and just concluded the 24 -hour urine collection. On the same day, the participants received a series of medical examinations, including an assessment of the ankle -brachial index. On the second appointment a clinical evaluation and a comprehensive motor and cognitive performances session were performed by an experienced geriatrician and a trained physical therapist, respectively. INRCA Ethical Committee approved the entire study protocol. 1.1.9 and 1.1.10 C ooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg, Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung in der region Augsburg (KORA Gesundheitsforschung in der R egion Augsburg (10)) are population - based samples drawn from the general population of the South -German city of Augsburg and surrounding counties stratified by age (25 to 74 years) and sex. The follow- ups of these surveys were conducted in 2004/05 (KORA F3) and 2006 -2008 (KORA F4). All participants had a German passport, were of European origin and underwent a standardized face -to-face interview by certified medical staff and a standardized medical examination. Genome -wide data are available for a subset of 1 ,644 subjects randomly chosen from at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 5 KORA F3 and for 1814 subjects from KORA F4. n=1 ,407 Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) (11), is a multi-c entre study designed to examine the long- term course and consequences of depressive and anxiety disorders (http://www.nesda.nl). NESDA included both individuals with depressive and/or anxiety disorders and controls without psychiatric conditions. Inclusion criteria were age 18 -65 years and self- reported western European ancestry, exclusion criteria were not being fluent in Dutch and having a primary diagnosis of another psychiatric condition (psychotic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, or severe substance use disorder). For all participants DNA was isolated from the baseline blood sample. Through funding from the fNIH GAIN program (www.fnih.gov/gain), whole genome scan analysis was conducted for 1 ,859 NESDA (1 ,702 depressed cases an d 157 controls) participants. A hundred subjects were excluded because of various quality control issues (12). 1.1.12 Nijmegen Biomedical Study (NBS) The Nijmegen Biomedical Study is a population- based cross -sectional study conducted by the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (13). Nijmegen is a town in the eastern part of The Netherlands with 156,000 inhabitants, approximately 87% of Caucasian descent. Age and sex stratified randomly selected adult (age 18 years and older) inhabitants of Nijmegen (N=22,452) received an invitation to fill out a postal questionnaire on lifestyle and medical history. A total of 6,434 participants donated blood for DNA -isolation. GWA-data were available for 1,832 participants (14). We invited participants aged 50 -70 yrs to come to the hospital and performed ABI at rest and after exercise. In total 1517 participants from the Nijmegen Biome dical Study were included (15). For 54 4 participants both ABI and GWA -data were available. Approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Institutional Review B oard. 1.1.13 and 1.1.14 The Rotterdam Study I and II (RS-I and RS-II) The Rotterdam Study is a prospective population -based cohort study to investigate the determinants of chronic diseases among participants aged 55 years and older (16). Briefly, residents of Ommoord, a district of Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, 55 years of age or older, were asked to participate, of whom 7,983 participated (RS- I). The baseline examination was conducted in 1990 -1993 and consist ed of a home interview and research center visit for blood samples. In 1999, inhabitants who turned 55 years of age or moved into the study district since the start of the study were invited of whom 3,011 participated (RS- II). In total, at the time of the current Analyses, ABI data were available for 5,169 participants with GWA study data for RS -I and for 1,642 participants from RS -II. The Medical Ethics Committee of Erasmus MC approved the study, and all participants gave informed consent . 1.1.15 Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) is a population -based survey in West Pomerania, the north -east area of Germany (17,18). A sample from the population aged 20 to 79 years was drawn from population registries. First, the three cities of the region (with 17,076 to 65,977 inhabitants) and the 12 towns (with 1,516 to 3,044 inhabitants) were selected, and then 17 out of 97 smaller towns (with less than 1,500 inhabitants), were drawn a t random. Second, from each of the selected communities, subjects were drawn at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 6 at random, proportional to the population size of each community and stratified by age and gender. Only individuals with German citizenship and main residency in the study area were included. Finally, 7,008 subjects were sampled, with 292 persons of each gender in each of the twelve five- year age strata. In order to minimize drop -outs by migration or death, subjects were selected in two waves. The net sample (without migrated or de ceased persons) comprised 6,267 eligible subjects. Selected persons received a maximum of three written invitations. In case of non -response, letters were followed by a phone call or by home visits if contact by phone was not possible. The SHIP population finally comprised 4,308 participants (corresponding to a final response of 68.7%). Baseline examinations were performed between 1997 and 2001 (SHIP -0). Follow -up examinations were conducted between 2002 and 2006 (SHIP -1) as well as between 2008 and 2012 (S HIP-2). Data for the present analyses were taken from a sample of SHIP -2. 1.2 Discovery cohorts : isolated populations 1.2.1 The Old Order Amish Study (Amish) The Old Order Amish individuals included in this study were participants of several ongoing studies of cardiovascular health carried out at the University of Maryland (19,20). Par ticipants were relatively healthy volunteers from the Old Order Amish community of Lancaster County, PA. and their family memb ers. Examinations were conducted at the Amish Research Clinic in Strasburg, PA. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Maryland and informed consent was obtained, including permission to use their DNA for genetic studies. 1.2.2, 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 CROATIA -Vis, CROATIA- Korcula and CROATIA -Split The CROATIA studies recruited adult individuals within each community irrespective of any specific phenotype. Fasting blood samples were collected, biochemical and physiologic al measurements taken and questionnaire data for medical history as well as lifestyle and environmental exposures were collected following similar protocols. The CROATIA study conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by appropriate ethics boards with all participants signing informed consent prior to participation. The CROATIA -Vis study includes 1008 Croatians, aged 18 -93 years, who were recruited from the villages of Vis and Komiza on the Dalmatian island of Vis during 2003 and 2004 within a larger genetic epidemiology program. The CROATIA -Korcula study includes 969 Croatians between the ages of 18 and 98. The field work was performed in 2007 and 2008 in the eastern part of the island, targeting healthy volunteers from the town of Korula and the villages of Lumbarda, rnovo and Raie. The CROATIA -Split study includes 499 Croatians between the ages of 18 and 85 recruited in 2009 from the city of Split. 1.2.5 Erasmus Rucphen Family Study (ERF) The Erasmus Rucphen Family study (ERF) is a cross -sectional family -based study. The study population essentially consists of one extended family of descendents from 20 related couples who lived between 1850 and 1900 and had at least 6 children baptized in the community church. The detailed information about ERF can be found elsewhere (21). The Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam approved the study and informed consent was obtained from all participants. at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 7 1.2.6 Orkney Complex Disease Study (ORCADES) The Orkney Complex Disease Stu dy (ORCADES) is an ongoing family -based, cross -sectional study in the isolated Scottish archipelago of Orkney. Genetic diversity in this population is decreased compared to Mainland Scotland, consistent with the high levels of endogamy historically. Data for participants aged 18 - 91 years, from a subgroup of ten islands, were used for this analysis. Fasting blood samples were collected and over 300 health -related phenotypes and environmental exposures were measured in each individual. All participants gave informed consent and the study was approved by Research Ethics Committees in Orkney and Aberdeen. 1.3 Replication studies 1.3.1 Bruneck Study The Bruneck Study is a prospective, population -based survey on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (22-26). In 1990, 1000 individuals aged 40- 79 years were randomly chosen from the inhabitants of the town of Bruneck (South Tyrol, Italy) on the basis of an age- and sex -stratified strategy (125 persons per sex and decade). The population of Bruneck is exclusively Caucasian and of heterogeneous geographic origin with sizeable segments of Austro -German or Italian background. Population mobility within the survey area was low at 0.2% per year. Follow -up examinations were performed in 1995, 2000 and 2005 with participation rates exceeding 90%. Analyses for the current investigation focused on the 1995 evaluation. The study protocol was approved by the pertinent ethics committee, and all participants gave their written informed consent. 1.3.2 Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS) CCHS is a prospective cardiovascular study of the Danish general population initiated in 1976 -1978 with follow -up examinations in 1981 -1983, 1991-1 994 and 2001- 03 (27-29). Individuals were selected based on the Central Population Register Code to reflect the adult Danish general population aged 20 -80+ years. Blood samples for DNA extraction are available for 10,594 participants. For 5,467 participants of this study ABI measurements are available from the 2001 -03 examination . 1.3.3 Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) MESA is an NHLBI -sponsored population -based, prospective, multi -center cohort stu dy including participants recruited from six field sites in the United States - Forsyth County, NC (Wake Forest University), Northern Manhattan/Bronx, NY (Columbia University), Baltimore/Baltimore County, MD (Johns Hopkins University), St. Paul, MN (University of Minnesota, Twin Cities), Chicago, IL (Northwestern University), and Los Angeles County, CA (UCLA). Details of recruitment and study design have been previously published elsewhere (30). Briefly, the ME SA cohort comprises 6,814 men and women of diverse ethnic background who were 45 to 84 years old at the baseline exam and free of clinically overt cardiovascular disease (CVD) who were recruited to elucidate the determinants and natural history of subclinical CVD, and study progression of subclinical CVD. The cohort is 53% women with an ethnic composition of approximately 40% White, 30% African American, 20% Hispanic and 10% Asian primarily of Chinese descent. The MESA was approved by the Institutional Revi ew Board of all participating field sites and reading centers and participants gave informed consent for participation and use of DNA specimens. Genotyping took place at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 8 using the Affymetrix 6.0 array. There were n=2611 participants of European descent who co nsented the use of DNA for research studies and had imputed GWAS data for the contributed SNPs as well as ABI measurements . 1.3.4 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) are conducted by the National Center on Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). NHANES is a collection of diverse, population -based cross -sectional surveys of non -institutionalized Americans regardless of health status at the time of ascertainment ( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm ). NHANES is considered a complex survey given that specific age groups (such as the elderly) and racial/ethnic groups (non -Hispanic blacks and Mexican -Americans) are oversampled. The NHANES data accessed for this work includes NHANES 1999 -2000 and NHANES 2000- 2001. Collectively, these surveys contain 7,839 DNA samples linked to demographic, health, and lifestyle data. Participants were consented by the CDC at the time of the survey and sample collection, and consent included the storage of data and biological specimens such as blood for future research (31,32). The present study was approved b y the CDC Ethics Review Board. Because the study investigators did not have access to personal identifiers, this study was considered non -human subjects research by the Vanderbilt University Internal Review Board. Race/ethnicity is self-described and wa s categorized as non -Hispanic white, non -Hispanic black, Mexican - American, and others. Only data for non -Hispanic whites were included here for replication efforts. The ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI), also referred to as the ankle arm blood pressure index (AAI), is a noninvasive technique to measure peripheral vascular disease in population -based and clinical studies. ABPI was defined as the ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle compared with that in the arm. ABPI measurement was perfor med by a health technician on all adults 40 years of age at interview. Exclusions for these procedures were bilateral amputation, casts, ulcers, dressings, or other conditions which make blood pressure readings at these sites impossible. The presence of these conditions on one limb did not exclude the study participant, but they were excluded if they occu rred bilaterally. Systolic pressure was measured in one arm (brachial vessel, right arm if accessible) and both ankles. ABI was defined as the ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle compared with that in the arm. The lower ABI of the two legs was used in the analysis. ABI > 1.4 and equal to 0 were excluded from the analysis. Serum HDL -C, triglycerides, and total cholesterol were measured using standard enzymatic methods. LDL -C was calculated using the Friedewald equation, with missing values assigned for samples with triglyceride levels greater than 400 mg/dl. Fasting status was recorded at time of blood draw. Body mass index was calculated from height and weight measured in the Mobile Examination Center by CDC medical personnel. Current smoking was defined by \"do you smoke cigarettes now?\" or cotinine levels > 15ng/ml. Former smoking was defined among non -current smokers by the answer \"yes\" to the question \"Smoked at least 100 cigarettes in life\". Participants were considered to have type 2 diabetes if they answered \"yes\" to \"Ever been told you have sugar/diabetes?\" or if they had fasting blood glucose levels >126 mg/dL. Hypertension was defined if average systolic blood pressure was 140 or average diastolic blood pressure was 90 or if the study participant reported taking medication for high blood pressure. Prevalent cardiovascular disease was defined by \"Ever told you had heart attack\". Lipid lowering medication use was defined by \"now taking prescribed medicine\" to lower cholesterol. at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 9 Genotyping was performed for nine SNPs in all of NHANES 1999 -2002 (n=7,839) using Sequenom in the Vanderbilt DNA NHANES samples, we genotyped blind duplicates provided by CDC. All SNPs reported here save for rs16824978 passed CDC quality control metrics and are available for secondary analyses through NCHS/CDC. Tests of association were performed unweighted using linear regression, unadjusted and adjusted for covariates as specified in the analysis plan. All statistical analyses were conducted remotely in SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) using the Analytic Data Research by Email (ANDRE) portal of the CDC Research Data Center in Hyattsville, MD. 1.3.5 PREVEND The Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd stage Disease study is an ongoing prospective study investigating the nat ural course of increased levels of urinary albumin excretion and its relation to renal and cardiovascular disease. Inhabitants 28 to 75 years of age (N=85,421) in the city of Groningen, The Netherlands, were asked to complete a short questionnaire, 47% res ponded, and individuals were then selected with a urinary albumin concentration of at least 10 mg/L (N= 7,768) and a randomly selected control group with a urinary albumin concentration less than 10 mg/L (N=3,395). Details of the protocol have been describ ed elsewhere ( www.prevend.org). Genotyping was performed in a subset of subjects. All subjects provided written informed consent. 1.3.6 Cardiovascular Disease in Intermittent Claudication (CAVASIC) Study The CAVASIC Study ( CArdioVAScular disease in I ntermittent Claudication) is a prospective case -control study which was initiated in 2002 to identify cardiovascular risk factors in patients with intermittent claudication (33). Patient s and controls were enrolled in two clinical centers, the Department of Vascular Surgery, Medical University Innsbruck and the 3rd Medical Department of Metabolic Diseases and Nephrology, Hietzing Hospita l, Vienna, Austria. Patients were consecutively included in the study when they presented with or had a history of intermittent claudication (PAD IIa or IIb according to the criteria of Fontaine), regardless of whether they had already undergone a treatmen t procedure (bypass surgery or intervention). Patients were excluded from the study for any of the following: presence of acute or critical limb ischemia (Fontaine III or IV); impaired liver function with elevated enzymes (AST>50U/L, ALT >25U/L, Gamma GT > 60U/L) ; with serum creatinine >1 .5 mg/ dL; malignancy ; past organ transplantation ; therapy with nicotinic acid or corticosteroids. Furthermore controls were recruited from the same geographical region matched for age and presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). All members of the control group volunteered to participate in the study following a public invitation in newspapers. We applied the same exclusion criteria to the control group as used for patients. Controls with symptomatic PAD were excluded, but those with a history of cardiovascular disease were allowed to participate. Neither the patients nor the controls suffered from acute illnesses or clinically detectable inflammatory processes at the time of enrollment. All subje cts provided written informed consent and the examination protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the participating study centers. To minimize interobserver bias all interviews and examinations were performed by one physician at each of the two clinical centers who was specially trained in vascular examinations and echocardiography. at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 10 1.3.7 GENEPAD The GENEPAD study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Stanford University and Mount Sinai; and registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 00380185). Participants were recruited from patients undergoing elective, non -emergent coronary angiogram for angina, shortness of breath, abnormal stress test, or known CAD at Stanford University and Mount Sinai Medical Centers between April 2004 and February 2008, for whom the PAD status was not known to the investigators at the time of informed consent and recruitment into the study. This cross -sectional design allowed for two sharply defined phenotypes to emerge (i .e., patients with hemodynamically significant CAD alone, versus those with hemodynamically significant CAD and PAD). Cases were defined as patients with CAD and PAD while controls were defined as subjects with CAD alone. Furthermore, with this study design, confounding clinical covariates ( e.g., traditional cardiovascular risk factors) would contribute minimally to the difference between the two phenotypes. This design would maximize our chances for discovery of novel factors that affect the distribution of atherosclerotic plaque. All part icipants provided written informed consent. Patients admitted for emergent catheterizations, or screening catheterizations prior to organ transplants were excluded. Additional exclusions included being younger than 40 years of age and having a history of radiation treatment, known chronic infectious diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B or C, or a language barrier. 1.3.8 Linz Peripheral Arterial Disease (LIPAD) Study The LIPAD S tudy was performed from April 2000 to April 2002 at the St. John of God Hospital, D epartment of Surgery, Linz, Austria. Of the patients admitted for inpatient evaluation of suspected or definite PAD during the given time interval, all patients with chronic atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities associated with typical symptoms were included into this study on the basis of the final clinical diagnosis established by the attending vascular surgeons. The diagnosis was verified by interview, physical examination, noninvasive techniques, and angiography, as detailed below. All cases with acute ischemia were excluded. Further exclusion criteria were PAD caused by nonatherosclerotic causes (cardioembolic disease, thromboangiitis obliterans, vasculitis, or congenital or metabolic vascular disease) and the history or presence of any malignancy. Doppler segmental blood pressure of the lower limbs, including continuous - wave spectral analysis and resting ankle -brachial index (ABI) measurements were performed i n all patients with symptomatic PAD and control subjects as previously des cribed (34). In addition to these measurements, intra- arterial aortofemoral angiography was performed in all patients to confirm the presence of PAD and to determine the location and extent of wall changes. Control subjects were matched to the patients with PAD in a 1:1 design by sex, age (\u00b12 years), and diabetes mellitus status. All control subjects were patients in our hospital and fulfilled the following criteria: no clinical indication of PAD by history and physical examination; ABI 1.0; no pathologic pattern of pulse waves in lower limbs by continuous -wave spectral analysis; no CAD; no CVD; no previous vascular or stenting of the internal carotid arteries; no stenosis of the internal carotid artery greater than 50% by color duplex ultrasound scans; no history of venous thromboembolism; and no history or presence of any malignancy. All control subjects were generally in good health and were admitted for treatment of minor health problems, such as cataract surgery, vertebragenic pain, or nonvascular surgery. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all study participants gave informed consent. at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 11 2.

Finally, in order to refine the functions of genes without clearly associated functions in the public databases pathway, we evaluated the pathway assignments in NCBI Entre z Gene were and used Genomatix Bibliosphere Software (Genomatix GmbH, Munich, Germany) to perform an automated literature and pathway analysis. The generated gene networks were then inspected for relevant tissue types and disease associations using build -in filter functions. However, this approach was inconclusive, probably due to the little data available in PubMed, and was thus not further pursued. 3. Statistical methods used for the candidate gene look -up In the following, the statistical methods used for the look -up of PAD/ABI and CAD candidate genes will be explained in detail, exemplified on the CYBA gene region: 1. All SNPs were identified, which lie in the chromosomal region defined by each of the candidate genes \u00b1100 kb upstream or downstream of the gene. In the case of CYBA , 138 SNPs lie within this defined region. 2. We then identified the most strongly associated SNP in each gene region using the discovery meta - analysis results for ABI (excluding isolates) : for CYBA this was rs3794624 with a p -value of 6.30E -05. 3. Since the lowest p -value within each gene region was selected adjusting for multiple testing within each gene region is necessary. Neighboring and densely spaced SNPs are likely to be in high LD. Furthermore, the SNPs are given as genotype s cores (allelic dosages between 0 und 2) derived from an imputation algorithm using HapMap. In this situation with high correlation between SNPs, simple Bonferroni correction with the number of SNPs would be too conservative. Therefore, the effective number of loci was calculated for each gene region using an algorithm by Gao et al (38). This method reduces the dimension of the parameter space. In the case of CYBA , the 138 SNPs could be explained sufficiently by a linear combination of 58 independent variables. Now, this so called effective number of loci can be used as the denominator in the Bonferroni correctio n formula. This leads to a corrected p- value of 6.30E -05 / 58 = 3.60E -03 for the CYBA gene region. 4. So far, we have applied the Bonferroni correction within each gene region separately resulting in gene - region -wide corrected p -values. Since we have looked a t 55 independent gene regions, further correction, however, is needed. The False Discovery Rate (FDR (39)) was calculated on the 55 corrected p - values. This approach account s for the multiple comparisons problem. Traditional methods like Bonferroni control the Family -wise error rate, the probability for at least on false positive among all tests. The False discovery rate on the contrary is the expected proportion of false positives amongst all rejected null hypothesis. It has a greater power than the methods controlling the Family -wise error rate at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 12 with the higher risk of false positives, however. In our analysis we have set the FDR threshold to 0.1, meaning that we are tolerating 10% of false positives out of the resulting list of significant findings. Since we are only including former PAD/ABI candidate gene regions, we are convinced that the prior knowledge outweighs the higher risk of false positives. For CYBA , a FDR of 0.0665 has been calculated. 5. For the CAD candidate genes, we have been looking at the specific reported SNPs rather than complete gene regions. In conclusion, we are sparing us the step of accounting for the numb er of SNPs within each gene region. Therefore, we are calculating the FDR directly on the p -valued derived from the discovery meta -analysis results for ABI. at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 13 Supplementary Table 1.

The peripheral systolic blood pressure was measured at the posterior tibial artery at both ankles with a hand- held 8 -MHz Doppler probe (handydop, Elcat) and a conventional aneroid sphygmomanometer. To calculate the ABI, the mean systolic blood pressure of the posterior tibial artery at both ankles was divided by the systolic blood pressure of the left arm. Health ABC (1997 -1998) Arterial systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by a hand- held, 8 -MHz Doppler probe (Huntleigh Technology, Inc., Manalapan, NJ, USA) placed directly ove r the artery and a conventional mercury sphygmomanometer.

Mean systolic blood pressure of that ankle side which was lowest / mean of the two brachial systolic blood pressures of the right arm NESDA (2004 -2007) Both ankle and arm syst olic blood pressure was measured by an ultrasound Doppler device at 8 -MHz (UltraTech PD1v, Ultrasound Technologies Ltd, Itton, Chepstow, UK) in combination with an ordinary blood pressure cuff, as previously described. Blood pressure was assessed with the respondent in supine position. Ankle -brachial index was calculated as the mean of two consecutive systolic right posterior tibial artery blood pressures divided by the mean of two consecutive systolic right humeral artery blood pressures. NBS (2005 -2008) To measure ABI appropriately sized cuffs were placed around both arms above the elbow and around both legs just above the ankle. Resting blood pressures were measured at the left and right brachial artery, the left and right posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis arteries using -held Doppler probe (IMEXDOPCT; Biomedic, Almere, The Netherlands). The highest of the two arm pressures was used to calculate ABI at rest for the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. The lowest of the four ABI 's was used in the analysis. RS-I (1990 -1993) RS-II (1999 -2001) Two seated blood pressures measured in right arm and a single systolic blood pressure obtained in each leg in supine position (posterior tibial) using Doppler device (Huntleigh Technology) (102) and random -zero manometer.

Measurements were taken in the supine position after at least 15 minutes rest. The ABI for each leg was calculated separ ately by dividing the ankle pressure in that leg by the mean brachial pressure of the two arms or the highest of the 2 arms if the difference between the two arms was >=10 mmHg . Then the mean ABI for both legs was used for a nalysis. Croatia- Vis (2003 -2004) Croatia- Korcula (2007) Croatia- Split (2009 -2010) Participant asked to remove all tight clothing from arms and legs and lie flat for approx 5 min. Brachial measure: sphymomanometer cuff placed around the right arm just above the elbow. Doppler probe placed over the brachial pulse. Cuff inflated until the Doppler sound disappears then cuff slowly deflated until the sound returns. Repeated on left arm. Ankle measure: Cuff placed around left leg just above the malleolus and Doppler used to locate the dorsalis pedis pulse.

Cuff inflated a further 10-20 mm Hg after the Doppler sound disappears then cuff slowly deflated until the pulse sound returns - measure recorded. Repeated on left arm. Ankle measure: Cuff placed around left leg just above the malleolus and Doppler used to locate the dorsalis pedis pulse. Cuff inflated a further 10 -20 mm Hg after the Doppler sound disappears then cuff slowly deflated until the pulse sound returns - measure recorded. Repeated for posterior tibial pulse. Both repeated for right leg. The lowest posterior tibial systolic blood pressure at either ankle was divided by the highest systolic blood pressure in the arm Replication Studies Bruneck Study (1995) The ankle -brachial index (ABI) was measured in a supine position. A cuff was inflated to 10 mmHg above systolic blood pressure and deflated at 2 mmHg/s. The first reappearance of the arterial signal at the ankle (posterior tibial artery) was taken as the systolic blood pressure (detected with a Doppler ultrasonic instrument). To calculate the ABI for the right and left leg, the systolic blood pressure at each ankle was divided by the systolic blood pressure in the arm. The higher arm reading (right or left side) was used for ABI calculation. The lower ABI of the two legs w as considered in the current analysis. Subjects with an ABI > 1.4 were at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 16 excluded. There was no subject with an ABI of zero on both legs. CCHS (2001 -2003) A standard brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressure was recorded on both arms, and systolic ankle blood pressure of the posterior tibial artery on both legs was obtained by Doppler (Huntleigh Mini Dopplex Doppler D900, Huntleigh, United Kingdom). The ABI was the lowest ankle systolic blood pressure divided by the highest brachial systolic blood pres sure. MESA (2000 -2002) Systolic blood with Nicolet Doppler apparatus (EN50 LE 100, Nicolet vascular, Golden, CO) in both arms and both ankles (posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis). Approximately 20 elapsed between each pressure. ABI is the minimum of the right and left ABI. The right ABI is calculated as the (maximum of the right dorsalis pedis and right posterior tibial)/ (mean right and left brachial), and the left ABI is calculated as the (maximum of the left dorsalis pedis and left posterior tibial)/ (mean of the left and right brachial). For right ABI and left ABI, if the two brachial (arm) BPs differ by 10 mmHg or more, use the higher arm pressure as the denominator. NHANES (1999 -2002) The ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI), al so referred to as the ankle arm blood pressure index (AAI), is a noninvasive technique to measure peripheral vascular disease in population- based and clinical studies. ABPI was defined as the ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle compared with that in the arm. ABPI measurement was performed by a health technician on all adults 40 years of age at interview. Exclusions for these procedures were bilateral amputation, casts, ulcers, dressings, or other conditions which make BP readings at these si tes impossible. The presence of these conditions on one limb did not exclude the study participant, but they were excluded if they occurred bilaterally. Systolic pressure was measured in one arm (brachial vessel, right arm if accessible) and both ankles (posterior tibial vessels) for ages 40 and above. ABI was defined as the ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle compared with that in the arm. The lower ABI of the two legs was used in the analysis. ABI > 1.4 and equal to 0 were excluded from the analysis. PREVEND (1997 -1998) At the first visit, while the participant was in a supine position, systolic blood pressure was measured each minute with an automatic Dynamap XL Model 9300 series device at the right brachial artery (ten times total). Withi n the first 5 min, systolic ankle pressure at each leg was measured at the same time a brachial pressure was performed. For ankle pressure measurements, the posterior tibial artery was measured using an 8 -MHz continuous -wave Doppler probe (Huntleigh Model D900, Huntleigh Diagnostics) and a random -zero sphygmomanometer. The ABI was calculated as the ratio of the systolic blood pressure of the ankle and arm for each leg. The lowest ankle-brachial index in eith er leg was used in the analysis. CAVASIC (2002) For the ABI measurement, the systolic blood pressure was measured in both arms and then two additional measures were obtained on the arm with the higher systolic blood pressu re. The systolic blood pressure was obtained three times for both the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery in each leg. (33) The mean of the second and third systolic blood pressure measurement at each site was used to calculate the ABI for each of the 4 lower extremity sites. The ABI was calculated as the ratio of the mean systolic blood pressure at each of four sites to the mean systolic blood pressure in the arm. at Boston University on March 6, 2012 circgenetics.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 17 The lowest ABI from the four sites was used in analysis. GenePAD (2004 -2008) The ABI (i.e. the ratio of ankle and arm systolic blood pressure) was measured using previously established methods.(103,104) In brief, prior to undergoing coronary angiogram, each participant rested in the supine position for 5 minutes, then, using a 5 - MHz Doppler ultrasound Vascular, posterior tibial, dorsalis pedis, and brachial arteries. Each pres sure was measured twice in sequential and reverse order as listed. With an IV in one arm, only the contralateral arm was used for the brachial pressures. (105) The ABI for each leg was calculated separately by dividing the higher of the two ankle pressures in that leg by the brachial pressure. If the ABI was less than 0.9 in either leg, the patient was considered to have PAD. The index leg was defined as the leg with the lower ABI. LIPAD (2002) ABI measurements in the LIPAD study were done according to (34): with the patient placed in a supine position, the brachial and ankle systolic pressure measurements are obtained.

Longitudinal cohort studies demonstrate that lower levels of cardiovascular risk factors measured in midlife or early older years predict survival and healthy survival to 85 years of age ( 1,2) and beyond ( 3,4). Longevity has been observed to cluster within families so that parents and siblings of centenarians have a greater like - lihood of attaining advanced age ( 5-7), and offspring of centenarians appear to have a delay in age-related disease (8,9). Studies of families clustered for longevity both in the United States and Europe (Long Life Family Study and Leiden Longevity Study) have demonstrated that offspring of long-lived participants has more favorable midlife risk factor profiles and less age-related disease ( 10,11). Simi- larly in the community-based Framingham Heart Study, adults with at least one parent surviving to old age have lower risk factor levels compared with individuals whose parents died younger and the risk factor advantage per - sists over time ( 12). The genetic contribution to longev - ity and human aging is likely to result from many genes each with modest effects. Some genes will likely affect longevity by increasing susceptibility to age-related disease and early death, whereas other genes are likely to slow the aging process itself leading to a long life. How genetic factors and their interaction with modifiable behavioral and environmental factors contribute to longevity remains unknown.Translational Article Special Issue on Genetics and Aging The Search for Longevity and Healthy Aging Genes: Insights From Epidemiological Studies and Samples of Long-Lived Individuals Joanne M.

Email: murabito@bu.edu Genetic factors clearly contribute to exceptional longevity and healthy aging in humans, yet the identification of the un - derlying genes remains a challenge. Longevity is a complex phenotype with modest heritability. Age-related phenotypes with higher heritability may have greater success in gene discovery. Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for longevity have had only limited success to date. The Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium conducted a meta-analysis of GWAS data for longevity, defined as survival to age 90 years or older, that identified several interesting associations but none achieved genome-wide significance. A recent GWAS of longevity conducted in the Leiden Longevity Study identified the ApoE E4 isoform as deleterious to longevity that was confirmed in an independent GWAS of long-lived individuals of German descent. Notably, no other genetic loci for lon - gevity have been identified in these GWAS. To examine the conserved genetic mechanisms between the mouse and hu - mans for life span, we mapped the top Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology GWAS associations for longevity to the mouse chromosomal map and noted that eight of the ten top human associations were located within a previously reported mouse life-span quantitative trait loci. This work suggests that the mouse and human may share mechanisms leading to aging and that the mouse model may help speed the understanding of how genes identified in humans affect the biology of aging. We expect these ongoing collaborations and the translational work with basic scientists to accelerate the identification of genes that delay aging and promote a healthy life span.

Because life expectancy has improved dramatically across birth cohorts since 1900, care must be taken when study designs compare long-lived with younger cohorts. Women live longer than men and make up a larger proportion of the older popula - tion especially at exceptional old ages. For example, among the original 5,209 Framingham Heart Study participants with follow-up through 2011, there are 43 centenarian women and only six centenarian men, whereas at study entry (1948-1953), 55% of participants were women. Men are more likely to attain extreme old age escaping common age-related disease, whereas women are more likely to attain 100 after surviving common morbidities ( 13). While these observations raise the hypothesis that genetic and environmental factors influence the path to longevity differently in men and women, whether genetic fac - tors play a greater or lesser role in men than in women is an area of debate ( 3,14). In a study of centenarians (100-104 years), semisupercentenarians (105-109 years), and supercentenaians (110-119 years), there was a progressive delay in the onset of age-related disease and onset of physical and cognitive function impairment with increasing age ( 15). Whether genes that influ - ence survival to these extreme ages also play a role in survival to age older than 90 years is unknown. The genetic contribution to longevity (age at death) has been estimated using both large twin registries and population- based samples (Table 1). Most heritability estimates from twin registries range between 20% and 30% ( 16,17), whereas estimates from population-based samples ranging from 15% to 25% ( 18,19), suggest- ing a significant but modest genetic contribution to the human life span. One study conducted among an ethnically diverse group suggests that genetic influences on life span may vary by ethnicity with heritabilities ranging from a low of 4% for African Americans to 29% and 26% for Caribbean Hispanics and Caucasians, respectively ( 21). Using data from the GenomeEUtwin project that included more than 20,000 Nordic twins, Hjelmborg and coworkers ( 42) noted that genetic effects on life span were minimal prior to 60 years of age, but genetic effects on life spans greater than 60 years of age were significant and constant to increasing with advancing age. Starting at about age 60 years, the relative recurrence risk of an individual living past a speci - fied age given that his/her cotwin also lived past that age increased with increasing age cut point in both men and women so that at age 92, the recurrence risk was 4.8 and 1.8 in monozygotic and dizygotic male twins and 2.5 and 1.6 in monozygotic and dizygotic female twins. Notably, recur - rence risks similar to men occurred in women at a 5- to 10-year older age perhaps reflecting the longer average longevity in women. Using the Framingham Heart Study cohorts, we explored whether genetic influences on life span increase with achievement of older ages by examining age Table 1.

In contrast to the modest heritability estimate for continuous age at death (16%), heritability of surviving past 65 years and surviving past 85 years was substantial at 36% ( p = 4.2 \u00d7 10 10) and 40% (p = 9.0 \u00d7 1010), respectively. Thus, genetic effects appear to be greater for survival to more advanced ages. In the Framingham Heart Study cohorts, heritability appears to increase with each 10-year increment in survived age (65 years, 75 years, and 85 years) for men, but not women, again suggesting that genetic effects on aging may be more substantial for men than women (20). at Boston University Libraries on July 11, 2012 http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from MURABITO ET AL. 472 The longevity phenotype measures overall life span without consideration of health and physical or cognitive function and hence is a very heterogeneous phenotype that may be affected by many environmental and other nongenetic factors. The rela - tive contribution of additive genetic effects may be greater for more homogeneous phenotypes that describe specific aspects of aging and in turn may result in greater success in gene dis - covery. The heritability of reproductive aging phenotypes is at least 50%, and heritability is even higher for age-related diseases such as osteoporosis (low bone mineral density) and Alzheimer's disease ( Table 1 ). Genetic association studies have been successful in identifying genetic variants for these aging phenotypes and have the potential to uncover new biologic in - sights into the associated underlying aging processes ( 43-49). Epidemiological studies that have followed participants over adulthood and collected a wealth of information in a standardized fashion have been important sources for devel - opment of aging-related phenotypes. Alternative aging phe-notypes include disease-free survival, preservation of high levels of function including maintenance of cognitive func - tion (50) and avoidance of bone loss ( 51), and successful aging (reaching advanced age with intact cognitive ability, physical function, and social engagement) ( 52). An index of physiologic age developed in the Cardiovascular Health Study by combining data across multiple systems was found to be a better predictor of death and disability than age itself ( 53). A frailty phenotype defined by five criteria, including uninten - tional weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, low physical activity, and slow walking speed ( 54), is distinct from physical disability and itself is predictive of mortality and other adverse outcomes. Although the frailty phenotype was developed in the Cardio - vascular Health Study sample, it was found to be applicable across diverse studies ( 55). Many components of the multidi - mensional aging phenotypes developed in longitudinal studies are heritable, such as weakness (defined using handgrip strength) and lower extremity function, suggesting the poten - tial for a genetic contribution to the overall phenotype ( 26,31). In the family-based Framingham Heart Study, we esti- mated the heritability of several of the age-related pheno - types including longevity, morbidity-free survival, physical function, and frailty as well as walking speed and handgrip strength ( Table 1 ). For quantitative traits, we used the variance components model, and for dichotomous traits, we used the liability model implemented in the software Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines ( 56). For both, we defined heritability as the proportion of phenotypic variance due to additive genetic effects only. The herita - bility of the physical function and frailty phenotypes in the Framingham sample has not previously been reported. For physical disability, three items from the Rosow-Breslau Functional Health Scale (are you able to walk a half mile without help? are you able to walk up and down one flight of stairs without help? are you able to do heavy work around the house without help? [ 57]) and five items from the Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale (can you do the following five activities independently: dressing, bathing, eating, toi - leting, and transferring) (58) were used. Physical disability was defined as present if the participant was unable to do any of the items. We examined the presence of physical dis - ability at age 75 years using the exam at which the partici - pant was closest to and within 5 years from age 75 using both the original cohort and offspring samples. Among the 2,614 individuals included in the analysis, 42% reported physical disability at age 75, and the heritability was 44% (p = .0002). We estimated heritability of frailty and two of its components handgrip strength and walking speed in the Framingham Offspring cohort participants who attended the last completed research examination (2005-2008) during which the short physical performance battery was administered including a timed 4-m usual paced and quick walk (59). Frailty was defined if three of the five criteria proposed by the Cardiovascular Health Study investigators were present and prefrailty if one to two criteria were pres - ent (54). The analysis was adjusted for age and sex and included only participants aged 60 and older. The prevalence of frailty and prefrailty among the 2,207 individuals in this sample was 5% and 41%, respectively, and the combined trait of prefrailty and frailty was modestly heritable ( h 2 = 19%, p = .05). The usual and fast paced walking times in par - ticipants aged 65 years and older were rank normalized to reduce skewness and adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and height. In contrast to frailty, both the usual and quick walk had a substantial genetic contribution with heri - tabilities of nearly 40% (usual walk: h 2 = 0.38, p = .0002; quick walk: h2 = 0.36, p = .0003). Next, we estimated herita - bility of handgrip strength in all offspring participants (mean age 67, range 43-93 years). Handgrip strength was measured three times in each hand with a JAMAR dynamometer. The maximum of the six trials was used in the analysis. Consistent with reports from twin studies, handgrip strength adjusted for age and sex had a heritability of 38% ( p = 5 \u00d7 10 15). Aging phenotypes are associated with varied heritabilities ( Table 1 ), and thus, the genetic contribution to the phenotype may be quite modest. Populations that differ in environmental factors may produce different heritability estimates even if the genetic factors influencing the trait are the same. Hence, it is remarkable that the heritability estimates for many of the age-related phenotypes are similar. Longevity and age-related phenotypes with higher heritability are of higher priority for genetic association studies, as these phenotypes are more likely to result in multiple genetic associations. Genetic Association Studies Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) test genetic variants across the entire genome for association with a phenotype and have proven highly successful for discovery of novel genes and biologic pathways involved in many common complex conditions ( Table 2 ). However, few GW AS of longevity have been conducted to date.

The project was relatively small in size including just 1,345 Framingham participants from the largest 310 families and limited in coverage of the genome as the genotyping was conducted with the 100K Affymetrix GeneChip. Modest associations between longevity (defined as age at death) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near FOXO1a, a gene important for life span in animal models, as well as other candidate genes were observed but failed to reach genome-wide statistical significance. Results of this investigation are considered hypothesis-generating and remain to be replicated. Lending some support to the Framingham 100K longevity investigation, a genome-wide linkage study looking for chromosomal regions linked to successful aging in the Amish Study identified a linkage region near one of the SNPs associated with age at death (52). In 2007, more than 9,300 Framingham Heart Study participants were genotyped with the Affymetrix 500K mapping array plus 50K gene centric supplemental array as part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's SNP Health Association Resource project ( http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id= phs000342.v2.p6 , accessed March 9, 2012). At the same time, multiple large population-based longitudinal cohort studies in the United States and Europe with richly pheno - typed participants planned to conduct genome-wide geno - typing. Thus, in 2008, the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Con - sortium was formed to facilitate GWAS meta-analyses and replication opportunities to enhance gene discovery for many phenotypes ( 77). The CHARGE aging and longevity work - ing group conducted a meta-analysis of GW AS results for longevity defined as survival to age 90 and older from four cohort studies (Age, Gene/Environment, Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Framingham Heart Study, and the Rotterdam Study) ( 64). The CHARGE collaboration permitted the assembly of one of the largest samples of long-lived individuals with genome-wide genotyping available at that time (1,836 individuals achieved aged 90 years). The comparison group was drawn from the same cohorts and included only deceased partici - pants to ensure that no individual achieved longevity. The investigation detected 273 SNP associations for longevity that achieved p < .0001, but none of the associations achieved genome-wide significance ( p < 5 \u00d7 10 8). In the next stage of the discovery analysis, among the 24 strongest independent SNP associations in the CHARGE meta-analysis, 16 SNPs were successfully genotyped in the Leiden Longevity Study and the Danish 1905 cohort, and one SNP near the MINPP1 gene was associated with longevity with p = 6.8 \u00d7 10 7 in the combined stage 1 and stage 2 discovery samples. The minor (less frequent) allele was associated with a lower odds of achieving longevity (odds ratio 0.8). MINPP1 is a highly conserved gene involved in cellular proliferation. The CHARGE aging and longevity working group now includes investigators from over 15 cohort studies permitting future investigations of even larger samples of long-lived individuals with genome-wide genotyping and additional aging pheno - types that may improve our power to detect age-related genetic variation and provide support to our initial findings. We have subsequently conducted a meta-analysis of GW AS data from nine studies in more than 25,000 individuals aged 55 years and older for two age-related phenotypes, all-cause mortality and survival free of major disease and death ( 63). Although none of the SNP associations for either phenotype achieved genome-wide significance, 14 independent SNPs were asso - ciated with mortality, and 8 independent SNPs were associ - ated with event-free survival. The SNPs were in or near genes highly expressed in the brain, genes involved with neural function, and genes associated with a variety of age-related diseases. Thus, our findings suggest that neural processes may be important in regulating aging. A GWAS conducted in 403 nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study, and 1,670 younger population controls identified 62 SNPs associated with longevity at p < 1 \u00d7 10 4 (61). Successful genotyping of 58 of these SNPs was conducted in three independent studies: the Rotterdam Study, Leiden 85-plus Study, and Danish 1905 cohort. A meta-analysis of the 58 SNPs in all four studies that included more than 4,000 nonagenarians and 7,500 younger controls identified only one genome-wide signifi - cant SNP rs2075650 in TOMM40 at chromosome 19q13.32 close to the ApoE gene. The minor allele was associated with lower odds of longevity (odds ratio 0.71, p = 3.4 \u00d7 1017). No other SNPs were associated with longevity. SNP rs2075650 was noted to be in moderate linkage disequilib - rium with rs429358, the SNP that ApoE E4 isoform and in very low linkage disequilibrium the SNP that defines the ApoE E2 isoform. In conditional analysis, with all three SNPs in the model, rs2075650 was no longer associated with longevity, whereas the minor allele of rs429358 had a deleterious effect on longevity, and rs7412 a protective effect leading the authors to conclude that rs2075650 effect on longevity was most likely medi - ated through the isoforms of the ApoE gene. A case-control conducted German nonagenarians and cente - narians, and 1,085 controls (mean age 60 years) identified rs4420638 near the APOC1 gene and replicated the finding in an independent sample ( 60). This finding was also fully explained by linkage disquilibrium with ApoE E4 isoform confirming the prior report. These results are intriguing as the ApoE gene is one of only two candidate genes with con- sistent evidence for association with longevity in humans (73). The ApoE E4 isoform has been linked to elevated choles - terol, cardiovascular disease, age-related cognitive decline, and dementia. The ApoE E4 isoform is more strongly asso- ciated with Alzheimer disease than longevity and other con - ditions. Homozygosity for the Apo E E4 allele confers up to a 15-fold risk for Alzheimer's disease in whites and an 8-fold risk in African Americans compared with the most at Boston University Libraries on July 11, 2012 http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from LONGEVITY AND HEALTHY AGING GENES 475 common ApoE genotype (E3/E3 [ 78]). Thus, ApoE may influence longevity through premature atherosclerosis and age-related diseases. Notably, the CHARGE study did not observe genome-wide significant associations between the ApoE gene region and longevity. However, neither of the two SNPs (rs429358 and rs7412) that define the ApoE E4 poly - morphism nor any strong proxies appear on any of the chips used by the CHARGE consortium studies. In the CHARGE meta-analysis, the odds of living past age 90 years associated with the minor allele of rs2075650 was 0.85 ( p = .046); hence, the effect is consistent with the prior reports. FOXO3a was first noted to be associated with longevity in a candidate gene study conducted in male centenarians of Japanese descent (65) and subsequently replicated in diverse samples of centenarians and long-lived individuals (66-69). Remarkably neither the Leiden or German studies nor the CHARGE GWAS identified an association between longevity and FOXO3a. Finally, a recent GWAS of 410 long-lived individuals and 553 young controls from Southern Italy identified an SNP in an intron of the CAMKIV gene among the top associations. This association was replicated in a sample of 116 long-lived and 160 young controls (p < 10 4 discovery analysis, joint replication analysis p = 1.7 \u00d7 106) (62). Interestingly, in vitro work suggests that this gene activates proteins in candidate genes for longevity (AKT, SIRT1, and FOXO3a). About 300 genetic variants in 30 genes in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway were genotyped in older women partici - pating in the Study of Osteoporotic Fracture. Replication studies were conducted in the Cardiovascular Health Study and an Ashkenazi Jewish Centenarian Study ( 70). SNPs in two genes this ( AKT1 and FOXO3a ) were signifi - cantly associated with human life span. A better understand - ing of the biological mechanisms by which the FOXO3a and AKT1 variants influence human longevity will be important to development of interventions to delay aging ( 79). Individuals with a family history of longevity have lower mortality for most age-related diseases ( 80). Therefore, researchers tested the hypothesis that this may be due to the absence of susceptibility alleles for common diseases in the Leiden Longevity Study and the Leiden 85 Plus Study. They examined whether the long-lived individuals had fewer cop-ies of 30 alleles discovered through GWAS to be associated with coronary artery disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes compared with a younger comparison group ( 81). Notably, no difference in the number of risk alleles was detected, suggesting that at least in these populations, survival to old age is not determined by the absence of risk alleles identified to date for age-related disease. The effort to identify genes that affect longevity through candidate gene and GWAS studies has had only modest suc - cess to date. This is likely due to a combination of factors including the heterogeneity of the phenotype, the influence of environmental and dietary factors, which vary widely across populations and the relatively small sample sizes of published longevity GWAS. Many of the successful GWAS with many replicating genome-wide significant signals have sample sizes of more than 10,000, and some published studies of quantitative traits such as age at menarche have had sample sizes of more than 80,000 ( 43). It is clear that defining more homogeneous phenotypes through age-related traits such as age at menopause and bone mineral density leads to greater success in identifying aging-related genes. Another potential explanation for the lack of identification of risk variants for longevity is that the bulk of the genetic effects are due to rare variants or structural variation in the genome. The GWAS chips used to date have focused on common SNP variants, which typically do not tag rare variants well. Recent work within the CHARGE consortium studies suggests that copy number variants are associated with mortality ( 82). With the advent of low-cost exome and whole genome sequencing as well as higher-density SNP chips with 5 million or more vari - ants, we will soon have the opportunity to determine whether rare or structural variants explain a substantive proportion of the heritability of longevity and other aging traits. Translation Comparison across genomes of different organisms may greatly facilitate the process of gene identification and test- ing of homologous genes in humans ( 83). Genome-wide mapping studies of longevity have been conducted in animal models, including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila (84). Through the National Institute of Aging's Longev - ity Consortium ( http://longevityconsortium.org/ , accessed August 15, 2011) that brings together scientists from mul - tiple disciplines, investigators from the CHARGE con - sortium, and the Aging Center at the Jackson Laboratory in Maine began to examine the conserved genetic mechanisms between humans and the mouse for life span (85). The labo-ratory mouse is an excellent model organism for under - standing mammalian physiology and genetics for several reasons, including the availability of extensive genetic resources, such as hundreds of inbred, congenic, consomic, and recombinant inbred strains, as well as the ability to add and delete genes via transgenesis and targeted mutagenesis (86,87). Sequence analyses have demonstrated that mice and humans share more than 99% of their genes and that these genes are arranged in a homologous fashion on chro - mosomes, a phenomenon termed synteny. The appearance of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for a given phenotype in syntenic regions of two different species is evidence that the same gene regulates the phenotype in both species ( 88). In the past 30 years, seven mouse life-span QTL studies have been carried out in two groups of recombinant inbred strains and 3 four-strain crosses (85). Although none of the SNP associations for longevity in the CHARGE GWAS achieved genome-wide significance (64), 8 of the top 10 hits were located within a mouse QTL, and five of the human signals were located within 10 Mb of at Boston University Libraries on July 11, 2012 http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from MURABITO ET AL. 476 a mouse QTL peak; the probability that this is due to chance is very low ( p = .0025 using Fisher's exact test, based on life-span QTL covering 860 Mb of the 2,700 Mb genome and each human peak being 1 Mb in size) ( 85). The colocal- izations of the human peaks and mouse longevity QTL are especially notable in the distal region of mouse chromo - some 1 (summarized in Figure 1). In this region, Gelman (90) first reported a longevity QTL that was identified in recombinant inbred lines of C57BL/6J X DBA/2. Recently, Yuan and coworkers identified two longevity QTL in this region in a backcross mouse population (POHN/DehJ \u00d7 C57BL/6J) \u00d7 POHN/DehJ (unpublished data, 2011). The peak of Gelman's QTL overlaps with the peak of one of the Yuan and coworkers QTL, around 160 Mb-163 Mb. The peak of the other Yuan and coworkers QTL was 14 Mb apart, around 175 Mb. Syntenic regions of 2 of the 10 highest peaks (rs16850255 and rs4443878) identified in the CHARGE study are found around 161 Mb and 176 Mb, co - localizing with the mouse longevity QTL. This suggests that human and mouse may share some mechanisms that regulate life span. Interestingly, around 160 Mb and 175 Mb, one peak from a mouse genome-wide association study and one QTL of IGF-1 have been reported (Figure 1). Yuan and coworkers reported that across mouse inbred strains, lower IGF-1 levels are associated with longer life span. The overlap between longevity QTL and IGF-1 QTL suggests that this region may contain genes that could regulate longevity through the regulation of IGF-1 level. Although this hypoth - esis must be further verified, the combination of such human and mouse genetic studies establishes a foundation for a powerful translational strategy. We plan to integrate data for additional age-related traits and use bioinformatics and genetic resources in the mouse to test promising candidate genes for longevity. Although genetic association studies in humans can help identify potential genes linked to longev - ity, the mouse model may be very useful in uncovering the underlying biologic mechanisms that lead to aging. Other investigators have examined human-chimpanzee orthologous gene pairs to explore evolutionary forces on genes related to aging ( 93). Genes that appeared to have a pattern of selection tended to have important biological functions that were conserved among mammals ( 93). Of interest, the study findings suggest that one gene that may have undergone rapid evolution is WRN. Defects in WRN cause Werner's syndrome characterized by premature aging. Ultimately, we hope that the identification of genes influ - encing human longevity will provide insights into the biol-ogy of aging and in turn new therapeutics to slow aging and improve health. Evidence from both human and animal studies has identified genes in the IGF1/insulin signaling pathway influencing life span. Therefore, interest in resve - ratrol, a compound shown to extend life span in animals and improve insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity among many other benefits, is not surprising. A recent pilot study conducted in 10 older adults suggests that resveratrol improved insulin sensitivity in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (94). These data combined with animal studies provide support for larger studies of the benefits of resveratrol in humans (95). Future Directions Technological advances now permit the complete sequenc - ing of all protein-coding portions of the genome (the \"exome\"), and the ability to sequence the whole genome of individuals quickly and efficiently is just beginning. Sequencing represents an opportunity to detect rare poten - tially functional genetic variants unlikely to be discovered with the GWAS that focus on common genetic variation (minor allele frequencies of >5%). The National Human Genome Research Institute and National Heart, Lung, and Figure 1. Quantitati ve trait loci (QTL) for mouse longevity and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) as well as genome-wide association peaks for human longevity and mouse IGF-1, both depicted on the mouse genome, mouse chromosome 1 (mapped in Mb). Colored bars are longevity QTL; the open bar is an IGF-1 QTL. The height of the bars represents the 95% confidence interval if reported or an estimated 40 Mb if not reported; the black squares in the bars represent the QTL peaks. We determined the Mb position using a recently revised mouse map ( 89) and the Mouse Map Converter from the Center for Genome Dynamics ( http://cgd.jax.org/mousemapconverter/). Arrows to the left of the chromosome represent human genome-wide association peaks at the homologous mouse genome locations. The arrow on the right of the chromosome is the mouse genome-wide association peak of IGF-1. (Figure is modified from Figure 1 of Yuan et al [ 85]). Chr = chromosome.

This innovative technology and the analytic tools under development will be able to be extended to longevity and age-related traits. The sequencing of centenarian genomes may uncover rare genetic variants underlying human extreme longevity and provide insights into the basic biology of aging. Changes in gene expression that occur as a result of molecular mechanisms that do not change the primary DNA sequence are referred to as epigenetics ( http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK45788/#epi_sci_bkgrd.About_ - nisms influence phenotypic expression and are affected by development, the environment, diet, drugs, and aging. One of the best studied epigenetic mechanisms called DNA methylation usually results in suppression of nearby genes. A study of global DNA methylation in an Icelandic cohort and a family-based Utah cohort demonstrated familial clus - tering of DNA methylation changes and changes in DNA methylation over time ( 96). The changes in DNA methylation that occur with aging may alter normal gene expression and in turn contribute to development of age-related disease and functional decline ( 97). Epigenetic changes can be identified using genome-wide analysis with microarrays (ChIP-chip) or next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). These new tech - nologies may be used in longitudinal cohort studies in the future to uncover the role of epigenetics in human longevity. Conclusions Genetic factors undoubtedly contribute to human aging and longevity, yet candidate gene and GWAS have yielded few replicated longevity-gene associations to date with the exceptions of the ApoE and FOXO3A genes. Genome-wide genotyping of participants in longitudinal cohort studies, family-based studies, and special populations of long-lived individuals such as centenarians along with unprecedented collaboration among investigators in the United States, Europe, and worldwide provide the opportunity for the assembly of the large discovery and replication samples needed for genetic discoveries. Existing consortia that include both population-based and laboratory-based scien - tists may speed the translation of newly discovered genetic associations by uncovering the function of the identified genetic variants and ultimately the biologic mechanisms leading to human aging. Many epidemiological studies are poised to use new technologies to move beyond common genetic variants to explore the contribution of low frequency and rare genetic variants, structural changes, and epigenetic changes to human longevity and aging.

Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM Pressure ulcers (PrUs) remain a national priority in American healthcare. Every year, tens of thousands of patients develop these skin lesions. Although rat es vary widely among different care settings, a 2009 survey among s elf-selected sites in the United States found an overall PrU prevalence rate of 11.9% and a facility-acquired rate of 5.0% in acute care facilities.1Along with pain and the risk for serious infe ctions, PrUs result in increased healthcare utilization and co sts. A survey using Medicare in- patient data found that, between 2005 and 2007, PrUs accounted for up to $2.41 billion in excess healthcare costs.2 Some PrUs may be avoidable, and in the past decade, the prevention of PrUs has gained increased emphasis in clinical practice. In the quest to reduce harm to patients from serious preventable events, institutions such as the National QualityForum, the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research, and the Joint Commission, among others, selected PrUs as indicators for patient safety and quality of hospital care. In similar efforts, the 5 Million Lives Campaign, led by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, brought additional attention to the importance of preventing PrUs in healthcare facilities. Furthermore, in 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services implemented new payment rules that included PrUs on the list of ''never events'' and stopped reimbursement to hospitals for the costs of care resulting from facility-acquired Stages III and IV PrUs.3 This article will help clinicians identify best practice evidence supporting the combined use of interventions to prevent PrUs in acute care and long-term-care facilities. PRESSURE ULCER BEST PRACTICES In the United States, best practices to prevent PrUs have been identified in randomized controlled trials and have been widely disseminated through clinical practice guidelines. A number of systematic studies have evaluated the efficiency of individual best practices, such as the use of special support surfaces or standardized tools to assess risk for PrU develop- ment.4,5However, the systematic implementation of best practices one at a time in the standard care environment has been shown to be a challenge for many facilities. Studies have found low adherence rates to best practices for PrU preven- tion in different care settings. For example, 1 study found that although hospitalized older adults were assessed for PrU risks, only 15% had a supportive device in place by day 3 of hospitalization.6Another study found that, of 2425 hospita- lized Medicare beneficiaries from across the nation, only 23% of immobile patients were documented as being at risk within 48 hours of admission, 66% were repositioned every 2 hours, and 8% received a pressure-reducing device.7A third study surveyed medical records of 834 residents in Veterans Health Administration long-term-care facilities and found that overall adherence to 6 critical best-care practices (such as standardized risk assessment and regular repositioning) was only 50%.8 Rather than implementing single best practices, care facilities have increasingly begun to bundle best practices together and implement them as part of comprehensive programs in their facilities. The aim of this review was to examine the evidence supporting the combined use of multiple interventions to pre- vent PrUs in acute care and long-term-care facilities. Two questions guided the analysis of the literature: &Are there any specific components that have consistently been included in multifaceted programs? &Is there evidence that these comprehensive programs reduce PrU incidence and/or prevalence? ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the evidence supporting the combined use of interventions to prevent pressure ulcers (PrUs) in acute care and long-term-care facilities. DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature describing multi- faceted PrU prevention programs was performed. Articles were included if they described an intervention implemented in acute care settings or long-term-care facilities, incorporated more than 1 intervention component, involved a multidisciplinary team, and included information about outcomes related to the intervention. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were identified. Recurring components used in the development and implementation of PrU prevention programs included preparations prior to the start of a program, PrU prevention best practices, staff education, clinical monitoring and feedback, skin care champions, and cues to action. Ten studies reported PrU prevalence rates; 9 of them reported decreased prevalence rates at the end of their programs. Of the 6 studies reporting PrU incidence rates, 5 reported a decrease in incidence rates. Four studies measured care processes: 1 study reported an overall improvement; 2 studies reported improvement on some, but not all, measures; and 1 study reported no change. CONCLUSIONS: There is a growing literature describing multi- pronged, multidisciplinary interventions to prevent PrUs in acute care settings and long-term-care facilities. Outcomes reported in these studies suggest that such programs can be successful in reducing PrU prevalence or incidence rates. However, to strengthen the level of evidence, sites should be encouraged to rigorously evaluate their programs and to publish their results.

In addition, reference lists were reviewed, and clinical experts were contacted to identify further relevant studies. The search was limited to articles published in English between January 1995 and December 2010. To be included, the studies needed to describe a pro- gram to prevent PrUs that &was implemented in an acute care or long-term-care facility, &consisted of more than 1 intervention component, &was not limited to site-specific PrUs (such as heel ulcers), &was delivered through multidisciplinary efforts, and &measured and reported PrU prevalence or incidence rates before and after implementation of the program. RESULTS Twenty-four articles were identified describing comprehensive PrU prevention programs. Twenty studies described single- site interventions and four described multisite interventions. All of the reviewed studies used a longitudinal 1-group pretest-posttest design. No randomized controlled trials were reported. An in-depth review of the studies was performed, and each study was analyzed for the following elements: setting and scope of the program, implementation team and preparations prior to program implementation, intervention components, methods of data collection, and results. The different intervention components were categorized into the following groups: PrU prevention best practices, staff educa- tion, clinical monitoring and evaluation, skin care champions, other campaign elements, and strategies to ensure sustain- ability. The findings of this review are shown in Table 1 and are summarized in the following sections. Setting and Scope Of the 20 programs reviewed in acute care settings,9-28all but one17were rolled out on multiple units or hospital-wide. Two studies reported spreading the program throughout the system after testing it on a small number of pilot units.18,22 Long-term-care facility initiatives included between 1 and 20 participating facilities.29-32 Team The individuals who initiated and led the improvement efforts were not specified in any of the reviewed articles. However, a distinction was found between programs that were initiated and led internally by staff members9-13,15-28and programs that were designed byexternal experts and implemented in collaboration with the facility in question.14,29-32Once the need for change was identified, several facilities chose to establish a team responsible for the design and/or implementation of the intervent ion. Teams responsible for de- signing and implementing the programs were generally multi- disciplinary and, if specified, included combinations of nurses and nursing aides, wound experts, d ietitians, pharmacists, physical therapists, physicians, clinical re searchers, educators, information technology staff, managers, and directors.10,11,15,18,20-25,27 Program Components Preparations. Twelve of the reviewed studies specified a set of activities completed prior to developing and implementing their initiatives.10-13,15,16,18,20,22,24,27,31Preparations included literature reviews of best practices for prevention and treatment of PrUs; baseline prevalence and incidence surveys; assessments of current state of staff knowledge, existing policies, and care processes; and the testing, evaluation, and selection of pressure relief equipment or skin care products. Pressure Ulcer Prevention Best Practices. Consistent with existing clinical practice guidelines, studies that described their PrU prevention protocol most commonly reported the use of standardized tools for assessing risk for PrUs; regular skin (re)assessment; an individualized care plan for patients at risk for PrUs; the use of pressure relief equipment, such as low-air- loss mattresses and heel lifts; nutritional assessment and consultation for at-risk patients; frequent turning and repositioning; and the use of skin care products and moisture barrier creams. Staff Education. All but 4 studies13,16,23,30described some form of education or training to i ncrease staff knowledge. Gen- erally, education was targeted at nursing staff and included instructions on PrU treatment and p revention practices, presenta- tions of new or existing facility guidelines and policies, and training on the use of skin care products and support surfaces. Two studies reported educational pro grams for physicians.20,28Most of the studies reported formal staff educational activities, such as unit in-service sessions and workshops, computerized educational modules, educational packages for staff, skin fairs, and wound conferences.9-12,14,15,18-22,24-29,31,32Three studies furthermore reported the integration of PrU prevention and treatment into their orientation of new hires.18,20,21 In addition to formal activities, several studies described more informal ways of teaching PrU prevention.9,11,17,22,27,31 One-on-one mentoring, consultation, and support at the bedside through certified nursing staff, training provided in preparation of PrU data collection, and individual case reviews of hospital-acquired PrUs were among the opportunities seized to provide ongoing training.

Staff com- pliance with existing protocols was monitored through daily, weekly, or monthly rounding of th e wound nurses or other nursingstaff; regular chart audits; and PrU tracking forms and compliance monitoring tools.9-13,15,18,21,22,24,26-28,30,31Additional strategies for continuous improvement include d preventability or root-cause analyses when a patient developed a PrU and the development of action plans when results of the surveys were unsatisfactory.13,18,26 Table 1.

Eight of the 24 studies highlighted the importance of sharing the results from their surveys with the staff by posting the PrU rates on unit bill-boards; publishing them in unit newsletters; distributing them to unit managers, directors, and senior leadership; or dis- cussing them at staff meetings.9,12,17,18,20,21,30,32 Skin Care Champions .Seven of the acute care studies created the role of a skin care champion as part of their PrU prevention Clinical Monitoring/FeedbackSkin Care ChampionsOther Elements SustainabilityPressure Ulcer (PrU) RatesCare Process Measures Compliance monitoring: daily unit audits Posting of rates on units and discussion during meetings Continuous support from ET teamNot reported Turn clocks Theme: ''Check, Rock & Roll Around the Clock''Continued data collectionAnnual prevalence/ incidence study For project: monthly if needed 2006: Overall prevalence: 15% Overall incidence: 7% (decreased from year before) Monthly studies: below national benchmark, downward trendNot reported Weekly audits on each unit Event forms for each HAPU Daily review of documentation and skin assessments for patients with Braden scores <19Unit-based wound championsTheme song Two campaigns to maintain staff motivationQuarterly prevalence studies Monthly incidence rates based on event forms for every HAPU Baseline August 2007 Overall prevalence: 9.5% Post December prevalence: 5.66% Second intervention: weekly chart RN: completed protocol PCA: audits chart 3 d laterNot reported Not reported Continued data collectionQuarterly prevalence studies Baseline : May 2003 All: 19.47% Post : 2.05% Weekly monitoring of at-risk patients and staff compliance with protocolNot reported ADVANCES IN SKIN & WOUND CARE &APRIL 2012 171 WWW.WOUNDCAREJOURNAL.COM Copyright @ 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Generally, the staff members received additional training in PrU treatment and prevention, and their responsibilities included a combination of the following elements: to introduce the new policies and in- terventions on the unit, to serve as skin care resource and mentor to coworkers, to serve as liaison between the unit and other parties involved in the improvement efforts, and to participate in the data collection and ongoing process monitoring. Other Elements .To increase awareness and provide cues to action for consistent and correct implementation of the new clinical practices, several programs utilized audiovisual sup- port and other isolated activities.9,10,12,13,15,17,18,20-22,24,27,29-32 Examples of these support elements included use of turn clocks, stickers in the patient charts or outside patient rooms to identify patients with PrUs or at risk for developing one, PrU pocket guides and reference cards, theme songs played every 2 hours, penlights for skin assessments, weekly skin care newsletters, posters on the units, and manuals or guidebooks on skin care products, support equipment, or PrU preventionand treatment protocols. Another strategy to ensure continued awareness of the program was the development of acronyms and themes related to the program. The following themes were identified in the reviewed literature: ''Check, Rock & Roll Around the Clock''9; PUPPI Protocol Interventions)11; ''Save Our Sur- faces, Keep the patients turning, Incontinence management, Nutrition)18; and TOE ( Turn, Overlay, Elevate).22 Strategies to Sustain Efforts .It is not evident in the literature if initiatives were discontinued after completion of the project period, or whether all or certain intervention components were continued even after the formal study phase. A number of studies, however, suggested ongoing measurement and report- ing of PrU rates as a strategy for ensuring continued awareness of PrU prevention.9,11,13,14,18,23,24,26Four studies reported iden- tification of new practice issues as a way for sustaining the momentum of the prevention efforts.16,18,24,28Finally, 1 study noted that additional visual and auditory cues were introduced after completion of the study to ensure consistent adherence to PrU prevention protocols.22Table 1.

Almost all of the reviewed studies measured PrU prevalence rates before and after implementation of their quality improve- ment projects.9-28Seven studies did not sufficiently describe the results of their prevalence surveys to draw meaningful con- clusions.12,13,18,22,26-28Eleven studies saw a decrease in prevalence rates over the course of the study period,9,10,11,14-17,20,21,23,24 whereas 2 programs reported no significant changes.19,25 Ten studies reported PrU incidence rates.9,12,13,18,24-29,32 Eight of these studies reported a decrease in rates between baseline and follow-up; 1 study reported that incidence rates increased between project year 1 and year 4 without statistical significance,25and 1 study noted that results could not be sustained during the postimplementation phase.32 Care Processes .Process measures were reported by 2 acute care-setting studies14,16,and 3 long-term-care-facility studies.29-31 One acute care-setting study measured the use of a new mattressand implementation of a repositioning schedule and found no significant change in preventive behavior when the use of new support mattresses was not taken into account.14The other acute care study reported minimal im provements in some of the mea- sured care processes.16Among the 3 multisite long-term-care facility programs, one reported an overall improvement of clinical practice benchmarks across all participating facilities after implementation of the 8-week program.31The other 2 multisite studies saw significant impro vement in 8 of 12 and 9 of 12 care processes when aggregated across the participating sites.29,30 Other Outcomes .Positive outcomes, such as increased staff awareness and knowledge, as well as change in attitudes towardClinical Monitoring/FeedbackSkin Care ChampionsOther Elements SustainabilityPressure Ulcer (PrU) RatesCare Process Measures Evaluation form for training sessions Weekly feedbacks on staff compliance with training Weekly reports by management to staff of PrU incidenceNot reported Penlights for skin assessment Caregivers required to wear TAP card $75 if the incidence of PrUs was reduced below the goal $10 for completion of training programNot reported Monitored the incidence of PrUs during the Baseline HAPU incidence: 28.3% Intervention HAPU incidence: 9.3% Reduction of PrU incidence was highest during the 12-wk intervention phase; results were not sustained without the support of the research teamNot reported PRESSURE ULCER TOOLKIT This literature review was performed as part of the process for developing a toolkit to reduce PrUs using a multifaceted quality improvement approach.

However, reports of these outcomes were mostly anecdotal and were not validated by any formal evaluation. DISCUSSION This review showed that there is an array of studies describing the use of multipronged initiatives to prevent PrU develop- ment among patients in hospitals and long-term-care facil- ities. Moreover, many programs reported impressive improvements in PrU prevalence or incidence rates. These results suggest that multifaceted, multidisciplinary programs are effective in preventing PrUs. A number of approaches were widely used as components of the multipronged approach and are likely to contribute to its success. In preparation of implementation, literature re- views or assessment of the current state of PrU practice was often used to provide a baseline for the data collection and identify areas in need for improvement. Intervention compo- nents included the use of a ''bundle'' of best practices for PrU prevention, the reliance on a unit skin care champions, and an emphasis on staff education. Strategies to generate staff enthusiasm and increase awareness and adherence to the best practices, such as turning clocks or skin care newsletters, often were used. The involvement of frontline staff members in all stages of program design and implementation was considered to be essential by many studies to ensure staff engagement, ownership, and dedication. Providing frequent real-time data feedback and giving staff credit for improvement, celebrating success, and stimulating a healthy competition among the units were frequently described as ways of engaging the staff and providing them a sense of pride in their accomplishments. Finally, regular monitoring of charts, weekly or monthly rounding, and root-cause analysis to examine what went wrong when a PrU developed were also used successfully. Few studies commented on long-term sustainability of the intervention, and there was little in the literature to suggest how improvements could be maintained. Continuous mon- itoring of PrU rates, the presence of a wound care team or unit champions, and continued formal and informal education seemed to be some of the elements that could positively in- fluence the maintenance of positive outcomes. Despite the number of studies showing benefit, results must be interpreted with caution. Foremost, the level of evidence is weak. Studies mostly consisted of a longitudinal 1-group pretest-posttest design. The y have neither randomization to interventions nor control groups. Description of methods for data collection and analysis was often neglected in the publications. Only 5 studies reported process m easures. This makes it difficult to determine whether the interventions contributed to increasedstaff compliance with new PrU prevention practices. In addition, some of the studies that measured care processes showed that albeit improved, adherence to cert ain best practices still remained low. One of the studies, for example, found that the proportion of residents with appropriate risk assessment completed within 2 days of admission increased from 2.2% to only 15.3%, whereas the proportion of residents with PrUs that receive weekly skin assessments increased from 12.6% to 32.8%.29 Furthermore, the components of the multifaceted programs were not evaluated individually, and it is therefore not possible to determine the impact of each single component. There is also a high likelihood of publication bias. Nearly all published studies were positive in showing a benefit. Given the multitude of interventions, it is not plausible that all programs would work. More likely, those programs that showed a benefit were more likely to be written up and published. Finally, studies generally did not describe or analyze the processes by which the new programs were implemented, the challenges they faced, and how they did overcome them. However, organizational change requires attention not only to the content of the program, but also to the strategies needed to implement the program. CONCLUSION Improving PrU prevention remains an important issue for hospital patients. This literature review has identified many components that have consistently been included in successful multifaceted PrU interventions. A review of the studies supports previously reported exemplars of success in PrU reduction initiatives. This includes administrative support with active involvement of clinical staff at the patient care level, bundling of care practices and infusing them into routine care practice, creating systemwide change and communication that is individualized to the institution's culture, making visible the documentation of PrU prevention practices, and regular education of all levels of staff.33Prevention practices of risk assessment, pressure redistribution and repositioning, and attention to skin care are common bundle care elements. It appears that the more care practices are incorporated into usual care practices, the more staff are apt to perform them and not see them as ''another task to perform.'' For example, including skin inspection while taking vital signs and reporting a patient's PrU risk assessment status as part of the patient's handoff report are ways for staff to consistently perform suggested prevention interventions. The best out- comes are a result of PrU prevention bundle care practices performed consistently. Pressure ulcer quality improvement teams that are empow- ered within their institutions appear to have more success. No one composition of the team has been identified as being best; ADVANCES IN SKIN & WOUND CARE &VOL. 25 NO. 4 186 WWW.WOUNDCAREJOURNAL.COM Copyright @ 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.each institution must decide what mix of the interdisciplinary team needs to be included in its oversight of PrU reduction initiatives. Pressure ulcer reduction initiatives should be cus- tomized and prioritized for the needs of professionals in that institution.34 Making too many changes at one time may impact the sustainability of PrU prevention practices. Dahlstrom et al35 found that also changing to an electronic medical record at the same time as their PrU prevention program decreased gains previously seen. Virani et al36have summarized factors that contribute to poor sustainability of evidence-based practices, including inadequate time for teaching new practices to staff, inadequate attention to barriers of acceptance of new practices, and organizational factors such as inadequate resources for equipment/supplies and infrastructure support. They recommend that ''sustainability of practice changes therefore requires systematic, thoughtful planning and action to ensure that the changes are embedded into the various knowledge reservoirs in the organization.''36 The authors agree with Virani et al,36who believe that a regular review of research literature and practice guidelines should be used to evaluate an institution's PrU practices. What did not work in one institution might work in another. Facilities that have implemented PrU programs, successfully or not, should be encouraged to rigorously evaluate their programs and publish their results to strengthen the level of evidence. & PRACTICE PEARLS &The review of the literature supports multi-disciplinary, bundled approaches to PrU prevention. &No one approach has been identified as being best; institutions should carefully plan and customize PrU prevention programs according to their needs and abilities. &PrU prevention programs require attention to content, as well as implementation and sustainability strategies. &Institutions having implemented PrU prevention programs are encouraged to share their strategies and results so that others can learn from the experience.

The primary outcome was any current STI, based on urine tests forNeisseria gonorrhoeae ,Chlamydia trachomatis . Data on potential demographic and behavioural predictors of STI were obtained from surveys administered at study entry. Of 682 participants, 12.8% (95% condence interval [CI] 10.3, 15.3) tested positive for at least one STI. In a multivariable modeladjusted for gender, age and marital status, only sex trade involvement over the last three months was signicantly associated with an increased odds of STI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.00, 95% CI 1.13, 3.55). Given that STIs were common in this HIV-infected cohort, and that few patient characteristics predicted STI, the current practice of screening HIV-infected Russians for syphilis alonemerits re-evaluation. Keywords: sexually transmitted infection, HIV, AIDS, STIs, risk behaviour, alcohol drinking, Russia INTRODUCTION The HIV epidemic in Russia has expanded rapidly over the last decade and continues to grow, with an estimated one millionHIV-infected people in 2010. 1While the epidemic has been largely driven by injection drug use, the proportion of newinfections attributed to sexual risk is increasing. 2,3This shift has drawn attention to the possible role of sexually transmittedinfections (STIs) in facilitating the spread of HIV in the country.Russia experienced rising STI rates in the period preceding itsHIV epidemic 4and STIs are known to increase both suscepti- bility to HIV and the infectiousness of those with HIV.5,6 Studies outside Russia have demonstrated that STIs, particu- larly gonorrhoea, chlamydia subpopulations. 7-1 there are few studies addressing STIs among HIV-infected Russians.12Existing data derive from studies based on self-report of STI symptoms, or only a small number of HIV-infected participants.2,13These limited data suggest that STIs may make a signicantcontribution to heterosexual transmission of HIV in Russia: for example, among 32 HIV-infected injecting drug users(IDUs) in one study, 18 (56%) tested positive for infection sample on the prevalence and corre- lates of STIs among those infected with HIV in Russia couldinform clinical practice as to the appropriate role for STI screen-ing for this group, which, according to national guidelines, isscreened routinely only for syphilis, but not for other STIs. The HERMITAGE (HIV Evolution in Russia - Mitigating Infection Transmission and Alcoholism in a GrowingEpidemic) study provided an opportunity to investigate theprevalence and correlates of four STIs among 682 HIV-infectedRussians. HERMITAGE is a randomized controlled trial of a be-havioural intervention to reduce high-risk sexual activity andsubstance use among HIV-infected heavy alcohol users whoreported recent unprotected sex in St Petersburg. The currentstudy was a cross-sectional, secondary analysis which inves-tigated the prevalence of gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis andtrichomoniasis at study entry, and examined which behaviours and demographic characteristics were associated with testing positive for one or more of these STIs.

In the clinicalsettings, research associates approached patients, assessedeligibility, offered participation and conducted assessments.At the non-clinical recruitment site, a needle exchange, researchassociates gave potential participants information on the studyand referred them to one of the clinical sites for eligibilityassessment. Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were 18 years of age or older; HIV-infected; reported anal orvaginal sex without a condom in the past six months; andreported past six month National Institute on Alcohol Abuseand Alcoholism (NIAAA) 'at risk' drinking levels (denedas.14 drinks per week or .4 drinks on a single occasion for men, and .7 per week or .3 on a single occasion, for women), described as 'heavy drinking' herein. 14Exclusion cri- teria included cognitive impairment, acute illness precludingparticipation, pending legal issues which could lead to incar- ceration or ongoing efforts to conceive. Procedure After eligibility assessment, all participants provided written informed consent. Baseline data were collected via: (a) aface-to-face interview with a research associate and (b) a self-administered questionnaire for particularly sensitive questions(e.g. about sexual victimization). A medical chart review wasperformed for participants recruited from medical settings.All participants were asked to provide a urine and bloodsample for STI screening at the baseline assessment. Thosetesting positive for an STI at baseline were offered treatment. Interviews were conducted in Russian. Participants were compensated 200 rubles, the equivalent of approximatelyseven US dollars, for the baseline assessment and received 30condoms. The HERMITAGE study was approved by theInstitutional Review Boards of Boston Medical Center andSt Petersburg Pavlov State Medical University. Measures Outcome measuresThe primary outcome of the current study was a diagnosisof one or more STIs (gonorrhoea, chlamydia, trichomoniasisand/or syphilis) based on biological testing at study entry. Urine specimens were tested for N. gonorrhoeae ,C. trachomatis and T. vaginalis using polymerase amplication (Amplisens PCR Kits, Ecoli Ltd,Moscow, Russia) in compliance with quality guidelines by theFederal State Institution of Science, Central Research Instituteof Epidemiology, Moscow, Russia). 15,16Serum was tested for syphilis using the venereal diseases research laboratory test(VDRL, Institute of Vaccines and Sera, St Petersburg, Russia)and an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) that employsrecombinant as having syphilis when both the ELISA and VDRL were positive and they hadnot been previously treated for syphilis. Participants with a positive VDRL and negative ELISA were considered false-positives. None of the participants with a positive ELISA andno prior treatment had a negative VDRL. Potential predictors Potential predictors of STI were identied from the baseline assessment. Sociodemographic characteristics of interest in- cluded age, gender and marital status. Potential health-relatedpredictors included self-report of current antiretroviraltherapy or past history of STI, as well as the most recent CD4count according to a medical record review. Sexual risk beha-viours over the last three months were assessed, and includedthe number of sexual partners; the number of sexual encounterswhen a condom was not used; buying or selling sex for drugsor money; and, for men, any sexual activity with other men(MSM). 17In addition, the assessment asked about the use of alcohol or drugs before or during sex in the last 30 days, a life-time history of sexual victimization and the propensity toseek out novel or risky sexual stimulation, using Kalichman's11-item sexual sensation-seeking scale. This scale generatesscores ranging from 1 to 4, with higher scores reflectinggreater sensation seeking. 18To assess potential alcohol-related predictors of STI, participants were asked about the quantityand frequency of alcohol consumption using a 30-daytime-line follow-back. 19Heavy alcohol use was denition, described above.14Alcohol depen- dence over the last year was evaluated using the CompositeInternational Diagnostic Interview Short-Form (CIDI-SF). 20 Drug-related variables included any of heroin, prescriptionanalgesics, marijuana, sedatives, tranquilizers or stimulants(including amphetamines and cocaine) over the last year,drug dependence according to the CIDI-SF and past historyof injecting drug use. Data analysis Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study sampleat baseline, both overall and by STI status. The frequency andproportion of STIs (i.e. testing positive by biological testingfor any of 4 specic STIs), and of any history of STI by self-report were also described. To identify factors associatedwith testing positive for an STI, a series of logistic regressionmodels were built using the following manual, iterative modelbuilding approach. First, unadjusted logistic regressionmodels for each factor of interest were t. Factors with a P value of less than 0.15 were then included together in a singlemultivariable model. In addition, covariates considered to beimportant potential confounders (i.e. gender, age and maritalstatus) were forced into the multivariable model. Factors inthis multivariable model with a Pvalue greater than 0.15 were removed one at a time. Finally, factors not selectedbased on the initial unadjusted analyses were included one ata time in the current multivariable model to assess their impor-tance in the presence of other variables. The continuous vari-ables of age, sexual sensation seeking score and number ofunprotected sexual encounters were included as tertiles. CD4count was included as a dichotomous variable ( /C21350 versus ,350 cells /mm 3) as was the number of sexual partners ( ,2 versus /C212), which is consistent both with the distribution of our data and the standard approach for measuring multiplepartnering over fairly short time periods. 21To minimize the............................................................................................................................... .................854 International Journal of STD & AIDS Volume 23 December 2012potential for collinearity, we assessed the correlation between all pairs of independent variables and veried that no pair ofvariables included in the same regression model was highlycorrelated (i.e. r.0.40). Due to a large number of missing values for CD4 cell count (30% of the sample), we used an indi-cator variable to create a category for missing values for thisvariable. Secondary, exploratory analyses were also conducted to as- sess gender as a possible effect modier. This analysis aimedto test the hypotheses that younger age may be a more impor-tant risk factor for STIs among women than men, and that theeffects of certain behaviours on STI risk may also differ bygender. 20Potential interactions between gender and four factors hypothesized to have differential effects on STI risk among women and men (age, any alcohol use before orduring sexual activity, sex trade involvement and past yearcocaine use) were evaluated. All reported Pvalues were two-tailed, and a Pvalue of less than 0.05 was considered statistically signicant. Analyses wereperformed using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary,NC, USA). RESULTS As shown in Figure 1, 921 individuals were screened for eligi-bility. Of the 190 ineligible individuals, 110 did not meet thealcohol-related criteria and 134 did not meet the sex risk cri-teria. Seven hundred of the 731 eligible individuals (96%)agreed to participate. Among these, 682 had available STIresults, and were included in the current analysis. Demographic, health-related and behavioural characteristics of the study cohort are shown in Table 1. In general, the sample was young, 40% were women, and, reflecting study eli-gibility criteria, had a high prevalence of heavy alcohol use andunprotected sex. The prevalence of any STI among the 682 participants was 12.8% (95% condence interval [CI] 10.3, 15.3; Table 2). Theprevalence appeared similar in women and men. Only 1.9% of all participants ( n\u00bc13) had more than one STI. Chlamydia was diagnosed among 40 participants (5.8%); it was moreprevalent among men than women (7.3% of men versus 3.6%of women). Trichomoniasis was also common with 37 partici-pants (5.4%) testing positive; prevalence was 8.2% amongwomen and men. Fourteen participants (2.0%)had 13 (1.9%) met the case denition ofuntreated syphilis infection. About half of participants (47.7%)reported a past diagnosis of an STI, including syphilis, gonor-rhoea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, genital warts or herpes. Bivariate analyses Based on the preliminary bivariate analyses, seven independentvariables met criteria for entry into the initial multivariablemodel: the number of unprotected sexual encounters (oddsratio [OR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.34, 1.10 for the middle versus lowest tertile; OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.67, 1.91 for the highest versus lowest tertile); buying or selling sex (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.08,3.24); any history of STI (OR 1.49, 0.95, 2.34); MSM(OR 2.82, 95% CI beforesex (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.95, 2.37); using alcohol before sex (OR1.53, 95% CI 0.98, 2.41); and past year cocaine use (OR 1.92,95% CI 1.01, 3.62). Using drugs oralcohol before sex was not included in the multivariable model due to its potential colli-nearity with using alcohol before sex, and past IDU was notincluded due to its potential collinearity with past year heroinuse. None of the other potential predictors described in theMethods section met criteria for inclusion in the multivariablemodel. Final multivariable model Using the model building approach outlined in the Methods, anal multivariable model was developed and is shown inTable 3. In this model, buying or selling sex was associatedwith a two-fold increased odds of having an STI (adjustedodds ratio [AOR] 2.00, 95% CI 1.13, 3.55). No other factorswere signicantly associated with testing positive for an STI,though there were notable, non-signicant increases in theodds of an STI among those reporting a past STI (AOR 1.46,95% CI 0.91, 2.35) and among MSM compared with men report-ing sex with women only (AOR 2.72, 95% CI 0.78, 9.49). In secondary, exploratory analyses, there was no statistically signicant interaction between gender and any of the followingvariables: age, sex trade, cocaine use in the past year or alcoholuse before or during sexual activity. DISCUSSION The prevalence of STIs in the HERMITAGE cohort of 682HIV-infected heavy drinkers in Russia was 13%. This is com-parable with what has been described in HIV-infected popu-lations in other countries. 12Many in this group reported past injecting drug use, which, consistent with the epidemiologyof HIV in Russia, likely led to their HIV infection. However,sexual transmission of HIV is a growing concern in Russia, 2 and the substantial prevalence of STIs in this sexually activecohort indicates a likely role for such infections in facilitatingHIV transmission to others. Figure 1 Enrollment of participants in the HERMITAGE study and inclusion in the current analysis of sexually transmitted infection(STI) data............................................................................................................................... .................Pace et al. STIs among HIV-infected heavy drinkers in St Petersburg, Russia 855It is thus important to examine factors that may be associated with testing positive for an STI in this subgroup of HIV-infectedRussians. In this study, the only variable that was signicantlypredictive of having an STI was buying or selling sex over the last three months, which doubled the odds of STI. The associ-ation between selling sex and STIs has been noted in many other studies, including several from Russia, 22 -24where sex work is an important risk factor for HIV itself.23However, there have been fewer data on the association between sextrade involvement and STIs from HIV-infected cohorts, agroup whose risk behaviours may be different from thosewithout HIV. 7,11Also of note in the current study was the nding that despite the relationship between sex trade andSTIs, there was no relationship between testing positive for anSTI and either the number of sexual partners or the numberof unprotected sexual encounters. Such a pattern has beenobserved in at least one other Russian study, 24suggesting that other, unmeasured sex risk factors (for example, beingpart of a particular sexual network with a high prevalence ofSTIs) may help account for STI risk among those who buyand sell sex in Russia.Table 1 Baseline characteristics of HIV-infected heavy drinkers with recent unprotected sex in St Petersburg Characteristic n(%), total ( n5682) Demographics Male or cohabitating 244 (35.8) 30 (34.5) 214 (36.0) Employed 498 (73.0) 57 (65.5) 399 (67.0)Ever incarcerated 260 (38.1) 26 (39.3) Health characteristics CD4/C21350 cells /mm 3(n\u00bc479)/C3249 (52.0) 28 (43.1) 221 (53.4) Currently on ARV therapy 117 (17.2) 11 (12.6) 106 (17.8) Sexual risk behaviours Two or more partners 181 (26.5) 25 (28.7) 156 (30.1) Inconsistent condom use518 (76.2) 66 (75.9) 452 (76.2)) Number unprotected IQR) 5 (1-18) 5 (1-26) 5 (1-17)MSM\u00a714 (3.4) 4 (4.6) 10 (1.7) Bought or sold sex for drugs or money 102 (15.0) 20 (23.0) 82 (13.8) Drugs /alcohol before sex, past 30 days 339 (49.9) 51 (58.6) 288 (48.6) Substances used before /during sex, past 30 days Alcohol 281 (41.4) 44 (50.6) 237 (40.0)Heroin 149 (21.9) 17 (19.5) 132 (22.3) Stimulants 40 (5.9) 8 (9.2) 32 (5.4) Cannabis 35 (5.2) 3 (3.5) 32 (5.4) Sexual sensation-seeking score (tertiles) 1-1.750 236 (34.7) (31.4) 196 (32.9) 2.50-4.0 222 (32.6) 28 (32.6) 194 (32.6) Any history of sexual victimization 231 (33.9) 31 (35.6) 200 (33.6) Alcohol and drug use Heavy drinking, last 30 days 554 (81.2) 72 (82.8) 482 (81.0)Ever injected drugs 566 (83.0) 70 (80.5) 496 (83.4)Alcohol dependence, last year 434 (63.6) 57 (65.5) 377 (63.4) Drug use in last year Sedative or tranquilizer 256 (37.6) 38 (43.7) 218 (36.7)Amphetamines or stimulants 213 (31.3) 27 (31.0) 186 (31.3)Analgesics or prescribed painkillers 227 (33.3) 30 (34.5) 197 (33.1) Inhalants 15 (2.2) 3 (3.5) 12 (2.0) Marijuana 319 (46.8) 38 (43.7) 281 (47.2)Cocaine, crack or free base 68 (10.0) 14 (16.1) 54 (9.1)LSD /other hallucinogens 53 (7.8) 7 (8.14) 46 (7.7) Heroin 432 (63.4) 51 (58.6) 381 (64.1) Drug dependence, last year diethylamide 'acid' /C3CD4 count was available for 479 participants, of whom 28 had STI and 221 did not have STI.

Particularly given that the number of MSM may be an underestimate due to underreporting of stig- matized behaviour in Russia, 25the nding may be clinically important. Several independent variables surprisingly did not appear to have strong associations with STIs, most notably age andgender. In many other studies, including some of HIV-infectedcohorts, age under 25 years and female gender have been foundto be strongly associated with STI. 7,10,23,24,26 - 28The impact of both age and gender on overall STI rates in the current studycould have been attenuated by the high-risk behaviour exhib-ited by both men and women who participated. In addition,given that some studies have shown particularly high rates ofSTIs among 15-19 year olds, 27the fact that all participants were 18 and over may have lessened the particular effect ofage as a predictor in this cohort. The expected effect ofgender would also not be seen if the men in this study wereinvolved in disproportionately high-risk sexual activity, suchas MSM, that they underreported. In other words, if MSM (oranother high-risk, potentially under-reported behaviouramong men) was in reality more common than reflected inthe data, residual confounding would prevent us fromgauging the true impact of gender alone on STI risk in multi-variable analysis. Patterns of alcohol use and the number of unprotected sexual encounters were not signicantly associated with having anSTI. The study's selection criteria meant that all participantsreported heavy drinking and at least one episode of unpro-tected sex over the last six months. In this context, it may beunderstandable that neither increasing severity of the alcohol-related problem nor an increasing number of unprotectedsexual encounters over the last three months was associatedwith increased STI risk. The study also found that neither users of particular drugs, nor those with drug dependence were more likely to haveSTIs, in contrast to ndings from several past studies in both HIV-infected and uninfected populations in the USA inwhich drug use, particularly marijuana and stimulant use,were risk factors for STI. 7,11,29This raised the possibility that drug use had a differential effect on STI risk among men com-pared with women, as was seen in a recent study from India inwhich alcohol was more strongly associated with condomnon-use among men (perhaps because men had more controlthan women over the decision to use condoms). 30A secondary analysis was conducted in the current study, to investigatewhether a similar process could have occurred for drug useand STI risk in the HERMITAGE cohort. There was, however,no signicant interaction seen between gender and cocaine use or alcohol use before sex. Future studies should investigate the prevalence of STIs in other groups of HIV-infected Russians. Should the current nd-ings be replicated, the data may have implications for STIscreening practices in Russia, where current guidelines (in con-trast to those issued by the United States Center for DiseaseControl and Prevention) 31recommend that HIV-infected patients be screened for syphilis alone. HIV-infected Russianstypically receive this screening from their HIV providers,while public STI clinics are available for treatment of sympto-matic STIs. Given that STIs are often asymptomatic, manycases likely go untreated with this approach. Our analysissuggests furthermore that screening for STIs only amongHIV-infected patients who report certain behavioural riskfactors may also be insufcient, since few factors predictedSTI in the current cohort, and those factors that were associatedwith STI (sex trade and perhaps MSM) are stigmatized beha-viours that patients may not consistently report to providers.Future research could thus help clarify whether screening allHIV-infected Russians is indeed the optimal strategy, as ourdata suggest it to be, and whether screening is needed for allfour of these treatable STIs or a subset of them. Our study has several limitations. Rectal specimens, as opposed to urine samples alone, could have provided a morecomplete assessment for gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomo-niasis. The lower prevalence of chlamydia among women com-pared with men additionally raises the possibility of reducedsensitivity of the urine assay among women. Unfortunately,the available peer-reviewed report on the performance charac-teristics of the Russian chlamydia assay lists a sensitivity forurine specimens (92.3%) that was determined from male speci-mens alone; only cervical and vaginal specimens were examinedfrom women (sensitivity 87.2%) and these were not possible to obtain in the context of HERMITAGE. 16Finally, cohort eligi- bility criteria limited our ability to discern a relationshipbetween alcohol and STIs, or condom use and STIs, and mayalso limit the study's generalizability to other HIV-infectedRussians. However, these behaviours appear to be commonamong HIV-infected people in Russia; of the 921 HIV-infectedpatients who were screened for the study, only 110 did notmeet the alcohol criteria and 134 failed to meet the sex riskcriteria. In summary, STIs (gonorrhoea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis and syphilis) were common among who reported recent unprotected sex. Multivariable ana-lyses identied only sex trade involvement as a signicantpredictor of STI. Future research should investigate the preva-lence of these four common, treatable STIs in a broadersample of HIV-infected Russians, to determine whetherroutine screening for all of these STIs, rather than syphilisTable 3 Characteristics associated with STI in the nal multivariable model CharacteristicAdjusted OR 0.88 (0.54, 1.43)/C30.60 Marital status Married or living with partner 0.92 (0.54, 1.43) 0.76 Number of unprotected sexual encounters(tertiles) (0.32, 1.09) 15-483 1.12 (0.64, 1.94) Bought or sold sex in past 3 months 2.00 (1.13, 3.55) 0.02Past history of STI 1.46 (0.91, 2.35) 0.12 Men who have sex with men 2.72 (0.78, 9.49)0.12 STI\u00bcsexually transmitted infection /C3Odds ratio (OR) represents comparison of men who report sex with women only versus women Over the past three months OR is comparison of men who report any sex with men versus men who report sex with women only, over the last three months............................................................................................................................... .................Pace et al.

Perkins, MD,MSc, Jennifer R. Jorgensen, MD,MPH, Molly E. McCoy, MPH, Sharon M. Bak, MPH, Tracy A. Battaglia, MD,MPH, and Karen M. Freund, MD,MPH OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the 2006 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guidelinesfor conservative management of minimally abnormal Paptest results (atypical of undetermined lesions) and moderate dysplasia(cervical neoplasia 2) in 1) re-sulted in fewer colposcopies and loop electrosurgical exci-sion procedures (LEEPs) in adolescents or 2) resulted inunintended treatment changes in older age groups. METHODS: We analyzed data from 1,806 women aged 18 years and older attending one of six community healthcenters who were diagnosed with abnormal Pap test resultsbetween January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2008. We usedmultivariable logistic regression to examine treatment dif-ferences in women with minimally abnormal Pap test re-sults before and after guideline changes. Variables includeddate of abnormality, site of care, race or ethnicity, language,and insurance type. We used Fisher exact tests to examinerates of LEEP in patients with moderate dysplasia before and after guideline publication. RESULTS: Among 206 women aged 18-20 years, rates of colposcopy after a minimally abnormal Pap test resultdecreased from 78% (n /H11549102) line changes ( P<.001). Colposcopy among women over age 21 (n /H115491,542) remained unchanged (greater than 90%). Multivariable logistic regression indicated that bothdate of abnormality and site of care were associated withcolposcopy referral. After guideline changes, manage-ment of moderate dysplasia with LEEP in women aged18-23 55% to 18% ( P/H11549.04); rates re- mained stable in and older (70% com-pared with 74%; P/H11549.72). CONCLUSION: Health care providers quickly adopted new conservative management guidelines for low-in-come, minority adolescents, which may reduce pretermdeliveries in these high-risk populations.

ISSN: 0029-7844/12 VOL. 119, NO. 6, JUNE 2012 OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY 1157LEEPs, the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology published new clinical practiceguidelines in 2006 recommending repeated Pap test-ing instead of colposcopy for females younger than 21years old with minimally abnormal Pap test results,and repeated colposcopy instead of LEEPs for man-agement of moderate dysplasia. 11 Previous research indicated poor health care pro- vider adherence to published guidelines in the area ofcervical cancer screening. 12,13,15,16Using a database that captured the follow-up of abnormal Pap testresults in women aged 18 and older in six indepen-dent community health centers between 2004 and2008, we investigated whether conservative manage-ment recommendations in the 2006 American Societyof Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology consensusguidelines 11,14resulted in less aggressive management of minimally abnormal Pap test results and moderatedysplasia in adolescent women, and whether theguidelines had unintended treatment consequences inolder age groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our study is a secondary data analysis of the BostonPatient Navigation Research Program. The PatientNavigation Research Program was a multi-site na-tional trial that evaluated the effects of patient navi-gation, defined as providing support and guidance tovulnerable persons with cancer or abnormal cancerscreening tests, on timeliness and quality of carereceived. The Boston Patient Navigation ResearchProgram is a community-based intervention imple-mented at six of Boston's neighborhood communityhealth centers, which serve a population of approxi-mately 50,000 low-income and minority women ages18 and older. 17,18Eligible participants for the cervical cancer screening arm of the Boston Patient Naviga-tion Research Program, which constituted the totalpatient pool for the current study, included nonpreg-nant women 18 years of age and older with a cervicalcancer screening abnormality at one of the participat-ing community health centers. Patient charts werereviewed up until the point at which participantsreached a definitive diagnosis of cancer or noncanceror were lost to follow-up. Patient and clinic data werecollected from electronic medical records betweenJanuary 1, 2004, and December 31, 2008. New rec-ommendations regarding the management of abnor-mal Pap test results were published in October 2007,midway through the Boston Patient Navigator Re-search program study period, creating the opportu-nity for a natural experiment comparing managementbefore new guidelines (January 1, 2004, throughOctober 31, 2007) with management after the publi- cation of new guidelines (November 1, 2007, throughJanuary 1, 2009). This study was approved by theBoston University School of Medicine InstitutionalReview Board. Patient race and ethnicity data were collected at the time of clinical registration. For those with missingrace and ethnicity, race was imputed using languageand birth country using a cross-tab table in SAS. Fiverace-ethnicity mutually exclusive categories wereused: white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and other. Patientage was collected from the medical record at the timeof abnormal Pap test result and reported in years.Patient language was collected at the time of clinicalregistration. For those missing language, these datawere pulled from the text of the participant's medicalrecords. Insurance status was collected at the time ofregistration. Three insurance categories were used inanalyses: public, private, and uninsured. The indexabnormality for each patient was defined as theabnormal cervical cancer screening test that made thepatient eligible for the study, and it included mini-mally abnormal Pap test results (atypical collected during two distinct time periods: fromJanuary 1, 2004, through December 31, 2005, andfrom January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2008.The first time period represents baseline data collec-tion and the second represents the intervention por-tion of the patient navigation study. The patientnavigation intervention did not seek to addresswhether or not health care providers adhered to newguidelines. We examined 1) whether treatment of women aged 18-20 years with minimally abnormal Pap testresults (ASC-US HPV /H11001and LSIL) changed in re- sponse to new guidelines, specifically whether theywere more likely to receive repeat Pap tests instead ofcolposcopy after guideline changes (defined as beforeor after October 31, 2007); 2) whether treatment ofwomen ages 21 and older with minimally abnormalPap test results (ASC-US HPV /H11001and LSIL) was inadvertently affected by the guidelines, specificallywhether they were also more likely to be treated withrepeated Pap test instead of colposcopy; 3) whethertreatment of women ages 18-20 years with moderatedysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN]grade 2) changed in response to new guidelines,specifically whether they were more likely to betreated with repeated colposcopy instead of LEEPs; 1158 Perkins et al Adherence to Pap Test Guidelines OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGYand 4) whether treatment of women ages 21 and older with moderate dysplasia (CIN 2) was inadvertentlyaffected by new guidelines, specifically whether theywere also more likely to be treated with repeatedcolposcopy instead of LEEPs. To examine the out-comes related to the management of minimally ab-normal Pap test results (ASC-US HPV /H11001and LSIL), patients stratified by age into three groups: age18-20, age 21-25, and age 26 and older. Within eachage strata, we first performed univariable analyses todetermine the relationships between sociodemo-graphic and clinic characteristics of patients and theirreceipt of repeated Pap test or colposcopy. Because ofthe clinical site differences suggested in univariableanalyses, we used multivariable logistic regression toexamine adjusted effects of the guidelines, patientcharacteristics, and clinic differences on study out-come. All variables were considered for inclusion inmultivariable models. In addition, generalized esti-mating equation analysis was performed to estimatethe effect of patient-level characteristics on adherenceto guideline change while controlling for the cluster-ing effect of clinical site of care. To assess the outcomes related to the management of moderate dysplasia (CIN 2), we analyzed differencesin the completion of LEEPs before and after guidelinechanges using the Fisher exact and /H92732tests. Although guidelines recommend repeated colposcopy for womenwith moderate dysplasia (CIN 2) younger than age 21and LEEPs for women ages 21 and older, literature onregression of lesions includes women up through age25, 6,7and some health care providers may choose to defer LEEPs in nulliparous patients older than age 21.Therefore, we performed separate analyses on womenages 18-20, 21-23, 24-25, and 26 years and older. Wefound similar changes in the rates of LEEPs before andafter new guidelines in the 18-20 and 21-23 age groupsbut different treatment patterns in women older thanage 23. Because of similar management outcomes,women ages 18-23 were compared with women ages24 and older in the final analysis. Analyses were con-ducted with SAS 9.1. RESULTS A total of 1,806 women were included in the analysis;264 (15%) were aged 18-20 years, and 1,542 aged 21and older. Demographic characteristics before and afterguideline changes were similar with the exception of alarger proportion of 18- to 20-year-old patients beforethe guideline changes (15% compared with 13%) and alarger proportion of patients from smaller health centersbefore the guideline changes (17% compared with 7%from Health Center F) (Table 1).Analysis of the management of minimally abnor- mal Pap test results (ASC-US HPV /H11001and LSIL) in women younger than age 21 revealed that mosthealth care providers adopted the new guidelines.Before guideline changes, 78% of young women withminimally abnormal Pap test results (ASC-US HPV /H11001 and colposcopy, compared with45% after changes.

Women whospoke Spanish or were of Latina ethnicity were lesslikely to receive repeated Pap tests in univariableanalyses but not in multivariable analyses; 50% ofLatina patients attended health centers with lowerguideline adherence (A and D). Assignment to thecontrol or intervention arm of the patient navigationstudy was not associated with guideline adherence.The clustering analysis using generalized estimatingequations controlling for clinical site of care showedsimilar results, with a significant increase in likelihoodof receiving a Pap test instead of colposcopy afterguideline change (odds ratio 6.09, 95% confidenceinterval 2.72-13.65).

To determine the effects of guideline changes on the management of moderate dysplasia (CIN 2) inyoung women, we examined the management of allcases of moderate dysplasia (CIN 2) in our dataset(n/H11005128). Among 18-20 year olds, 6 of 16 (38%) underwent LEEPs when the initial abnormal Pap testresult occurred before guideline changes, comparedwith 0 of 3 after guideline changes ( P/H11005.52). Among 21- to 23-year-olds, 17 of 26 (65%) underwent LEEPswhen the initial abnormal Pap test result occurredbefore guideline change, compared with 2 of 8 (25%)after guideline changes ( P/H11005.10). No change was seen in women ages 24 and older: 31 of 44 (70%) under-went LEEPs before guideline changes compared with23 of 31 (74%) after guideline changes ( P/H11005.72). Be- cause women aged 18-20 and 21-23 were treatedsimilarly, we combined these age groups in ouranalysis of LEEP completion. Fisher exact analysis ofwomen aged 18-23 revealed a significant decrease inthe number of LEEPs performed, from 55% beforeguideline changes to 18% after guideline changes(P/H11005.04) (Fig. 1). DISCUSSION We used data from six community health centers serving more than 50,000 low-income and minoritywomen to determine health care provider adherenceto the 2006 American Society for Colposcopy andCervical Pathology guidelines for conservative man- test results(ASC-US HPV /H11001and LSIL) and moderate dysplasia (CIN 2) in young women. We observed an overalldecrease in the performance of colposcopies in 18- to20-year-old women with minimally abnormal Pap testresults and reduced numbers of excision proceduresin 18- to 23-year-old women with moderate dysplasiaafter publication of the guidelines. These findingsshow that the new guidelines were sufficient to changeclinical practices among this cohort of health careproviders serving an urban population of low-incomeand minority women. Existing literature highlights reasons why these guidelines may have been rapidly adopted. First,clinical practice guidelines that are based on clearscientific evidence are adhered to more frequently byhealth care providers, 19,20and a robust literature ac- cumulating over more than a decade indicated bothhigh rates of regression of HPV infection and moder-ate dysplasia (CIN 2) in young women 5-7as well as clear obstetric harms from treatment of cervical dys-plasia with excision procedures. 9,21These findings were highlighted in medical journals and at nationalmeetings including those of the American Society ofColposcopy and Cervical Pathology and the Ameri-can Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologistsbefore publication of the final consensus guidelines,thus health care providers may have been aware ofthe science underlying the guideline changes. In fact,our data indicated that some adolescents receivedrepeated Pap tests for abnormal Pap LSIL) moderate dysplasia (CIN 2) before publication ofguidelines. Another reason for rapid adoption ofguidelines may reflect the medical mantra \"first, dono harm.\" To avoid harming patients, many healthcare providers rapidly stop practices that are associ-ated with negative outcomes, a prominent examplebeing the dramatic decrease in use of postmenopausalhormone therapy after publication of the results of theWomen's Health Initiative. 22,23Therefore, clinicians aware of the obstetric complications associated withexcision procedures (LEEP and cold knife cone) mayhave been eager to adopt guidelines published withthe intent of avoiding these potentially harmful pro-cedures in young women. Multivariable analysis revealed that site of care affected the management of minimally abnormal Paptest results (ASC-US HPV /H11001and LSIL), with women attending Health Centers A and D being more likelyto receive colposcopy instead of repeated Pap testingthan were women at Health Center B.

VOL. 119, NO. 6, JUNE 2012 Perkins et al Adherence to Pap Test Guidelines 1161practice have been noted at the regional, local, and individual health care provider level,24-26and a com- bination of individual and clinical systems factors mayhave played a role in guideline adoption in this case.Although the design of this study did not specificallyexamine system factors within health centers or indi-vidual health care provider factors that may havecontributed to early or late adoption of guidelines,individual health care provider factors seem to bemost prominent based on the workflow related toabnormal Pap test result management in these clinicalsites. The six clinical sites encompassed 17 separatepractices (pediatrics, family medicine, and internalmedicine) in which 108 health care providers pro-vided primary care including Pap testing during thestudy period. In 16 of these practices, abnormal Paptest results were routed directly back to the healthcare provider who ordered the Pap test, and thatindividual made the recommendation for colposcopyor repeated Pap test. Only one practice had a referralclinician who triaged all abnormal results. Whenpatients with abnormal Pap test results were diag-nosed with moderate dysplasia (CIN 2) via colpo-scopic biopsy, the decision to perform a repeatedcolposcopy or a LEEP was made on an individualbasis by the health care provider who had taken thebiopsy. This study has several limitations related to the use of retrospective data from electronic medicalrecords. We accessed data related to the health careproviders' documentation in the patient's medicalchart and procedures ordered, but we do not knowthe extent of health care provider-patient discussionaround management options, nor the degree to whichpatient preference influenced therapeutic choices. Wealso did not collect data on patient characteristics thatmay have influenced the decision to perform aninvasive procedure, such as a history of abnormal Paptest results, human immunodeficiency infection, orprevious noncompliance with recommended follow-up. In addition, the influence of clinical site on themanagement of abnormal Pap test results could havereflected health center policy, health care providereducation, or provider or patient attitudes, factors thatcould be explored in future research. New guidelines for conservative management of minimally abnormal Pap test results and moderatecervical dysplasia in adolescents were quickly ad-opted among this group of community health centersserving low-income, urban populations. If this trend isobserved nationwide, the resulting decrease in LEEPsmay reduce racial disparities in preterm deliveries inthe future.REFERENCES 1. Kahn JA, Lan D, Kahn RS.

Prushik, Sr, PhDc,d, and Joanne M. Murabito, MD, ScMd,f,* Little is known about the familial aggregation of intermittent claudication (IC). Our objective was to examine whether parental IC increased the risk of IC in adult offspring,independent of the established cardiovascular risk factors. We evaluated the OffspringCohort Participants of the Framingham Heart Study who were >30 years old, cardiovas- cular disease free, and had both parents enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study (n /H11549 2,970 unique participants, 53% women). Pooled proportional hazards regression analysiswas used to examine whether the 12-year risk of incident IC in offspring participants wasassociated with parental IC, adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, smoking, systolic bloodpressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and antihypertensive and lipid treatment. Of the 909 person-examinations in the parental IC history group and 5,397 person-examinations in the no-parental IC history group, there were 101 incident IC events (29 withparental IC history and 72 without a parental IC history) during follow-up. The age- andgender-adjusted 12-year cumulative incidence rate per 1,000 person-years was (95%condence interval [CI] 2.74 to 7.33) and 2.34 (95% CI 1.46 to 3.19) in participants with andwithout a parental IC history. A parental history of IC signicantly increased the risk ofincident IC in the offspring (multivariable adjusted hazard ratio 1.81, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.88). Thehazard ratio was unchanged, with an adjustment for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease(hazard ratio 1.83, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.91). In conclusion, IC in parents increases the risk of ICin adult offspring, independent of the established risk factors. These data suggest a geneticcomponent of peripheral artery disease and support future research into geneticcauses. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. (Am J Cardiol 2012;109:736-741) A National Institutes of Health consensus statement has described family history as vital to patient care, because itcan uncover information about factors that contribute to therisk of developing common diseases, such as diabetes mel-litus, stroke, cancer, and heart disease. 1The occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a parent or sibling confersan increased risk of CVD in middle-age adults, distinct fromthe traditional risk factors. 2,3The parental occurrence of stroke is associated with a threefold increase in the risk ofoffspring stroke. 4However, little is known about the famil- ial aggregation of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Thesubjects whose siblings were diagnosed with prematurePAD were shown to have an almost threefold increase in PAD. 5Finally, the early onset of symptomatic CVD is more common in rst-degree relatives of patients with prematurePAD than in the relatives of healthy persons. 6The latter 2 studies were limited by the small sample size, an examina-tion of PAD prevalence rather than incidence, and an in-ability to quantify the degree of familial aggregation ofPAD that was independent of the established risk factors.The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) affords the uniqueopportunity to study intermittent claudication (IC) across 2generations using prospectively collected data in a largecommunity-based sample. The present study was under-taken to test the hypothesis that parental IC confers anincreased risk of IC in adult offspring, independent of es-tablished CVD risk factors. Methods The FHS is a prospective epidemiologic cohort study that was established in 1948 when 5,209 residents of Fra- mingham, Massachusetts, aged 28 to 62 years, were en- rolled. The members of the original cohort have undergoneexaminations every 2 years. In 1971, the offspring of theoriginal cohort (n /H110053,548) and the spouses of the offspring (n/H110051,576), aged 5 to 70 years, were enrolled into the Framingham Offspring Study. 7The offspring cohort has undergone an examination about every 4 to 8 years.

The data from 3 offspring examinations (Figure 1), each with 12 years of follow-up, were pooled: offspring exami-nation 1 (1971 to 1975), 3 (1983 to 1987), and 6 (1995 to1998). The follow-up for the nal examination ended inDecember 2007. Given the structure of the follow-up ex-aminations in the offspring, we chose to study the 12-yearincidence of IC to have a comparable length of nonoverlap-ping follow-up after each baseline examination. All off-spring participants who were /H1135030 years old at any of the 3 baseline examinations were eligible if both parents wereenrolled in the original cohort and if the Offspring partici-pant was free of CVD and IC at the examination. A total of2,970 unique subjects (1,405 men) were included in ournal study sample, including 346 with a parental history ofIC and 2,624 with both parents free of IC. Parental IC wasdened as the occurrence of IC in a parent before theoffspring examination. Both parental IC events and incidentIC events occurring in the offspring were adjudicated by apanel of 3 senior investigators using the same previouslyestablished criteria. The investigators were unaware of theparental IC status. All available information was used todetermine the presence of IC, including the standardizedphysician-administered IC questionnaire that was a part ofeach routine FHS research clinic visit, any available recordsfrom the ofce visits with the participants' personal health-care provider, and the hospital records pertaining to PAD. 8 The standardized physician-administered questionnaireasked about the presence of calf and leg discomfort broughton by exertion, the relation of the discomfort to the rapidityof walking or uphill walking, and whether the symptomswere relieved with rest. The nal diagnosis of IC wasdetermined from the clinical history only, without conr-matory testing. At the more contemporary FHS examina-tions, the participants were queried about lower extremityrevascularization procedures and all self-reports were vali-dated from the medical records. At each offspring examination, the risk factors weredirectly measured and the occurrence of CVD was updated.Blood pressure at rest was measured twice. Current smokingwas dened as smoking /H113501 cigarettes/day in the year pre- ceding the examination. Blood was drawn, with the patientin the fasting state, for total cholesterol, high-density lipo-protein cholesterol, and triglyceride measurements. Diabe-tes was dened as a fasting glucose level of /H11350126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L) or the use of insulin or oral hypoglycemicagents. CVD was dened as any of the coronary insufciency, angina pec-toris, stroke, transient ischemic attack, congestive heart fail-ure, or cardiovascular death. The follow-up time within each 12-year period was cal- culated as the interval from each baseline visit date until thediagnosis date of IC for those participants who developedthe disease and censored at the earliest of the date of the lastexamination, date of death, or end of the 12-year period forparticipants who did not develop the disease. The age- andgender-adjusted incidence rates and 95% condence inter-vals (CIs) per 1,000 person-years were calculated in eachparental IC history group by dividing the number of ICevents observed by the total person-years. The Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to plot andcompare the cumulative incidence rates. Pooled propor-tional hazards regression analyses were used to examinewhether the 12-year risk of incident IC in offspring wasassociated with parental IC. This method of pooling person-examinations provides estimates of the effect similar to atime-dependent Cox proportional hazards model. 9Further - more, this method allowed us to update the risk factors andparental IC at each examination. The hazard ratios (HRs)and 95% CIs were calculated with the reference groupconsisting of participants with no parental IC before theexamination. The covariates used in the multivariablemodel included age, gender, diabetes, current smoking, sys-tolic blood pressure, antihypertensive treatment, total cho-lesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and choles-terol lowering treatment.

First, we used Cox models in which CVD was entered as a time-dependent covariate.Next, the follow-up time was censored when an Offspringparticipant developed any CVD event to account for the factthat CVD increases the risk of IC. To assess the incrementalpredictive utility of parental IC history associated with in-cident IC in the offspring, we calculated the c-statistic forthe model with clinical covariates alone and the full modelwith clinical covariates and parental IC history. 10,11We assessed the model calibration (i.e., concordance of ob-served risk and that predicted by the model with parental IChistory) by calculating the Hosmer-Lemeshow Chi-squaredstatistic for the Cox models. 10,11To evaluate whether the inclusion of parental IC history improved the risk classi-cation of participants, we calculated the enhanced \"net re-classication improvement\" (NRI) using an extension tosurvival analysis that uses Kaplan-Meier estimates of eventprobabilities at 12 years. 11We used 12-year IC risk thresh - olds of/H110212%, 2% to 5%, and /H110225% for the NRI index. The NRI is used to assess how well a new marker \"reclassies\"patients from 1 risk category to another. Because no categoriesfor the absolute risk of IC have been previously established, wealso assessed the \"category-less\" NRI, which assesses anyupward or downward reclassication. Values /H110220 correspond to improved reclassication. 12We performed a secondary analysis dening the incident events in the Offspring as IC andor lower extremity revascularization.

The group of participants with parental history of IC was older (mean age 49.9 vs 47.6years, p /H110210.0001) and, with the exception of current smok- ing, had signicantly greater risk factor levels compared tothe group of participants without a parental history of IC.During the follow-up period, 101 incident IC events (29 inparticipants with a parental history of IC and 72 in partic-ipants with no parental history of IC) occurred. The age- andgender-adjusted 12-year cumulative incidence rate per1,000 person-years was 5.08 (95% CI 2.74 to 7.33) inparticipants with a parental history of IC and 2.34 (95% CI1.46 to 3.19) in participants with no parental history of IC(log-rank test, p /H110210.0001; Figure 2). Parental IC was asso- ciated with a signicantly increased risk of incident IC inoffspring (age- and gender-adjusted HR 2.29). The associ-ation was modestly attenuated but remained signicant afteradjustment for traditional risk factors (multivariable-ad-justed HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.88; Table 2). The asso- ciation was unchanged after additional adjustment for in-terim CVD and the magnitude and signicance of the effectof parental IC persisted in the analysis in which the fol-low-up time was censored when the offspring participantdeveloped an incident CVD event (Table 2). The addition ofparental IC history to a multivariable model incorporatingthe baseline covariates increased the already not signicantly differentstatistically (p /H110050.22). The model with parental IC history had excellent calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow Chi-squared14.07; p /H110050.20). The to The essentially unchanged, with adjustment for theoccurrence of CVD entered as a time-dependent covariateor in a model in which the follow-up time was censoredwhen a participant developed any CVD event. The associ-ation between parental IC and incident PAD, dened as ICand/or lower extremity revascularization (n /H11005114 events), was very similar to the primary analysis (multivariable-adjusted HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.72; additional CVD 95%CI occurrence ofCVD [HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.97] did not substantivelychange the association). Discussion In our community-based sample, parental IC confers a nearly twofold increased risk of IC in adult offspring even after accounting for traditional risk factors and the interimoccurrence of CVD. Parental history of IC is quite powerfulin predicting IC in adult offspring; however, the smallimprovement in the c-statistic and category-based NRI sug-gested a modestly improved prediction of offspring IC be-yond that of the established risk factors. Our results suggestthe presence of a genetic predisposition to IC. However, inaddition to the genetic factors, environmental and lifestylefactors shared within families can contribute to the suscep-tibility to common diseases. 13A person's family history provides a readily accessible and important clinical tool togain insight into a person's risk of developing disease,including PAD. Knowledge of one's family history has thepotential to motivate positive lifestyle changes, enhanceindividual empowerment, and influence clinical decisionswith respect to preventative interventions. 1This might be especially important for PAD, a disease that is often unde-tected and undertreated by clinicians 14and underappreci - ated by the lay public for its association with the risk ofmyocardial infarction, stroke, and death. 15 Little is known concerning the genetic determinants of PAD, but family aggregation and heritability estimates sug-gest signicant - zaras and Zdoukopoulos18created a publically available database that catalogs the genetic association studies ofPAD. However, to date, the genetic associations for PADremain inconclusive, with no strongly replicated results. 19 The genetic susceptibility to PAD and CVD is likely con-ferred by multiple genes interacting with a variety of envi-ronmental factors. Although PAD might share some geneticvariants with CVD, likely a set of genetic variants exists thatare unique to PAD, given the phenotypic diversity acrossthe vascular system. 19 Genome-wide association studies have identied a strongly replicated association between variants on chromo-some chromosome locus appears to play a broad role in arterial disease, because it is also associatedwith atherosclerotic locus was associated with clinically diagnosed PAD;however, the relation was no longer present when the cor-onary artery disease cases were removed from the sample. 24 Recently, this locus was reported to be associated with agreater prevalence of PAD and a lower mean arterial bra-chial index level in older adults from 3 population-basedsamples that was independent of risk factors and persistedeven after removal of those with myocardial infarction. 25 The genome-wide association approach successfully iden-tied genetic variants on chromosome 15q24 for nicotinedependence that conferred the risk of PAD. 26Thus, theTable 2 Twelve-year risk of intermittent claudication (IC) by parental occurrenceof intermittent claudication (IC) Model HR 95% CI p Value Age and gender adjusted 2.29 1.49-3.54 0.0002Multivariable adjusted* 1.81 1.14-2.88 0.01Multivariable plus cardiovascular disease Multivariable plus censor for interim cardiovascular disease1.92 1.16-3.19 0.01 * Multivariable model adjusted for following covariates: age, gender, diabetes, current cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, antihyperten-sive treatment, total cholesterol, high-density as Risk Factorgenetic variants identied appeared to influence the risk of PAD through shared biologic mechanisms for CVD andsmoking-related behaviors. Additionally, in a recent studyof 1,292 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, the abdominal aortic aneurysm and PAD. 27No association was found between this gene and the CVD risk factors,suggesting an independent genetic predisposition exists. 27 Using a murine hind limb ischemia model of PAD, Dokun et al28identied genetic influences on PAD disease severity. Additional work is needed to elucidate the genesresponsible for the association and their human orthologs.One study, using microarray analysis of femoral artery spec-imens, elucidated /H11022400 genes that are either up- or down- regulated in patients with severe atherosclerosis. 29Another similar study demonstrated that many of the genes involvedin atherosclerosis are also involved in lipid synthesis andimmune function pathways. 30A clinical investigation that leads to the elucidation of the genetic basis of PAD mightprovide potential targets for future focused gene therapies. Several strengths and limitations of the present study merit comment. The FHS is a large, community-based sam-ple, with the data collected prospectively from both parentsand offspring. The symptoms of IC were adjudicated by apanel of senior investigators using well-established criteria,and the risk factors were directly measured, rather thanobtained by self-report from the participants, which couldbe subject to misclassication. Most FHS participants wereof white, European ancestry, limiting the generalizability ofthe results to those from other race/ethnic backgrounds. Thediagnosis of IC is determined by symptoms alone, withoutconrmatory testing; thus, some of the participants with ICin the present study might not have had PAD. In contrast,only about 50% of those with PAD have leg pain symptoms.The risk factors used for adjustment in the multivariablemodels were from a single-occasion measurement andmight not represent an assessment of lifetime risk factorexposure. Hence, it is possible that the effect of a parentalhistory of IC on the personal risk of IC might have beenoverestimated. Residual confounding might be present inthat the parental history might reflect a low social class,passive smoking, diet, or sedentary behaviors that we werenot able to account for in our study. 1.

Cross-sectional analyses were conducted with baseline data from 415 male participants enrolled in a randomized HIV intervention clinical trial [the HERMITAGE Study]. Participants were HIV-infected men reporting recent heavy alcohol use and unprotected sex in St. Petersburg,Russia.

Keywords: HIV; Russia; IPV; substance use; STI Introduction More than one-third of women in Russia have been victims of male partner-perpetrated intimate partner violence and victims of IPV are at increased risk for contracting HIV (World HealthOrganization [WHO], 2005). Mechanisms for the association between IPV and HIV include both greater sexual risk taking (e.g., sex trade involvement,non-use of condoms) and substance use (e.g., injec- tion drug use, risky sex while intoxicated) among victims of IPV, according to findings from Russia(Kalichman et al., 2000; Zhan et al., 2012), Ukraine (Dude, 2007), South Africa (Jewkes, Dunkle, Nduna, et al., 2006), and the USA (Bogart et al., 2005; Dude,2007; El-Bassel, Witte, Wada, Gilbert, & Wallace, 2001; El-Bassel, Wu, Go, & Hill, 2005a;Panchanadeswaran et al., 2010; Schmuel & Schenker,1998; Silverman et al., 2011; Silverman, Raj, Mucci,& Hathaway, 2001). However, research from Russiaand elsewhere also indicate that male perpetrators ofIPV are more likely to engage in risky sex (e.g.,concurrent sex partnering, non-use of condoms,buying sex) and substance use et &Silverman, 2008; Decker, Kapur, Gup-ta, & Raj, 2007; Zhan et al., 2012). Longitudinalstudies with women and men in the US furtherindicate the bidirectional nature of these associations *Corresponding University] at 11:45 06 February 2013 (El-Bassel, Gilbert, Wu, Go, & Hill, 2005b; Gilbert, El-Bassel, Wu, & Chang, 2007). Little of this researchhas focused on HIV-infected populations outside theUS and in Eastern Europe, and may have growingimportance given Russia's increasingly heterosexuallydriven epidemic (Goliusov et al., 2008). Thus, thisstudy assesses lifetime IPV perpetration and its association with STI and high risk sexual behaviors among a sample of male HIV-infected substanceusers in St. Petersburg, Russia. Methods This study involved a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from male participants of a randomizedclinical trial of an HIV risk reduction intervention forHIV-infected risky drinkers in Russia (the HERMI-TAGE Study). Between July 2007 and April 2010, eligible adults were enrolled from four HIV or substance use clinical sites and one needle exchangeprogram in St. Petersburg, Russia. Trained researchassociates recruited participants; those indicatinginterest were escorted into a private room to assesseligibility and to obtain informed consent. Subse-quent to consent, trained staff conducted the baselinesurveyassessment;urineandbloodsampleswerethen collected for STI testing. Baseline incentives of 300 rubles (US$7) were provided. Of 921 individualsscreened, 732 were eligible, and 700 agreed toparticipate. Analyses involved data from men(n/C30415), all men reported female sex partners. Institutional Review Boards of Boston UniversityMedical Campus and Pavlov State Medical Univer-sity approved this study. Measures Single items assessed subjects' age, marital status, education, incarceration, employment status, andwhether the participant was currently on anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Past 30-day drinking andbinge drinking (5 /C27drinks per day) were assessed using the 30-day Timeline Follow Back (Sobell &Sobell, 1992, 1996). Past 30-day injection drug use(IDU) was assessed using an item from the Risk BehaviorSurvey(RBS)(Petry,2001;Weatherbyetal., 1994). Our primary independent variable, IPV perpetration , was assessed via three items based on the Conflict Tactics Scale-2 (Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, & Sugarman, partner with violence, pushed orshoved partner or threw something at partner''),sexualIPVperpetration(''insistedonormadepartner have sex with him''), and causing injury due to IPV(''injured partner during a fight''). A subject was classified as ''yes'' for IPV perpetration if a positiveresponse was recorded for any of the three items. STI ever, our primary outcome, was assessed via surveyitemsonwhethertheparticipanthadeverbeendiagnosed with each of the following: syphilis,gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Trichomonas, genital warts, and genital herpes. Current STI , our secondary out- come, was assessed via biologic testing of urine andblood samples for gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Trichomo-nas, and syphilis (see Pace et al., in press for details). In terms of sex risk behaviors, our secondary outcomes of interest, subjects provided detailed in-formation about their sexual partners in the past 90days (Kalichman et al., 2001). For each of their five most recent partners in this period, starting with the mostrecent, participants wereaskedaboutnumber ofsexualepisodesandcondomuseduringtheseepisodes,as well as number of episodes involving drug oralcohol use prior to sex (past 30 days). They werethenaskedaboutanyothersexpartnersbeyondfiveinthe past 90 days using these same questions. Theseitems were used to create the following additional secondary outcomes: number of unprotected sex episodes in the past 90 days, multiple sex partners (2/C27) in the past 90 days, and substanceusebeforesex in the past 30 days. Sex trade involvement items weretaken from the Risk Assessment Battery (RAB)(Navaline et al., 1994); one item asked about buying sexwith money or drugs in the past 90 days. Data analysis Descriptive statistics were obtained for demo- graphics, ART, sex risk behaviors, substance usebehaviors, and STI for the overall sample andstratified by IPV perpetration status. Bivariateassociations were assessed via chi-squared analyses, t-tests, or the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. To assess associations between IPVperpetration and dichotomous STI and sex riskbehavior outcomes, simple logistic regression ana-lyses as well as multiple logistic regressions analysesadjusted for demographics (age, marital status, andeducation), ART, and substance use (binge alcoholuse and IDU) were conducted. Crude and adjusted overdispersed Poisson regression analyses were used to assess associations between IPV perpetration andthe number of unprotected sex episodes. Odds ratios(ORs) are reported for logistic regression models andincidence rate ratios (IRRs) are reported for Poissonregression models; 95% CIs were used to determinesignificance. Statistical analyses were performed byusing SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).2A. Rajet al. Downloaded by [Boston University] at 11:45 06 February 2013 Results Sample ( N/C30415) were aged 20 /C157 years; 20.7% had not completed high school, and 48.4% had a historyofincarceration.Mostofparticipants(81.0%) reportedpast30-daybingealcoholuse,and42.7%hadinjected drugs in this same timeframe. Half of parti- cipants (50.1%) reported alcohol or drug use before sexinthepast30days,andoneineighthadboughtsexin the past 90 days. More than 1 in 10 men (11.8%) currently had an STI; 41.0% had a history of a STI diagnosis. Almost half of participants (46%, n/C30189) reported a history of IPV perpetration (Table 1). due to IPV perpetration. Associations between IPV and STI and sex risk behaviors Adjusted regression analyses demonstrated that life- time IPV perpetration is associated with a higherodds a lifetime STI (AOR /C301.58, 95% CI/C301.04, 2.39), but (AOR /C300.50, 95% CI /C300.26, 0.96) (Table 2). No significant associations between lifetime IPV perpe-tration and sex risk behaviors were observed inadjusted analyses. Discussion Almost half of study participants reported a history of IPV perpetration, a percentage higher than that seen in other studies of men from Russia (Lysova &Hines, 2008; Serbanescu & Goodwin, 2005; WHO,2011; Zhan et al., 2012), and may be attributable tohaving an HIV-infected and risky drinking sample.Previous research from Russia and elsewhere docu-ments a strong association between IPV perpetrationand substance use, particularly alcohol use (Lysova & Hines, 2008; WHO, 2011; Zhan et al., 2011, 2012). History of IPV perpetration may also be dispropor-tionatelyrepresentedamongmenwithHIVinRussia,a finding seen in South Africa and India (Dunkleet al., 2006; Silverman et al., 2007). Of note, theproportion of IPV perpetration among HIV-infectedsubstance users in Russia is consistent with findingsfrom a sample of HIV-infected IDUs (Frye et al., 2007), highlighting the relevance of considerations of IPV perpetration in this population of men.

However, un- expectedly, history of IPV perpetration was notassociated with current sexual risk behaviors andwas negatively associated with current STI. These findings may in part be attributable to use of a lifetime IPV perpetration variable, which correspondsmore directly to ever STI than current STI or recentsex risk behaviors, as such behaviors may change for men over time. Future research should examine whether recent IPV predicts current STI and sexrisk behaviors in this population. Study limitations include reliance on self-report of stigmatizing behaviors and STI over an ''ever'' time- frame; these data used are subject to recall and social desirability biases. Our IPV assessment had feweritems than the standard version, which may haveresulted in underreporting. Use of differing time frames across some of our variables of interest (e.g., lifetime IPV perpetration, unprotected sex in past 90days) likely affected some study findings. Cross-sectional data analyses do not allow an interpretation of the findings in terms of causality, and many potential relevant covariates such as knowledge andattitudes were not able to be considered by theseanalyses. Finally, the study may be limited in generalizability based on its focus on HIV-infected male risky drinkers recruited largely through healthsystems in the context of St. Petersburg, Russia.Despite limitations, study findings in conjunction with above described prior research document thatIPV perpetration histories are a major concern among male HIV-infected risky drinkers in Russia and worthy of study with regard to their associationwith HIV acquisition and transmission in this national context.

CMECME ABSTRACT The elimination of cancer disparities is critically important for lessening the burden of breast cancer (BC). Patient nav-igator programs (PNPs) have been shown to improve ratesof BC screening in underserved communities, but there is adearth of evidence regarding their benefits after the actualdiagnosis of BC. We retrospectively examined sociodemo-graphic characteristics, disease characteristics, and con-cordance to quality measures (QMs) of BC care amongwomen participating in a PNP that services disadvantagedminority communities in the greater Boston area. Of the186 PNP patients diagnosed with BC in 2001-2011 in threeneighborhood community health centers, treatment datawas available for 158 (85%) and race and disease stage in-formation was available for 149 (80%). Regarding stage,25% were diagnosed with in situ cancer, 32% had stage 1, 25% had stage 2, 13% had stage 3, and 5% had stage 4 BC.Guideline-indicated care was received by 70 of 74 patients(95%) for the hormonal therapy QM, 15 of 17 (88%) pa-tients for the chemotherapy QM, and 65 of 71 (92%) pa-tients for the radiation QM, all similar to publishedconcordance rates at elite National Comprehensive CancerNetwork institutions. These findings suggest that PNPsmay facilitate evidence-based quality care for vulnerablepopulations. Future research should prospectively analyzequality metrics to assess measures to improve the processand outcomes of patient navigation in diverse underservedsettings, compared with control non-navigated popula-tions.

Although there was a 14% decrease in cancer-relateddeaths over the years 1991-2004, racial and ethnic minoritypatients continue to die disproportionately from cancer, com-pared with their white counterparts, even after adjusting for in-surance status and income [1]. There is increasing evidencethat the disconnect between discoveries in cancer care andtheir timely delivery to all Americans contributes to cancer dis-parities. Solutions to improve the equity of cancer care deliv-ery are desperately needed [2]. Patient navigation programs (PNPs) have emerged as a po- tential solution for improving cancer care delivery [3, 4]. PNPsfacilitate access to quality medical care by identifying barriersto care and by bridging gaps in care through culturally sensi-tive coordination. Patient navigators are resources for patientsand providers and may assist with all phases of access, includ-ing primary cancer prevention, screening and follow-up care,cancer treatment, and survivorship care [5]. Extensive data have established the efficacy of navigation in improving the timeliness and receipt of cancer screening anddiagnostic care after an abnormal screening test [6-11]. How-ever, it is unknown whether or not PNPs improve patient careand outcomes following the actual diagnosis of cancer. Wesought to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients enrolled inthe Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Avon Breast CareProgram (MABCP) based on evidence-based national qualitymeasures. The MABCP provides patient navigation services toracially and ethnically diverse communities seeking care atfour federally qualified health centers in the greater Bostonarea, and thus represent a population vulnerable for poor can-cer outcomes. METHODS We performed a retrospective chart review of all 186 women di-agnosed with breast cancer who participated in the MABCP in2001-2011. Since its inception in 2001, the MABCP has servedfour community health centers and has provided primary screen-ing services and diagnostic follow-up of abnormal screening ex-aminations for /H110114,000 patients. Of these 4,000 patients, 186 patients (4.7%) were diagnosed with breast cancer. Patients in need of routine screening mammography are re- ferred to the MABCP by their community health center pri-mary care physician. The patient navigators automaticallyenroll all patients at these centers who have abnormal screen- ing examinations and require diagnostic follow-up examina-tions. MABCP navigators follow the community healthworker model [5] and are trained lay workers who are cultur-ally diverse and generally representative of the populationserved by their community health center. Languages spoken bythe navigators include Spanish, Bosnian, and Portuguese. Most patients received their subsequent cancer care at ei- ther MGH or Boston Medical Center. Institutional reviewboard approval was obtained at both sites. Sociodemographicdata and treatment data were obtained by review of patientcharts within the respective electronic medical records.Descriptive statistics were used to analyze baseline so- ciodemographic characteristics. Clinical outcomes were ana-lyzed using data abstracted from electronic medical records.Two physicians collected data using a chart abstraction formand entered the data into a secure Microsoft /H23041Excel database. Abstracted clinical data were used to examine concordancewith American Society of Clinical Oncology/National Com-prehensive Cancer Network (ASCO/NCCN) quality measures. Quality Measures Three ASCO/NCCN quality measures based on NCCN level 1evidence were analyzed to determine quality of cancer care.These included: (a) hormonal therapy within 1 year of diagno-sis of hormone receptor (HR) /H11001tumors/H110221 cm, (b) chemother-Table 1.

Descriptive statistics were used to report patient character- istics and determine the proportion of navigated patients whohad documented care that was in concordance with these threequality metrics. Concordance data for these quality measuresacross all NCCN institutions were used as a benchmark forMABCP patients [12]. Concordance rates between MABCPpatients and NCCN institution patients were compared using /H92732analyses. RESULTS Self-reported sociodemographic data, including language spo-ken, age, insurance status, and level of education of MABCPpatients diagnosed with breast cancer was available for the 186patients in the MABCP. Missing data were attributed to pa-tients declining to report these characteristics. In terms of raceand ethnicity, 60% of the patients in the program were non-white black, Hispanic, and Asian or Middle Eastern. Forty-three percent of MABCP patients were non-English speaking.Twenty-one percent were either uninsured or were enrolledin Medicaid or Free Care. Thirty-seven percent had highschool or general educational development education orgreater (Table 1). Of the 186 MABCP patients diagnosed with breast cancer, treatment data were available for 158 (85%) and race andbreast cancer stage information was available for 149 (80%)(Table 2). In terms of stage of disease at diagnosis, 25% werediagnosed with in situ cancer, 32% had stage 1, 25% had stage2, 13% had stage 3, and 5% had stage 4 breast cancer. Althoughthere were no obvious differences between racial or ethnic groups with regard to breast cancer stage, the numbers are toosmall to make direct statistical comparisons. In our limited da-taset, black patients appeared to be diagnosed with stage 3 dis-ease more frequently than white patients. In terms of diseasecharacteristics (data not shown), 91% of the navigated patientshad HR /H11001disease and 10% of the patients had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive disease. QMs Table 3 illustrates concordance with ASCO/NCCN qualitymeasure among MABCP patients compared with concordancerates for patients who received breast cancer care at NCCN in-stitutions. For the hormonal therapy quality measure, 95% ofthe MABCP patients received hormonal therapy within 1 yearof diagnosis for HR /H11001tumors/H110221 cm. For the chemotherapy quality measure, 88% of the patients in the MABCP receivedchemotherapy within 120 days of diagnosis of HR /H11002breast can- cer/H110221 cm. For the radiation quality measure, 92% of the pa- tients received postlumpectomy radiation therapy. Theseconcordance rates are comparable with rates from eight NCCNcenters, largely viewed as elite cancer centers in the U.S. [12].There was no significant difference ( p/H11022.05) between MABCP patients and NCCN patients with regard to each of thequality measures. Upon detailed review of the treatment re-cords of MABCP patients, patients received standard adjuvantchemotherapy regimens such doxorubicin, cyclophosph-amide followed by paclitaxel, and plus cyclophos-phamide. With regard to endocrine therapy, the propermedication was prescribed to patients. For example, tamoxifenwas prescribed for premenopausal patients and aromatase in-hibitors were prescribed for postmenopausal patients. DISCUSSION In this study, we demonstrated that breast cancer patients whoreceived navigation services received high-quality cancer care,as defined by concordance with ASCO/NCCN quality mea-sures. These navigated patients also had a favorable breast can-cer stage distribution, with /H1102250% having in situ or stage 1 disease, similar to that of white women reported by the Sur-veillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program [13]. Thisstaging profile is also comparable with that of the white breastcancer population in Massachusetts as reported by the Massa-chusetts Cancer Registry [14, 15]. Our findings are particularlyTable 2.

Much of the patient navigation literature addressing the care of cancer patients focuses on improving screening ratesand the diagnostic management of abnormal screening results[9, 16, 17]. Most studies have shown better outcomes when pa-tients receive patient navigation services. However, evidencethat PNPs improve clinical outcomes after a cancer diagnosisis lacking. Arguably, patient navigation is equally, if not more,important after a cancer diagnosis given the logistical com-plexities and financial burdens of cancer treatment such as che-motherapy or radiation. In our patient population, 15% of thepatients opted for treatment at other institutions, and thereforetheir treatment data were unavailable. However, among thosepatients with available data, at least 87% received care that ad-hered to guidelines. Some reports suggest that patient naviga-tion after a cancer diagnosis improves patient satisfaction andreduces barriers to care [18, 19]. Guadagnolo and colleaguesshowed that patient navigation led to fewer cancer treatmentinterruptions and higher rates of clinical trial enrollmentamong Native American cancer patients, compared with his-torical controls [20]. Ell and colleagues showed that cancertreatment adherence was better than in historical controlsamong patients who received navigation services [21]. Ourstudy offers additional data to support the efficacy of PNPs forpatients diagnosed with cancer. Our finding of a high concordance with level 1 ASCO/ NCCN quality measures has important implications for the un-derserved and vulnerable patients diagnosed with breastcancer. These level 1 quality measures are based on random-ized controlled clinical trials. Our data suggest that patient nav-igation may offer an effective strategy to overcome barriersthat interfere with access to quality cancer care for underservedcommunities. Major weaknesses of our study are that it was a retrospec- tive analysis and data regarding the outcomes of 15% of thepatients are missing. Fifteen percent of MABCP patientselected to receive their cancer care at institutions other thanMGH or Boston Medical Center, and therefore we lack treat-ment data for these patients. However, their sociodemographicdata otherwise closely matched those of the patients for whomwe do have treatment data, suggesting that their treatment ex-perience may match that of the larger population. Anotherweakness of our study is the extent of missing data, particularly with respect to education and insurance status. Our cohort maybe disproportionately influenced by more highly educated andinsured patients, leading to selection bias. Another weaknessof this study is the lack of a closely matched control group thatdid not receive patient navigation. Similar studies in the liter- ature often use historical controls as a reference group, but thisstrategy also has weaknesses, including the inability to accountfor improved outcomes with modern cancer therapies. Weused data from patients receiving treatment at NCCN centersduring the same time period as the benchmark to demonstratethat our navigated patients received similar quality care. Fi-nally, another weakness of the study is the relatively smallnumber of women diagnosed with breast cancer ( n/H11005186) within the MABCP, making it difficult to draw definitive con-clusions about this population. Despite these weaknesses, our findings provide objective evidence that vulnerable populations may indeed receive qual-ity cancer care when enrolled in a PNP, further prioritizing theneed for rigorous research, ideally large, multicenter, prospec-tive, randomized, controlled trials of patient navigation in pa-tients diagnosed with cancer. Such trials are currently underway at the nine sites participating in the National Cancer Insti-tute (NCI) Patient Navigation Research Program [22]. How-ever, these trials are primarily enrolling patients for cancerscreening, not after a cancer diagnosis. Additionally, the issueof randomizing patients to an intervention that is intuitivelybeneficial versus control (no intervention) raises ethical con-siderations. However, this national effort will provide insightinto the role of patient navigation after a breast cancer diagno-sis and, importantly, will allow evaluation of the cost-effec-tiveness of this approach [23, 24]. In conclusion, we have shown that patient navigation can lead to high-quality breast cancer care, as measured by concor-dance with national guidelines, among an underserved vulner-able population in an urban setting. Further research is neededto examine other metrics of quality care that may be improvedwith patient navigation during cancer treatment.

To evaluate projects such as PNRP, it is desirable to perform a pooled analysis to increase power relative to the individual projects. There is no agreed upon prospective methodology, however, for analyzing combined data arising from different study designs.

Methods\u2014 The Design and Analysis Committee critically reviewed the pros and cons of five potential methods for analyzing combined PNRP project data. Conclusions were based on simple consensus. The five approaches reviewed included: 1) Analyzing and reporting each project separately, 2) Combining data from all projects and performing an individual-level analysis, 3) Pooling data from projects having similar study designs, 4) Analyzing pooled data using a prospective meta analytic technique, 5) Analyzing pooled data utilizing a novel simulated group randomized design. Results\u2014 Methodologies varied in their ability to incorporate data from all PNRP projects, to appropriately account for differing study designs, and in their impact from differing project sample sizes. Limitations\u2014 The conclusions reached were based on expert opinion and not derived from actual analyses performed. Conclusions\u2014 The ability to analyze pooled data arising from differing study designs may provide pertinent information to inform programmatic, budgetary, and policy perspectives. Multi- site community-based research may not lend itself well to the more stringent explanatory and pragmatic standards of a randomized controlled trial design. Given our growing interest in community-based population research, the challenges inherent in the analysis of heterogeneous study design are likely to become more salient. Discussion of the analytic issues faced by the PNRP and the methodological approaches we considered may be of value to other prospective community-based research programs. Keywords Patient navigation; Health disparities; Pooled analysis; Research methodology Introduction Patient navigation is a promising approach to reduce cancer disparities and refers to support and guidance offered to persons with abnormal cancer screening or a new cancer diagnosis in order to more effectively access the cancer care system. 1 The primary goals of navigation are to help patients overcome barriers to care and facilitate timely, quality care provided in a culturally sensitive manner. Patient navigation is intended to target those who are most at risk for delays in care, including individuals from racial and ethnic minority and lower income populations. Although patient navigation is an intervention that has clearly grown in popularity over the past decade, rigorous research on the efficacy of patient navigation is still new.2 A number of studies conducted on patient navigation have been recently summarized.2, 3 Patient navigation has generally shown improvements in timeliness of definitive diagnosis and initiation of cancer care. To date, there have been no published multicenter studies assessing patient navigation. The Patient Navigation Research Program (PNRP) is the first multi-center program to critically examine the role and benefits of patient navigation. This program is sponsored and funded by the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CRHCD), with additional support from the American Cancer Society. The five-year program focuses on four common cancers (breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate) with screening tests having evidence of disparate outcomes in underserved populations.Roetzheim et al. Page 2 Clin Trials . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 11. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptThe PNRP is a cooperative effort of nine research projects (see Figure 1), the funding agencies, and an evaluation contractor. Each PNRP project focuses on one or more of the four specified cancers. All projects targeted populations at greater risk of disparate cancer outcomes, such as racial or ethnic minorities, the uninsured or underinsured, or persons of lower socioeconomic status. As a cooperative endeavor, the PNRP utilizes a steering committee consisting of the nine project principal investigators, along with representatives from NCI-CRCHD, the American Cancer Society, and NOVA Research Company (NOVA), the evaluation contractor for the national outcomes studies. In order to advise the steering committee on methodological issues, a design and analysis committee was created composed of investigators having expertise in research design and methods from each project site, NOVA, and NCI-CRCHD. The cooperative agreement did not require a uniform research design across all projects. This allowed for flexibility in implementing the patient navigation intervention that would be sensitive both to the specific patient populations as well as local system-level factors at each project. In addition, the nature of patient navigation requires involvement of the community with development of the research strategy in collaboration with community partners. Thus, each project had its own research design that included traditional randomized clinical trials (RCT), group-randomized trials (GRT), and non-randomized quasi- experimental designs (QE). Despite the differences in research designs, all projects included characteristics specified by the steering committee, in order to support a single common evaluation of the PNRP. For example, all projects utilized a common definition of patient navigation and navigators received common national training in this role. In addition, all study designs share common well-defined outcomes with data elements from a single detailed data dictionary. Navigation was hypothesized to shorten the time interval from cancer screening abnormality to definitive diagnosis (primary outcome) and for patients diagnosed with cancer, the time interval from definitive diagnosis through initial cancer treatment as well as improving satisfaction with care. Each project assessed these time intervals by medical record abstraction and the common data elements from all projects were uploaded to a national database to support a single common evaluation of the PNRP. While each PNRP project was individually powered to address its hypotheses, a pooled analysis was desirable for many reasons. First, the increased statistical power from pooling data allows a more precise estimate of navigation effects across a variety of settings. In addition, while cancer screening abnormalities are common in primary medical care settings, cancer diagnoses are rare. The ability to address the hypothesis that navigation improves cancer care is strengthened by pooling data across projects to increase statistical power. Pooling of data also increases statistical power to explore navigation effects within patient subgroups at greater risk of adverse cancer outcomes (uninsured, racial-ethnic minorities, and persons of lower socioeconomic status). Pooling increases the generalizability of the findings by demonstrating the effect across a variety of settings and populations. Finally, pooling data enables exploration of heterogeneity of navigation effects (contrasting models of navigation for example), something that is not possible within individual PNRP projects. For these reasons, a pooled analysis to evaluate the overall PNRP was desirable. The design and structure of PNRP, however, created a challenge in developing a suitable analytic method to evaluate the overall program. The PNRP was clearly different from standard multicenter trials that utilize a single study design with common shared protocols at all centers. In addition, while there was a common definition of navigation, its delivery couldRoetzheim et al. Page 3 Clin Trials . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 11. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptdiffer among the PNRP projects. The design variations across the distinct projects do not lend themselves to traditional methods for analyzing data from a multi-center research trial. Other fields, notably epidemiology, have recognized the need to analyze pooled data arising from heterogeneous study designs.4, 5 These efforts generally involve retrospective analysis of published studies. To our knowledge, however, there is no agreed upon methodology for analyzing combined data arising from different study designs a priori or before each project has published their primary results, as opposed to retrospective analyses. The Design and Analysis Committee was therefore charged with the task of reviewing potential methodologies for analyzing combined data from PNRP projects. This review took place over a series of conference calls and the results of this assessment are presented below. In the following section, we describe each of the PNRP projects in more detail, and discuss five possible approaches that could be employed in this situation, including the pros and cons of each approach. Methods Summary of PNRP Research Designs The PNRP is a collaborative effort involving nine separate research projects (Table 1). Eight of the nine sites contributed data to the national dataset. The ninth site focused solely on the American Indian / Alaska Native population of the northwestern US, and the data sharing agreements are specific to that setting. Each project designed the implementation of its intervention taking into account factors that were unique to their health care delivery system and patient population. Some projects were able to employ true experimental designs, while others implemented variations of quasi-experimental designs. Four projects \u00b1 Denver, Ohio, Rochester and Tampa \u00b1 implemented true experimental designs, using random assignment of either individuals or clinics to the Intervention or Control conditions. Given adequate sample size, random assignment allows the analysis to make the assumption that treatment conditions formed through this process are equivalent, and observed differences between control and intervention treatment conditions can be attributed to the intervention effect. Denver and Rochester used a more classical RCT design and randomly assigned individuals to either a control group or the intervention condition.6 Ohio and Tampa used a GRT approach and randomly assigned groups (i.e., clinics) to either a control group or an intervention group. GRT is a comparative study design in which identifiable groups (i.e., study units) are assigned at random to study conditions and observations are made on members of those groups.7 Studies with different units of assignment and observation exist in many disciplines and pose a number of design and analytic problems not present when individuals are randomized to study conditions. A central problem is that the intervention effect must be assessed against the between-group variance rather than the within-group variance.8 Furthermore, the between-group variance is usually larger if based on identifiable groups than if based on randomly constituted groups. This is the result of the positive intraclass correlation expected among responses from members of the same identifiable group9; that correlation reflects an extra component of variation attributable to groups above and beyond that attributable to their members. In addition, the degrees of freedom (df) available to estimate the between-group variance is normally less than that for the within-group variance when there are a limited number of groups per condition. The extra variation and limited df can combine to reduce power and therefore make it difficult to detect important intervention effects in an otherwise well-designed and properly-executed research trial.Roetzheim et al. Page 4 Clin Trials . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 11. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptOhio originally identified 12 participating clinics and stratified them according to clinic type \u00b1 university-based clinic (n = 8) vs. neighborhood health center (n = 4). Within clinic type, individual clinics were rank-ordered on the proportion of African-American patients and pairs were formed by clinics adjacent in rank. Clinics within each pair were then randomly assigned to either Navigation or Control conditions. This method of forming pairs should maintain balance between the two conditions on at least the variable that was used to rank the clinics in the first place. To the extent that this variable is also a surrogate for other variables (e.g., SES, insurance coverage) that might be correlated with the outcome, then this assignment process will permit a more direct interpretation of results. Data on these confounding variables can be examined for balance among the treatment conditions. Tampa identified 12 clinics nested within five distinct health care organizations (the five organizations having 3, 3, 2, 2, and 2 clinics respectively). There was a further constraint that for health care organizations having 3 clinics, one was randomly assigned to be the Control clinic and the remaining 2 clinics were designated as Navigated clinics. Random assignment of clinics occurred within each health care organization. The Tampa project presents a case where the number of units to be randomly assigned is small and the degree to which equivalency between Control and Navigated conditions was achieved is of less certainty than the situation where several hundred individuals are randomly assigned. The remaining 5 projects \u00b1 Boston, Chicago-ACCESS, Chicago-VA, San Antonio and Washington DC, employed a quasi-experimental design,10 with the distinguishing feature that patients (or clinics) were not randomly assigned to conditions. The decision to use non randomized designs reflected the nature of the intervention and the collaborations with community partners to develop and conduct the research. This leaves attribution of outcomes to Patient Navigation open to other plausible explanations. The same kinds of statistical analyses can be applied to data from quasi-experiments as from true experiments; it is the ability to directly interpret the findings and the confidence in the obtained results that separates these two kinds of designs. Random assignment eliminates many of the alternative plausible explanations for the obtained results that may be more difficult to eliminate in quasi-experimental designs, and facilitates generalizability of results to similar populations. The Design and Analysis Committee considered the various study designs and proposed five possible analytic methods or approaches for a national evaluation of the major outcomes of the PNRP. Each approach was evaluated by the committee in regards to its strengths, weaknesses, and suitability to address the unique methodological issues of the PNRP. Results of that evaluation are presented below (see also Table 2). Results Approach #1: No presentation of combined findings. Each project in the PNRP would be separately analyzed and reported as an independent study One possible approach to evaluate the PNRP is to make no attempt to combine the data, but instead present each project based on its own analysis. This approach would eliminate the difficulties in assessing the best method to combine data. This approach is useful if the findings of the individual projects are markedly different, allowing readers to more easily see which projects had a significant effect, and which did not. However, this approach does not provide a coherent summary of the overall PNRP program, and leaves the synthesis of the findings to the reader. An understanding of the effects of patient navigation from individual project analyses would only emerge over time as project results were published.Roetzheim et al. Page 5 Clin Trials . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 11. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptAn example of such an analytic approach is the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) funded program of 15 individual RCTs evaluating care coordination to improve quality of care, re-hospitalization rates and Medicare expenditures for Medicare beneficiaries. In this program, each project developed their own intervention and selected their own target diseases, study population, and established inclusion and exclusion criteria specific to their respective projects.11 CMS developed a uniform evaluation procedure, using claims data and a standardized telephone survey. To summarize the effects of the overall program, the authors chose to present the data as 15 parallel RCTs, outlining the differences in each intervention and study population. Interpretation of the findings primarily focused on the two projects that demonstrated positive effects, with an attempt to understand these findings in the context of differing study designs. This approach proved useful in the setting where trials utilized markedly different designs and where the nature of the intervention varied significantly from project to project. In contrast, the PNRP program allowed different study designs, but utilized a standard intervention strategy, study population, inclusion, and exclusion criteria. Approach #2: Pool the data from all projects and analyze at the individual level ignoring any possible intraclass correlation This analytical approach would combine data from all the projects, analyze at the individual level and ignore any possible intraclass correlation. The primary analysis would be a test of the mean difference in time from abnormal finding to diagnostic resolution for the Control condition compared to the Intervention (Navigated) condition. The analysis could be performed using standard methods based on the general linear model 12, such as t-tests or F- tests with df based on the number of individuals. While separate analyses could be performed for the different cancer sites \u00b1 breast, cervical, colorectal, prostate \u00b1 the basic analytical approach would be the same. The major advantages of this approach are that it would use all data from all projects in a single analysis and that it would rely on familiar methods based on the general linear model.12 Pooled data also yield larger sample sizes and increased power, and thereby permit the exploration of rarer events and the examination of the main effects on hypothesized sub- groups, such as patients with co-morbidities. However, these advantages are offset by several serious disadvantages. A primary disadvantage is that this approach is inappropriate for GRTs and for quasi-experiments involving non-random assignment of identifiable groups. 7, 13 Another is that larger projects would contribute more information than smaller projects; if the results varied systematically by study size, the effects in the larger projects could wash out the effects in the smaller projects. Approach #3: Pooling data from projects with similar designs Some of the projects employed similar research designs allowing the possibility of pooling raw data from projects that used similar research designs. For example, two projects employed a GRT design (Ohio and Tampa) that targeted shared cancer sites (breast, colorectal). This approach would analyze data from these two GRT projects, employ statistical methods that are appropriate to the study design, and stratify on project so that overall results would be examined and differences between projects could also be evaluated. An advantage of this situation is that it would allow stratification by cancer site and project simultaneously. The committee considered whether to include data on cervical cancer (collected at Ohio but not Tampa) and concluded that such data could be included, increasing the generalizability of findings. Individual-level data would be analyzed, but forRoetzheim et al. Page 6 Clin Trials . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 11. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptthese two projects, the intraclass correlation expected in the data would be addressed and df would be based on the number of groups, not the number of individuals. The analysis would be based on the general linear mixed model.14 Two projects, Denver and Rochester, designed and conducted projects in which individuals within clinics were randomly assigned to either the Control or Navigated conditions. Data from these 2 projects could be pooled for a single analysis using Approach #2. Project (Denver versus Rochester) would be a stratification variable to test the interaction effect. The approach would use standard methods based on the general linear model12, such as t- tests or F-tests with df based on the number of individuals. An issue complicating this approach in this instance is that the major outcome variables are measuring different time frames; for Denver the time is from abnormal finding to diagnostic resolution in 80% of its population and from cancer diagnosis to initiation of treatment in 20%, while for Rochester the time for most of its patient population is from cancer diagnosis to initiation of treatment and/or completion of primary treatment. Hypothetically, however, it could be possible to pool the data across these two projects since both outcomes are measured in the same unit (# of days). This analytical approach could help answer the general question as to whether patient navigation reduces the time to obtain standard quality cancer care \u00b1 whether that \u00aacare\u00ba is diagnostic resolution or initiation of cancer treatment. The challenge would be to find ways to appropriately combine and describe the relative merit of the data in reference to: 1) the overall effects of patient navigation (PN) on quality of cancer care; and 2) specific differential effects of PN on cancer diagnostic resolution and initiation of cancer treatment. While randomization insures comparability of treatment arms on average, adjustment for patient level covariates is still advisable for several reasons.15 First, despite randomization, imbalances in patient characteristics can occur by chance. Moreover, unadjusted analyses may yield results that are biased toward the null if there is heterogeneity of risk across strata.16 Adjusted analyses may provide more precise estimates and a summary result closer to stratum specific results.16, 17 The primary advantage of approach three is that it would base the analysis on the design of the project: RCTs would be analyzed as RCTs and GRTs would be analyzed as GRTs. Interpretation would be straightforward in both analyses. The primary disadvantages are that this approach would accommodate only 4 of the 9 projects and present two sets of potentially conflicting results. With each analysis based on only two projects, power would also be reduced relative to other options, and questions may arise regarding unequal sample sizes of projects within type of design. Approach #4: Prospective Meta-Analysis Meta-analysis is the statistical synthesis of data from separate but similar projects that are combined so that a quantitative summary of the pooled results can be obtained.18\u00b121 An extension of this approach is prospective meta-analysis (PMA) in which studies are identified, evaluated and determined to be eligible before the results of any of the studies become known.22 PMA addresses some of the limitations of retrospective approaches to meta-analysis. For example, retrospective analyses can be influenced by the individual study results, potentially affecting studies that are assessed (publication bias), study selection, what outcomes are assessed, and what treatment and patient subgroups are evaluated. In addition, PMA provides standardization across studies of instruments and variable definitions. PMA is an increasingly utilized approach reported in the literature.23\u00b132 Using this PMA approach, data from each project would be analyzed separately using methods appropriate to the project design and an effect size of the intervention (Patient Navigation) would be calculated. These effect sizes would then be combined across projectsRoetzheim et al. Page 7 Clin Trials . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 11. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptusing standard meta-analytic techniques to obtain a summary measure of the general effect of Patient Navigation on the timely receipt of standard, quality cancer care. This approach has several advantages. It recognizes the idiosyncrasies across projects and treats these as random effects. It retains individual projects' research designs and allows for stratification according to research design quality. The PMA approach also avoids another important disadvantage of retrospective meta-analyses, where the researcher conducting the meta-analysis is dependent upon the data that are published in the literature, or must request additional data from the authors. In the PNRP, all original data would be available for analysis. The data for each project would be analyzed separately, maintaining each project's research design and using statistical methods appropriate to the projects' designs with particular attention to the unit of assignment. Effect sizes could be examined by type of design (Individually randomized, group randomized, non-randomized; or randomized versus non- randomized) to examine differences in the estimated magnitude of the effect of PN as a function of research design type or quality of research design. A potential disadvantage is the risk that the analyses performed for the PMA might differ from the analyses eventually reported by the individual projects. That risk can be minimized by requiring the individual projects to specify in advance their primary analysis plan. However, if projects plan their primary analysis with the inclusion of data they collected beyond the common dataset, this analysis could not be completely replicated. If the individual projects have very different effect sizes (for example, several with a positive effect of navigation, and several with no effect or a negative effect in the navigated arm) then pooling the effect sizes would not be appropriate and presenting the individual project results would be recommended. Approach #5: Simulated Group Randomized Design In this approach, pairs of matched groups would be created within each project to mimic a pair-matched group-randomized trial. The grouping would occur so that the number of observations in each group formed within a particular project is balanced. The matching would be done such that factors most highly associated with outcomes were similarly distributed in both the control and navigated study conditions. Potential matching factors could include cancer site, health insurance coverage, ethnic and racial minority status, gender, and age. The distribution of these factors would first be examined to determine overall balance between navigated and control patients within each individual cancer site. There is no requirement that the number of groups per project be equal or that group as defined for one endpoint be the same group defined for another endpoint. For projects where group randomization of clinics was used, subjects from each individual clinic would remain together in a single group, and not split into multiple groups even with a large sample size. In those cases where a `group' was the unit of randomization or assignment, it would not be appropriate to split these units to obtain more groups; this would create groups that were not independent and violate the assumptions of the analysis plan. For some clinics that have small sample sizes it may be necessary to combine across clinics and match on cancer site to attain a sufficient number of observations per group. For projects where individual randomization was used, groups would be created based on cancer site and date of index event, in order to create well matched sets of navigated and control pairs. In the case where reasonable matching within strata has not been achieved with respect to the most influential covariates, it may be necessary to employ a mathematical model in the analysis to control for confounding.Roetzheim et al. Page 8 Clin Trials . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 11. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptTwo methods of analysis could be considered for this approach, ANOVA and simple t-tests (or permutation tests for situations where the assumptions of normality are grossly violated). These methods have been described elsewhere.7, 33, 34 Strengths of this approach are that it would utilize all of the data from all eight projects and it would help insure balance in the number of observations in each constructed group within a project and in the number of groups in each condition. Balance is important in group- randomized trials as it helps limit the potential impact of other problems that can occur in GRT data. 35 The size of groups should be similar enough in magnitude that weighting of effects would not be required. Another advantage of this method is that by creating comparable groupings across all PNRP projects, confounding that occurs at the level of groups can be controlled in the analysis. Potential disadvantages are that this is an untested and novel approach, and more importantly, it would not reflect the original design of most of the PNRP projects. Discussion The PNRP presents some unusual analytic challenges. The PNRP is clearly distinct from traditional multicenter randomized trials and traditional methods of analysis of multicenter trials could not be applied.36 Instead, we have considered 5 alternative approaches to the analysis of the PNRP data and examined their strengths and weaknesses. However, as community based participatory research gains strength as a methodology to address health disparities, we anticipate that other research groups will face similar challenges when analyzing multi site studies. Though we considered Approach #1, we judged the weaknesses to outweigh the strengths. The PNRP was created with the overarching goal of estimating the value of patient navigation. The results from individual projects would certainly add to the research literature on this issue, but a unified summary would not emerge and readers would be left to find, evaluate, and synthesize the reports from the individual projects. In addition, this approach would not allow a thorough evaluation of heterogeneity of navigation effects across projects. The circumstance where this method would however be more applicable is the situation where the effect sizes from the different individual projects are in opposite directions, and therefore a synthesized effect size is not appropriate. Another major disadvantage to Approach #1 was that a combined analysis should have greater power than a series of project-specific analyses. Pooling data allows sufficient sample size to explore effects of navigation across subpopulations of interest. Moreover, because the number of cancers arising in primary care settings is small, navigation programs that target primary care settings are unlikely to have sufficient numbers of cancers diagnosed to explore effects for each cancer site. By pooling data across cancer sites, there is a greater opportunity to examine the effects of navigation programs that target the full cancer continuum, from diagnosis through treatment. Two analytic approaches that would pool data cross projects were considered unacceptable by the Design and Analysis Committee. First, simply combining all data and conducting an individual-level analysis would ignore intraclass correlation and each project's unique study design, greatly increasing the likelihood of a type 1 error.7, 13 In addition, projects having large sample size would be weighted greater in Approach #2 which could unduly influence findings.37 Approach #3 would combine data only from projects having similar study designs but was deemed undesirable as it would exclude data from five of the eight projects. Each of these remaining two approaches has potential strengths and weaknesses. Strengths of the PMA approach included an analytic method that was familiar to most readers, theRoetzheim et al. Page 9 Clin Trials . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 11. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptability to utilize data from all projects, and the ability to account for unique research designs of each project, the ability to avoid problems common to many meta-analytic efforts by virtue of having complete access to original data, and its prospective approach. A meta- analysis conducted in advance of publication of individual project results could risk inconsistencies with later reports from the separate projects. Inconsistencies can be potentially managed through governance such as enforcing (or at least negotiating) agreed upon analytic methods between that in the pooled analysis and that performed by individual PNRP projects. In addition, differences in analytic methods and resultant discrepancies in reported results between pooled analysis and individual projects would need full disclosure and explanation in subsequent publications. Advantages of approach #5 which would construct a simulated pair-matched group- randomized trial include utilizing data from all projects, insuring balance between intervention and control conditions, and increased efficiency. Disadvantages include an untested analytic approach not familiar to reviewers or readers, a less transparent approach which lacks adherence to the original designs of the PNRP projects, difficulty achieving sufficient sample size per group, and finally issues of weighting if some projects contribute more groups than others. Adequate control of confounding is an important analytic issue in all methods. In pooled analyses, confounding can occur at several levels; at the level of the PNRP project and cancer site, at the level of groups that occur within the pooled data (e.g. clinics or hospitals), and at the individual patient level. Factors that are highly correlated are difficult to separate in any analytic strategy. For example, three of the four sites examining cervical cancer are non-randomized while four out of five sites examining colon cancer are randomized. As a result it will be difficult to isolate the potential effects of cancer site from potential effects of the study design. Confounding of group level (e.g. clinic) characteristics is also important in all analytic methods. While group randomized trials have inherent groups that can be assessed, a potential strength of method five is that it creates similar groupings within other study designs allowing for control of confounding at this level. There were a number of limitations considered in our discussion of analytic approaches. First, the conclusions reached were based on expert opinion and not derived from actual analyses performed. Because data collection is still underway, there was no attempt to perform simulations, for example, that contrasted results from different analytic strategies or assumptions. Finally, the issues faced were unusual and there is little existing literature to put these conclusions into context. Even so, programs that involve different designs and interventions addressing the same problem are not uncommon. The PNRP faced an unusual situation in which timely program evaluation required the analysis of pooled data arising from projects having heterogeneous study designs. This situation could re-emerge in future multi-site, community based participatory research projects. The PNRP D&A Committee considered several analytic approaches and concluded that a prospective meta-analysis is one appropriate analytic strategy in these situations. A novel simulated group randomized approach was also proposed as an alternative analytic approach. Future research (e.g. data simulations) would help to understand how program evaluation results are influenced by the analytic method used.

Rose, MD, MSc, FACP Performance variation is easy to find\u2014all one needs to do is to look for it. We have long known that some nations achieve better control of hypertension than others,1some hospitals have shorter door-to-balloon times than others,2and some cardiac surgeons have better risk-adjusted mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery than others.3In fact, it is difficult to recall an instance when performance wasfound not to vary. Given that performance variation isubiquitous, it is no longer shocking to find it; the moreinteresting question is why performance varies so much. Theanswer to this question would likely be a key step along thepathway to improving performance. Article see p 2309 It is rather uncommon to find a single answer to the question of why performance variation exists. However, inthe current issue of Circulation, Van Spall and colleagues 4 have found an unusually straightforward explanation forperformance variation, at least in the context of the manage-ment of warfarin. The authors found that site-level adherenceto a relatively simple algorithm regarding when to change thedose of warfarin and when not to change the dose predictedfully 87% only increased the amount ofexplained variation to 89%. In short, management of warfarindoses appeared to be almost deterministic regarding theanticoagulation control that was achieved. Remarkably, theauthors also found that greater adherence to the algorithmalso predicted a reduced rate of the combined primary endpoint of stroke, major hemorrhage, or death at the site level.For each 10% increase in algorithm-consistent dosing at thecenter level, the annual rate of the combined end point was8% lower, even after adjusting for a host of patient-levelpredictors. The algorithm has additional attractive features aswell, not least of which is that it does not require a computer or proprietary software to use. In fact, it would be equallysuitable to use in developing countries.The authors deftly used a feature of their dataset to demonstrate that percent time in therapeutic range (TTR) really is in the causal pathway to adverse events. Becausetheir dataset was drawn from a randomized trial of dabigatranversus warfarin, they were able to show that, whereas siteswith more algorithm-consistent warfarin dosing had lowerrates of adverse events among patients receiving warfarin,they did not have lower rates of adverse events amongpatients receiving dabigatran. Some have expressed doubtsabout whether TTR really is in the causal pathway tooutcomes, 5suggesting that instead, sites with higher TTR also might be delivering high-quality care in other ways. Ifthis were true, then quality improvement efforts aimed atincreasing TTR might not achieve the desired benefits interms of preventing adverse events. The finding by Van Spalland colleagues 4serves as a strong refutation for this line of reasoning, because if high-TTR sites were truly deliveringother interventions responsible for preventing adverse events,we would have seen a similar reduction in adverse eventsamong patients receiving dabigatran. The present study there-fore serves as a strong endorsement of efforts to improve TTRat the site level and thereby prevent adverse events. The algorithm studied by Van Spall and colleagues 4was similar to others that are in widespread use. The algorithmsuggested no dose change for an in-range internationalnormalized ratio (INR) value, a 10% dose change when theINR was somewhat out of range (1.51-1.99 or 3.01-4.00),and a 15% dose change for greater deviations from the targetrange. The authors note that, although they distributed thisalgorithm, they cannot know to what extent the sites of careactually used it\u2014in essence, their study examined the differ-ence between care that would have been algorithm-concordant, as the authors put it, \"whether intentionally ornot.\" In a study by Kim et al, 6a very similar (but not completely identical) dosing algorithm was shown to improveTTR. The Kim study complements the current study in that itshows that the introduction of a standardized dosing algo-rithm improved TTR considerably using a before-after de-sign. 6Although Van Spall and colleagues were able to show that algorithm-concordant care was important, they wereunable to examine whether the introduction of the algorithmhad actually increased the likelihood that such care would bedelivered. Also, in the Kim study, algorithm-consistent dos-ing was highly correlated with patient-level TTR, whichcomplements the site-level findings of the current study.Taken together, the 2 studies suggest that the algorithm isboth valid (in the sense of predicting important outcomes) 4 and feasible (in the sense that it can successfully be intro-duced and change clinical practice). 6The opinions expressed in this article are not necessarily those of the editors or of the American Heart Association.

Any decision about warfarindose changes must occur in the context of the visit, and someinformation that is divulged by the patient (for example,recent dietary intake) may well prompt a decision that isdiscordant with the algorithm. 7However, both the Van Spall and Kim studies strongly suggest that clinicians managingwarfarin should ask themselves whether they really have acompelling reason to deviate from the algorithm\u2014and thenask again for good measure. The present study also adds to a growing discussion about how to manage warfarin doses when the INR is only slightlyout of range. In the past, several studies have suggested thatdose changes are not necessary for mildly deranged INR, andin fact may begin a cycle of overcorrection and rebound thatmay worsen control. 8-9Based on this limited evidence, the latest consensus guidelines for managing warfarin suggest notchanging the dose when the INR deviates by /H113490.5 from the target range, and instead merely rechecking in 1 to 2 weeks. 10 Notably, a deviation of up to 0.5 is an even wider tolerancerange than would be suggested by either of the previousstudies. 8-9With this issue in mind, Van Spall and colleagues examined whether their findings would also be true when thetolerance range was widened from 2.0 to 3.0 to 1.9 to 3.1, 1.8to 3.2, 1.7 to 3.3, and 1.6 to 3.4. They found that TTR washigher with increased adherence to any of these ranges, butwas best with the strict construction of the target range (ie,2.0-3.0). In addition, only the strict construction predictedthe primary combined end point in a statistically significantfashion. Thus, the findings of the present study cast at leastsome doubt on the idea of a widened tolerance range, withinwhich slightly deranged INR values do not prompt a dosechange. Ideally, a well-designed prospective study couldaddress this issue more definitively. For now, although someclinicians may still opt to have a tolerance range, it may beprudent not to extend it beyond approximately 1.8 to 3.2, 8-9 as opposed to the much wider range of 1.5 to 3.5 recom-mended by the most recent guidelines. 10 One noteworthy limitation of the present study stems from its origins in a clinical trial.11The patients represented in this study may have been unusually adherent to their medication,and gaps in INR monitoring were likely minimal. In areal-world setting, dose management may not predict 87% ofsite variation, and other issues, like gaps in INR monitoring,also may play an important role. Our group has shown thatnonstandard target ranges, gaps in INR monitoring, andfailure to recheck INR promptly after also strong predictors of site-level TTR. 12-14 Together, these 3 measures predicted 48% of TTR variation among sitesof care in the Veterans Health Administration (our unpub-lished finding). It is likely, therefore, that although adherenceto the algorithm examined by Van Spall and colleagues maybe the single most important determinant of site-level TTR, itis not the only performance measure worth addressing. Infact, improving TTR is likely to require a multifactorialapproach, as there are many related issues that contribute toTTR (Table). Another limitation, mentioned above, is that the present study was not an attempt to actually implement the algorithmunder study. Kim and colleagues successfully implemented asimilar algorithm, 6but they did so at a single site of care, which may not be representative of other sites. An importantnext step would be a prospective test of this algorithm in areal-world setting, preferably across an integrated healthsystem. Such an effort would require great attention to theprinciples of implementation science to promote successfuladoption of the algorithm. 15In fact, we have recently begun such a study in the New England region of the VeteransTable.

One challenge for our effort, and for any effort occurring in the real world, is that automated datamay not reliably identify dose changes in warfarin, which is usually prescribed as use as directed. A need to rely on chartreview to track adherence to the algorithm may hamperefforts to measure its uptake. In summary, Van Spall and colleagues 4have added several important new pieces of information to the literature. First, incombination with other studies, 6the present study convinc- ingly demonstrates that managing warfarin according to astandard algorithm can improve patient outcomes. Second, itshould lay to rest any lingering doubts about whether TTR istruly in the causal pathway to adverse events. Finally, itsuggests that changing the dose of warfarin for any out-of-range INR may in fact be best, although other studies havefound differently, 8-9and further evidence is needed. The study by Van Spall and colleagues certainly provides apowerful argument for greater adoption of any sort of systemto promote standardized dose management for warfarin\u2014either computer support when it is available, or paper-basedalgorithms if not. Improving outcomes for patients receivingwarfarin will not be easy, but it may be easier than we think.

INR targets and site-level anticoagulation control: results from the Veterans (VARIA). J Thromb Haemost 2012; 10:590-5. Summary. Background: Not all clinicians target the same International Normalized Ratio (INR) for patients with aguideline-recommended target range of 2-3. A patient /C213sm e a n INR value suggests the INR that was actually targeted. Wehypothesized that sites would vary by mean INR, and that sitesof care with mean values nearest to 2.5 would achieve betteranticoagulation control, as measured by per cent time in therapeutic range (TTR). Objectives: To examine variations among sites in mean INR and the relationship with anticoag-ulation control in an integrated system of care. Patients/ Methods: We studied 103 897 patients receiving oral anticoag- ulation with an expected INR target between 2 and 3 at 100Veterans Health Administration (VA) sites from 1 October2006 to 30 September 2008. Key site-level variables were:proportion near 2.5 (that is, percentage of patients with mean INR between 2.3 and 2.7) and mean risk-adjusted TTR. Results: Site mean INR ranged from 2.22 to 2.89; proportion near 2.5, from 30 to 64%. Sites /C213proportions of patients near 2.5, below 2.3 and above 2.7 were consistent fromyear to year. A 10 percentage point increase in the proportionnear 2.5 predicted a 3.8 percentage point increase in risk-adjusted TTR ( P< 0.001). Conclusions: Proportion of 2.5 is a site-level /C212signature /C213of care and an implicit measure of targeted INR. This proportion varies by site and is strongly associated with site-level TTR. Our studysuggests that sites wishing to improve TTR, and therebyimprove patient outcomes, should avoid the explicit or implicitpursuit of non-standard INR targets.Keywords : ambulatory care, anticoagulants, medication ther- apy management, quality of healthcare, warfarin. Millions of patients receive warfarin each year to prevent or treat thromboembolic disease. Better anticoagulation control(i.e. a greater percentage of time in therapeutic range [TTR]),can reduce the occurrence of adverse events [1-4]. Therefore, toimprove patient outcomes, sites of care should develop systemsto measure and improve TTR [5-7]. Ideally, we should measure not only intermediate outcomes (such as TTR), but also processes of care, because process deciencies provide aprescription for remediation. Because the most useful processmeasures are /C212tightly linked /C213to outcomes [8], it would be ideal to demonstrate which processes of care are associated withbetter anticoagulation control. We have proled 100 sites of care in an integrated healthcare system (the Veterans Health Administration, or VA) on TTR [9]. Having proled sites on anticoagulation control (an intermediate outcome of care), we sought todetermine which processes of care predict this outcome [8].Several site-level processes o f care are related to TTR, most notably follow-up intervals after out-of-range InternationalNormalized Ratio (INR) values [10]. Another process mea-sure likely to affect anticoagulation control is pursuit of atarget INR range of 2-3 for most patients. Several high- quality randomized trials have demonstrated that aiming for a lower INR target range (such as 1.5-2) produces inferiorprotection from thromboembolism with no reduction in ratesof major hemorrhage [11-16]. Despite the established value ofthe standard target range of 2-3 for patients with atrialbrillation (AF) or venous thromboembolism (VTE)[5,17,18], some clinicians may continue to implicitly orexplicitly aim for non-standard target ranges. Although these clinicians may believe that they can successfully keep patients within a very narrow target range such as 2-2.5, target rangesnarrower than a full INR unit do not reduce the variability ofINR [19].

Rose, Center for Health Quality, Outcomes and Economic Research, Bedford VA Medical Center, 200 SpringsRoad, Building 70, Bedford, MA 01730, and Thrombosis and HaemostasisOne prominent study includes use of a standard target range of 2-3 for patients with AF among its quality measures [20].However, in most large automated databases, we do not havedirect access to the target range, complicating efforts to use thisas a quality measure. In this study, we propose a new process ofcare measure for oral anticoagulation: the proportion ofpatients at a site, anticoagulated for AF or VTE, who achieve a mean INR of 2.3-2.7. We assert that this does not merely measure differences in INR variability among sites of care, butactually measures site-level propensity to target non-standardtarget ranges, because even patients with highly variable INRvalues will still tend to achieve a mean INR very close to what isbeing sought. We used a large database from the VA to addressthree main questions. (i) At which level of mean INR dopatients record the highest TTR? (ii) Do sites of care vary in their propensity to aim for non-standard target ranges? (iii) Are these differences associated with site-level anticoagulationcontrol? Demonstration of variability of process and arelationship with an intermediate outcome of care wouldprovide strong support for measuring, and intervening tooptimize, this new process measure. Methods Data The database for this study has also been described elsewhere [9]. The Veterans AffaiRs Study to Improve Anticoagulation(VARIA) included all patients deemed to be receiving oralanticoagulation therapy from the VA between 1 October 2006and 30 September 2008, based on the criteria described below.The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board ofthe Bedford VA Medical Center. Patients We included all patients who received warfarin from the VAduring the 2-year study peri od (i.e. at least 30 days /C213worth dispensed by the pharmacy). We excluded patients whose primary indication to receive warfarin was valvular heartdisease. Many such patients have a target INR range of 2.5-3.5rather than the more standard 2-3, but it is not possible todetermine with certainty which patients have the higher targetrange. Without specic knowledge of the target range, wecannot calculate TTR. For this study, we also excluded theinception period, or the rst 6 months of warfarin therapy, a period when many patients may have erratic INR control and may spend much time below the target range. Laboratory values and calculation of per cent time in range (TTR) We included INR values within the VA system during times when a patient was /C212on warfarin /C213: that is, when a patient was either (i) in possession of warfarin or (ii) having INR tests atleast every 42 days. We dened the period of warfarin possession as the duration of the most recent VA prescriptionfor warfarin, plus 30 days. Because patients may be instructedto take half-doses of warfarin, we recognize that going morethan 30 days beyond the end of a prescription does notnecessarily indicate that warfarin therapy has stopped. Wetherefore also allowed a consistent pattern of INR measure- ments (i.e. every 42 days or less) to indicate that a patient was still being managed. We excluded INR tests measured while the patient was hospitalized. Patients who are hospitalized may receive tem-porary parenteral anticoagulation or no anticoagulation, solow INR values be intentional. Wecalculated TTR using Rosendaal /C213s method [21], which uses linear interpolation to assign an INR value to each day between successive observed INR values. Gaps of 56 days or more between INR values are not interpolated. After interpo-lation, the percentage of time during which the interpolatedINR values lie between 2.0 and 3.0 (from 0 to 100%) iscalculated [21]. Sites of care We included 100 VA sites of care, each of which includes ahospital, an outpatient care center and several outlyingcommunity-based clinics. Each site has a specialized anticoag-ulation clinic, which is usually run by clinical pharmacistsunder the supervision of a medical director[22]. Therefore, essentially all patients whose anticoagulation is managed in the VA are managed by specialized anticoagulation clinics. Mostpatients only visited one site of care, and their INR data wereassigned to that site. If a patient visited more than one site (3%of patients), we partitioned their data by site. While most INR values in the VA are processed via an automated laboratory, a few VA sites mostly or exclusively relyupon point-of-care (POC) testing. Our data do not specify which INR tests were obtained via POC. Home testing with POC devices is not covered by the VA, and therefore isextremely uncommon. Risk adjustment model We have previously described our risk adjustment model forTTR [9]. We considered many potential variables for inclusionin the model which were likely to impact TTR, includingdemographics, area-level poverty, driving distance to care,physical health conditions, mental health conditions, numberof medications, and number of hospitalizations. Most variables were retained within the model, with the exception of several co-morbid conditions with small effect sizes. The model wasderived and validated according to customary procedures,which included considerations of maximizing predictive ability,clinical credibility, and ease of use and understanding. Thispatient-level risk adjustment model for TTR has an R 2of 13.3% when used with this dataset [9]. Table 1 contains all thevariables in the model.What /C213s real anticoagulation control Our dependent variable was mean site risk-adjusted TTR (also known as observed minus expected, or O-E). First, for eachpatient, we calculated the observed TTR (O) and applied therisk adjustment model to calculate the expected TTR (E).Then, an observed minus expected (O-E) score was calculatedfor each patient. The mean O-E score for each site constitutedits risk-adjusted TTR. We also calculated the mean O, E andO-E for each site of care. Independent variable: site mean INR value As explained above, we included all INR values that occurred when a patient was /C212on warfarin /C213according to our denition,and that were within 56 days of another INR (a /C212valid interval /C213). We limited this study to patients who had at least four valid intervals for calculating per cent time in therapeuticrange (TTR) [21]. For this purpose, a valid interval consists oftwo INR values separated by 56 days or less, without anintervening hospitalization. In this way, we ensured thatpatients had sufcient INR values to reliably indicate their target INR. For each patient, we calculated his or her mean INR value over the 2-year study period. We also calculatedseparate mean INR values in years 1 and 2 of the study forpatients who had at least four valid intervals in one year. Wecomputed, for each site, the overall mean INR value, as well asthe proportions of patients with a mean INR value < 2.3, 2.3-2.7 and > 2.7. INR values may be measured several times in rapid succession when the INR is low or high. We were concerned that this phenomenon might impact our assessment of patient-or site-level mean INR values. We therefore computed analternative version of our independent variable, omitting allINR values obtained within 7 days after the previous value.The results of our analyses were essentially unchanged. Statistical analyses We examined the baseline characteristics of patients in ourdatabase. We calculated unadjusted and risk-adjusted TTR foreach patient and for each site of care. We characterized eachpatient /C213s mean INR value, each site /C213s mean INR value, and the proportion of patients at each site with a mean INR of 2.3-2.7. We examined the ability of patient-level mean INR value topredict unadjusted and adjusted TTR using ANOVA , linear regression and cubic smoothing splines [23]. 2.3-2.7 and site-level anticoagulation control usinglinear regression. All analyses were conducted using SAS,version 9.1 (SAS Corporation, Cary, NC, USA). Results Patients Our database contained 103 897 patients who were experienced users of warfarin for indications ordinarily requiring a targetINR range of 2-3 (i.e. not mechanical heart valves). Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The sample was mostly male (98%) and had a median age of 72 years (IQR 62-79).More than half of the patients were anticoagulated for AF(64%), with many of the others anticoagulated for VTE (27%).Patients had a substantial burden of chronic disease: 40% haddiabetes, 32% had heart failure, 29% had chronic lung disease,and 14% had chronic kidney disease. Patients also had asubstantial burden of mental health disorders: for example, 22% had major depression, and 9% carried a diagnosis of alcohol abuse. As might be expected with this burden of co-morbidity, patients received many medications (a median ofeight) and 26% were hospitalized at least once during the study.Table 1 Patient characteristics ( n= 103 897) VariableNumber (%), median (IQR) or mean (SD) Female gender 1976 (1.9) Median age (IQR) 72 (62-79) Race/ethnicity Non-Hispanic white 88481 (85.2)Non-Hispanic black 392 (0.4) Native American 449 (0.4)Other/unknown 1774 (1.7) Median per cent poverty in zip code of residence (IQR)10.7 (6.6-16.0) Median distance from nearest VA facility in miles (IQR)7.8 (3.7-16.5) Primary indication Physical (newly diagnosed) 7033 (6.8)Chronic kidney disease 14581 (14.0) Chronic liver disease 1228 (1.2) Chronic lung disease 30 311 (29.2)Diabetes 41 507 (40.0)Epilepsy 2903 (2.8) Heart failure 33 727 (32.5) Hyperlipidemia 78 205 (75.3)Hypertension 87 138 (83.9) Mental co-morbid conditions abuse 9583 (9.2) Bipolar disorder 2359 (2.3)Dementia 5491 (5.3)Major depression (21.5) (4.0) Median number of medications (IQR)8 (6-12) Hospitalized at least once 26 921 (25.9) Anticoagulation control Per cent time in range (TTR), mean (SD)61.6 (22.1) IQR, interquartile range. *Patients whose main indication for antico- agulation was valvular heart disease or prosthetic heart valve were excluded from this study.592 A. J. Rose et al /C2112012 International Society on Thrombosis and HaemostasisOverall anticoagulation control was fair for this population of experienced users of warfarin (mean TTR = 61.6%). Mean INR values - patient level Patients varied widely in their mean INR values. The mean ofall INR values in the database was 2.42, but 10% of patientswere below 2.00 and 10% were above 2.83, so extremedeviations were not uncommon. The maximum predicted TTRoccurred at a mean INR value of 2.43. At this value, patientshad a predicted TTR of 71%; for each deviation of 0.1 fromthis value, the predicted TTR was 3.9% lower ( P<0 . 0 0 1 ) . However, this relationship was not symmetric, with greater decrements in TTR occurring below a mean INR of 2.43 thanabove it (Table 2). An ANOVA test, comparing deciles of patients with regard to mean INR values, demonstrated asimilar phenomenon (Table 2). Anticoagulation control wasgenerally excellent among patients with a mean INR between2.3 and 2.7, but quite poor outside of this range. Mean INR values - site level There were 100 sites of care in the database. The number ofp a t i e n t sp e rs i t er a n g e df r o m7 4t o4 3 7 1( m e a n1 0 3 9p e rs i t e ) . Site TTR varied from a low of 43% to a high of 72%, and site risk-adjusted TTR varied from 18% below to 12% abovepredicted. Site mean INR varied widely, from 2.22 to 2.89. Themedian site had 34% of patients with a mean INR < 2.3, 48%of patients with a mean INR 2.3-2.7, and 16% of patients witha mean INR > 2.7. However, there was considerable variationin this regard; sites ranged from 30 to 64% of patients with amean INR of 2.3-2.7 (Fig. 1). In a regression analysis, for every 10% of patients at a site with a mean INR of 2.3-2.7, site- unadjusted TTR was 4.4% highe was 3.8% higher ( P< 0.001 for both ndings). The proportion of patients at each site with a mean INR 2.3- 2.7 was consistent between years: comparing of correlation was 0.78 ( P< 0.001). Sites were also somewhat consistent regarding whether their patientsachieved mean INR values above or below this desirable range. For example, regarding the proportion of patients with a mean INR below 2.3, sites varied from 19 to 62%. The coefcient ofcorrelation between FY07 and FY08 regarding below 2.3 was 0.45 ( P< 0.001). Several sites had a consistent pattern of having many patients with lowmean INR. For example, sites KM and GD had among thevery highest proportion of patients with a low mean INR inboth years (KM, 56% and 65%; GD, 55% and 60%). Thecorrelation between years for the proportion with a high meanINR was also appreciable ( r= 0.35, P< 0.001), but not as strong a relationship. Discussion We examined mean INR values at the patient level and the site of care level. We had three main ndings: (i) site mean INR varied widely; (ii) proportion of patients near 2.5 varied widely by site, and proportions low, high and near 2.5 were stableacross years; and (iii) a higher proportion near 2.5 was stronglyassociated with higher site-level TTR. Several related pointsremain speculation: (i) intentional pursuit of non-standardINR target ranges is the principal cause of variation in site-levelmean INR; (ii) actively discouraging clinicians from adoptingnon-standard targets will increase TTR and reduce adverse events; (iii) it will be possible to induce clinicians to change their practise regarding INR target ranges; and (iv) discouragingnon-standard targets will not harm certain classes of patients,such as the oldest old (age 80+). We will soon launch an initiative to improve mean TTR in the VA from its current 58% to 70% [9], an improvement thatcould prevent thousands of adverse events [24]. In light of thepresent study, one strategy will be to discourage sites from pursuing non-standard target INR ranges. We hypothesize that decreased use of non-standard target ranges will increase theproportion of patients with a mean INR of 2.3-2.7, and thatsites that change this parameter the most will increase TTR themost. In addition, by directly measuring outcomes amongimportant subgroups of patients (e.g. the oldest old), we hopeto provide reassurance that avoiding non-standard targetranges benets them as well, or at least does not harm them. This forthcoming study will therefore address whether the proportion of patients whose mean INR is near 2.5 can serve asa useful process measure in anticoagulation care. The nding that extremes of mean INR are associated with poor anticoagulation control at the patient level is notsurprising. However, the nding that sites of care vary more Table 2 Patient-level analysis of relationship between mean INR value and per cent time in therapeutic ran ge (TTR). Patients are d ivided into deciles by mean International Normalized Ratio (INR) values. The range of mean INRs is given for each decile ( n= 103 897) Mean INR group Lowest 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Highest Range of mean 0 and 100%. Adjusted TTR measures the dierence between observed and expected TTR. Expected TTR is calculated for each patient based on his or her demographics and co-morbid conditions. Positive values for adjusted TTR indicate that a patient /C213s observed TTR exceeded the expected TTR. ANOVA tests are signicant for comparisons of observed TTR and adjusted TTR ( P< 0.001 for both). Groups designated by a common letter are not signicantly dierent from one another by Thrombosis and Haemostasisthan 3-fold regarding the proportion of patients with a mean INR below 2.3 suggests real differences in site-level practise.Our ndings suggest that some sites routinely choose aguideline-concordant target range of 2-3 while others arelikely to attempt to /C212shade /C213patients below this range. This might take the form of an explicit designation of a non-standard target range (for example, 2-2.5) or an implicit tendency to aim for the lower end of a nominal target range of 2-3. As discussed above, considerable work is needed to extend the results of this study and to clarify their implications. Fornow, however, we recommend that clinicians aim for standardtarget ranges, as are already recommended by prominentguidelines such as ACCP [5]. We are not advocating a targetrange of 2.3-2.7, or any other narrow range [19]. Clinicians should be equally satised with an INR of 2.1 or 2.9, provided the patient is under stable control. Rather, we recommendeliminating target ranges other than 2-3 and 2.5-3.5[5,17,18,25,26]. Our study has important strengths, particularly the size and clinical detail of the database. However, we also acknowledgelimitations. First, as stated above, we cannot know for surewhy sites achieved such disparate mean INR values. While we suspect that it is a reflection of different styles of practise at each site, our observational database study is not equipped toconrm this suspicion. Second, we examined the impact ofmean INR values on anticoagulation control, but did notexamine the impact of mean INR values on adverse events.However, multiple studies have already linked TTR to adverseevents [1-4], demonstrating the importance of pursuing ahigher TTR both for populations and for individuals. In addition, multiple studies have also linked the pursuit of /C212low /C213target INR ranges to inferior patient outcomes [11-15], as discussed above. Nevertheless, this study could have providedeven more compelling evidence by directly linking site-leveltarget ranges to site-level rates of adverse events. Unfortu-nately, we lack the data to directly examine adverse events withthis dataset. In the future, we hope to examine this link moredirectly. Third, VA patients are mostly male and have higher rates of co-morbid illness, mental illness, substance abuse disorders and socioeconomic disadvantages than the generalUS population. This may have contributed to INR target rangechoices; for example, clinicians may justiably fear hemorrhagein an alcoholic patient and therefore target a low INR value.However, these issues are unlikely to impact the underlyingrelationships we demonstrated between site-level mean INRvalues and site-level TTR. In addition, our risk-adjustment model should have accounted for the impact of these patient characteristics upon TTR, at least within the VA system [9]. In conclusion, 100 sites of care in the nation /C213s largest integrated healthcare system varied considerably in their meanINR values and in the proportion of patients with a mean INRof 2.3-2.7. Our results suggest that pursuing standard INRtarget ranges (2-3 for most patients) could improve anticoag-ulation control, as measured by TTR. In a forthcoming intervention study, we plan to test this proposition by actively promoting the use of standard INR targets and observing theeffects on TTR and patient outcomes.

Rose, Beth Ann Petrakis, Patricia Callahan, Scott Mambourg, Dimple Patel, Elaine M. Hylek, and Barbara G. Bokhour Objective. Anticoagulation clinics (ACCs) can improve anticoagulation control and prevent adverse events. However, ACCs vary widely in their performance on antico- agulation control. Our objective was to compare the organization and management of top-performing with that of bottom-performing ACCs. Data Sources/Study Setting. Three high outlier and three low outlier ACCs in the V eterans Health Administration (VA). Study Design. Site visits with qualitative data collection and analysis. Data Collection/Extraction Methods. We conducted semi-structured interviews with ACC staff regarding work flow, staf ng, organization, and quality assurance efforts. We also observed ACC operations and collected documents, such as the clinic protocol. We used grounded thematic analysis to examine site-level factors associated with high and low outlier status. Principal Findings. High outlier sites were characterized by (1) adequate (pharma- cist) staf ng and effective use of (nonpharmacist) support personnel; (2) innovation to standardize clinical practice around evidence-based guidelines; (3) the presence of a quality champion for the ACC; (4) higher staff quali cations; (5) a climate of ongoing group learning; and (6) internal efforts to measure performance. Although high outliers had all of these features, no low outlier had more than two of them. Conclusions. The top-performing ACCs in the VA system shared six relatively recog- nizable characteristics. Efforts to improve performance should focus on these domains. Key Words. Qualitative research, quality of health care, anticoagulants, pharmacists, organization and administration Warfarin (Coumadin) is an oral anticoagulant given to millions of patients to treat or prevent blood clots. Warfarin requires routine blood tests to ensure that patients are suf ciently anticoagulated to prevent blood clots, but not so\u00a9Health Research and Educational Trust DOI: 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2011.01377.x RESEARCH ARTICLE 1541Health Services Research thoroughly anticoagulated as to place them at excessive risk of bleeding. War- farin can be dif cult to manage, and clinicians must carefully monitor and adjust doses to keep the patients in the target range. Management in a dedi- cated anticoagulation clinic (ACC) can improve anticoagulation control (van Walraven et al. 2006). V eterans Health Administration (VA) medical centers are required to manage all patients receiving warfarin in an ACC, which is generally run by clinical pharmacists (V eterans Health Administration 2009). Nevertheless, even among patients receiving treatment in an ACC, there is substantial variation in anticoagulation control (Rose et al. 2011a). Many patients have poor control (van Walraven et al. 2006; Rose et al. 2010), which increases rates of stroke, venous thromboembolism, major hemor-rhage, and death (V eeger et al. 2005; White et al. 2007; Wallentin et al. 2010). Anticoagulation control can be measured by the percentage of time in thera- peutic range (TTR) (Rosendaal et al. 1993). We have proposed using TTR as a quality measure (Rose et al. 2009). In our recent study, mean site TTR varied among 100 VA ACCs by more than 20 percent, a large and clinically impor- tant difference (Rose et al. 2011a). We sought to understand this variation in performance using the positive deviance approach (Bradley et al. 2009). This approach emphasizes in-depth qualitative study of organizations with exceptionally high performance tounderstand the factors that contribute to their excellence (Peters and Water- man 1982; Spear and Bowen 1999; Gawande 2007). Qualitative methods are ideal for studying organizational culture, which can be dif cult to characterize using quantitative methods (Sofaer 1999; Patton 2002). The Anticoagulation Forum has proposed nine key domains (Table 1) that are essential to establish- ing and maintaining a high-quality ACC (Garcia et al. 2008). We sought to explore these nine domains, while remaining open to others that would emerge through this qualitative study. Address correspondence to Adam J.

Sites were not informed of theirhigh or low outlier status. Although we selected sites based on their perfor- mance from October 2006 to September 2008 (the \"measurement period \"), site visits occurred between May 2010 and March 2011. We took care to identify personnel and organizational factors that had changed since the measurement period. T o a large extent, these factors and personnel had not changed, but when they had, we viewed this as an additional opportunity to examine not only static models of high and low performance but also changes in performance. When conditions as we found them differed in important ways from what was present during the measurement period, we have noted this in the text.Table 1: Nine Recommendations for Optimal Anticoagulation Care as per the Anticoagulation Forum Consensus Statement (Garcia et al. 2008) Domain Explanation 1. Quali cations of personnelACC staff should be licensed health care professionals possessing core competency related to anticoagulation therapy. 2. Supervision The ACC should have a well-de ned relationship with responsible/ referring health care providers (e.g., the primary care physician). 3. Care management and coordinationThe ACC should have written policies and procedures that are approved by the clinic 's medical director. An ef cient system for scheduling and tracking patients should be utilized. 4. Documentation The ACC should have an accurate system of documentation to ensure that clinically relevant data are available to staff at all times. 5. Patient education The delivery of anticoagulation care should address the educational needs of patients and their caregivers. 6. Patient selection and assessmentOptimized anticoagulant therapy should be instituted only after careful consideration of the risk and bene t for an individual patient. The appropriateness of anticoagulation therapy should be periodically reviewed for each patient. 7. Laboratory monitoring Optimized anticoagulation therapy should incorporate regular laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant effect, using either a high-quality laboratory or a well-maintained point of care device. 8. Initiation of therapy The initiation of optimized anticoagulation therapy should use a systematic, evidence-based approach. 9. Maintenance of therapy The delivery of optimized anticoagulation should use a systematic process for longitudinal patient assessment, adjustment of anticoagulant drug doses, scheduling of follow-up visits, andinterruptions of therapy for elective procedures.Characteristics of T op Anticoagulation Clinics 1543Data Collection Interviews. One author (A. J. R.) visited each study site for two working days. At each site, we sought to interview all staff members who work in the ACC or whose work impacts the ACC. All employees agreed except one, and all partic- ipants gave informed consent. Each participant was interviewed in private for 20-60 minutes using a semi-structured interview technique. Interview topics were based largely upon the Anticoagulation Forum recommendations (Garcia et al. 2008) and included ACC work flow, staf ng, organization, and quality assurance efforts. We also asked about the clinic 's patient population, the chal- lenges of managing anticoagulation, and the participant 's opinion of the clinic 's performance. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Observation. At each site, we observed approximately 4 hours of direct clinical care, which occurred face-to-face or by telephone. We observed delivery of care,work environment, work pace and flow, patient-provider interactions, and inter- actions among pharmacists and pharmacy technicians working in the ACC. Documents. We obtained ACC-related documents, including ACC protocols, note and consult templates from the electronic medical record, training manu- als for ACC staff, education materials for non-ACC staff, patient education materials, patient-provider treatment agreements, form letters sent to patients, quality assurance forms and reports, and screen shots of clinical management software used by the ACC. Data Analysis Using grounded thematic analysis, we coded interview transcripts, identifying broad \"domains \"of ACC organization and subtopics within each domain (Pat- ton 2002). Having coded the interview transcripts, we added information gleaned from the eld notes and the ACC documents. We synthesized the data from each site and produced a pro le of each site 's organization and manage- ment. As successive study sites were added, we used constant comparison to contrast our ndings from various sites, noting similarities and differences between high- and low-performing sites. We made a conscious effort to note counterexamples, particularly positive aspects of bottom-performing sites and negative aspects of top-performing sites. We identi ed key features present or1544 HSR: Health Services Research 47:4 (August 2012)absent at each site, noting relationships between these features and site performance. Finally, we performed internal member checking among our co-authors, many of whom have direct experience managing oral anticoagula- tion, to ensure that our ndings resonate with anticoagulation practitioners. RESULTS The six sites we visited represented six different states and all geographic regions of the United States. Details about site performance are located inTable 2. Table 3 lists the job descriptions of the 55 interviewees. We identi ed 11 domains related to site organization; six were related to site performance and ve were unrelated (Table 4). Although high outliers had all six of the features related to performance, no low outlier had more than two of them. The important domains were (1) adequate (pharmacist) staf ng levels and effective use of (nonpharmacist) support personnel; (2) innovations to standardize clinical practice around current evidence and guidelines; (3) the presence of a quality champion; (4) higher staff quali cations; (5) a climate of ongoing group learning; and (6) internal performance measurement. Domain #1: Staf ng We observed, and were told by interviewees, that ACC staff at the low out- lier sites had a rushed work pace and a chaotic work environment, whereas Table 2: Three High Outlier and Three Low Outlier Sites, as Measured byPerformance on Percent Time in Range (TTR), a Measure of Anticoagulation Control Site Number Outlier Status TTR, 2007 -2008 (%) 1 High 67 2 High 67 3 High 704 Low 525 Low 54 6 Low 54 Notes . Although Sites Were Selected for Inclusion Based on Risk-Adjusted TTR (Rose et al. 2011b), Unadjusted TTR Is Presented Here for Ease of Understanding. TTR was computedusing the Rosendaal method (Rosendaal et al. 1993). TTR above 60 percent is generally con-sidered adequate, whereas TTR above 70 percent is generally considered excellent.Characteristics of T op Anticoagulation Clinics 1545staff at the high outliers worked at a comfortable pace in a well-organized environment. Based on expert opinion, consensus guidelines for organizing an ACC recommend a ratio of no more than 400 patients per pharmacist full-time equivalent (FTE) (Ansell et al. 2008). Details about staf ng at our six study sites are in Table 5. In general, the adequacy of staf ng was not fully characterized by the patient/FTE ratio but also depended on the effec- tive integration of support staff into the ACC, the degree to which staff could focus on their ACC duties without other responsibilities, and avoiding an inappropriate reliance upon trainees (pharmacy residents) to provide manpower, as will be discussed below. Pharmacists. Anticoagulation clinic staff at low outlier sites consistently reported being rushed due to inadequate staff allocations; we also observed this rushed work pace. In contrast, staff at high outliers only rarely reported mild issues with staf ng related to vacations and sick leave.

An interview with one pharmacist revealed the stress prevalent at the low outlier sites: Q: Are you pretty happy with how your job here is going? A: I 'm overwhelmed ...over the years, our numbers have grown ...and no one has really looked at our workload and I think we 're really stretched. (Pharmacist, Low Outlier) A pharmacist at another low outlier suggested that being short-staffed may prevent them from following some patients as frequently as needed, a potentially serious issue with quality of care:Table 4: Summary of Six Anticoagulation Clinics on Six Domains Related to Site Performance and Five Domains Not Related to Site Performance High Outliers Low Outliers Site 1 Site 2 Site 3 Site 4 Site 5 Site 6 Domains related to performance Stafng Innovation Champion Quali cations Group learning Measurement Domains not related to performance Telephone clinic Commitment Integration Patient selectionTenure Key to table : =present during measurement period of 2007 -2008.

So I think we 're doing the best we can with what we 've got. (Pharmacist, Low Outlier) By contrast, ACC providers at the top sites had fewer patients per FTE, which was re flected in their work pace. One participant noted: I don 't think we 're capacity most days. I don 't think we have 40 face-to-face visits most days, but that 's good, because that allows us to see patients more frequently if necessary. There are still appointments left to see those patients without overboo-king. (Associate Chief of Pharmacy, High Outlier) Support Staff. Adequate staf ng also relates to the role of support staff, indi- viduals who work in the ACC but do not have the authority to prescribe war- farin. When present, pharmacy technicians were universally lauded as contributing to the smooth functioning of the ACC. For example, at one high outlier, four FTE of pharmacists were supplemented by two FTE of pharmacy technicians, who handle incoming calls, distribute workload, and mail letters,Table 5: Details for Clinic Staf ng in Six VA ACCs Panel Size FTEPatient/ FTE Ratio Support Staff Details High outlier sites Site 1 550 1.5 375 Specially trained clerksACC providers have considerable time for administrative tasks, much of which is also devoted to the ACC Site 2 1700 4 425 2 pharmacy techniciansWork flow is highly streamlined and is aided by clinical management software Site 3 250 1.5 167 None Low outlier sites Site 4 600 2 300 None Pharmacists not dedicated to ACC; distraction may reduce effectiveness Site 5 1000 1 1000 None Approximately 1 additional FTE of resident labor in ACC Site 6 800 1.5 533 1 pharmacy technician Notes . Panel Sizes Were Determined from VA Automated Data (Rose et al. 2011b), whereas Phar- macist FTEs Assigned to the ACC during the Measurement Period (10/06-9/08) Were Deter-mined through Interviews and Direct Observation. A Patient to FTE Ratio of No More Than 400Is Generally Recommended by Consensus Guidelines (Ansell et al. 2008). ACC, anticoagulation clinic; FTE, full-time equivalents (pharmacists, not counting support staff); V eterans Health Administration.1548 HSR: Health Services Research 47:4 (August 2012)thereby freeing the pharmacists to concentrate on higher level tasks, such as managing patients who are out of range. However, personnel other than phar- macy technicians can also provide effective support. At another high outlier, only the most experienced clerks are given special training and permission to schedule appointments for the ACC. Low outliers were generally character- ized by ineffective approaches to support staf ng: either untrained clerks or, at two sites, no support staff at all. Dedicated Time for ACC Duties. At most study sites, ACC pharmacists had ded- icated days when they staffed the ACC without other obligations. In contrast,at one low outlier, ACC pharmacists were simultaneously responsible for anti- coagulation and other tasks related to primary care pharmacy. Pharmacists at this site were frequently interrupted from ACC duties to attend to non-ACC matters. For example, we observed a pharmacist from this low outlier site treat- ing a patient who had suffered a blood clot in the lung. The patient was hard of hearing, possibly suffered from dementia, lived in a trailer, and did not fully understand or accept the need for anticoagulation. The visit was interrupted six times by people walking into the room (often without knocking) to ask thepharmacist questions in her role as a primary care team member. Each inter- ruption caused a loss of focus and momentum, and the overall effect was to prolong the visit and to transform an already dif cult encounter into an almost insurmountable challenge. Avoiding Inappropriate Use of Pharmacy Residents. At most of the sites we visited, pharmacy residents were in the ACC primarily to learn and were not expected to contribute greatly to staf ng due to their inexperience and need to be super- vised. However, at one low outlier site, residents were expected to be about as productive as the senior pharmacists. They handled about half of the work-load of the ACC and we were explicitly told that they constituted an important part of the staf ng plan. A pharmacy resident from this site, who had recently rotated through the ACC for a month, remarked: I feel like the pharmacy residents do a lot here ...just because there are so many patients ...I'm interviewing patients in 10 or 15 minute increments, very fast. (Pharmacy Resident, Low Outlier)Characteristics of T op Anticoagulation Clinics 1549The fact that half the care at this site was delivered by pharmacy residents may have contributed to uneven quality of clinical management. A pharmacist at this site admitted that the quality of the pharmacy residents can vary from day to day and from month to month: \"It's hit and miss with them. \"This does not suggest that these residents or their training are lacking, merely that they need to complete residency before so much can be expected of them. Domain #2: Innovations to Encourage Uniform, Evidence-Based Practice Top sites developed innovative ways for encouraging uniformity of practice. In general, the organizing principles for standardization were drawn from existing clinical guidelines about anticoagulation care, especially the Ameri- can College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for managing warfarin (Ansell et al. 2008). This domain, with its emphasis on the systematic pursuit of uniform, evidence-based practice, is also embodied in the Anticoagulation Forum Consensus Guidelines for organizing an ACC (Garcia et al. 2008). We noticed at least three examples of how sites pursued uniform, evidence-based practice: developing note templates as an aid to clinical reasoning and docu- mentation, adopting new software packages to enhance work flow, and devel- oping systems to reduce loss to follow-up. Evidence-Based Note T emplates. One way to reinforce evidence-based practice is to design note templates around it. Although all of the sites had note tem- plates, some were especially effective at encouraging adherence to clinical guidelines. For example, one site 's ACC Coordinator created a note to guide clinicians through the decision-making process of how to manage a temporary interruption of warfarin therapy for a procedure. Although this was a low out- lier site, this note was introduced after the measurement period as part of an effort to improve the ACC. Previously ...if we heard about a patient ...stopping [warfarin] for a procedure we would kinda wait and see if somebody had the idea of using bridge. I standard- ized that process ...[now] if we hear a patient 's stopping Coumadin he 's gonna do it through a standardized review process that 's based strictly on the [ACCP] guidelines. I created a note template that quotes what the guidelines say ...and then we walk 'em through the peri-procedure risk assessment note which gets documented in the medical record and is sent to the doctor. (Pharmacist, Low Outlier)1550 HSR: Health Services Research 47:4 (August 2012)Adopting New Software to Aid Clinical Practice. One high outlier site used a soft- ware package to help streamline anticoagulation management. Participants commented, and we observed, that the software contributed to this site 's abil- ity to handle a large patient load without compromising quality. The software improved work flow, helped make sure patients were not lost to follow-up, and allowed for internal performance measurement with a minimum of effort. A low outlier site also started using this software package in 2010 (after the measurement period) with similar positive results. Reducing Loss to Follow-Up. It is important not to lose ACC patients to fol- low-up, because without proper monitoring, patients may be at risk for seri- ous adverse events. All six sites had various techniques to avoid losing patients \u2014the most common was to limit warfarin prescriptions to a short period of time (often 30 days), to ensure that the patient must follow-up. However, some sites went farther. At one high outlier, the ACC Coordinator \"runs the list \"monthly to manually search for patients who have not been seen for over 30 days (a laborious process). The two sites that had adopted the new software package easily performed this task, because the software monitors this automatically. One low outlier had no system to prevent lossto follow-up: Actually we don 't have a system in place for that. Now, if we could run our clinics quarterly or have some kind of computer program where if a person hasn 't been to see us in say, two months, then we could follow it, but right now we don 't have a way of tracking 'em down. (Pharmacist, Low Outlier) Note that this pharmacist recognizes the potential for manually running the list or a \"computer program, \"elements that are present at the high outlier sites. Domain #3: Quality Champion The best sites had one or more strong quality champions for the ACC, although this champion could occupy many different formal positions. At one high outlier, this champion was the Associate Chief of Pharmacy, also the ACC 's founder. She wrote all the procedures for the ACC, trained her replacements, and continued to take a special interest in the ACC 's perfor- mance. At another high outlier, this champion was the ACC Coordinator,Characteristics of T op Anticoagulation Clinics 1551while at a third, the main quality champion for the ACC was the Chief of Phar- macy. In the following quote, a quality champion explains her role with regard to the ACC: I would say my main thing is to make sure that I really kinda do the quality aspect...make sure that the ...care that we 're providing is appropriate. That if we 're gonna offer a program, that it 's doing what it needs to do, and if it isn 't then what do I need to do to x it. (Chief of Pharmacy, High Outlier) None of the low outliers had a quality champion. For example, one low outlier had a middle manager in the pharmacy department whose job was tooversee credentialing, peer reviews, academic pursuits, and quality assurance for pharmacists. However, he had almost no role with regard to the ACC pharmacists, because they were located in primary care rather than phar- macy. Instead, these pharmacists were supervised by the director of primary care, a physician. Although she has made her primary care clinic into a model of performance, she saw the pharmacists primarily in their role as sup- porting cast for the primary care clinic and was relatively unaware of the pharmacists as the central movers in managing anticoagulation. Thus, there were two people quali ed to serve as the quality champion for the ACC (the pharmacy middle manager and the ACC medical director), but one was not given the authority to do so and the other did not see it as part of her job. Domain #4: Staff Quali cations Many pharmacists complete a 1-year residency after obtaining their PharmD degree. The purpose of residency is to gain a set of skills in a mentored setting, especially the ability to interact with patients to directly manage chronic con- ditions. All of the ACC pharmacists at the top outlier sites had completed resi- dencies in pharmacy. In contrast, none of the pharmacists at two of the low outlier sites were residency trained. We observed important differences between pharmacists with and with- out residency training. The residency-trained pharmacists had greater facility communicating with patients. The pharmacists that lacked residency training struggled to handle dif cult situations, often despite years of experience. At one site, we did observe a nonresidency trained pharmacist who was instead completing a protracted apprenticeship in the ACC. This suggests that other kinds of training can also help pharmacists to achieve a similar degree of facil- ity with the skills needed for direct patient management.1552 HSR: Health Services Research 47:4 (August 2012)Domain #5: Climate of Group Learning Clinicians frequently discuss dif cult cases to solicit the opinions and insights of their colleagues. At the high outlier sites, such interactions were explicitly encouraged, and they occurred frequently: So it 's good to have other people next to you in the room you can bounce ideas off of. (Pharmacist, High Outlier) These interactions were largely absent from the low outlier sites; provid- ers at these sites tended to practice without the bene t of their colleagues ' opinions. When asked about how often she seeks advice from colleagues, this pharmacist said: Not very often. I would probably have to say less than once every 3 months. I would say we don 't tend to collaborate a lot. (Pharmacist, Low Outlier) We directly observed a marked contrast between low and high outliers with regard to the frequency and quality of discussions of dif cult cases. The availability of colleagues for discussion at the high outlier sites seemed to con- tribute not only to the management of the case at hand but also to an atmo- sphere of learning from each other. Domain #6: Internal Performance Measurement The top-performing sites emphasized internal performance measurement. One high outlier manually collected data at every patient encounter (a labori- ous task) to be able to calculate and track percentage of lab values in range and rates of adverse events in their ACC. The Associate Chief of Pharmacy, when asked about the strengths of his site 's ACC, demonstrated detailed awareness of its performance: About two-thirds of our patients on average are within the therapeutic range. Our no-show and cancelation rate typically combined is less than 12 to 15 percent ... thromboembolism is usually less than two percent, and major bleeding is usuallyless than 5 percent. (Associate Chief of Pharmacy, High Outlier) At other sites, anticoagulation software or regionally produced perfor- mance reports made performance measurement particularly easy to accom- plish. One high outlier site began using such software well before ourCharacteristics of T op Anticoagulation Clinics 1553measurement period. A low outlier site recently adopted the same software. The ACC coordinator at this site commented: When we started using software as of January 2010, we kinda changed our QA pro- cess. We were now able to calculate our TTR or actually get reports from that from the software ...we look at ...thrombotic events, bleeding events ...patients lost to follow-up ...When the software took over we started doing that more rou- tinely...it's something that has become a part of our practice. (Pharmacist, Low Outlier) Low outlier sites did not measure performance in 2007 -2008, although two of them have begun doing so since then. At the third low outlier, the ACCmedical director admitted that they do not yet measure ACC performance in a rigorous, proactive way. When asked about ACC performance, she appeared to be unprepared for the question and thus uncomfortable with the topic. She focused on one-time episodes such as complaints or adverse events as a way to measure quality: You mean in terms of bad outcomes with the patients or in terms of? [Clears throat] Yes we de nite\u2014that, I would know [Clears throat]. We do have adverse out- comes. It 's something that we look at. So if ...a patient comes in with [a critical degree of overanticoagulation] and nobody did anything about it, I would know about this ...if there 's an adverse occurrence, then I 'm told about this. (ACC Medical Director, Low Outlier) In the absence of quality measurement, ACC pharmacists at this site believed that their clinic was doing very well \u2014but in fact, their TTR was among the lowest of any VA site. One pharmacist guessed that her patients spend 70 percent of time in range, whereas another guessed 75 percent. In fact, TTR at this site was closer to 55 percent, a large and clinically important differ- ence. Five Domains Not Related to ACC Performance There were at least ve domains that were not associated with ACC perfor- mance, although we had expected that they might be (Table 4). 1. We had expected to nd that quality might vary due to the con gura- tion of the ACC, that is, telephone versus face-to-face management of patients and the use of point-of-care ( ngerstick) testing versus reli- ance upon venous blood We observed highly variable1554 HSR: Health Services Research 47:4 (August 2012)congurations of care among our six sites. For example, three sites had predominantly telephone clinics and three saw their patients face-to-face, but neither model was associated with high or low outlier status. 2. All sites, whether low or high outliers, exhibited a strong commit- ment to serving veteran patients. Staff went to great lengths to help patients, contacting them after hours when necessary and even assist- ing them with matters unrelated to anticoagulation. 3. The VA 's integrated system of care, and particularly the electronic medical record, are thought to contribute to the VA 's generally high performance (Longman 2007). However, we did not notice any dif-ferences among sites regarding the extent to which they utilized these advantages. 4. We had suspected that high outlier sites might achieve better perfor- mance in part by being more selective in the patients they agree to manage (gaming). However, all sites went to extraordinary lengths to manage even the most challenging patients. 5. We had expected that ACCs established long ago might perform bet- ter than those established recently; in fact, only one of our ACCs was established less than 10 years before our site visit, and it was a highoutlier. In addition to these ve domains, it should be noted that the nine domains identi ed as important by the Anticoagulation Forum (Garcia et al. 2008) generally were not suf cient to separate high- and low-performing sites (Table 1). Exceptions included Item 3, where high outlier sites generally had better systems for tracking patients and preventing loss to follow-up, andaspects of some of the other items, in that high outliers achieved greater unifor- mity of practice. In most respects, however, high and low outliers ful lled the Anticoagulation Forum recommendations equally. DISCUSSION In this study, we visited three of the best-performing and three of the worst-performing ACCs in the VA system. We sought to understand how elements of ACC organization and management related to these differences in site- level performance. We found that six critical domains separated high and low outlier sites. Although we had anticipated some of these domains, ourCharacteristics of T op Anticoagulation Clinics 1555investigation revealed details that we had not anticipated. For example, while we had suspected that staff credentials might be important, we had assumed that all ACC pharmacists would be residency trained, and that those at the top sites would be distinguished by additional credentials. We discovered the importance of residency training through its absence among staff at some low outlier sites and its apparent impact on their fluency as cli- nicians. We also found that the recommendations of the Anticoagulation Forum (Garcia et al. 2008) were not suf cient to separate high outliers from our three low outliers. T o a large extent, all six study sites had met all of these criteria. It is apparent, therefore, that the pursuit of excellence in oral anticoagulationcare will require a comprehensive program of quality measurement and qual- ity improvement (Rose et al. 2009). In a previous study, we examined many of the same domains, including stafng, presence of quality improvement programs, and training of ACC staff but were unable to link them to site-level performance (Rose et al. 2011b). The previous study relied upon a site-level questionnaire to gather data, but complex ideas like adequate staf ng may not easily be encapsulated in a single number. In the present study, we examined not only the FTE ratio but also the context and con guration of care delivery, the work flow, and the importance of support staff in allowing pharmacists to focus on higher level tasks. The present study suggests that adequate staf ng is indeed important but that a simple numerical ratio of pharmacists to patients may not fully capture all the data needed to understand this issue. Anticoagulation clinics improve anticoagulation control and usually reduce adverse events compared with \"usual care \"(van Walraven et al. 2006; Ansell et al. 2008), but less is known about how ACC management improves these outcomes. Our study suggests that an ACC should be characterized by a core group of well-quali ed and well-trained staff, dedicated time to focus on anticoagulation (without other responsibilities), development of innovations to improve care, opportunities to discuss dif cult cases and learn from each other, internal performance measurement, and a quality champion, whose role it is to facilitate all of these other things. T o the extent that our low outlier sites lacked these features, they did not fully embody the ideal of an ACC. It should not be surprising, therefore, to nd that anticoagulation control at these low outliers was similar to what has been reported for non-ACC settings (van Walraven et al. 2006). Our study also suggests that building time into schedules for the purpose of problem solving and knowledge sharing can increase the value created per1556 HSR: Health Services Research 47:4 (August 2012)person. Discussion of dif cult cases allows for group learning and may even encourage group solutions to frequently encountered problems. In contrast, while providers at low outlier sites may learn from challenging cases as indi- viduals, such learning is unlikely to spur practice innovations. It may not be necessary to add additional people to set aside time for these activities; rather, by emphasizing these activities, an ACC can foster a climate of ef ciency in which people simply accomplish more and do it better. Insights gained from this study are not limited to ACCs alone. In fact, Curry et al. found remarkably similar themes that differentiated between hos- pitals ranking in the top and bottom 5 percent on risk-adjusted mortality after acute myocardial infarction (Curry et al. 2011). Thus, there may be consider-able overlap between the ingredients of success in a large program (such as treatment of myocardial infarction) and a small program (such as management of anticoagulation). This study has important strengths. Our in-depth observation allowed us to uncover previously unsuspected ndings, as discussed above. However, some limitations should also be noted. First, we were unable to gain access to some of the worst-performing ACCs in the VA system, primarily because those sites did not have an IRB of record, and therefore could not participate in research. We might have gained further insight had we been able to visitlow outlier sites with worse performance. Second, a considerable amount of time elapsed between our measurement period and our site visits. This was unavoidable because of the time needed to identify outlier sites and obtain IRB approvals. Third, due to time and resource constraints, we were only able to visit six sites. We might have learned more if we had visited additional sites. Fourth, we realize that local circumstances may contribute to some of the suboptimal features we observed, such as a heavy reliance on pharmacy residents, high patient-FTE ratios, or a lack of residency-trained pharmacists. Strategies for addressing local resource limitations are beyond the scope of our study. Finally, the site visitor was not blinded to outlier status, and the analysis of data was also not blinded. However, we consciously tried to notewhat was suboptimal about high outlier sites and what was good about low outlier sites. In summary, we found that six domains of organization and manage- ment are related to ACC performance. Clinics have the potential to transform themselves, and their performance, by focusing on changing these six domains for the better. This study reminds us that excellence is within our reach if we focus on the most important determinants of performance.Characteristics of T op Anticoagulation Clinics 1557ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Joint Acknowledgment/Disclosure Statement: This study was funded by the VA Stroke Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI), Project RRP-10- 054.

Amy K. Rosen, PhD,* Borzecki, MD, MPH wzz z Background: The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) use administrative data to detect potentially preventable in-hospital adverse events. However,few studies have determined how accurately the PSIs identify true safety events. Objectives: We examined the criterion validity, specically the positive predictive value (PPV), of 12 selected PSIs using clinical data abstracted from the Veterans Health Administration (VA) electronic medical record as the gold standard. Methods: We identied PSI-flagged cases from 28 representative hospitals by applying the AHRQ PSI software (v.3.1a) to VA scal year 2003 to 2007 administrative data. Trained nurse-abstractors used standardized abstraction tools to review a random sample offlagged medical records (112 records per PSI) for the presence of true adverse events. Interrater reliability was assessed. We evaluated PPVs and associated 95% condence intervals of eachPSI and examined false positive (FP) cases to determine why they were incorrectly flagged and gain insight into how each PSI might be improved. Results: PPVs ranged from 28% (95% for Postoperative Wound Dehiscence. Common reasons for FPsincluded conditions that were present on admission (POA), codingerrors, and lack of coding specicity. PSIs with the lowest PPVs had the highest proportion of FPs owing to POA. Conclusions: Overall, PPVs were moderate for most of the PSIs. Implementing POA codes and using more specic ICD-9-CM codes would improve their validity. Our results suggest that additionalcoding improvements are needed before the PSIs evaluated herein are used for hospital reporting or pay for performance. Key Words: patient safety, ICD-9-CM coding, criterion validation, adverse events, administrative data (Med Care 2012;50: 74-85) The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report To Err is Human1 increased national concern and focus on patient safety, prompting demand for evidence-based measures that couldbe used with administrative data to identify patient safetyevents. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs), released in 2003, were developed in response to this demand and represent asignicant contribution to the scientic detection of patient safety events. They are specically designed to screen for potentially preventable adverse events occurring in the acuteinpatient setting. Because they use administrative discharge data (known for its coding variability and inconsistency with respect to diagnoses and procedures), they were viewed as\"indicators,\" rather than as denitive measures, intended for use in quality improvement initiatives, case-nding activ- ities, and monitoring trends. 2 Although the PSIs underwent a rigorous development process, in which face, content, and construct validity were assessed,2and several studies have subsequently evaluated predictive validity,3-8concerns about how well the indicators identify true events and accurately reflect hospital perfor- mance have heightened with increasing use in public reporting. The National Quality Forum (NQF) recentlyendorsed 10 PSIs as consensus standards,9and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will soon be publicly reporting 6 individual PSIs and a PSI Compositemeasure on their Hospital Compare website and will betracking these through their annual payment program. 10,11From the *Center for Organization, Leadership and Management Research (COLMR), VA Boston Healthcare System; wDepartment of Health Policy and Management, Boston University School of Public Health; zBoston University School of Medicine; yDepartment of Surgery, VA Boston Healthcare System; 8Harvard Medical School; zDepartment of Surgery, of Surgery,Tufts Medical Center; **Tufts University School of Medicine;wwDepartment of Operations and Technology Management, Boston University School of Management, Boston, MA; and zzCenter for Health Quality, Outcomes and Economic Research, Bedford VAMC, Bedford, MA.

Positive predictive value (PPV), the proportion of flagged cases confirmed by chart review to have the PSI event, ranged from 32% for decubitus ulcer to91% for accidental puncture or laceration. 12-17These studies highlighted some of the limitations of conducting chart review (eg, unavailability of specific data elements; timeintensiveness; poor documentation); they led to recommen- dations for coding changes to enhance the specificity and PPV of certain indicators18and they provided guidelines for use of individual PSIs in quality improvement, publicreporting, or pay-for-performance initiatives. Despite these pilot study results, knowledge about the criterion validity of the PSIs is still relatively limited.Understanding whether AHRQ's results are generalizable to other healthcare settings is particularly critical, as healthcare systems move increasingly toward public reporting ofmeasures. Therefore, we undertook a study to assess the criterion validity of the PSIs in the Veterans Health Administration (VA). The VA is an ideal setting in whichto do this. It has a comprehensive, clinically integratedelectronic medical record (EMR), which enables centralized access to detailed clinical data and provides a reliable and efcient method for data collection. EMR data can be easilylinked with VA discharge data, which are known to have a high level of data element completion and accuracy. 19,20 Further, the VA is strongly committed to making perfor- mance and quality data publicly available.21,22VA PSI rates will be reported on both the VA and CMS Hospital Compare websites in the near future (personal communication,Dr. Marta Render, 4/11). Finally, although the VA is dedicated to \"accountability\" through its transparency initiatives, it lacks nancial incentives for \"upcoding\" ofdiagnoses, and has no penalties or rewards tied to PSI events. The specic goals of this study were to: (1) assess the criterion validity, specically the PPV of the PSIs, to determine whether PSI-flagged cases represented true ad-verse events compared with the gold standard of medical record abstracted data 23; (2) determine reasons why flagged PSI cases did not represent true events; and (3) recommendmodications to the PSI algorithms to improve PPVs. METHODS Study Design and Data This was a retrospective cross-sectional study using VA administrative and EMR data from VA scal year 2003 through 2007 (October 1, 2002 -September 30, 2007). We used hospital discharge information, including demo-graphics, ICD-9-CM coded diagnoses and procedures, and discharge status from the VA's National Patient CareDatabase Patient Treatment File.24On the basis of prior work, we eliminated nonacute care as the PSIs were designed to screen for events in the acute-care setting.25,26We also used a previously developed algorithm to distinguish electivefrom nonelective (ie, urgent/emergent) admissions as VAdata lack an admission type and this is required for the denominator of 3 surgical PSIs. 25VistaWeb was used to access EMR data from all VA facilities.27 PSI Definitions The PSIs are constructed as rates or proportions based primarily on relevant ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes. Each PSI is dened with both a numerator(complication of interest) and denominator (population at risk). We selected 12 of the 20 hospital-level PSIs for study based on their relevance to the VA population, observed VArates, and their potential preventability. These included decubitus ulcer (\"Ulcer\"), body (See Appendix for complete deni-tions.) These PSIs have measures. 9Pneumothorax, Dehiscence, Puncture/ Laceration, PE/DVT, and Respiratory Failure will be posted by CMS as individual PSI measures, along with the PSIComposite measure, a combined measure of these 11 PSIs, with the exclusion of Foreign Body28,29 We excluded the 4 obstetric PSIs, 2 PSIs with extremely low frequencies (Complications of Anesthesia and Transfusion Reaction), plus 2 PSIs based on mortality (Death in Low Mortality DRGs and Failure to Rescue)because they measure how well hospitals treat complications rather than how well they p revent complications.30 Hospital Sampling Criteria for hospital selection included: (1) obtaining a manageable number of hospitals for chart review; (2) selecting hospitals that represented a spectrum of PSI rates;and (3) ensuring that selected hospitals had an adequate number of PSI events available for chart abstraction. We rst applied the AHRQ PSI software (v3.1a) to VA inpatient datato obtain hospital-level PSI counts and PSI composite scores; these were generated by the software. 28,29Second, we grouped the 158 acute-care VA hospitals into 3 tiers basedon their observed and expected PSI counts (Fig. 1). Afacility's expected number of PSI events was calculated as the national VA PSI rate multiplied by the PSI denominator of that specic facility. The rst tier included hospitals withZ4 observed and expected safety-related events for each PSI, whereas the second and third tiers had Z2 andZ1Medical Care /C15Volume 50, Number 1, January 2012 Validating the PSIs in the VA r2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins www.lww-medicalcare.com |75observed and expected events, respectively. Hospitals with < 1 observed or expected safety-related event were excluded,yielding a sample of 79 hospitals. Third, within each tier, we ranked hospitals by the PSI composite measure and included the top 3 and bottom 3 hospitals. Fourth, we randomlyselected from the remaining hospitals within each tier to obtain a sample of 28 hospitals. Finally, to assure balanced geographical representation, 3 hospitals were replaced by thenext hospital in rank. 31 Case Identification Four flagged medical records per PSI were randomly selected from each of the 28 hospitals. On the basis of previously reported PPV estimates, 112 cases per PSI, asavailable, were selected to ensure reasonably narrow PPV condence intervals (CI range, 10% /C020%).32 Medical Record Abstraction Two trained nurse abstractors reviewed EMRs using standardized data abstraction instruments and guidelines adapted from AHRQ-developed tools33or developed de novo if there were no existing tools. Medical records werereviewed for: (1) the occurrence of a safety-related event; (2) demographics, comorbidities, and risk factors; (3) clinical circumstances surrounding the safety-related event; and (4)patient outcomes. To ensure consistency of abstracted information, we examined interrater reliability (IRR). Two nurses reviewed approximately 10% of the medical records of each PSI. IRRwas measured as the percentage of agreement across all questions on each abstraction instrument. Identical recordswere abstracted in groups of 5 until Z90% agreement was obtained; thereafter, they abstracted different records. Studyphysicians reviewed questions on which nurses disagreed, with resulting instrument revisions and/or guideline clari- cations as appropriate, and also reviewed cases for clarica-tion as needed throughout the abstraction process. Additional IRR assessment was performed on 5 charts toward the end of the abstraction process to check for abstractor reliabilitydrift; subsequent IRR testing revealed Z90% agreement for all PSIs. Analyses To determine whether our sample's PSI rates were representative of overall VA hospital PSI rates, we calculated PSI observed and risk-adjusted rates using the PSI software. Next, we categorized flagged cases as eithertrue positives (TPs) or false positives (FPs) based on the application of AHRQ's denition of each PSI and chart- abstracted information. FPs were cases flagged by the PSIsoftware that failed to meet the clinical intent of theindicator. To assess criterion validity, we calculated the PPV of each PSI and associated 95% CIs. PPV was calculated by dividing TPs by the number of flagged cases.We also examined FPs in detail to determine why they were flagged and gain insight into how the PSI might be improved. This included classifying reasons for FP occurrence, such aswhether FPs resulted from inappropriate coding or coding limitations. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Observed counts are the number of flagged cases per PSI. Expe cted counts are the number of expected cases per PSI. A facility 's expected number of PSI events was calculated as the national V A PSI rate multiplied by the PSI denominator of that specific fac ility. Our final hospital sample included 28 hospitals (10 in Group 1, 10 in Group 2, and 8 in Group 3). From each of the 28 hospital s, we selected 4 cases per PSI, for a total of 112 cases per PSI. FIGURE 1. Hospital sampling strategy.Rosen et al Medical Care /C15Volume 50, Number 1, January 2012 76|www.lww-medicalcare.com r2012 Lippincott Williams & WilkinsRESULTS Observed PSI rates ranged from 0.14 (Foreign Body) to 15.86 (Ulcer) per 1000 eligible discharges in our 28-hospital sample (Table 1). Ulcer and Respiratory Failure were the most commonly flagged PSIs (15.86 and 13.55,respectively per 1000 discharges). Risk adjustment had a noticeable impact on some of the indicators. Risk-adjusted rates were lower than observed rates for 6 of the PSIs,whereas some risk-adjusted rates were slightly higher than observed, particularly for Ulcer and Sepsis. Given the comparability of observed and risk-adjusted rates betweenthe 2 groups, our hospital sample appeared to be representa-tive of all VA hospitals with respect to PSI rates. Table 2 displays the PPVs and estimated 95% CIs for selected PSIs and the percentage of cases that were presenton admission (POA). PPVs varied considerably, ranging from a low of 28% (95 CI, 15% /C043%) for Fracture to a high of 87% (95 CI, 79% /C092%) for Dehiscence. Although there were some relatively low PPVs, particularly for Fracture and Ulcer, most PPVs were relatively moderate, ranging from 43% (95% 34 for PE/DVT for the PPVs of 2 indicators, Dehiscence and Puncture/Laceration, were relatively high (87% and 85%), respectively, demonstratinggood predictive ability. Many PSIs occurred before the index hospitalization. Overall, 17% of flagged cases were POA, with a range from0% (Respiratory Failure and Dehiscence) to 59% (Ulcer). POA was also a major reason for flagged cases being deemed as FPs (42% of all FPs were due to POA). For example,among cases POA Fracture Foreign Body (56%), and Derangement (47%). Because the PSIs with the lowest PPVs also had thehighest proportion of FPs owing to POA, we explored the impact on PPV by eliminating POA cases. As expected,the PPVs for these PSIs increased substantially compared to those of other PSIs. Of the 1266 abstracted cases, 41% were FPs. We categorized reasons for the occurrence of FPs among the 12PSIs (Table 3). In addition to POA, miscoding and lack of coding specicity were important reasons for mis-flagging cases, accounting for 28% and 16% of FPs, respectively.Individual manuscripts describing the clinical ndings of 10 of these PSIs are currently in press. 31,34-40 We use 1 PSI, PE/DVT, to illustrate the reasons for FPs. Miscoded cases represent those that resulted in a flagged PSI owing to being assigned an incorrect diagnosis or procedure code based on the documentation available inthe chart. Among PE/DVT's FPs, there were 24 miscodedcases. These included cases of arterial (not venous) thrombosis, supercial (not deep) vein thrombosis, and where a postoperative PE/DVT workup was negative or PE/DVT was a \"rule-out\" diagnosis. Lack of coding specicity refers to flagged cases that were coded correctly; however, the codes were not specic enough to distinguish between atrue PSI event and a nonevent. For example, 14 cases of PE/DVT occurred after admission but before the index procedure. Although these cases were appropriately coded asPE/DVTs, the codes were not specic to \"postoperative\" events. 31Two other cases in this category were coded correctly as \"thrombophlebitis\" events, but because some ofthe ICD-9-CM codes included in the PSI algorithm do notdistinguish supercial phlebitis (eg, inflammation of the supercial veins) from true deep vein thromboses (which is the clinical intent of this PSI), these 2 cases were flagged asPE/DVT events. 31 There were other less frequent reasons for the occurrence of FPs, some of which were more importantwith respect to specic PSIs. Three PSIs (Respiratory Failure, Derangement, and Sepsis) required a code for admission type to identify cases that were more likely to beTABLE 1.

Misidentication of nonelective admissions as elective accounted for a high percentage of the FP cases forthese PSIs, particularly Respiratory Failure and Derange-ment, (62% and 45% of FPs, respectively). 36,38A remote or previous history of the PSI before admission was another reason for FPs, particularly for PE/DVT (16% of FPs). Alsoimportant for determining if a case was an FP or not was whether the PSI event was related to surgery. Similar to PE/ DVT, both Fracture and Sepsis had PSI events that occurredduring admission but before surgery (15% and 13%, respectively), and were therefore not related to the index surgery/procedure. DISCUSSION This study explored the criterion validity of selected PSIs in the VA. Specically, we characterized one aspect of criterion validity, PPV, for 12 PSIs that were designed to detect complications that are potentially preventable throughgood care. Given increasing national focus on improving safety, accurate identication of safety events is critical for guiding improvement efforts. Our overall ndings suggestthat the original intent of the PSIs, as screening tools todetect potential safety events, may still be the most appropriate use of the PSIs, given the coding inaccuracies and limitations we encountered. We had several specic study ndings. First, consistent with the literature, 26,41-44we found that PSI rates weregenerally low; 2 PSIs were relatively rare (Foreign Body and Fracture), with rates less than 1.0 per 1000 discharges.Despite the overall low incidence of individual PSI rates,some PSIs, such as Ulcer (even with POA codes) and Respiratory Failure, had fairly substantial rates, suggesting clinical areas for targeting and opportunities for hospitalimprovements. As in earlier VA studies, risk adjustment had varying effects on individual PSIs 26,43in some cases, risk- adjusted rates increased by up to 10%, whereas in others,risk-adjusted rates decreased by up to 35%. Second, despite evidence on the accuracy and completeness of VA data,19,20all of the PSIs misidentied true events to some extent, with considerable PPV variationacross PSIs. This variation was likely due to codinginaccuracies or limitations (eg, differences in hospital coding practices, lack of POA codes, lack of precise or meaningful codes, poor documentation). We generally found moderatePPVs for most of the PSIs, ranging from 43% to 75%. Dehiscence had the highest PPV (87%), possibly for 2 reasons: rst, wound dehiscence is more likely to occurwithin the immediate postoperative period compared with other PSIs; and second, in contrast to other PSIs that had high percentages of cases that were POA but were missingPOA codes, Dehiscence had no FPs that were due to POAcases. 40 Our PPV results were generally comparable to those of other non-VA and VA studies3,12-16,45-47; for example, forTABLE 2.

For Postoperative Physiologic and Metabolic Derangem ents, we flagged 119 cases rather than 112 to ensure that we had an adequate number of diabetes patients who developed abnormalities of glucose control to review in additio n to those discharges who developed acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. We were not able to flag 112 cases for Foreign Body and Postoperative Hip Fracture because they were r elatively rare events. Parentheses contain 95% condence intervals (CIs). Positive predictive value (PPV) represents the proportion of true positive cases divided by the number of flagged cases. POA indicates present on admission.Rosen et al Medical Care /C15Volume 50, Number 1, January 2012 78|www.lww-medicalcare.com r2012 Lippincott Henderson al45reported of 55% compared with our PPV of 43%. A previous VA study compared 5 surgical PSIs with chart-abstracteddata obtained from the VA National Surgical QualityImprovement Program (NSQIP), a program designed to promote quality improvement through dissemination of risk- adjusted surgical outcomes to VA facilities. 46Notably, our PPVs were higher for Sepsis 72%), and PE/DVT (43% vs. 22%) than those found in the earlier VA study, possibly owing to differencesin methodologies and abstraction tools used in the 2 studies, plus definitions of adverse events. Further, that study matched only about 50% of PSI-flagged hospitalizationswith NSQIP surgical cases because of NSQIP's exclusion criteria. Nonetheless, there are enough similarities between the various PSI validation studies to suggest that theshortcomings of the PSIs are more inherent to coding-relatedissues and practices, rather than specific to any 1 study. Third, there were several reasons for the occurrence of FPs; the 3 most common reasons included diagnoses thatwere POA, miscoding, and lack of coding specicity. The impact of POA codes on the PSIs is not unique to the VA. A recent AHRQ study found that including POA informationreduced the overall number of identied PSI cases by approximately 50%. 48The effect was especially striking forUlcer, where as few as 11% of originally flagged cases of Ulcer remained after inclusion of POA codes, followed by Fracture and PE/DVT, where as few as 21% and 43%, respectively, of originally flagged cases remained.48The recent CMS mandate to collect POA codes in all InpatientProspective Payment System hospitals should help mitigate this issue.49Although the VA lags behind the private sector in implementing this policy, it is currently collecting POAcodes at the hospital level. Once these codes are incorporated into administrative databases, they will help improve the PPVs of many of the PSIs, particularly those with the highestproportions of FPs owing to POA. Even for PE/DVT, cases that are POA or have a history of PE/DVT would be dropped, potentially increasing the PPV by as much as 13%,albeit decreasing the number of cases flagged. Another large group of FPs was miscoded cases. As illustrated by PE/DVT, the inability to distinguish the type andnature of the thrombosis was a common reason for miscoding,both in our study and in others. 15,31,45Lack of coding specicity was also an important reason for FPs among selected PSIs. For the postoperative PSIs, current ICD-9-CMcodes do not adequately distinguish the timing of the PSI event (ie, before, during, or after surgery). In addition, the codes may not match up with clinical criteria or nomenclature appliedby physicians when documenting patients' diagnoses. 15For example, at the time of our study, there were no existing codesTABLE 3.

The categories of miscoding and nonelective admission are mutually exclusive; other categories may overlap so that the numbers in the column do not necessarily match up with the number of FPs for each PSI; for example, most of the overlap is between cases that occur red during the admission but before surgery and those included under lack of coding specicity. \"Other\" category includes events that were intentional (eg, a patie nt with a single kidney underwent a necessary nephrectomy resulting in a need for dialysis and was flagged as PMD), documentation errors (eg, a patient who had diabetic ketoacidosis inc orrectly noted as a complication in a discharge summary by a physician, flagged as PMD), postoperative complications that were incidental to surgery (eg, using the PMD ex ample, a patient developed kidney failure from underlying liver problems but it occurred after having a minor surgical procedure, a mouth biopsy under local anesthetic.) These may also overlap with other categories.Medical Care /C15Volume 50, Number 1, January 2012 Validating the PSIs in the VA r2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins www.lww-medicalcare.com |79that would allow one to distinguish upper extremity from lower extremity DVTs, a distinction that is meaningful for preven- tion. To remedy some of these specicity issues, AHRQ proposed several coding structure revisions to the ICD-9-CMCoordination and Maintenance Committee, one of which, anew code specically for upper extremity DVTs, has been approved. 18Although miscellaneous coding errors and poor physician documentation may still remain as issues, thesechanges should improve both the codes and coding guidelines for PE/DVT.14 General coding changes to improve the inaccuracies and limitations in the ICD-9-CM coding structure, such as implementation of a \"timing\" code for diagnoses, would help to improve the PPVs of all selected PSIs. Improving thevalidity of all the PSIs could also be facilitated by standardizing coding practices, such as relying more on evidence-based clinical criteria for diagnostic coding, as wellas educating and training medical coders to improve bothgeneral and specic coding practices related to adverse event reporting. Providers could assist in this latter process by ensuring that relevant complications are well documented inthe discharge summary and that \"rule-out\" diagnoses are replaced by more precise diagnoses once appropriate tests have been performed. Incorporation of an admission typecode denoting an emergent versus elective admission into VA administrative databases would help to improve the PPVs of the 3 PSIs requiring this code in the VA. However,even in UHC member hospitals that code data with respect toadmission status, inaccurate admission status coding was still the most frequent reason for FPs, 13occurring in 5% of Respiratory Failure cases. Nonetheless, these recommenda-tions should be useful in leading to real improvements in quality rather than simply to changes in documentation/ coding practices.13 Our study has several strengths worth highlighting. Our 28 hospitals were drawn from a nationally representative sample of VA acute-care hospitals. Unlike most othervalidation studies that relied on paper charts,12-16,45we had access to a centralized EMR. This was useful in streamlining the abstraction process and facilitating accurateinformation retrieval through automated text searching foradverse events and preventing misinterpretation of data owing to poor text legibility. Study clinicians were available to clarify clinical questions throughout the abstractionprocess, which also helped to maximize the accuracy and reliability of our findings. Finally, we examined agreement between the 2 nurses at different time points, achieving ahigh level of abstractor agreement at each review. There were also some limitations. We were not able to report other aspects of criteri on validity, namely specicity, sensitivity, or negative predic tive value of the PSIs; this was beyond the study's scope and re sources. In addition, our sample sizes were small, preventing us from examining whether there was variation in coding acc uracy across hospitals. Although not a specic study goal, we attempted to determine the preventability of the TP cases in our clinically detailed manuscripts. 31,36-40However, we were unable to determine the actual number of cases associated with quality of care problems given the retrospective nature of the study,lack of evidence-based processes of care for some of the PSIs, information missing from the EMR (such as anesthesia reports), and the lack of control groups. As such, we are limited in concluding whether or not the PSIs, which shouldin theory be preventable if appropriate perioperative and in-hospital care are provided, do in fact, identify cases that represent true deficiencies in the quality of care and that can lead to or inform meaningful quality improvements. In conclusion, the PSIs appear to be useful tools for screening, case-nding, and quality improvement. Given the relatively moderate PPVs found, and the need for informa-tion on potential preventability and how often true events are missed, we believe it is premature to use the PSIs for public reporting or pay-for-performance. Further, without standar-dized surveillance systems in place to identify and track safety events nationally, higher PSI rates may be more a marker of improved screening practices or coding differ-ences rather than quality of care. 50Nonetheless, the PSIs are a step in the right direction, and it is still important to understand what the indicators detect and whether care could be improved.

Rosen, PhD, *wSusan Loveland, 8z and Ann Borzecki, MD, MPH wy# Background: By focusing primarily on outcomes in the inpatient setting one may overlook serious adverse events that may occur after discharge (eg, readmissions, mortality) as well as opportunitiesfor improving outpatient care. Objective: Our overall objective was to examine whether experi- encing an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality PatientSafety Indicator (PSI) event in an index medical or surgical hos- pitalization increased the likelihood of readmission. Methods: We applied the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality PSI software (version 4.1.a) to 2003-2007 Veterans Health Administration inpatient discharge data to generate risk-adjusted PSI rates for 9 individual PSIs and 4 aggregate PSI measures: anyPSI event and composite PSIs reflecting \"Technical Care,\"\"Continuity of Care,\" and both surgical and medical care (Mixed). We estimated separate logistic regression models to predict the likelihood of 30-day readmission for individual PSIs, any PSI event,and the 3 composites, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and the occurrence of other PSI(s). Results: The odds of readmission were 23% higher for index hospitalizations with any PSI event compared with those with no event [condence interval (CI), 1.19-1.26], and ranged from 22% the odds of readmission ranged from 15% higher for the Technical Care composite (CI, 1.08-1.22) to 37% higher for theContinuity of Care composite (CI, 1.26-1.50). Conclusions: Our results suggest that interventions that focus on minimizing preventable inpatient safety events as well as improvingcoordination of care between and across settings may decrease the likelihood of readmission. Key Words: patient safety, readmissions, adverse events, coordi- nation of care (Med Care 2013;51: 37-44) Despite improvements in patient safety resulting from the Institute of Medicine report \"To Err is Human,\"1short- comings in patient safety remain a major concern. Only 36% ofsafety-related hospital measures (eg, postoperative complica- tions) improved at rate >5% per year, compared with 84% of non-safety-related measures (eg, measures of effectiveness,timeliness, and patient centeredness). 2Although tracking safety event trends is complicated, standardized measures such as the Agency for Healthcare Resear ch and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) have hel ped identify hospitalizations with potentially preventable a dverse events (AEs), hospital variation in the safety of care,3-6and the consequences of AEs [eg, excess mortality, length of stay (LOS), and costs] duringhospitalization. 7-9 Nevertheless, by focusing excessively on outcomes in the inpatient setting one may overlook serious AEs amonginpatients that may manifest after discharge, 10,11important postdischarge safety events,12,13and opportunities for im- provement in postdischarge patient care.11,14Recent studies have expanded on earlier work linking PSI events with in- hospital adverse outcomes,7-9attributing postdischarge out- comes, such as readmissions, to PSI events that occurredduring the index admission. 10,11In 1 study of adult surgery patients treated in nonfederal hospitals, the 30-day read- mission rate increased by 44% when a PSI event occurred during the index admission.11Another study of privately insured adult surgery patients suggested that PSI events in the index admission were responsible for 11% of all deaths and 2% of all readmissions at 90 days.10From the *Center for Leadership, Organization and Management Research (COLMR), VA Boston Healthcare System; wBoston University School of Medicine; zDepartment of Operations and Technology Management, Boston University School of Management; yDepartment of Health Policy and Management, Boston University School of Public Health; 8Division of Trauma, Emergency Surgery and Surgical Critical Care, Massachu- setts General Hospital; zHarvard Medical School, Boston; and #Center for Health Quality, Outcomes and Economic Research, Bedford VAMC,Bedford, MA.

The VA is the nation'slargest integrated health care system, currently offering a fullcontinuum of care to approximately 8 million veterans. 15We also expand the previous focus from surgical cases only to both medical and surgical cases, making our ndings particularlytimely given the recent posting of VA 30-day readmission rates for pneumonia, heart failure (HF), and acute myocardial in- farction on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid ServicesHospital Compare website. 16,17Readmissions have emerged nationally as an important outcome measure, as they occur frequently (all-cause readmission rates range from 13% to20%), 14,17account for substantial costs (estimates as high as $25 billion per year have been reported),18and reflect poor quality of care during the index hospitalization, breakdown incontinuity of care, poor discharge planning, or the occurrenceof an AE in the index hospitalization. 11,14,19 Although a recent systematic review of the literature on readmission prediction models suggests that patient-levelfactors, such as sociodemographic and clinical variables, are strongly associated with readmission risk, it also noted that the lack of hospital-level and system-level factors (includingthe quality of inpatient care) limits the models' ability to predict readmission. 20By examining whether a PSI event in the index hospitalization increases the likelihood of read-mission, we may be able to improve the ability of the modelsto target those at high risk of readmission and thus facilitate the design of transitional care interventions. Our specic objectives were to: (1) compare demo- graphic and clinical characteristics of index hospitalizations with and without PSIs; (2) examine 30-day \"all-cause\" re- admission rates for index hospitalizations with and withoutPSIs; (3) assess whether experiencing a PSI event in the index hospitalization affects the reason for readmission; and (4) examine the likelihood of 30-day readmission on thebasis of the type of PSI event that occurred in the index hospitalization. METHODS Data Sources Our primary source of inpa tient data was the VA Patient Treatment File, an administrative database that containsinformation on all veterans discharged from VA acute-care facilities, such as demographi cs, principal and secondary diagnoses, and surg ical procedures. 21Because the PSIs were designed to screen for patient sa fety events in acute-care hos- pitals, as in a previous work, we eliminated the nonacute por- tion of care, creating a hospital d ischarge le containing only acute care.22We linked the Patient Trea tment File data to dates of death from the VA Vital Status File to obtain information on deaths within 30 days after dis charge. Study approvals were received from the relevant I nstitutional Re view Boards. Sample Our initial sample (n = 2,332,794) comprised all acute- care discharges from VA hospitals from scal years 2003 to2007 (October 1, 2002 through September 30, 2007). Similar to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Hospital Compare methodology, we combined hospitalizations in which the subsequent admission was on the same or next dayafter the prior discharge. 23There were a total of 60,032 admissions that were combined with a preceding discharge, which reduced the nal sample to 2,272,762 discharges. For these aggregated hospitalizations, admission attributes (eg,principal diagnosis) came from the rst hospitalization and discharge attributes (eg, discharge location) came from the last hospitalization. We dened an index hospitalization as the rst hos- pitalization that occurred on or after October 1, 2002 (the rst day of the study period) or 31 days or more after theindex discharge. Thus, patients could have multiple index hospitalizations (it is noteworthy that 55% had only 1 index hospitalization over the 5 y). Consistent with other stud-ies 11,14,23we excluded index hospitalizations in which the patient left against medical advice (n = 32,980) or was transferred to a non-VA hospital (n = 14,807). We also ex- cluded index hospitalizations documented as occurring afterthe patient's date of death (n = 3,899) (ie, data errors) or discharged after August 9, 2007 (n = 60,809), ensuring that any index hospitalization occurring toward the end of ourdata would have a large enough window after discharge to capture a readmission. This cutoff date, 51 days before the last day of the scal year 2007, accounted for the 30-dayspan from discharge to potential readmission as well as thereadmission's LOS (95% of all hospitalizations had a LOS <21 d). As nal steps, we eliminated index hospitalizations that died in-hospital (n = 58,767), and excluded 290 hospi- talizations that did not meet eligibility criteria for any of the PSIs used in the study (eg, obstetric discharges). We alsoretained the readmission information associated with all in- dex hospitalizations to examine reasons for readmission. However, for hospitalizations with multiple readmissionsoccurring <30 days apart, we kept only the rst readmission, excluding 31,696 subsequent readmissions. This yielded a nal sample of 1,807,488 index hospi- talizations and 262,026 readmissions for study. We dividedthe index hospitalizations into 2 groups for analytical pur- poses: index hospitalizations with a PSI event(s) (n = 27,958) and those without a PSI event(s) (n = 1,779,530). The PSIs The PSIs were designed specically to capture poten- tially preventable events that represent compromised patient safety in the acute-care setting, such as complications after surgeries, procedures, or medical care. The original 20 hos-pital-level PSIs resulted from a 4-step process including literature review, evaluation of candidate PSIs by clinical panels, consultation with coding experts, and empiricalanalyses. 24The PSI software uses secondary diagnoses, procedures, and other hospital discharge information to flag hospitalizations for potential safety-related events. The PSIs are calculated as rates, dened with a numerator (compli-cation of interest) and denominator (population at risk). Currently there are 17 PSIs, 7 relevant to surgical dischargesRosen et al Medical Care /C15Volume 51, Number 1, January 2013 38|www.lww-medicalcare.com r2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkinsonly, 8 to both medical and surgical discharges, and 2 to obstetric discharges.25 We excluded the following PSIs from all analyses: 2 obstetric PSIs as they are not relevant to the VA population;2 PSIs related to in-hospital mortality: PSI #2 (Death DRGs) and PSI #4 (Complications in Surgical Inpatients); and PSI #16 (Transfusion Reaction) which is very rare. Three PSIs, PSI #8 (Postoperative Hip Fracture),PSI #3 (Pressure Ulcer), and PSI #5 (Foreign Body Left in During Procedure), were used in aggregated PSI measures only (described below)\u2014the former 2 because they arepresent on admission about 70% of the time 26and therefore are not associated with care in the index hospitalization, and the latter because it is relatively rare.27This yielded 9 PSIs for individual analyses (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/MLR/A354 for PSI definitions). Four aggregated PSI measures were used for analyses. The rst measure was designed to capture \"any PSI event\" (yes/no) and contained the 9 individual PSIs plus PSIs #3, #5, and #8. Three PSI composite measures, developed inprevious work to compensate for the relatively low rates of individual PSIs, were also included in analyses. 28These measures, empirically derived through factor analyses andclinical judgment, grouped individual PSIs into clinically meaningful categories. The \"Continuity of Care\" composite contained PSIs that reflect continuity of care and medicalmanagement of high-risk patients in the perioperative included PSIs reflecting technical skill-based care: PSI #5 Body Left in During Procedure), #9 (Postoperative Hemorrhage or Hematoma), PSI #14(Postoperative Wound Dehiscence), and PSI #15 (Accidental Puncture or Laceration). The \"Mixed\" composite included both surgical and medical PSIs: #6 (Iatrogenic Pneu-mothorax) and Vein Thrombosis). Because the PSIs were developed and tested using hospital discharge abstracts from AHRQ's HCUP State In- patient Databases, they require UB-92 (1992 Uniform Bill)data elements from hospital claims, 22some of which are missing from VA databases. Consequently, we used pre- viously developed algorithms to calculate certain variables,such as principal procedure, that were not readily available from the data. 29 Outcome Measure The primary outcome measure was a 30-day all-cause readmission, dened as a readmission occurring for any di-agnosis within 30 days of an index discharge. Analyses Analyses were performed by applying the PSI software (version 4.1a) and the statistical analysis system (SAS, ver- sion 9.1.3) to our dataset. We ran descriptive statistics,ttests, and w2tests as appropriate, to compare demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as rates of readmission, between index hospitalizations with and without any PSI event. We also explored whether having any PSI event in theindex hospitalization (prior PSI event) was related to thereason for readmission, dened by the principal diagnosis or the primary cause of readmission. 21To provide a more meaningful description of the reason for each readmission,we grouped the principal diagnosis of the readmission as- sociated with each index hospitalization into a discrete cat- egory using the clinical classication software (CCS), a tooldeveloped by AHRQ for clustering patient diagnoses and procedures into a manageable number of clinically mean- ingful categories. 30 As a nal step, we developed separate logistic re- gression models to predict the likelihood of 30-day read- mission for any PSI event, selected PSIs, and each of the 3PSI composite measures, controlling for age, sex, 27 co-morbidities that are included in the AHRQ comorbidity software, 31and the occurrence of any other PSI(s). To ex- plore the impact of multiple PSIs, we ran a logistic re-gression model among hospitalizations with at least 1 PSI, and included a variable indicating 2 or more PSIs. Odds ratios and 95% condence intervals (CIs) were calculated foreach of the 13 models. As a sensitivity analysis to account for the potential correlation among repeated hospitalizations for the same patient, we reran the logistic regression modelsnesting hospitalizations within patients; to account for anychanges in readmissions over time, we included dummy variables for \"year.\" RESULTS Characteristics of Index Hospitalizations As shown in Table 1, our sample was predominantly male, with a mean age of 64.8 years (SD = 12.9) and LOSof 6.6 days (SD = 35.4). Compared with index hospital- izations without any PSI event, those with any PSI event were slightly older (67.8 vs. 64.8 y, respectively), had muchlonger LOS (24.2 vs. 6.3 d), were more likely to be hospi-talized for a surgical rather than a medical inpatient stay (62.1% vs. 37.9%), and were more likely to die within 30 days after discharge (9.4% vs. 3.4%). Hospitalizations withany PSI event also had higher rates of HF and renal failure compared with hospitalizations without events (10.4% vs. 6.9% and 8.1% vs. 6.1%, respectively). In addition, read-mission rates were higher for index hospitalizations with any PSI event compared with those without an event (18.6% vs. 14.4%, respectively) ( P< 0.0001 for all listed comparisons). Rates of readmission were consistently higher for index hospitalizations with selected PSIs and PSI com- posites compared with hospitalizations without these events(Table 2). Differences in readmission rates were greatest forindex hospitalizations and iologic and Metabolic Derangements (23.8% vs. 11.4%, respectively). Among composites, the largest difference inreadmission rates was for index hospitalizations with and without the Continuity of Care composite (18.7% vs.Medical Care /C15Volume 51, Number 1, January 2013 Impact of PSIs on Readmissions in the VA r2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins www.lww-medicalcare.com |3911.3%, respectively) (all comparisons were signicant at P< 0.0001). We explored differences in the top 10 reasons for re- admission among index hospitalizations with and without any prior PSI event. Although the causes of readmission, asillustrated by CCS categories, were generally similar be- tween the 2 groups (Table 3), there were some differences in prevalence rates for specic CCS categories. For example,\"complications of surgical procedures or medical care\" and\"complication of device\" were the top reasons for read- mission (6.5% and 5.0% of readmissions, respectively) among hospitalizations with any prior PSI event; both ofthese occurred less frequently among those without any prior PSI event (4.8% and 2.8%, respectively). Similarly, although pneumonia and urinary tract infections were among the topreasons for readmission for hospitalizations with any prior PSI event (4.7% and 4.2%, respectively), these were not as frequent among those without any prior PSI event (3.7% and2.4%, respectively) (all comparisons were signicant atP< 0.0001). Moreover, septicemia (another poten- tially hospital-related infection) occurred in 4.0% of read- missions associated with index hospitalizations that had anyprior PSI event, it was not among the top 10 reasons for readmission in hospitalizations that did not have any prior PSI event. The odds of readmission were 23% higher for index hospitalizations with any PSI event compared with those with no event (CI, 1.19-1.26) (Table 4). The odds of read-mission were higher for all selected PSIs except Accidental Puncture or Laceration, ranging from 22% higher for Iatro-genic Pneumothorax (CI, Postoperative Wound Dehiscence (CI, 1.27-2.05). Thissuggests that index hospitalizations with a particular PSI, such as Postoperative Wound Dehiscence, had a greater likelihood of readmission than index hospitalizations that didnot have that individual PSI (although they could have had other PSIs in the index hospitalization). For the composites, the odds of readmission ranged from 15% higher for theTechnical Care composite (CI, 1.08-1.22), compared withthose without any of the PSIs comprising this composite, to 37% higher for the Continuity of Care composite (CI, 1.26-1.50). Interestingly, among those with at least 1 PSIevent, the odds of readmission were 1.15 (CI, 1.02-1.31) for those that had 2 or more PSI events. Nesting hospitalizations within patients, and including dummy variables for time, hadno impact on results. DISCUSSION A few recent studies provide some empirical evidence that PSI events can increase the risk of readmission.10,11We explore this relationship in the VA health care system, which has a state-of-the-art electronic medical record system and a strong commitment to providing high-quality care and im-proving discharge planning. 32,33,34Compared with other studies, our study population is broader, and we examine the types of PSIs associated with the greatest likelihood of re- admission. Our study is also one of the rst to ascertainwhether experiencing a PSI event in the index hospitalization is associated with the risk of readmission.TABLE 1.

First, our results are consistent with the literature suggesting the po- tential impact of safety-related events on increased risk of readmission and other outcomes.4,8-11,22Second, despite the relatively low prevalence of individual PSIs, index hospi-talizations with selected PSIs had signicantly higher read- mission rates than those without PSIs. In some instances, the odds were almost double. Having multiple PSI events in-creased the odds even more. Readmission rates were also higher for index hospitalizations with PSI composites com- pared with those without the composites, and, similar toother studies, for index hospitalizations with any PSI event compared with those with no event. 10,11The risk of read- mission was about 60% higher for index hospitalizations inwhich a Postoperative Hemorrhage or Hematoma or Post- operative Wound Dehiscence occurred compared with those in which these particular PSIs did not occur. In contrast,Friedman et al 11found the highest risk of 30-day read- mission among patients who had a Postoperative Pulmonary Embolism/Deep Vein Thrombosis or Accidental Puncture or Laceration in the index admission, whereas Encinosa andHellinger 10found the highest risk of 90-day readmission among related Metabolic Derange-ments, and Failure. Differences in study methods, patient populations, readmission denitions, and random variation may explain the impact of differentPSIs in each study. Third, we found that the occurrence of any PSI event in the index hospitalization was reflected in the reason for re- admission. In general, index hospitalizations with any priorPSI event had a greater likelihood of readmission for com- plications related to surgical or medical care or implanted devices, or for acute problems such as infections that mightbe hospital acquired, compared with those without any prior PSI event. It is noteworthy that index hospitalizations with- out any prior PSI event were likely to be readmitted forexacerbations of chronic conditions, such as HF. Our ndings suggest that 1 way to reduce readmissions is to target and minimize potentially preventable AEs thatoccur in hospitals. The establishment of surgical checklists,training of staff in patient safety, hospital-wide efforts to reduce hospital-acquired infections, and developing in- centives to improve care are just a few examples of possiblesteps hospitals can take to reduce readmissions. 35Moreover, early follow-up and monitoring of surgical discharges may help prevent continuation of in-hospital complications intothe postdischarge period and detect delayed complications early. 13 Index hospitalizations with PSIs reflecting continuity of care had a higher likelihood of being readmitted thanhospitalizations that did not have these PSIs. This composite comprises the same PSIs that had the greatest impact on likelihood of readmission in Encinosa and Hellinger's 10 study, providing further empirical support for the validity of this composite construction. As readmissions are sometimes thought of as \"missed opportunities to better coordinatecare,\" 19our results provide additional evidence that inter- ventions to improve coordination of care across inpatientTABLE 2.

Our study has several important strengths. Unlike previous cross-sectional studies in this area that examined surgical cases only, 10,11we used 5 years of VA nationwide data, and included both medical and surgical discharges,providing an opportunity to examine PSI events and read-missions on a large population of patients. Use of composite measures helped ensure adequate statistical power to test the association between PSIs and readmissions. The consistencyof our results with those of the private sector 10,11pro- vides increased evidence of the impact of the PSIs on readmissions. There were also some limitations. We lacked clinical data for risk adjustment, thereby limiting the ability to as- certain patients' severity of illness. We lacked current data;however, PSI and readmission rates have remained relativelystable over time, suggesting that use of more recent dataTABLE 3.

For example, some PSI events were likely to be present on admission, and some of the conditions that were incorporatedas comorbidities could have been complications of care. 26,43 However, several recent studies show that a number of the PSIs (including those with the highest impact on read- missions in our study) have moderate to good positive pre-dictive ability based on chart review. 44-47In addition, we did not examine organizational-level factors potentially asso- ciated with readmissions, because our primary focus was onthe relationship between PSIs and readmissions. Future studies should examine their impact on readmissions. Fi- nally, we could not establish causality between PSIs andreadmissions because unobserved patient or provider factors could affect both measures, nor could we determine whether readmissions were clinically related to the index hospital-ization, planned, or potentially preventable. The relative lack of direct nancial incentives in the VA compared with the private sector may result in less pressure to decrease readmission rates in the VA. However,the VA operates in an increasingly budget-constrained en- vironment, and the public reporting of VA readmission rates should increase pressure to better understand the causes ofreadmissions and to develop interventions to reduce them. Although previous studies have linked readmissions with the quality of inpatient care during the index hospitalization, 48,49 our study suggests that focusing on AEs that occur during theindex hospitalization provides another important way of viewing readmission as an indicator of quality of care. Thus, efforts to reduce readmissions should also incorporate qual-ity improvement initiatives targeted at minimizing and pre- venting inpatient AEs. REFERENCES 1. Institute of Medicine.

Several risk stratification schemes have been developed for assessing the relative risk of stroke in patients with non-valvular AF [2-8 ], and such information may help clinicians in making more informed decisions regarding clinical management. While these risk stratification schemes were devel-oped for use in individual patients, they may also be useful in popu lation-based studies [9- 14]. For individual patients, chart reviews to obtain prior and current medical conditions are typically used for identifying characteristics as-sociated with increase d risks of stroke. How- ever, for assessing relative risks for large co-horts of patients, administrative data is often more feasible. There is disagreement on which risk stratifica- tion scheme provides the most useful informa-tion in patients with AF. We have chosen to fo-cus on the CHADS2 because its elements (age and diagnoses) are often available in large ad-ministrative databases [6]. (Some risk stratifica-tion schemes use data that is less commonly available in such databases, such as systolic blood pressure or heart size measurements from echocardiograms [3-5].) In the CHADS2 scheme, a score is created by adding one point for each of the elements of Congestive heart failure (CHF), Hypertension, Age 75 or Diabe- tes, and two points for pr ior Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) [6]. In the initial validation of CHADS2 in Medicare beneficiaries, a chart review was used to identify the presence of hy-pertension, a history of stroke or TIA and, for most of the cohort, diabetes [6]. However, Inter-national Classification of Diseases, 9th Revi-sion, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) codes were Am J Cardiovasc Dis 2012;2(3):184-191 www.AJCD.us /ISSN:2160-200X/AJCD1205003 Original Article Choices in the use of ICD-9 codes to identify stroke risk factors can affect the apparent population-level risk factor prevalence and distribution of CHADS2 scores James A Rothendler1,2, Adam J Rose1,3, Joel I Reisman1, Dan R Berlowitz1,2,3, Lewis E Kazis1,2 1Center for Health Quality, Outcomes and Economic Resea rch, Health Services Research and Development, Bedford VA Medical Center, Bedford, MA, USA; 2Department of Health Policy and Management, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA; 3Department of Medicine, Section of Gene ral Internal Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA Received May 18, 2012; Accepted June 10, 2012; Epub July 25, 2012; Published August 15, 2012 Abstract : While developed for managing individu als with atrial fibrillation, risk st ratification schemes for stroke, such as CHADS2, may be useful in population -based studies, including those assessing process of care. We investigated how certain decisions in identifying diagnoses from administ rative data affect the apparent prevalence of CHADS2- associated diagnoses and distribution of scores. Two sets of ICD-9 codes (more restrictive/ more inclusive) were de- fined for each CHADS2-associated diagnosis. For stroke/trans ient ischemic attack (TIA), the more restrictive set was applied to only inpatient data. We varied the number of years (1-3) in searching for relevant codes, and, except for stroke/TIA, the number of instances (1 vs. 2) that diagnose s were required to appear. The impact of choices on ap- parent disease prevalence varied by type of choice and condition, but was ofte n substantial. Choices resulting in sub- stantial changes in prevalence also te n d e d t o b e a s s o c i a t e d w i t h m o r e s u b s tantial effects on the distribution of CHADS2 scores.

ICD-9 codes w e r e a l s o u s e d t o i d e nt i fy the presence of dia- betes for some of the patients. In a subsequent study comparing the CHADS2 to other risk ad-justment schemes, any history of CHF was sub-stituted for recent exacerbations [8]. Since the initial validation of CHADS2, a number of population-based studies have defined the elements of the CHADS2, in whole or in part, by the use of ICD-9 diagnosis codes [9-12]. How-ever, in defining the various elements of the CHADS2, there have been differences among studies in the specifications of sets of ICD-9 codes associated with each condition, the num-ber of times that a code was required to be pre-sent or the use of inpatient vs. outpatient data-sets from which codes are extracted. Further-more, there has been variation in the time inter-val used in searching for such codes. Studies that have focused on validating sets of ICD-9 codes to represent the types of clinical conditions associated with the CHADS2 scheme have reported differences in sensitivity and specificity based on similar types of choices [15-19]. Use of ICD-9 codes to identify stroke has been particularly difficult in regard to identifying code sets that have both high sensitivity and specificity [19-21]. Ther efore, among investiga- tors who have used ICD-9-based datasets in defining CHADS2 scores, variation in codes to identify CHADS2 conditions is probably not sur-prising. Differences in choices regarding how ICD-9 codes are used to identify the clinical conditions associated with CHADS2 could also impact the distribution of CHADS2 sc ores at the population level. This, in turn, could affect statistical asso-ciations and conclusions. The purpose of this study was to assess how different sets of ICD-9 codes as well as other decisions (such as the number of times a code appears and the time over which the presence of codes is searched) affect the apparent prevalence of CHADS2-associated conditions an d the distribution of CHADS2 scores in a population of patients with non-valvular AF. Methods Datasets Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) national datasets encompassing outpatient visits and/or acute inpatient hospitaliz a t i o n s w e r e u s e d t o determine the presence of certain ICD-9 codes, as further specified below. Population Patients with \"non-valvular\" AF were identified from among those cared for in the VA during fiscal year (FY) 2007 (October 2006 through September 2007). Diagnoses for AF were based on having two or more inpatient or outpatient ICD-9 codes of 427.31 separated by at least 60 days. Patients were excluded if there was a his- tory of valvular heart disease manifested by mitral stenosis or certain types of prior cardiac valve surgery [22], as indicated by the following ICD-9 These exclu-sion diagnoses were based on outpatient or inpatient records in the three years prior to the initial diagnosis of AF identified in FY2007. ICD-9 definitions for CHADS2 components A number of reports in the literature that incor-porate CHADS2 scores have defined the pres-ence of CHF, hypertension, diabetes or stroke/TIA using sets of ICD-9 codes [9-12]. Other re-ports, not involved with CHADS2, have studied ICD-9 code sets for these conditions in compari-son to chart reviews [15, 16, 18, 19]. \"Core\" sets of codes often include 428.x for CHF, 401.xx-405.xx for hypertension and 250.x for diabetes. Additional codes for each condition, typically associated with other comorbidities or complications, have been used by some investi-gators. For example, the set 437.2, and that for diabetes has included 357.2, 362.0 and 366.41 [10, 19]. While it did not seem likely that use of these additional codes would identify a substantial number of additional patients with the relevant condition, we investigated this issue by specifying \"more restrictive\" and \"more inclusive\" code sets, as indicated in Table 1 . Compared to the other CHADS2 conditions, the use of ICD-9 codes to identify patients with prior ischemic stroke or TIA is more problematic. Be-cause the CHADS2 scheme includes any prior history of ischemic stro k e o r T I A , i t b e c o m e s Choices in the use of ICD-9 codes to identify stroke risk factors 186 Am J Cardiovasc Dis 20 12;2(3):184-191 important to search for records indicating prior in addition to acute even ts. Validation studies in the literature have typically assessed the codes associated with acute strokes associated with hospitalizations, and even in that setting, it has been difficult to identify code sets that have both good sensitivity an d specificity [20, 21]. Using one year of inpa tient records, Birman- Deych reported use of an ICD-9 code set that achieved a sensitivity of 58% for detecting acute or prior strokes, but patients in the cohort were selected based on a hospitalization for AF [19]. In attempting to identify any history of an ischemic stroke or TIA in a population that in-cludes individuals without hospitalizations within a specified span of data, it would seem important to include ou tpatient records. How- ever, we are not aware of published studies that have reported on systematic validation of outpa-tient ICD-9 codes for ei ther acute or prior strokes (or TIAs). While we included outpatient codes in our more inclusive code set, as indi-cated below, we recognize that the accuracy of such codes is unknown at this time. For the more restrictive code set for stroke/TIA, we included ICD-9 codes 433.x1 and 434.x1 identified from acute inpatient records, as these codes have been found to have high specificity and positive predictive value [20]. Also included in the restrictive set is 435.x for TIA. We ac-cepted these codes in any position in the list of discharge diagnoses. For the more inclusive code set, we included codes that appeared in either acute inpatient or in outpatient records. In addition to 433.x1, 434.x1 and 435.x, we included codes 436 and 438.x. Investigators who have defined CHADS2 using ICD-9 codes have often included code 436 (\"Acute, but ill-de fined, cerebrovascular disease\") in identifying st roke [9-12], although it had a positive predictive value of only 48% in VA inpatient datasets [20]. We included ICD-9 code 438.x (\"Late effects of cerebrovascular dis-ease\") in an effort to detect previous strokes [11, 19]. One potential issue is whether, in the outpatient setting, prior strokes are being coded with 438.x or with one of the codes more typi-cally associated with acute events. Yiannakou-lias et al found that in certain outpatient facili-ties in the province of Alberta, Canada, ICD-9 codes 435.x, 436 and 438.x were the most common of those for cerebrovascular disease [23]. However, there we re substantial differ- ences among the facilities in which of these codes predominated. For example, at some fa- cilities, 438.x predominated, while at others, it was 436. While the actual medical conditions were not determined by chart review, the au-thors suggested that such wide variation in cod-ing was unlikely to be ex plainable by differences in disease prevalence. There was a change in the definition of ICD-9 code 436 beginning in October 2004 that was intended to remove th e words \"stroke\" and \"cerebrovascular accident\" (CVA) from its de-scription and to re-index those terms to other codes [24, 25]. However, it is unclear how this has changed coding practices in either the inpa- tient or outpatient setting, and some reference documents have continued to include, for cer-tain sub-entries, the te rms \"stroke\" and \"CVA\" in association with code 436 [26, 27]. Therefore we counted its presence in periods after Sep-tember 2004 as part of the more inclusive code set. V12.54 is a current code for indicating prior stroke or TIA without residual sequelae, but was not relevant to this study as it was not an official code until Oct. 1, 2007. In searching for relevant ICD-9 codes for each of the CHADS2 conditions, we assessed the effect Table 1. ICD-9 codes used to define more restrictive and more inclusive sets associated with the CHADS2 conditions. TIA: transient ischemic attack CHADS2 condition More restrictive set More inclusive set data Choices in the use of ICD-9 codes to identify stroke risk factors 187 Am J Cardiovasc Dis 20 12;2(3):184-191 of looking back 1, 2 and 3 years (\"lookback\" times) prior to the init ial diagnoses of AF in FY2007. Also, for diagnoses involving CHF, hy-pertension and diabetes, we explored the effect of requiring only 1 vs. 2 diagnoses during each of the relevant \"lookback\" times. Statistical methods We used descriptive analyses to indicate the prevalence of disease as a percent of all indi-viduals in the cohort. In addition, we assessed the distribution of the CHADS2 scores (0, 1, 2, or 3+) as a percent of all scores in the cohort for each of the choices rela ted to ICD-9 code sets, number of diagnoses and years of lookback. Results A total of 126,167 individuals met the study criteria for non-valvular AF. Their mean age was 74.0, and 98.4% were male. Table 2 shows the prevalence of the individual conditions that comprise the CHADS2 as a function of the ICD-9 code set (more restrictive vs. more inclusive), the number diagnoses required (1 vs. 2) and the number of \"lookback\" years used in assess- ing for the presence of diagnoses (1, 2 or 3). For CHF, hypertension and diabetes, the addi-tional codes in the more inclusive set made relatively little difference, as expected, in the calculated disease prevalence. However, the requirement of having at least two diagnoses substantially decreased the apparent preva-lence for all three conditions, especially with only a one year lookback, although the effect was greater for CHF and hypertension in com-parison to diabetes. For Stroke/TIA, there was a substantial difference in the calculated preva-lence of disease between the more restrictive and more inclusive code sets, mainly due to the inclusion in the more incl usive code set of diag- noses drawn from outpatient datasets. A major-ity of such outpatient codes were for 436, and there was also a substantial prevalence of 438.x and 435.x, whereas there were relatively few 433.x1 and 434.x1. For all four of the condition categories, the num-ber of years of lookback also had a substantial effect on the calculated disease prevalence. On a relative basis, the difference was most pro-nounced for stroke/TIA. Diabetes showed the least change as a function of years of lookback, perhaps because diabetes is so often a focus of office visits. Table 3 shows the distribution of CHADS2 scores as function of ICD-9 criteria, number of diagnoses required and years of database look-back. In this case, the more restrictive and more inclusive categories include the corresponding code sets for each of the four conditions. There were moderate differences in the CHADS2 dis-tribution between the more restrictive and more inclusive categories, mainly due to the preva-lence differences for stroke/TIA. The effect of the more restrictive/ more inclusive categories was greater for the higher CHADS2 scores. Varying the number of required diagnoses and Table 2.

As expected, there was a de-crease in those with scores of 3+ when two di-agnoses were required. Similarly, the number of patients with CHADS2 scores of 0 was substan-tially higher with one year compared to three years of lookback, and there was a correspond-ing decrease in the percentage of those with scores of 3+ with one compared to three years of lookback. For the more restrictive code sets, use of two diagnoses over one year was associ-ated with 12.1% of patients with CHADS2 score of 0, compared to 5% when one diagnosis was required over three years. Discussion Because the more inclusive sets of ICD-9 codes for hypertension, CHF and diabetes differed from the more restrictive sets only by inclusion of codes that indicate certain complications or comorbidities, it is not surprising that there were only small differences in prevalence be-tween these sets. However, for these same con-ditions, the requirements based on the number of years of lookback an d number of diagnoses required both had more substantial effects on disease prevalence. The extent of these differ-ences may vary among different healthcare sys-tems and their associated administrative data-sets. For stroke and TIA, there were also substantial differences in apparent disease prevalence as a function of the number of years of lookback. There were also large relative differences in disease prevalence between more restrictive and more inclusive code sets. For the more in-clusive code set, the increased prevalence was mainly due to the inclusion of codes in the out-patient setting, including those more typically associated with acute events. However, it is possible that in many cases of \"acute\" codes, the intent was to indicate a prior stroke or TIA. To the extent that prior strokes or TIAs were being diagnosed, the relative contribution of such data to the overall prevalence of stroke/TIA might be expected to have a larger effect in VA datasets compared to those of some other healthcare systems. This hypothesis is based on a report that most patients dually eligible for VA care and Medicare receive their initial care for acute strokes in non-VA hospitals, and such acute events would not typically be included in the VA acute hospitalization files [28]. As previ-ously noted, we are not aware of any validation studies in the outpatient setting for using ICD-9 codes to identify stroke/TIA, and chart reviews were not part of this study. Therefore, the rela-tive accuracy of different outpatient codes to identify stroke/TIA is un known, and further stud- ies in this area are warranted. However, the apparent prevalence of stroke/TIA of 13.1% using three years of data is similar to other studies that have determ ined the prevalence of these conditions in patients with AF [29, 30]. Consistent with the effect on disease preva- lence, choices studied in this report regarding identification of conditions from ICD-9 codes also had a substantial effect on the distribution of the CHADS2 scores. Reports in the literature that have assessed CHADS2 scores based on ICD-9 codes have varied in these parameters, and this may affect co mparison among studies [9-12]. Even in our \"more inclusive\" set of codes for stroke/TIA, we did not include such codes as 433.x0 or 434.x0 since these codes have been found to have poor positive predictive value for Table 3.

We also did not assess variation of disease preva-lence or CHADS2 distribution as a function of the position of a particular diagnosis (i.e. pri-mary vs. anywhere in the record). Such an as-sessment would likely have resulted in further variation in the observed parameters. For those ICD-9 codes identified from outpatient records, we included all outpatient services (including laboratory, radiology, etc) and not just face-to-face clinical encounters . This may also have affected the relative prevalence of these codes. There are several additional issues that may limit the generalizability of our findings. The VA population in our cohort was 98.4% male, and the VA population tends to have a higher preva-lence of comorbidities th an non-VA populations. Also, as previously noted, a substantial percent-age of patients dually eligible for VA care and Medicare receive initial care for strokes outside the VA. Therefore, the presence of outpatient codes suggestive of stroke/TIA may have had a greater influence on apparent disease preva-lence compared to other health care systems. In addition to care for stroke, many VA patients receive at least some routine outpatient care outside the VA, and the VA datasets may there-fore not reflect some comorbidities not ad- dressed at VA clinic encounters. Regarding out-patient diagnoses, the VA uses an electronic medical record (EMR) to document care. The EMR's characteristics and the methods by which providers choose ICD-9 codes using this EMR may result in different distributions of codes compared to those found in other health-care systems. Because of the presence of these issues, the actual numbers in this report de-rived from VA datasets ar e likely to be different in other systems of care. Although specific num-bers may vary, it seems likely that in other healthcare systems, decisions in identifying CHADS2 conditions using ICD-9 codes can simi-larly affect calculated disease prevalence and distribution of scores. Our goal in this report was not to define \"optimal\" algorithms to id entify the presence of the various conditions associated with CHADS2 from administrative data, but rather to demon-strate the variation that can occur in the ob-served prevalence of these conditions as a func-tion of choices made in their identification. While the CHADS2 often is used on an \"n\" of 1 basis for the clinical care of patients who might be at increased risk of stroke, the intent of this paper is to show the effect of different choices regarding use of ICD-9 codes in deriving the CHADS2 scores for application in population-based studies and not for individual patients. Researchers performing population-based stud-ies based on ICD-9 codes identified in adminis- trative datasets should be aware of how choices in specifying components of stroke risk stratifi-cation schemes, such as the CHADS2, affect the distribution of risk scores. Further studies would be useful to assess how such choices affect the accuracy of administrative diagnostic codes for different healthcare systems. In particular, vali- dation studies are need ed regarding the accu- racy of outpatient ICD-9 codes to indicate prior strokes and TIAs.

February 2013 volume 18 number 1 1 EDITORIAL Open Access Screening and brief intervention (SBI): has it hit the tipping point? Richard Saitz* In 1961, Chafetz [1] reported the results of a randomized trial of brief advice by a psychiatrist to patients with alco- holism in the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)emergency department (ED); 42% of patients in the advice arm reported to an alcohol clinic versus only 1% in the control group. Fifty years later, in the Liberty Hotel, thesame space as the former Charles Street Jail in Boston where there was a \"drunk tank \"and across from that same MGH ED, over 200 researchers and clinicians gathered topresent over 100 abstracts and plenary sessions on screen- ing and brief intervention (SBI). In those 50 years, thou- sands of patients participated in randomized trials of SBI;the US Institute of Medicine (in 1990) encouraged identi- fication and intervention for unhealthy alcohol use for people across the spectrum from risky use through de-pendence; the World Health Organization validated as- sessment tools and showed SBI 's effectiveness in primary care settings; and the US Substance Abuse and MentalHealth Services Administration allocated substantial fund- ing for SBI for both alcohol and other drugs across many general health settings. Research presented at the September 2011 International Network on Brief Interventions for Alcohol and Other Drugs (INEBRIA) conference in Boston was from aroundthe globe, covered alcohol and other drugs, crossed a var- iety of health settings and practitioners, and showed the sophistication that has been reached in the field. Researchdiscussed when, where, and for whom SBI has or might not have efficacy, how to implement SBI programs, adap- tations of SBI, costs and effectiveness, and many othertopics. Nonetheless, despite the excitement, breadth, and sophistication, the fact remains that few patients eligible for SBI receive the service, and, as a result, opportunitiesto improve health and save health care costs are missed. Most people with alcohol and drug use disorders receive no treatment.At least in some cases, SBI is ready for dissemination. And, with solid evidence available, health reforms promised in the US and elsewhere, and an international discussiontaking serious shape regarding the integration of care for medical, mental health, and substance use conditions, SBI may have reached a tipping point for dissemination and im-plementation as well as for sma ll- and large-scale studies of remaining efficacy and effectiveness questions. The editors of ASCP invited INEBRIA attendees and presenters to submit their studies for peer review and possible publication. The initial core of this thematic series, \"Screening and brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use, \"is the result of that call for papers, a seed that we expect will grow as the SBI litera- ture continues to become more robust. Papers will covera range of topics from what the efficacy of SBI really is, to effectiveness in people with mental health and drug use conditions, to adolescent SBI, to health professionalattitudes towards SBI, to SBI implementation research and even to state-of-the-art SBI research protocol de- sign, among others. We hope this series begins a longand serious conversation. Received: 6 June 2012 Accepted: 15 June 2012 Published: 28 August 2012 Reference 1.

The last 20 years have brought two major changes in the field of addiction. First, the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) encouraged recognition of a spectrum of alcoholand other drug use that affects health and is not limitedto those with the highest severity [1]. Unhealthy use(the spectrum from use that risks consequences throughaddiction [2]) among those without addiction is muchmore common than addiction itself. The second majorshift also began in the 1990s with an emphasis on addic- tion as a chronic illness [3,4] and on unhealthy use as a health condition. Although drug and excessive alcohol use clearly have social and other environmental determinants and conse-quences, there is little doubt that health care shouldplay a major role in addressing them. In the health-caresector, attention to unhealthy substance use cannot belimited to highly specialized care settings; most patients with these conditions appear in general health settings where such problems are all too often ignored. In 2006,the IOM urged improvements in the quality of care forsubstance use conditions [5]. Responding to that reportis a major impetus for the establishment of Addiction Science & Clinical Practice (ASCP) . We see this focus as unique among journals that address addictions. History of ASCP Addiction Science & Clinical Practice was founded in 2002 by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA),an agency of the US National Institutes of Health andthe largest funder of drug-abuse research in the world.In 2011, NIDA discontinued ownership of the journaland transferred editorial control to us. We hope to seeall of their subscribers and authors continuing the dialo- gue they established so well. Under NIDA 's stewardship, ASCP excelled at bringing researchers and clinicians together to better translate science into practice andback again- to blend the two by publishing reviews and roundtables. We aim to take the next steps in this the-matic direction: to serve as a forum for clinically rele- vant research and perspectives that contribute toimproving the quality of care (prevention and treatment)for people with unhealthy alcohol, tobacco, or otherdrug use and addictive behaviors across a spectrum ofclinical settings- from emergency departments to pris- ons, from primary-care offices to the Internet, and fromgeneral hospitals to specialty care programs. A modern publishing model for ASCP To achieve these aims, we have moved firmly into thecutting edge of 21st-centu ry publishing practices by teaming with BioMed Central. Although some feel tiedto print publications, we realize that, in 2012, mostscientific reading occurs online. We are interested inhaving a broad reach and large impact, and online open-access journals are best able to meet these goals. In this publishing model, authors pay the costs to pub-lish their work, which funders of research recognize aslegitimate and expected. For an initial period, we aregrateful to have support from NIDA that allows us todefray those costs for authors. With BioMed Central as publisher, ASCP continues to be listed in Medline, to have articles deposited in national and international repositories, and to make our content freely and permanently available around theglobe at no charge. Articles will be published immedi-ately upon acceptance and listed in PubMed shortlythereafter. Because they are widely indexed, articles inASCP are easily and freely discoverable through Internet search engines. We seek to have an impact beyond theusual calculations of citations; we want our articles to benefit people receiving care.

In addition to four known loci, we identified 13 loci newly associated with age at natural menopause (at P < 5 \u00d7 108). Candidate genes located at these newly associated loci include genes implicated in (also known as BAT2 )). Gene-set enrichment pathway analyses using the full GWAS data set identified exoDNase, NF-kB signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction as biological processes related to timing of menopause. RESULTS In our discovery stage of 38,968 women with natural menopause aged 40-60 ( Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), we identified 20 regions with SNPs meeting the genome-wide significance criterion P < 5 \u00d7 108 (Fig. 1). Four of these loci confirmed earlier reports of associations on chromosomes 5, 6, 19 and 20 (refs. 14,15; regions 5b, 6a, 19a and 20, respectively, in Table 1) and 16 loci were previously unidentified. We did not confirm one reported association on chromosome 13 (13q34, rs7333181, P = 0.12). The overall genomic inflation factor was 1.03 (Fig. 1, inset; SNP with lowest P value from each region, Table 1). There was no between-study effect heterogeneity across discovery studies ( P > 0.05/20 = 0.0025) for the 20 SNP associations presented. Within the Framingham Heart Study group, we tested for differences in effect size for the 20 SNPs in retrospectively and prospectively col - lected menopause age, and found no significant differences (data not shown). The effect sizes ranged from 0.17 years (8.7 weeks) to nearly 1 year (50.5 weeks) per each copy of the minor allele. We computed the effect sizes for dichotomized age at natural menopause in women from the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS). For early meno - pause, we compared women with age at menopause <45 ( N = 745) to those with age at menopause >45. For late menopause, we compared women with age at menopause >54 ( N = 1,632) to those with age at menopause <54. The estimated odds ratios for early menopause for the menopause-decreasing allele ranged from 1.01 to 2.03. The estimated odds ratios for late menopause for the menopause-decreasing allele ranged from 0.52 to 0.96 ( Supplementary Table 3 ). The top SNPs in regions 2c, 5a and 19b were >400 kb but <1 Mb from the top SNP in another region on the same chromosome. The top SNP in each of these primary regions had low linkage disequilibrium (LD; r2 < 0.5) with the top SNP in the nearby region. To determine whether these associations were independent, we carried out a conditional association analysis in the discovery study samples with the most significant SNP from each of the primary 17 regions included as covariates in the analysis. For regions 5a and 19b (rs890835 and rs12461110, respectively), the effect estimates in the conditional analysis were unchanged compared Meta-analyses identify 13 loci associated with age at menopause and highlight DNA repair and immune pathways Menopause is the cessation of reproductive function of the human ovaries. This life stage is associated with one of the major hormonal changes of women, characterized by a decline in secretion of estro - gen, progesterone and, to a lesser degree, testosterone. It influences a woman's well-being and is associated with several major age-related diseases including cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, osteoarthri - tis and osteoporosis1. Ovarian aging is reflected by the continuous decline of the primordial follicle pool, which is established during fetal life, subsequently leading to endocrine changes owing to loss of the negative feedback from ovarian hormones on the hypothalamic- pituitary axis. In addition to follicle loss, oocyte quality diminishes with increasing age, which is believed to be due to greater meiotic nondisjunction2. Oocyte quality may be controlled at the time germ cells are formed during fetal life, but it may also reflect accumulated damage during reproductive life and/or age-related changes in granu - losa cell-oocyte communication3. Although both oocyte quantity and quality decline with increasing age, it is unclear whether they are controlled by the same mechanisms and whether they decline in parallel. The average age at natural menopause in women of Northern European descent is 50-51 years (range 40-60 years)4. Heritability estimates from twin and family studies for age at natural menopause range from 44% to 65% (refs. 5-8). Thus far most genetic associa - tion studies regarding age at menopause have focused on candidate genes9 from the estrogen pathway10,11 or vascular components12,13. Recently, two GWAS have newly identified five loci associated with age at natural menopause on chromosomes 5, 6, 13, 19 and 20 (refs. 14,15). These loci, however, explained <1.5% of the pheno - typic variation of age at natural menopause, suggesting that addi - tional loci of small effect will probably be discovered in larger samples. Therefore, we conducted a two-stage GWAS of women of European ancestry, combining the women from the two previous GWAS14,15 with new participants for a total of 38,968 women from 22 studies in the discovery stage, and 14,435 women from 21 studies in the replication stage.

However, for region 2c, the effect size was ~12.5% lower in the conditional analysis than in the initial analysis, and the SNP P value was no longer genome-wide significant ( P = 9.8 \u00d7 107; Table 1), suggesting that the association with rs7606918 is not independent of the rs1018348 region 2b association. We attempted replica - tion only for the 19 SNPs that represented independent regions that reached genome- wide significance ( P < 5 \u00d7 108), thus we did not pursue replication of rs7606918. Replication We used 21 studies contributing 14,435 women for replication of the 19 SNPs that defined the independent genome-wide signi - ficant regions from stage 1. We defined age at natural menopause using the same criteria as in the discovery studies ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Of these studies, 17 ( n = 6,639) were included in in silico replication (Supplementary Table 2) ; an additional 4 studies ( n = 7,796) con - tributed de novo genotypes for the 19 SNPs ( Supplementary Table 2; effect sizes and P values for replication and combined meta-analysis of discovery and replication samples, Table 1). There was no evidence for effect heterogeneity among the replication studies ( Table 1). We also tested for heterogeneity between the in silico and de novo geno - typed studies, and found no evidence for heterogeneity of effect (data not shown), suggesting that for the significant SNPs, the genotype imputation methods did not lead to significantly different effect size estimates than would have been obtained from direct genotyping. Of the 19 SNPs, 17 were genome-wide significant and had lower P values in combined meta-analysis of the discovery and replication samples. Regions 5a and 13a showed no evidence of association in the replication samples ( P > 0.50) and were not genome-wide significant in combined discovery and replication meta-analysis. Four of the 17 replicated regions have been reported previously; thus our analysis identified 13 regions newly associated with age at natural menopause on the basis of genome-wide significant discovery with replication. In the combined discovery and replication meta-analyses, the effect esti - mates ranged from 8.2 to 49.3 weeks per minor allele. The estimated proportion of variance explained by the 17 replicated SNPs in the four replication studies with de novo -genotyped SNPs varied from to 4.1% (PROSPECT-EPIC). We used the largest study contributing data to our discovery GW AS (WGHS, n = 11,379) to explore whether substantial SNP-SNP inter - actions are present among the 17 replicated SNPs. We tested all 136 pairs of SNPs and found no evidence for interaction (all P > 0.01). Roles of genes at or near newly identified loci All but two of the replicated SNPs are intronic or exonic to known genes ( Table 2). The top SNPs in regions 6b, 12, 19b and 20 are mis - sense polymorphisms. Three of the four have been predicted to have damaging protein function by SIFT16, and one by PolyPhen2 (ref. 17). Using dbSNP and LocusZoom18, we identified the genes unde r lying the newly identified top regions. We used SCAN (see URLs) to identify all genes with SNPs that are in LD ( r2 > 0.5) with our SNPs ( Table 2). We identified all SNPs with r2 0.8 with our top SNPs and used several databases to determine whether the SNPs are associated with expression ( Table 2).The strongest new signal was on chromosome 4 (region 4, rs4693089; P = 2.4 \u00d7 1019). The SNP is located in an intron which the protein HEL308, a DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA helicase19. The second strongest new signal was on chromosome 12 (region 12, rs2277339; P = 2.5 \u00d7 1019). This SNP is a nonsynonymous variant in exon 1 of PRIM1 . The top SNP was significantly associated with expression PRIM1 in visual cortex, cerebellum and prefrontal cortex ( Table 2). Several other previously unidentified signals are located in introns of genes for which mouse models exist. These were region 8 in ASH2L (rs2517388; P = 9.3 \u00d7 1015), region 15 in (rs2307449; P 1013) and 1010). ASH2L encodes a trithorax group protein, and is involved in X chromosome inactivation in women20. POLG encodes the catalytic subunit of mito - chondrial DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for replication and repair21 of mitochondrial DNA. EXO1 is a member of the RAD2 nuclease family of proteins, which is involved in DNA replication, repair and recombination, and the top hit is in LD ( r2 = 0.83) with a functional polymorphism in EXO1 that affects a transcription factor-binding site in the promoter.

The top SNPs in two other previously unknown regions are non - synonymous coding variants. Region 6b, rs1046089 ( P = 1.6 \u00d7 1016), is in exon 22 of PRRC2A and was associated with expression of several transcripts in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region in several tissues ( Table 2).

The top SNP in the final newly identi - fied region, 16, is within 60 kb of three genes, TNFRSF17 , GSPT1 and RUNDC2A . It is in LD ( r2 > 0.5) with SNPs in these three genes and four others (rs10852344; P = 1.0 \u00d7 1011; Table 2). Pathway analyses We used three independent pathway-based methods to identify con - nections among our single-marker associations and link them with broader biological processes. Although all three approaches (ingenu - ity pathway analysis (IPA, see URLs), MAGENTA23 and GRAIL24) are based on published data, thus linking the gene products of our top hits to each other in functional pathways, each uses a substantially dif - ferent methodology and uses different aspects of our results as input. Thus, we expect complementary results from the three approaches. We used IPA (see URLs) to identify potential biological pathways common to the 17 replicated SNPs. On the basis of the genes physi - cally nearest the 17 loci, we identified four major functional networks applying direct interactions only ( Supplementary Table 4 ). Network 1, related to lipid metabolism, molecular transport and small molecule biochemistry, contained 14 of the genes nearest the menopause loci (P = 1 \u00d7 1030). Central to this network is the HNF4A gene, which has a role in diabetes. Network 2, containing 12 of the input genes, relates to cell cycle, cell death and cancer ( P = 1 \u00d7 1024). The ESR1 gene is central in this network, suggesting that genes in this network influence or are influenced by estrogen signaling. Network 3 is also partially related to cell death, and includes TNF and NF- B (P = 1 \u00d7 1019). Network 4 relates to infection mechanism, DNA replica - tion, recombination and repair and gene expression ( P = 1 \u00d7 1012). Notably, several of the input genes included in network 1 ( EXO1 and HELQ and TLK1 ) are also involved in DNA repair mechanisms. We used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) implemented in MAGENTA23 to explore pathway-based associations using the full GWAS results. Three pathways reached study-wide significance (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05), exoDNase ( P = 0.0005), NF- B signaling ( 0.0006) and mitochondrial dysfunction ( P = 0.0001; Supplementary Table 5 ). Finally, we used the GRAIL method of literature-based pathway analysis24 to explore the connections between genes near our top SNPs. Genes are considered related if they share informative words. GRAIL scores for genes associated with three of the replicating genome-wide significant SNPs were significant, EXO1 , FKBPL and BRSK1 . When we applied this method to a deeper set of 66 SNPs from the discovery meta-analysis with significance meeting FDR < 0.05, 12 genes significant with GRAIL FDR = 0.06. Candidate genes Within the discovery GWAS, 18,327 SNPs were within 60 kb of the start and end of transcription of 125 candidate genes selected because of a reported relationship with ovarian function ( Supplementary Table 6 ). After multiple testing correction, 101 SNPs in or near five of the associated with age at natural menopause. SNPs in or near four of these genes were already identified as genome-wide significant 11). the other gene, DMC1 , the most significant SNP was rs763121, with nominal P = 1.6 \u00d7 107 (P = 0.0009 corrected for candidate gene SNP analyses); age at natural menopause was lower by ~0.18 years per copy of the minor allele. DMC1 encodes a protein that is essential for meiotic homologous recombination and is regu - lated by NOBOX , mutations in which can cause POI25-27. Pleiotropy of primary hits We examined overlap of our significant regions against published GWAS results for other traits (GWAS catalog; see URLs). Twelve menopause loci were within 1 Mb of a previously published genome- wide significant SNP , but most of the colocalized SNPs were in low LD (0 < r2 < 0.21) with our SNP in the region ( Supplementary Table 7). The exception was at the GCKR locus on chromosome 2. Region 2a (rs2303369) was correlated ( r2 0.5) with four different SNPs reported to influence kidney function, type 2 diabetes, continuous glycemic traits, as well as serum albumin, C reactive protein, serum urate, and triglycerides. These results increase the observed clustering of signals in complex trait genetics, whilst also adding to the increasing pleio - tropy observed at the GCKR locus. DISCUSSION In this large two-stage GWAS, we confirmed four established meno - pause loci and identified and replicated 13 loci newly associated with age at natural menopause. Of these 17 hits, all but two are intronic or exonic to known genes. For associated SNPs in GWAS, on aver - age 40% are intergenic, whereas only 2% of our hits are intergenic. Furthermore, we found twice the nonsynonymous top hits typically observed in GWAS (24% versus 12%; ref. 28). The 17 replicated loci function in diverse pathways including hormonal regulation, immune function and DNA repair. Together, they explained 2.5-4.1% of the population variation in menopausal age in independent replication samples. Biological pathway analysis of the genetic associations with age at natural menopause in this study using distinct algorithms and databases were in close agreement in emphasizing general biological pathways for mitochondrial function, DNA repair, cell cycle and cell death and immune response. Aging is thought to result from the accumulation of somatic damage29. Analysis of gene expression patterns in aging organs, such as heart and brain, identified changes in genes involved in inflammatory response, oxidative stress and genome stability30, processes also identified in ana - lysis of age-related changes in mouse oocytes, including changes in mito - chondrial function31. Comparisons of lifespans across species show that longevity and DNA repair function are generally related32. This notion is reinforced in the Werner and Bloom syndromes, which involve genome instability due to mutations in 3 5 DNA helicases of the RecQ family members, and are characterized by both premature aging and premature menopause33. Similarly, an increase in meiotic errors is associated with an age-related decline in oocyte quality, compounding progress toward menopause owing to follicle depletion34. In biological pathway analysis, seven candidate genes identified by proximity to the 17 genome-wide significant associations with age at natural menopause are related to DNA damage repair and The protein encoded by UIMC1 physically interacts with BRCA1 and estrogen receptor and is thought to recruit BRCA1 to DNA damage sites and to initiate checkpoint control in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. PRIM1 (primase) is involved in DNA replication by synthesizing RNA primers for Okazaki fragments during discontinuous replication35. in POLG can segregate with POI36.

FANCI , another gene at the same locus adjacent to POLG , is a member of the Fanconi ane - mia complementation group. Fanconi anemia is a recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic instability and defective DNA repair. Fanconi anemia patients experience irregular menstruation with menopause occurring around age 30 (ref. 38). The functional poly - morphism correlated to our top hit in EXO1 is associated with longev - ity in female centenarians39. Male and female Exo1 knockout mice are sterile because the gene is essential for male and female meiosis40. In addition to the GWAS regions in or near genes associated with early menopause, we investigated a panel of candidate genes identified before the study, and found a SNP near the meiotic recombination gene DMC1 to be significantly associated with age at menopause. How the DNA repair pathways contribute to menopause remains unclear. With altered DNA repair mechanisms, damage could accu - mulate, rendering poor-quality oocytes for selection. In contrast, the number of damaged follicles may increase with aging, leading to a greater rate of follicle loss through atresia. The top hit in this study, a nonsynonymous SNP in MCM8 , was not included in the IPA results, probably because the exact function of this protein is still unknown. The MCM family, however, is a key component of the prereplication complex, and its main function is to restrict DNA replication to one round per cell cycle41. The pathway analyses highlighted additional candidate genes with functions in DNA repair, but with subgenome-wide levels of sign i ficance for association with age of natural menopause. These 12 candidates (Supplementary Table 5 ) included the gene encoding Werner helicase (WRN), mutations in which cause Werner syndrome, a classic progeria with advanced aging phenotype and ovarian aging42. Estrogen can enhance WRN expression, preventing cell senescence, suggesting that WRN is involved in menopause43. The identification of DNA repair as one of the biological pathways involved in menopause may also explain the association between smoking and an earlier age at menopause. Damage caused by smoking activates several different DNA repair mechanisms. Indeed, a polymorphism in Exo1 , one of our top loci, is associated with colorectal adenomas in smokers only44. Additional studies are needed to determine whether smoking status modifies the association between age at natural menopause and polymorphisms in DNA repair genes, as has been observed for various cancers. Pathway-based analysis indicated that genes related to autoimmune disease also influence age at natural menopause. This link has not been reported before, however, in a proportion (2-10%) of women with POI, ovarian autoimmunity can have a role45. POI is frequently associated with additional autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 dia - betes mellitus46. The top SNP in region 19a is near IL11 , which binds the interleukin 11 (IL-11) receptor chain. Female mice with null mutations in Il11ra are infertile owing to defective uterine deciduali - zation, the process necessary for successful embryo implantation47. NLRP11 (region 19b) is a member of the NLRP family of genes, which have important roles in the innate immune system and reproduc - tive system. Several NLRP genes show an oocyte-specific expression pattern46, whereas NLRP5 has been implicated in POI, and serves as an autoantigen in a mouse model of autoimmune POI48,49. Many auto - immune conditions are associated with a particular HLA type, but no such association has been reported for POI50,51. One of our top meno - pause associations (rs1046089) is a missense substitution in PRRC2A (HLA-B-associated transcript), which is in the HLA class III com - plex on chromosome 6 and has been associated with type I diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis. Multiple phenotypes have been SNPs in GWAS, including BMI, neonatal lupus, HIV control height ( Supplementary Table 7 ), but the SNPs have low correlation with our top hit. Expression data for rs1046089 show that the polymorphism was associated with altered expression of HLA-DRB4 in monocytes and HLA-DQA1 in lymphoblastoid cell lines ( Table 2). Thus, this gene is a candidate for a proinflammatory component to oocyte depletion that affects menopause age. Indeed, the enrichment of genes involved in NF- B signaling ( TNF , TNFRSF17 and CSNK2B ) in biological pathway analysis suggests that susceptibility to inflammation, which often accompanies immunosenescence in aging, may also affect ovarian aging. The finding that the innate immune response can be upregulated in response to DNA damage52 suggests that interplay between the two main pathways we identified (DNA repair and inflammation) may contribute to variation in age at natural menopause. Three of the 17 regions can be linked to hormonal regulation, an additional route to follicle pool exhaustion. The top SNP in region 11 (rs12294104) is in high LD with SNPs in FSHB (r2 = 0.92, Table 2), which limits the rate of production of FSH, a key pituitary gland- expressed hormone that stimulates maturation of follicles. FSH-deficient female mice are infertile53. Transgenic mice that overexpress FSH show premature infertility owing to postimplantation reduction of embryo- fetal survival54. FSH concentrations rise in women approaching menopause; this might be related to a decrease in growing follicles55. Mutations in FSHB cause hypogonadism and primary amenorrhea in women56 and lead to greater FSH concentrations and infertility in males compared with wild type57. The latter observation is due to a promoter polymorphism that may be causal58 and is in LD ( r2 = 0.7) with our most significant SNP . Although STAR , which encodes ster - oidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), was not the nearest gene to the top SNP in region 8 (rs2517388), its functional role in cleavage of cholesterol to pregnenolone in response to tropic hormones makes it a probable functional candidate, and our top SNP is in high LD with SNPs in that gene ( r2 = 0.81, Table 2). Pregnenolone is a precursor for several steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, and muta - tions in the STAR gene are associated with congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia and POI59. Furthermore, STAR is a target of FOXL2, for which truncating mutations are preferentially associated with POI60. Similarly, BCAR4 , which encodes the breast cancer antiestrogen resist - ance 4 protein, is the best candidate gene near region 16. BCAR4 is expressed only in placenta and oocytes and may have a role in hor - monal stimulation in the ovary. In breast cancer treatment, tumors highly expressing BCAR4 are more resistant to tamoxifen treatment61, reinforcing the role of BCAR4 in transduction of hormonal signals. In summary, our findings demonstrate the role of genes that regulate DNA repair and immune function, and genes affecting neur o endocrine pathways of ovarian function in regulating age at menopause, indicating that the process of aging is involved in both somatic and germ line aging. We expect that several additional common variants with small effects on age at natural menopause are yet to be identified, and that many of them are in genes in pathways identified in this study. Sequencing and exome chip studies to determine whether low- frequency and rare variants of large effect also contribute to age at natural menopause are underway or being planned in many of the cohorts involved in this GWAS. A collaboration of several consortia is examining the contribution of common genetic variants to age at natural menopause in African-American women, and could allow researchers to determine whether the genetic variation that affects age at natural menopause in African-American women is the same or substantially different from that for women of primarily European descent. We are now conducting a study of women with POI to determine whether variants associated with age at natural menopause npg \u00a9 2012 Nature America, Inc.

Age at natural menopause was defined as age at last menstrual period that occurred naturally with at least 12 consecutive months of amen - orrhea. This analysis included women with natural menopause aged 40-60. Women of self-reported non-European ancestry were excluded, as were women with menopause owing to hysterectomy and/or bilateral ovariectomy, chemotherapy or irradiation, if validated by medical records, and women using HRT before menopause. Most cohorts collected age at natural menopause retrospectively; in the Framingham Offspring, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), Nurses Health Study (NHS) and WGHS studies, some women became menopausal under study observation. Study-specific questions, mean age at menopause and age at interview are in Supplementary Table 1 . Genotyping and imputation information for discovery cohorts are in Supplementary Table 2 . Descriptions of each study are in Supplementary Note . For all studies participating in the meta-analyses, each participant provided written informed consent. The Institutional Review Board at the parent institution for each respective cohort approved the study protocol. Replication. A total of 14,435 women from 21 studies meeting the same inclu - sion and exclusion criteria as the women in discovery analysis were included in replication analysis. The women had mean and s.d. of age at natural meno - pause similar to the discovery set ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Genotyping and imputation methods for the in silico replication cohorts are in Supplementary Table 2 . Genotyping information for the studies that genotyped the SNPs de novo is in Supplementary Table 2 . Descriptions of each study are in Supplementary Note . The 19 independent genome-wide significant SNPs were tested for association with age at natural menopause using linear regression models. Meta-analysis inverse variance weighted meta-analysis of the studies was done with METAL using genomic control62. A SNP within a study was omitted if the minor allele frequency was <1% or imputation quality score was <0.2. discovery meta- analysis included 2,551,160 autosomal SNPs and 38,968 samples. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis. For each of the genome-wide significant menopause SNPs ( Table 1), all proxy SNPs with r2 > 0.8 were deter - mined in HapMap CEU release 22. Each SNP and its proxies were searched against a collected database of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) results, including the following tissues: fresh lymphocytes63, fresh cytes64, leukocyte with monocytes70,71, CD4+ lymphocytes72, adipose and blood samples73, brain cortex70,74, brain including pre - frontal cortex, visual cortex and cerebellum (three large studies; V The collected eQTL results met criteria for statistical significance for association with gene transcript levels as described in the original papers. eQTL findings for replicated GWAS SNPs are summarized in Table 2. Conditional analysis. On each chromosome, SNPs of the lowest P value that met genome-wide significance were identified. Genome-wide - significant SNPs >250,000 bp and <1 Mb apart that also had pairwise HapMap CEU LD values of r2 < 0.5 were considered potentially independent regions. Potential independent regions that were within 1 Mb of a second region with a more significant P value were tested for independence using conditional analysis. In this analysis, the most significant SNP in the most significant region on each chromosome was used as a covariate in a genome-wide analysis. The second region on the chromosome was then retested for independent association. Pathway analyses. IPA Knowledge Base 8.8 (see URLs) was used to explore the functional relationship between proteins encoded by the 17 replicated meno - pause loci. The IPA Knowledge Base contains millions of findings curated from the literature. All reference genes ( n = 61) within 60 kb potentially encoded by the 17 loci ( Table 2) were entered into the Ingenuity database. Fifty-one genes were eligible for pathway analysis. These eligible 'focus genes' were analyzed for direct interactions only. Networks were generated with a maximum size of 35 genes and molecular relationships between genes or gene products were graphically represented. Proteins are depicted as nodes in various shapes representing functional class of protein. Lines depict the biological relationships between nodes. To determine the probability that the analyzed gene would be found in a network from Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base owing to random chance alone, IPA applies a Fisher's exact test. The network score or P value represents the significance of the focus gene enrichment. Enrichment of focus genes to diseases and functional categories was also evaluated in the IPA Knowledge Base. The P value, determined by a right-tailed Fisher's exact test, considers the number of identified focus genes and the total number of molecules known to be associated with these categories in the IPA knowledge database. MAGENTA was used to explore pathway-based associations in the full GWAS data set. MAGENTA implements a GSEA-based approach that has been described23. Briefly, each gene in the genome is mapped to a single index SNP of the lowest P value within a 110 kb-upstream, 40 kb-down - stream window. This P value, representing a gene score, is then corrected for confounding factors such as gene size, SNP density and LD-related proper - ties in a regression model. Genes within the HLA region were excluded from analysis owing to difficulties in accounting for gene density and LD patterns. Each mapped gene in the genome is then ranked by its adjusted gene score. At a given significance threshold (95th and 75th percentiles of all gene scores), the observed number of gene scores in a given pathway, with a ranked score above the specified threshold percentile, is calculated. This observed statistic is then compared with 1,000,000 randomly permuted pathways of identical size. This generates an empirical GSEA P value for each pathway. Significance was determined when an individual pathway reached FDR <0.05 in either analy - sis ( Supplementary Table 5 ). In total, 2,580 pathways from Gene Ontology, PANTHER, KEGG and Ingenuity were tested for enrichment of multiple mod - est associations with age at natural menopause. GRAIL is designed to provide evidence for related biological function among a set of candidate genes. The method is based on connections between gene names and informative words extracted from PubMed abstracts by automated language processing techniques. Genes are considered related, and achieve a high similarity score, if they share informative words. For this analysis, the input for GRAIL was a list of candidate SNPs associated with age at natural menopause. From among candidate genes mapping near the candidate SNPs, GRAIL identifies genes with associated informative words that are significantly similar to informative words from other candidate genes. Genes with significant similarity scores are thus consistent with the set of candidate genes as a whole in having greater sharing of informative words than would be expected by chance, suggesting shared biological functions or even biological pathways. GRAIL was first applied to the lead SNPs from each of the replicating genome-wide significant loci using the 2006 edition of the database of genes and informative words. Separately, GRAIL was applied to a list of 66 SNPs, one from each locus that had at least one SNP meeting a FDR threshold of 0.05 from the QV ALUE software in R79. For meta-analysis of age at natural menopause, the FDR < 0.05 threshold implied P < 2.8 \u00d7 105. Candidate gene analysis. We explored the association of natural age of meno - pause with 125 candidate genes selected because of a reported relationship with ovarian function, including animal models in which gene mutations affect ovar - ian function ( n = 37), human studies of menopause or isolated POI ( n = 48), syndromes including ovarian failure ( n = 4) or genes expressed in the ovary or female germ cells ( n = 38; Supplementary Table 6 ). For each gene, the start and end of transcription was defined by the transcripts that span the largest portion of the genome. NCBI36/hg18 positions taken from the UCSC genome browser were used to define gene and SNP locations. Using the correlation measured from a set of ~850 independent Framingham Heart Study participants, we com - puted the effective number of independent SNPs for each chromosome80, and used the total (5,774) in a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Pleiotropy of primary hits. Allelic pleiotropy was explored by comparing genome-wide-significant menopause signals to the online catalog of published GWAS (GWAS catalog; see URLs). All reported associations that reached P < 5 \u00d7 108 and were within 1 Mb of the menopause signal were considered. LD estimates between the SNP pairs were assessed using HapMap (CEU, release 27).

Analyses were based on longitudinal data on 2724 members of the Framingham Heart Study (based in Massachusetts, U.S.A.) who were linked to friends and family members who were also participants in the same study. Men were more likely to take aspirin if a male friend had recently been taking aspirin, and women were more likelyto take aspirin if a brother had recently been taking aspirin. Men were also more likely to take aspirin ifa brother recently had a cardiovascular event, and women were more likely to take aspirin if a female friend recently experienced a cardiovascular event. Aspirin use is correlated with the health and behavior of friends and family. These ndings add to a growing body of evidence which suggests that behavioral changes that promote cardiovascular health may spread through social networks. /C2112012 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction A large body of evidence shows that aspirin reduces cardio- vascular events for patients with and without histories of cardio- vascular disease (CVD) ( national studies that aspirin ). Increases in aspirin use have been slow given its ef cacy, and rates remain low, particularly among outpatients ( Stafford & Radley, 2003 ). Using the 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, Ajani, Ford, Greenland, Giles, and Mokdad (2006) report adjusted aspirin prevalence rates of 69.3% and 32.7% for individualswith and without CVD. They also nd less aspirin use amongwomen than men (adjusted prevalence for women was 34% and formen 38.5%). Given that aspirin is inexpensive, available without a prescrip- tion, and its health bene ts have been relatively widely publicized (e.g., industry-initiated advertising campaigns), much of the vari- ation in aspirin use is likely to be determined by factors outside of the clinical setting. While having had a conversation with one 's doctor about aspirin is an important determinant of aspirin use innational samples ( Brown et al., 2002; Pignone et al., 2007 ), discrepancies between medical records and self-reports suggestthan many people take aspirin on their own initiative without their doctor 's knowledge ( Brown et al., 2002 ). It seems reasonable to suppose that having a member of one 's social circle (i.e., an \"alter \") experience a cardiovascular event and/ or begin taking aspirin is likely to affect an individual' s (i.e., an \"ego \") aspirin use. Health behaviors and risk factors (e.g., obesity, smoking) may be \"socially contagious, \"and the chances that one changes his/her own behavior are increased if a member of one 's social network recently began behaving differently (e.g., withrespect to diet, exercise, smoking, or drinking) ( Christakis & Fowler, *Corresponding author.

Having a friend or family member experience a cardiovascular event and/or begin taking aspirin may increase an ego 's odds of aspirin-use by increasing his/her awareness of CVD and aspirinprophylaxis. Alters 'events and aspirin-use could also raise ego 's subjective assessment of personal cardiovascular risk and improvehis/her attitudes toward aspirin use. This work departs from prior work in that it evaluates both the similar behaviors in alters (aspirin use) and also events occurring in alters (e.g., cardiovascular illness) with respect to how they affect ego. MethodsThe Framingham Heart Study Social Networks Study The Massachusetts, U.S.A. Framingham Heart Study (FHS) began in 1948 with an Original Cohort of 5209 adults. In 1971, the FHS added an Offspring Cohort comprised of 5124 adult children of the Original Cohort and their spouses. In 1994, a minority oversample of 508 people known as the \"Omni Cohort \"was empaneled. Beginning in 2002, 4095 adults having at least one parent in the Offspring Cohort enrolled in the Third Generation Cohort, along with 103 parents of the Third Generation Cohort participants who were not previously enrolled in the Offspring Cohort. As a means of following participants, the FHS collected regular contact informa- tion for participants' close friends and family members. Since the FHS cohorts are family-based and participants are drawn primarilyfrom the Framingham, Massachusetts area, many of the friends and family members that were listed as contacts are also participants in FHS. Connecting participants (i.e., egos) at each wave to their contacts who were also participants (i.e., alters) gives researchers longitudinal data on a network of social connections among participants. Combining these network data with data from peri- odic physical exams and questionnaires allows us to test how alters ' recent events and behaviors impact egos. The Framingham Heart Study protocol is reviewed by the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Board and partici-pants signed written informed consent. Our project was addition- ally reviewed by the Harvard Medical School Institutional Review Board. Study sample Longitudinal data for our analysis come from physical exams and questionnaires performed during three-year periods centered at 1985, 1989, 1992, 1997, and 1999. We limit our analysis to egos who are likely candidates for aspirin prophylaxis dthat is, women age 55e70 and men ages 45 e79. All egos are from the Framingham Offspring Cohort, while alters may be in any of the Framingham cohorts. In this analysis, we include three types of intimate peer relationships: spousal relationships, sibships, and friendships. We select these relationship types because we expect egos to be more sensitive to events/behaviors among alters they identify with and feel close to. An insuf cient number of observations and events made it impossible to examine gender-strati ed parent echild relationships. In the data for our analysis, information on egos' and alters ' health events, behaviors, and social ties are time-varying acrosswaves. If a respondent lists a friend as a contact in one wave, but not in the next wave, that tie is dissolved and is not included in subsequent waves. If an alter dies between the last and current wave, we include information about the health events leading to his/her death in the current wave, but that tie will be dissolved and is not included in all subsequent waves. Examining ego-alter tiesacross all waves, 32% of the observations are spousal ties, 58% are sibling ties, and 11% are friendships. Study variables The dependent variable for this analysis is a dichotomous indi- cator for whether ego is taking aspirin on a daily basis at the time of the current wave. The key predictors of interest are whether alter was taking aspirin on a daily basis at the last wave and whether alter had a cardiovascular event between the last and current waves. Speci c cardiovascular events included in the alter event measure are: myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronaryinsufciency , stroke, intermittent claudication, and death from CVD or stroke. We include a lagged version of the dependent variable as a predictor to adjust for whether ego was taking aspirin at the lastwave. We also adjust for whether ego has ever had his/her own cardiovascular event prior to the current wave. The measure of ego 's prior events includes: myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary insuf ciency, stroke, and intermittent claudication. Other control variables are ego 's age, education, marital status, and survey wave. Statistical analysis The longitudinal logistic regression model employed in our analysis can be written measuring an ego characteristic and a superscript aindicates a variable measuring an alter characteristic. The subscript irefers to individual ego, i, the subscript rrefers to relationship, r, with a given alter, and the subscript trefers to a given wave at time t. Ye itis the dichotomous dependent variable indicating whether ego used aspirin at the current wave. Xa 1ir\u00f0t;t/C01\u00deis a dichotomous variable indicating whether alter experienced a cardiovascular health event betweenthe last wave ( t/C01) and the current wave ( t).X a 2ir\u00f0t/C01\u00deis a dichot- omous variable indicating whether alter was taking aspirin at thelast wave. X e 3i\u00f0t/C01\u00deis a dichotomous measure of whether ego was taking aspirin at the last wave. Xe 4itis a dichotomous measure of whether ego had a cardiovascular health event at any time prior to the current wave. Xe 5itreflects the set of controls for ego 's charac- teristics (e.g., age, education, marital status). X6treflects the set of controls for survey wave. And, nally, eirtis an error term speci ct o each ego-alter pair at a given wave. To account for clustered errorterms resulting from ego-alter pairings and multiple observations of the same egos across waves, we use generalized estimating equations with an independent working correlations structure (Hardin & Hibe, 2002 ). After presenting a model for all ties combined, we stratify the analysis according to ego 's sex, the sex-composition of the tie (i.e., two males, two females, or a male and female), and the type of relationship (i.e., spouses, siblings, and friendships). Aspirin-use is lower among women than men, and evidence of the preventative benets of aspirin is somewhat more controversial for women than men ( Ajani et al., 2006; Mulrow & Pignone, 2005 ). We further expect that people may be more likely to identify with and take behavioral cues from same-gender alters, and that alter 'si nfluence on ego may differ depending on the type of relationship they share(i.e., spouses, siblings, friends).K.W. Strully et al. / Social Science & Medicine 74 (2012) 1125 e1129 1126Since siblings are, roughly speaking, equally likely to be male as female, there are comparable numbers of same-sex and mixed-sex sibling pairs and we present estimates separately for sister pairs, brother pairs, and brother esister pairs. Friendships, on other hand, are much more likely to same-sex than mixed-sex, and we do nothave suf cient observations to present separate mixed-sex friendship estimates. We, therefore, present estimates for allfriendships combined and then present separate estimates for the subset of same-sex friendships. We conducted all the analysis using STATA SE 10 software. Results As shown in Table 1 , about 25% of male and 19% of female egos were using aspirin on a daily basis in a given wave. Looking at male and female egos combined in the rst column of Table 1 , about 20% of their alters were using aspirin daily at the last wave and about5.2% had a cardiovascular event between the previous and current waves. Table 2 presents odds ratios and 95% con dence intervals from our rst regression model including all relationship types and both male and female egos. Older egos, male egos, and egos whohad a prior cardiovascular event were more likely to take aspirinregularly. In line with widely documented trends, ego 's odds of aspirin use were also higher at more recent waves ( Stafford, 2000 ). Ego 's marital status and education, however, were not signi cantly associated with his/her aspirin use in this sample. InTable 2 ,e g o 's odds of daily aspirin use were 12% higher if alter used aspirin daily at the last wave. On the other hand, there was nosignicant association between alter 's recent cardiovascular events and ego 's aspirin use. However, this refl ects the overall association for all ego-alter pairs and we expect associations may vary according to ego 's gender, relationship type, and the gender composition of the relationship. Tables 3 and 4 replicate the basic model presented in Table 2 strati ed according to each of these factors. InTable 3 , male egos' aspirin-use was not associated with their wives 'aspirin-use or cardiovascular events. Their aspirin use also did not appear to be sensitive to their sisters 'aspirin-use or events. On the other hand, male egos were about 41% more likely to use aspirin if their brothers had a cardiovascular event since the last wave. Brothers 'earlier aspirin use, however, was not associated with ego 's aspirin use. Men 's aspirin-use was about 48% higher if a male friend was using aspirin at the last wave. Men 's aspirin-use may also be higher if a male friend had a recent cardiovascularev ent, but this odds ratio of 1.71 should be interpreted cautiously since the lower bound for the 95% con dence interval is 1.00. Whereas male egos 'aspirin-use was not associated with their sisters 'aspirin-use, Table 4 shows that female egos were about 35% more likely to take aspirin if their brother used aspirin at the last wave. Brothers 'recent cardiovascular events, however, were notTable 1 Characteristics of egos and alters in sample.

Women 's odds of aspirin use did not appear to be sensitive to their sisters 'aspirin use or health events. Women were more than twice as likely to use aspirin if a female friend recently had a cardiovascular event. However, female friends 'recent aspirin use was not associated with women 's aspirin use. Women 's odds of aspirin use may also be positively associated with their husband' s recent aspirin use, however this odds ratio of 1.30 should be interpreted cautiously since the lowerbound for the 95% con dence interval is 1.00. Discussion Persons in this study were more likely to take aspirin regularly if a friend or family member took aspirin. A growing body of litera- ture shows that behavioral changes that promote cardiovascular health may spread through social networks ( Christakis & Fowler, 2007, 2008; Rosenquist et al., 2010 ). The above results add to this literature by providing preliminary evidence that another impor- tant cardiovascular health behavior dregular aspirin use dmay also be shaped by how members of one 's network behave. Another contribution of this analysis is the examination of alters ' cardiovascular events. This approach has both conceptual and methodological advantages compared to prior work. Conceptually, it broadens the scope of what sorts of inter-personal effects might be relevant to individual and public health. Methodologically, it is advantageous because, when considering the effect of an alter event on an ego behavior, it may reduce concern about confounding (since it is a bit harder to imagine factors that are associated with alter events and ego behaviors than it is to imagine factors that are associated with the same behavior in both egos and alters). While alters 'cardiovascular events were not associated with ego 's behavior when looking at average effects among all pairs in Table 2 , we did nd signi cant associations among certain subgroups. Men were more likely to take aspirin if their brothers recently had a cardiovascular event, and women were more likely to take aspirin if a same-sex friend recently suffered an event. There has been very little research into how people may learn about their own cardiovascular risk and possibly take cues from their friends or family members 'health problems ( Khwaja, Sloan, & Chung, 2006 ). Models and theories of behavioral change posit that healthbehavior depends on how people perceive their health risk and where they fall on a continuum of \"readiness to change\" (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997 ). Having a friend or family member go through an experience like a myocardial infarction or stroke may be an important catalyst on the path toward healthier behaviors and better cardiovascular health. Because aspirin-use is lower among women than men, and evidence of the bene ts of aspirin is somewhat more controversial for women than men ( Ajani et al., 2006; Mulrow & Pignone, 2005 ), we strati ed the above models according to ego 's sex and the sex- composition of the relationship. While the above analysis does not allow us to draw clear conclusions about sex differences in the spr ead of aspirin-use through social networks, there are suggestive ndings. It is notable, for instance, that only male alters, not female alters, appeared to shape ego 's aspirin use. Men 's aspirin use was associated with their male friends 'aspirin use. Women 's aspirin use was associated with their brother 's aspirin use. Female alters '(i.e., wives, sisters, female friends) aspirin use, on the other hand, was not signi cantly associated with ego 's aspirin use in any of our strati ed models. This greater sensitivity to male alter 's aspirin use may result from several different factors including higher rates of aspirin use among men, different perceptions of cardiovascular risk for men and women ( Frijling et al., 2004 ), and gender inequalities in the inter-personal dynamics of ego-alter relationships.Our analysis also points to possible sex differences in sensitivity to alters 'cardiovascular events. Associations between ego 's aspirin use and alters 'cardiovascular events occurred only within same- sex relationships (i.e., brother pairs for men and same-sex friend- ships for women). There was no association between the ego 's aspirin use and the alter 's cardiovascular events within mixed-sex pairs. Although several factors may contribute to this pattern, people probably identify more strongly with, and take more health cues from, people of the same sex. When interpreting the results of our study, it is important consider the role that subjects 'doctors may have played in their behavior. One possible explanation for associations between ego 's and alter 's aspirin use is that they both have the same physician who encouraged aspirin use. In our study sample, we were able toidentify ego-alter pairs who shared the same doctor and adjust our estimates for this potential confounder. Associations between ego 's and alter 's aspirin use were quite robust to this adjustment and it does not appear that shared doctors can account for our results (see Table S1 in the online data supplement). Unfortunately, our data do not allow us to know whether egos who were in fluenced by alters ' aspirin use involved their doctors in their aspirin use decisions (e.g.,when an ego learns of an alter 's aspirin use, does she then turn to her physician for advice about aspirin prophylaxis?). In an effort to focus our study on egos who are likely candidates for aspirin prophylaxis, we analyzed women ages 55 e70 and men ages 45 e79. We believe this broad, demographically-based de - nition of an aspirin use risk group is appropriate given that we areexamining how people make choices about aspirin use outside of clinical settings. Further, because clinical recommendations regarding regular aspirin use were being developed over the period in our study (i.e., 1971 e1998), it is important that we capture a broad segment of the general population. It should be kept in mind, however, that in fluences of alters ' beha viors and health may operate differently on egos with speci c clinical risk factors (e.g., those based on blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, etc.). We found consistent results when we replicated our main analysis for the subset of egos with prior cardiovascular events and/or elevated 10-year coronary heart disease risk scores (based on Wilson et al., 1998 ). However, when we limited the sample further to include only egos with prior cardiovascularevents, we no longer found a signi cant association between egos ' and alters 'aspirin-use. Interpreting this non-signi cance is dif - cult, though, because relatively few egos had prior cardiovascular events, raising concerns about sparse data and large standard errors (these results are presented in the online data supplement). Further research, preferably with larger samples, is needed to know whether individuals at higher risk for cardiovascular disease are more or less sensitive to the health and behaviors of their friends and family. This study makes no suggestions related to clinical guidelines or about who should take regular aspirin doses. Rather, our results document how social networks are correlated with whether or not an individual adopts a regular aspirin regimen, regardless of speci c clinical risk factors. This work has a few notable limitations. It does not randomize individuals into social networks, thus leaving open the possibility that these results may in part refl ect homophily-driven selection bias on the basis of unobserved traits (e.g., avidity for drugs) that influence the use of aspirin over time. For instance, we can imagine that individuals with similar tastes, health knowledge, or physicalresilience may be more likely to form relationships. Shared leisure time activities, as well as similar sociodemographic positions (e.g., educational backgrounds or professions), may increase the chances that people with underlying tendencies toward aspirin-use meet and form relationships. While observational data can never over- come all concerns about unmeasured confounding, the FraminghamK.W. Strully et al. / Social Science & Medicine 74 (2012) 1125 e1129 1128Heart Study Social Networks Study, which is longitudinal and provides several control variables, gives us more leverage on causality than is usually possible with non-experimental data. Most notably, our data allow us to adjust for egos' prior aspirin use and cardiovascular events. Also, as has been widely noted, the Fra-mingham Heart Study sample is somewhat homogenous and does not have a signi cant percentage of underrepresented minorities. Because of differences in how questions about aspirin use were asked in earlier and later waves of the Framingham Heart Study, our dependent variable captures daily aspirin use, but does not detect less frequent regular aspirin doses (e.g., taking aspirin every other day). Furthermore, with these data, we can measure egos' aspirin use only every four years or so. Lower levels or shorter-termchanges in egos' aspirin use are, therefore, not detected in our study. This may mean that we fail to capture some variation in egos ' aspirin use, which would imply our estimates may fall on the conservative side. Because our dataset captures a limited number of relationship ties, we were unable to stratify the data in certain ways, and there were several questions about heterogeneity across subgroups that we were not able to test. For instance, after stratifying by sex andrelationship type, we did not have a suf cient number of obser- vations to test whether associations differed depending on whetherego had cardiovascular disease and/or had taken aspirin previously. It should be kept in mind that the above results re flect average associations for a general population. It remains possible thatassociations between egos' aspirin use and alters 'aspirin use/ events may differ when distinguishing between further subgroups.Finally, the analyses comparing results across different types of relationships and exposures are exploratory. We did not have prior hypotheses about effect sizes for different types of relationships or exposures. These results should not be interpreted as evidence of differences in causal effects across groups/exposures. Since there is very little existing research into peer in fluences in drug-taking behavior, we believe that this type of exploratory analysisprovides a useful rst step in understanding how networks may shape pharmacotherapy. In this case of an exploratory analysis, it isnot clear whether Bonferroni adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing are appropriate; nevertheless, we note that all Bonferroni- adjusted p-values in our analysis were greater than 0.05. Across a broad swathe of behaviors, people are in fluenced by those around them. Pharmacotherapy is a behavior, and so we should not be surprised by the fact that people 's drug-taking behavior is related to the behavior of those around them, and tothe events occurring in those around them. Similar to the person who might stop smoking when his friend gets lung cancer, a person whose friend, sibling, or spouse has a myocardial infarction may be more inclined to take aspirin because he/she now has a palpable demonstration of the occurrences the aspirin is intended to prevent, rather than an abstract admonition. Likewise, those whose friends are taking aspirin might follow suit for a variety of reasons, including the basic realization that taking aspirin is not hard at all. People are connected, and so their health is connected.

The association of female reproductive factors with mea-sures of regional body fat distribution has not been comprehensively studied. Methods: We examined the association of female reproductive factors (age at menarche, parity, age at natural menopause, menopausal status) in association with body composition data fromwomen who participated in the Offspring and the Third Generation Framingham Heart Studycohorts. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and sc adipose tissue (SAT) were measured volumetrically bymultidetector computerized tomography. We modeled the relationship between each fat depotand female reproductive factors after adjusting for various factors such as age, smoking status,alcohol intake, physical activity index, hormone replacement therapy, and menopausal status. Results: Earlier age at menarche was associated with increased body mass index (BMI), waist circum- ference (WC), VAT, and SAT ( P/H110210.0001). association of earlier menarche with adiposity measures was attenuated after adjusting for BMI (all P/H110220.70). We observed no association between parity and all parameters of adiposity measurements (all P/H110220.24). Similarly, age at natural menopause was not associated with measures of body composition. Despite higher mean BMI among the post- (BMI 27.3kg/m 2) compared women (BMI 25.9 kg/m2) in an age-matched analysis, mean VAT was not different between the two groups ( P/H110050.30). Conclusions: Earlier menarche is associated with overall obesity but not with VAT or SAT after accounting for measures of generalized adiposity. Parity and menopausal age were not associatedwith adiposity measures. Although postmenopausal women had increased BMI, VAT, and SAT, theassociation was predominantly due to age. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98: 236-244, 2013) Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women in the United States (1). Women, when compared with men, may manifest their clinicaldisease later in life (2) and tend to have less adverse CVDrisk factor profiles (3), rendering standard risk predic-tion algorithms less reliable in women (4). The life course approach allows us to understand the associa-tion of female reproductive factors on CVD risk fromchildhood to later adult life.

Although there is accumulating evidence regarding the importance of understanding CVD outcomes related tofemale reproductive factors, including age at menarche,parity, and age at menopause, less is known regardingtheir determinants. Generalized obesity is a key risk factorthat is associated with several reproductive factors, in-cluding age at menarche (8, 9), parity (10), and age atmenopause (11). However, the association of body fatdistribution and female reproductive factors has been lesswell characterized. Regional fat distribution, particularlyvisceral adipose tissue (VAT), is thought to be a uniquepathogenic fat depot. VAT has been shown to be associ-ated with hypertension (12), diabetes, insulin resistance(12), and dyslipidemia (13). Understanding whether bodyfat distribution is associated with female reproductive fac-tors may provide insight into the potential mechanismslinking them to CVD and its risk factors. Thus, the goal of this study was to examine whether measures of regional body fat distribution, including VATand sc adipose tissue (SAT) are associated with age ofmenarche, parity, age of menopause, and menopausal sta-tus. We hypothesized that visceral adiposity is associatedwith earlier menarche, greater parity, and earlier meno-pause independent of body mass index. Materials and Methods Study sample Participants for the present study were drawn from a subset of women (n /H110051638) who participated in the tomography (MDCT) substudy of the FraminghamHeart Study (FHS) from 2002 to 2005. These participants were part of the FHS Offspring and Third Generation cohorts.Women aged 40 yr or older, weighing less than 160 kg [owing toweight restrictions for computed tomography (CT) scan ma-chine], and not pregnant, were included in the MDCT substudy(14). All participants in the FHS Offspring and Third Generationcohort underwent a contemporaneous research clinical visit(Offspring examination 7, 1998-2001; Third Generation ex-amination 1, 2002-2005). During this clinic visit, a physicalexamination along with laboratory analyses was performed. Co-variate data were taken from the contemporaneous examinationfor both cohorts. In addition, the Offspring cohort underwentexaminations approximately every 4 yr from study inception in1971 and reproductive history was updated at each attendedexamination. The study protocol was approved by the institutional boards of the Boston University Medical Center and MassachusettsGeneral Hospital. Written consent was obtained from allparticipants.Assessment of female reproductive factors The physician-administered standardized medical history portion of the FHS research examinations included questions onreproductive history. At Offspring examination 2 (1978-1981)and the Third generation examination 1, female participantswere asked age at the start of menses and also asked, \"How oldwere you at the time of your first menstrual period (menses)?\"Responses were recorded in years. At the Third generation ex-amination 1, women were asked about the number of live births.At all Offspring examinations and at Third generation exami-nation 1, women were asked whether their periods stopped for1 yr or more and if yes, the cause and age, when periods stoppedwas recorded. Only women who reported natural menopausewere included. Women who reported cessation of menstrual pe-riods due to hysterectomy and/or removal of both ovaries, che-motherapy, radiation, and other causes were excluded. Addi-tionally, women who reported the use of hormone replacementtherapy before the cessation of menses were excluded because itcan lead to the misclassification of age at menopause. Adiposity measurements MDCT participants underwent an eight-slice CT scan of the abdomen in a supine General Elec-tric, Milwaukee, WI). Twenty-five consecutive 5-mm-thick sliceswere covering 125 mm above the level of S1. Volumesof SAT and VAT were evaluated as described previously (14).Interreader reproducibility was high, with interclass correlationsof 0.992 for VAT and 0.997 for SAT (15). Body mass index(BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were measured at the indexexamination. BMI was defined as weight (in kilograms) dividedby square of height (in meters). WC was measured by trainedtechnicians using a tape measure at the level of the umbilicus withthe participant standing erect and arms hanging to the sides. Covariate assessment Covariates were ascertained during the contemporaneous FHS examination. Current smokers (as standardized across theFramingham Heart Study) were defined as women who smokedat least one cigarette per day for the year preceding the exami-nation. Alcohol use (as standardized across Framingham HeartStudy) was characterized in women as seven or more drinks perweek. Physical activity was measured by a questionnaire thatrecorded the average number of sleep hours and activity hours(sleep, sedentary, slight, moderate, and heavy activity) (16).Physical activity index, a composite score was calculated by add-ing the weighted time spent in each activity as described in ourprior studies (16). At Third generation examination 1, all women were asked, \"Have you taken hormone replacement therapy?\"The age at which hormone replacement therapy was started andduration of therapy were also noted. Use of estrogen or hormonereplacement therapy was also collected in the Offspring exam-inations. Available data from 592 postmenopausal Offspringwomen showed 21% currently using estrogen (122 of 592women). Of those women on estrogen, 55% were also onprogesterone. Statistical analyses We performed three separate analyses for each female repro- ductive factor with additional analyses for FHS MDCT substudy, 1622 had both VAT and SAT data available. Age at menarche was avail-able for 1544 women. Of these, 1456 women (41% from Off-spring cohort and 59% from Third Generation cohort) had com- plete covariate and outcome (BMI and WC) information. Theaccuracy of recall for age at menarche in adulthood has been welldocumented in several studies (17, 18). Age at menarche was categorized per 1 yr starting from 9 yr up to 14 yr. Those with ages at menarche at 15 yr old or olderwere grouped together. The primary analysis incorporated all ofthe data in continuous form using individual years of age andcollapsing at the extremes of age. Women who attained men-arche at less than 9 yr of age were excluded from the study.Separate multivariable linear regression models were created toexamine the association of continuous age at menarche (expo-sure) with each measure of adiposity (including BMI, WC, VAT,and SAT as the outcome variables). Covariates included in theprimary analyses were age at CT scan, cohort (Offspring vs. Third Generation), smoking, alcohol intake, hormone replace-ment therapy, physical activity, and menopausal status. In sec-ondary analyses, to adjust for overall adiposity, BMI was addedto the model as a covariate. To reinforce the analyses, we per-formed step-wise selection model (with entry and stay cutoff ofP/H110050.15) to determine which of the body composition variables were most associated with age at menarche. All the covariates inthe primary analyses were forced into the model after whichBMI, WC, VAT, and SAT were allowed to compete and thecovariate with the highest partial R-square entering first. We alsoperformed backward elimination (with a stay cutoff of P/H110210.15). In the backward elimination, all variables were put in and thevariable with the lowest partial correlation was removed and themodel refit. Parity Detailed data on parity was only available in the Third Gen- eration data set. Overall, 900 women in the MDCT substudywere in the Third Generation cohort. All 900 had VAT and SATdata. Of these, 898 women had parity information and 870women had complete covariate information, resulting in a finalsample size of 868 women. Parity was categorized as no, one, two, three, and four or more live births. Multivariable linear regression models withparity as the exposure and adiposity measures (BMI, WC, VAT,and SAT) as the outcome were performed, adjusting for age atCT scan, smoking, alcohol intake, hormone replacement ther-apy, physical activity, and menopausal status. In secondary anal-yses, we additionally adjusted for BMI. Age at menopause Of the 1622 women in the FHS MDCT substudy with VAT and SAT data available, across both the Offspring and ThirdGeneration cohorts, 652 women experienced natural meno-pause. Women with missing age at natural menopause (n /H110057), women reporting estrogen use before cessation of menstrual pe-riods (n /H1100521), and women with primary ovarian insufficiency (natural menopause age /H1102140 yr, n /H1100528) were excluded. Of the remaining 596 women with body composition measures, 522had complete covariate and outcome information. Age at as follows: 40-45, 46-47, 48-49, 50-51, 52-53, and more than 54 yr. Because we had too manyindividual ages and thus for logistical reasons, we simplified them to age categories. We collapsed the age categories at theextremes into 40-45 yr and 54 yr old or older. Multivariablelinear regression models were performed, with age at menopauseas the exposure and adiposity measures (BMI, WC, VAT, andSAT) as the outcome. We adjusted for age at CT scan, cohort(Offspring vs.Third Generation), smoking, alcohol intake, hor- mone replacement therapy, and physical activity. In second-or-der models, we additionally adjusted for BMI. We report ourresults as least square means and Pvalues comparing differences across the groups as obtained from multivariable linear regres-sion models. Menopausal status To examine pre- vs.postmenopausal body composition, we used two complementary analyses designed to examine the as-sociation of menopausal status above that of age. Some previousstudies (19, 20) have reported that aging may contribute to bodyadiposity irrespective of menopausal status. First, we performed an analysis of the overall sample of women from the Offspring and Third Generation cohort (n /H11005 1280). Of these, 1271 women had age at CT and outcome dataand were used for the unmatched model. Of these women, 681were premenopausal and 590 women were postmenopausal. Wemodeled measures of body composition (BMI, WC, VAT, andSAT) as a function of menopausal status (before vs.after meno- pause). We used an unadjusted model examining crude differ-ences in adiposity between pre- and postmenopausal women;and additionally adjusted for age at CT scan. In a secondary, supportive sensitivity analysis, we per- formed a matched analysis of pre- and postmenopausalwomen matched by cohort and age at CT scan. Eighty-five pairs were identified matched on age at natural menopausal (63in Third Generation cohort and 22 in Offspring). Premenopausalwomen within the same cohort were randomly matched to an-other postmenopausal woman with the same age at CT. Giventhat many of the postmenopausal women were older at the timeof the CT than women who were premenopausal, the sample wassignificantly reduced from 1271 to the 85 pairs. We performedpaired ttests of the differences in body composition and condi- tional logistic regression models predicting postmenopausal sta-tus from VAT and SAT. This conditional model included ad-justments for smoking and alcohol intake. Results Association between age at menarche and body fat distribution Cross-sectional characteristics of the study sample by categories of age at menarche are presented in Table 1. Inthe multivariable linear regression analysis examining theassociation between age at menarche and body composi- tion (Table 2), we observed an inverse association betweenmenarcheal age and adiposity as measured by BMI, WC,VAT, and SAT (all P/H110210.0001). For each 1-yr increase in menarche age, VAT was 61.0 cm 3lower. However, upon adjustment for BMI in the above model, our results were attenuated ( /H9252-coefficient 2.78 cm3,P/H110050.74). These re -238 Trikudanathan et al. Female Reproductive Factors and Body Composition J Clin Endocrinol Metab, January 2013, 98(1):236-244sults were confirmed using stepwise regression and back- ward elimination models. We also found the overall modelR 2was 4.37% with a partial R2from BMI of 2.87%. BMI had the largest partial R2of all model terms and accounted for more 65% of the total variation explained by the model. Parity and body fat distribution Supplemental Table 1, published on The Endocrine So- ciety's Journals Online web site at http://jcem.endojour-nals.org, contains the descriptive data for 868 women ac-cording to their parity status. Table 3 shows themultivariable linear regression model for body composi-tion across various categories of parity. Associations be-tween adiposity measures (BMI, WC, VAT, and SAT) andparity did not reach statistical significance in our study (allP/H110220.24). For example, for every incremental increase in parity by 1 live birth, VAT was 23.1 cm 3higher, although this association was not significant ( P/H110050.24). Age at natural menopause and body fat distribution Supplemental Table 2 depicts the demographic char- acteristics of the cohort by categories of associated with categorized meno- pausal age (Table 4, Supplemental Fig. 1). The adjustedmeans for VAT in women with menopause age between 48and 49 yr was 1469 cm 3. VAT was higher for women who had menopause earlier than 48 yr and later than 50 yr, although these trends were not significant ( P/H110050.7). We also performed quadratic model predicting adiposity mea-sures from age at menopause and did not find any rela-tionship with the squared terms. Menopausal status and body fat distribution In unadjusted models, postmenopausal women had higher levels of BMI, WC, VAT, and SAT (all P/H110210.0001, Table 5), which were attenuated upon age adjustment ( P/H11022 0.16). One notable exception was SAT, which continuedto be higher in post- vs.premenopausal women (3289.8 vs.2876.2 cm 3) after age adjustment ( P/H110050.007). To disentangle the associations of chronological age and compare the association of menopausal status alone,additional testing was carried out. We performed an age-matched analysis of pre- and postmenopausal pairs; sam-ple characteristics are displayed in Table 6. The mean dif-ference between the age at CT scan and age at menopausewas 2.8 yr (range 2-11 yr). As expected, VAT and SAT TABLE 2.

Discussion Principal findings We observed that earlier age at menarche was associ- ated with increased BMI, WC, VAT, and SAT, althoughthis association was attenuated after adjusting for BMI.Our study did not identify an association between parityand BMI, WC, VAT, and SAT. Similarly, age at naturalmenopausal was not associated with measures of bodycomposition. We noted that postmenopausal women hadincreased BMI, WC, VAT, and SAT when compared withpremenopausal women; however, this was mostly ex-plained by increased ages among postmenopausal women. Menarche and body composition In our study earlier age at menarche was associated with BMI, WC, VAT, and SAT. However, VAT was notassociated with earlier menarche after adjusting for BMI.These findings suggest that earlier menarcheal age is associ-ated with generalized but not regional body fat depots. These findings are consistent with other longitudinal and cross-sectional studies that have shown that earlymenarche is associated with increased BMI and WC (21, 22). For example, in the European Prospective Investiga-tion into Cancer and Nutrition study (22), per older yearof age at menarche, generalized and central adiposity (asmeasured by waist circumference) was lower. Similarly,the BioCycle study used dual-energy x-ray absorptiometryscan (DXA) to measure total body fat in 253 healthy pre-menopausal women and found that earlier age of men-arche ( /H1134912 yr) was associated with increased BMI and percent total body fat (23). The findings from our study advance the current literature in important ways. Ourstudy used a multidetector CT scan to examine VAT in alarge number of women in a contemporary setting. Weobserved from our data that early age at menarche wasassociated with generalized adiposity rather than VAT. Disentangling the associations of childhood adiposity on earlier menarcheal age and subsequent risk for adult-hood obesity is challenging. We acknowledge the complexinteraction between body fat and puberty (24, 25). Epi-demiological studies, including the Bogalusa Heart Study(8), have noted that childhood obesity is associated withboth earlier menarcheal age and adulthood obesity. Be-cause childhood obesity influences the timing of men-arche, it remains unclear whether childhood obesity sim-ply tracks across to adult obesity (26). Furthermore, manygenetic variants associated with the timing of menarcheare in or near genes associated with childhood and adult-hood BMI, energy homeostasis, and body weight regula- TABLE 4.

Female Reproductive Factors and Body Composition J Clin Endocrinol Metab, January 2013, 98(1):236-244tion (27). For example, LIN28B is associated with earlier age at menarche and prolonged increase in BMI in womenacross adolescence and midadulthood (28). Thus, an im-portant limitation of our study is the lack of data on child-hood adiposity, which may confound the association ofage at menarche with general adiposity observed in ourstudy. Parity and body composition In contrast to much of the prior literature (10, 29, 30), we observed no association between parity and measuresof adiposity. However, our findings are supported by re-sults from the Stockholm Pregnancy and Women's Nutri-tion study. In the Stockholm Pregnancy and Women's Nu-trition study, 563 Swedish women were followed up at 1and 15 yr after the first delivery with questionnaires andanthropometric measurements. At the end of 15 yr, ap-proximately 39% of the women became overweight(BMI/H1102225 kg/m 2). No difference were noted in terms of parity (2.4 /H110060.8vs.2.4/H110060.9 children) between the group that became overweight vs.the group that remained nor- mal weight, respectively (31). However, weight gain dur-ing pregnancy and high weight retainers at the end of thefirst year had a greater BMI at 15 yr follow-up. The find-ings observed by the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study showed that considerable weightgain (3-6 kg) and increased WC (3-6 cm) occurred inwomen who were overweight before childbirth. In thisstudy, excess weight gain was not associated with higher-order births among parous women. However, increasedWC was noted in parous women when compared withnonparous women (5-6 cm, P/H110210.001) (32). Two studies have specifically focused on parity and visceral adiposity. In a cross-sectional study, 170 non-smoking Caucasian women underwent DXA and CT scanto assess total body fat and intraabdominal adiposity (33).Parity was associated with VAT ( P/H110050.02) but not with percent body fat ( P/H110050.68), waist circumference ( P/H11005 0.16), or SAT ( P/H110050.98). Potential reasons for the dispa- rate results from our study could be their relatively smallsample size and inclusion of only nonsmokers; severalcross-sectional studies have noted that smokers havelower body weight than nonsmokers (34). Our study sam-ple included smokers with a higher prevalence of smokingamong nonparous women and women with lower-orderbirths. Current smoking was adjusted for in this analysis. In the second study (4), 122 premenopausal women had total body fat measured by DXA and VAT measuredby CT scan over a 5-yr period. Of these 122 women, only14 had at least one interim birth. There was no change intotal body fat over the 5-yr period for one interim birth vs. no interim births (2.7 vs.3.7 kg, P/H110050.55). However, a larger gain in VAT was observed among women who hadat least one interim birth (27.1 vs.9.2 cm 2,P/H110210.01) (35). Differences with our study include the longitudinal design and the short interval between childbirth and assessmentof VAT. It may be plausible that parity does not affectlong-term gain in VAT as observed in our study. Age at menopause and body composition We did not identify robust associations between meno- pausal age and BMI, WC, VAT, and SAT. Although there is a large body of literature on menopausal status and bodyweight, very few studies (11, 36) have examined the as-TABLE 5.

In a Japanese study (n /H110051022), pre- and postmenopausal BMI were studied in three groups of women, depending on theage at the time of menopause ( /H1102145 yr, 45-50 yr, /H1102250 yr). No differences in the BMI were observed among thegroups both during early postmenopause and late post-menopause (36). There is a paucity of studies exploring theassociation of age at the time of menopause with body fatdepots. Menopausal status and body composition Further analysis to dissect the associations between age and menopausal status in the present study revealed thatpostmenopausal women had increased BMI, WC, VAT,and SAT compared with premenopausal women, but thisassociation was largely attributable to the age. These find-ings underscore the important role of aging and the se-lected indices of body composition. Several studies have explored the association of chro- nological aging vs.menopause-related changes in the body composition of women (19, 37-39). In the Study of Wom-en's Health Across the Nation study, a cross-sectionalstudy of a large multiethnic cohort of middle-aged women,after adjusting for chronological age, no differences wereseen in the BMI between premenopausal women andwomen who reported natural menopause (40). Similarly,Wing et al. (41) prospectively studied 484 middle-aged women over 3 yr and noted a 2.25-kg increase in weightduring follow-up; however, this weight was similar amongcontrol women who remained premenopausal during thefollow-up. Some studies have evaluated longitudinal changes in body composition among perimenopausal women usingimaging techniques. An observational longitudinal studyfollowed up 103 healthy premenopausal women over 4 yr.All women gained SAT over time; however, only womenwho transitioned through menopause demonstrated a sig-nificant increase in VAT (42). In another study, intraab-dominal fat by CT scan significantly increased by 21%across menopausal transition (43). However, in this study,no age-matched controls were used. Thus, it remains un-clear whether these findings were due to aging (43). In thepresent work, we have attempted to disentangle the asso-ciations of aging compared with menopause transition. Indoing so, we show that post- compared with premeno-pausal women have higher levels of SAT, but levels of VATare similar. Our results suggest that much of the differ-ences in body composition between pre- and postmeno-pausal women may be due to aging. Implications The overarching aim of our study was to use a life course approach to explore the association of female re-productive factors and body composition. The findings from our study suggest that early menarche in women maybe an opportune moment to advocate lifestyle measures toprevent adult obesity. Our study notes that parity and ageat menopause per se may not be suitable determinants for predicting obesity. However, further studies are necessaryto test whether female reproductive factors can be used totarget lifestyle interventions in high risk women to preventthe metabolic complications of obesity and CVD. Strengths and limitations The strengths of our study include the large population- based cohort without ascertainment for obesity-relatedconditions. All clinical risk factors were assessed by astudy physician. Clinical characteristics were carefullymeasured and standardized. A highly reproducibleMDCT scan was used for accurately measuring visceraladiposity. Limitations of our study include the observa-tional and cross-sectional nature of the data, obscuringour ability to comment on temporality and causality. Thestudy sample was comprised of predominantly Cauca-sians; thus, the findings may not be generalizable to otherethnic groups. Data on birth weight, prior growth param-eters, age at adrenarche, and thelarche were not recordedin this study. Other reproductive factors such as gesta-tional weight gain, polycystic ovarian syndrome, gesta-tional diabetes, and preeclampsia were not examined inthis study. Conclusions Earlier age at menarche is associated with overall adipos-ity but is not specific to VAT or SAT. Parity and age atmenopause were not associated with parameters of centralor generalized adiposity. However, postmenopausalwomen had higher levels of adiposity, which appears to bepredominantly due to age. Acknowledgments Address all correspondence and requests for reprints to: Caroline S.

We sought to characterize the nature and geographic scope of allegations of human rights violations perpetrated against civilians in Darfur and to evaluate their consistency with medical examinations documented in patients' medical records. Methods and Findings: This was a retrospective review and analysis of medical records from all 325 patients seen for treatment from September 28, 2004, through December 31, 2006, at the Nyala-based Amel Centre for Treatment andRehabilitation of Victims of Torture, the only dedicated local provider of free clinical and legal services to civilian victims of torture and other human rights violations in Darfur during this time period. Among 325 medical records identified and examined, 292 (89.8%) patients from 12 different non-Arabic-speaking tribes disclosed in the medical notes that they hadbeen attacked by Government of Sudan (GoS) and/or Janjaweed forces. Attacks were reported in 23 different rural councilareas throughout Darfur. Nearly all attacks (321 [98.8%]) were described as having occurred in the absence of active armed conflict between Janjaweed/GoS forces and rebel groups. The most common alleged abuses were beatings (161 [49.5%]), gunshot wounds (140 [43.1%]), destruction or theft of property (121 [37.2%]), involuntary detainment (97 [29.9%]), andbeing bound (64 [19.7%]). Approximately one-half (36 [49.3%]) of all women disclosed that they had been sexually assaulted, and one-half of sexual assaults were described as having occurred in close proximity to a camp for internally displaced persons. Among the 198 (60.9%) medical records that contained sufficient detail to enable the forensic medicalreviewers to render an informed judgment, the signs and symptoms in all of the medical records were assessed to beconsistent with, highly consistent with, or virtually diagnostic of the alleged abuses. Conclusions: Allegations of widespread and sustained torture and othe r human rights violations by GoS and/or Janjaweed forces against non-Arabic-speaking civilians were corroborated by medical forensic review of medical records of patients seen at a local non-governmental provider of free clinical and legal services in Darf ur. Limitations of this study wer e that patients seen in this clinic may not have been a representative sample of persons alleging ab use by Janjaweed/GoS forces, and that most delayed presenting for care. The quality of documentation was s imilar to that available in other conflict/po st-conflict, resource-limited settings. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary .

PLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 1 April 2012 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e1001198Introduction In the Darfur region of western Sudan, ongoing conflict between Arabic-speaking and non-Arabic-speaking tribes [1,2]has reached crisis proportions since the Government of Sudan(GoS) first initiated its military response to organized armedgroups opposing the GoS [2]. In addition to targeting armed rebelforces in its response, however, the GoS has also been accused of targeting non-Arabic-speaking civilians, namely members of the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa tribes [3,4]. By the end of 2007, morethan 2.4 million refugees from the violence, or nearly one-third ofthe population [5], had fled to camps for internally displacedpersons (IDPs) within Darfur or to similar refugee camps inneighboring Chad [6], thus creating a severe humanitariandisaster. Prior research has focused on generating accurate mortality estimates to inform policy and programming [7-13], with recentstudies estimating 200,000-300,000 deaths directly and indirectlyattributable to the conflict in 2003-2005 alone [14,15]. Thereported systematic, repeated, targeted assaults on non-Arabic- speaking civilians, large-scale disruption of rural livelihoods, and deliberate consignment to conditions conducive to death haveprompted observations that these could constitute acts of genocide[4,5,16-19]. Following a United Nations-appointed Commissionof Inquiry and an International Criminal Court (ICC) investiga-tion, the Pre-Trial Chamber I of the ICC issued arrest warrants forallegedly responsible authorities, including two arrest warrants for Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir (''Al Bashir'') on the grounds of crimes against humanity (March 4, 2009)[20,21] and genocide (July 12, 2010) [22]. Despite investigations into the violence in Darfur, little research to date has been able to make use of Sudanese documents to substantiate victims' or observers' claims of violence amounting towar crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide. GoS forceswere implicated in the Atrocities Documentation Survey [5,23-25]. Arab Janjaweed (''men with guns on horses or camels'')militias, which originated as Libyan proxy militias in the Chadiancivil war and have been suspected of collaborating with GoS forces [2], have been implicated in reports of sexual violence described by Darfuri women now living in IDP camps [26]. The systematicdestruction of livelihoods, which under certain circumstances canbe considered an act of genocide [17,27,28], has also beendescribed. However, a critical limitation of prior studies is theirreliance on self-report data gathered from victims living in refugeecamps outside of Sudan. One team of investigators attempted to conduct interviews at IDP camps within Darfur but was refused access by the GoS [17,27]. With unique access to medical recordsof clinical encounters in Darfur, we undertook this study tocharacterize the nature and geographic scope of alleged abusesagainst civilians in Darfur and to substantiate the allegations withforensic review and analysis of the medical evidence. Methods Ethics Statement As this was a retrospective analysis of de-identified medical records, informed consent was not obtained. All study procedureswere approved by the Harvard School of Public Health Office ofHuman Research Administration as well as an independent ethicsreview board convened for this research project by Physicians forHuman Rights. Given that the medical records used in the analysiswere de-identified, this research project was assessed to represent minimal risk to Amel Centre patients. The ethics review board wasguided by the relevant process provisions of Title 45 of the US Code of Federal Regulation and the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2000 [29] and was composed of individuals with expertise in forensic medicine, public health, bioethics, and international health and human rights research. Study Population and Setting Data for this study consisted of 325 de-identified medical records of all initial visits (i.e., excluding follow-up visits) of patients seen for treatment at the Amel Centre for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture, in Nyala, South Darfur, from its opening on September 28, 2004, through December 31, 2006. Records for 2007-2009 could not be retrieved because of ongoing security concerns (as described in more detail below). With funding from the European Commission, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the US Agency for International Development, and the United Nations Development Programme, the Amel Centre was the only dedicated local non-governmental provider of free clinical and legal services to any civilian victim of torture or other human rights violations. The Amel Centrereceived referrals from volunteers placed in three large IDP camps near Nyala (Dreig, Otash, and Kalma) but accepted civilian clients from all over Darfur. Aside from the free services, and transportation to and from the IDP camps, patients were not given additional incentives or benefits. The Amel Centre's initial staff in the Nyala office consisted of one general medicine doctor (M. A. E.), one junior doctor, one psychosocial worker, and two lawyers. Their training on the treatment of victims of torture and sexual violence was facilitated by the Sudan Organisation Against Torture and was consistent with the Manual on Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (''Istanbul Protocol'') [30-32]. The paper-based record-keeping system was similar to other prototypical clinics operating in conflict zones. Although examining clinicians typically conversed with patients in the patients' language of choice (typically Fur, Zaghawa, or Dago), notes documenting the encounters were written in English. A standardized medical record form was used, but few fields specified closed-ended responses (e.g., ''name,'' ''date of birth,'' ''date of detention''). The content of the clinical encounter, and therefore the bulk of the medical record documentation, was driven by patients' concerns. A network of volunteer physicians and social workers provided specialty care, and all women who disclosed that they had been sexually assaulted were referred to a gynecologist for evaluation. The laboratories associated with the network were able to implement all necessary blood, urine, stool, serological, and pregnancy tests but did not have the capacity for deoxyribonucleic acid analysis. After the initial visit, follow-up visits were provided to assess symptomatic improvement and provide longer term physiotherapy where indicated. The care provided and coordinated by the Amel Centre was delivered under difficult and often dangerous field conditions. After the ICC issued the first arrest warrant for AlBashir [21], the Sudanese Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs ordered the Amel Centre, along with two other local and 13 foreign aid groups, to cease operations [33]. The three clinicians formerly on staff are now living abroad. Prior to fleeing the country, they preserved hard copies of the medical records for 2004-2006 and sent them out of the country. Data Collection Amel Centre clinicians generated the medical records for the purposes of clinical care and internal record-keeping. We soughtHuman Rights Violations in Darfur PLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 2 April 2012 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e1001198to abstract the data both accurately and in such a way as to capture the main themes identified in the records. Guided by prior research [34-41], we created a list of different types of abuses thatmay be considered evidence of torture and/or other human rightsviolations, as well as symptoms potentially reported by patientsand signs potentially documented by examining clinicians. Thenwe developed a medical record abstraction tool that included lists of standardized names (e.g., tribes and rural council areas) and response options to guide efficient abstraction of data (Text S1). Data were abstracted by one of the authors (A. C. T.) from the demographic, incident, and clinical care components of the Amel Centre's general medical records. Although the general medicalrecords may have noted the presence of diagnostic or laboratorytesting, or specialty medical records, access to these raw dataelements unfiltered by the examining clinicians (e.g., diagnosticimaging or laboratory reports) were not available for our analysis. We collected data on patient socio-demographic characteristics, alleged abuses, and the harms reportedly resulting from theabuses. To assess the reliability of the data abstraction tool forcoding the key variables on alleged abuses, we randomly selected20 medical records for independent coding by two other study authors (M. A. E. and S. S. C.) as well as for wider discussion by the research team. Inter-rater agreement exceeded 0.70 on thecoding of most of these variables. The abstraction tool was furtherrefined through an iterative process to ensure that the variableswere clearly defined and could be applied consistently to the data. With regards to content validity, the 20 records were carefully reviewed to ensure that all potential categories were represented.Data from the remaining 305 medical records were thenabstracted by a single author (A. C. T.). Medical Opinions on Alleged Abuses Two study authors with extensive medical experience in the evaluation and treatment of survivors of torture and other forms of physical and psychological abuse (S. S. C. and V. I.) independently reviewed each medical record, blinded to each other's assessments.First, they determined whether the medical record containedsufficient detail to enable an informed opinion about theconsistency of the documented signs and symptoms with the record of alleged abuses in the medical notes. Second, among the cases that did contain sufficient detail, they assessed the extent towhich the recorded signs and symptoms were consistent with thealleged abuses described in the medical record. Consistency wasscored using a five-point Likert-type evaluations werebased on the Istanbul Protocol [30-32] and other conventions forthe evaluation of survivors of torture and other human rightsabuses [42-45]. Statistical Analysis Data were entered into Excel (version 12.0, Microsoft) and then exported to Stata (version 11.0, StataCorp) for analysis. We characterized socio-demographic, incident, and clinical variableswith medians and inter-quartile ranges. Inter-rater agreement wasassessed using the kappa statistic [46]. The locations of allegedattacks were mapped to the longitude and latitude [47-49] of the administrative center, principal town, or largest secondary town of the rural council area where they were reported to have takenplace. ArcGIS (version 9.2, Esri) was used to generate acontinuously variable proportional circle map, with circle sizesclassified into seven categories using the Fisher-Jenks algorithm [50].Results Characteristics of Amel Centre Patients We obtained medical records for all 325 patients presenting for care at the Amel Centre from September 28, 2004, to December 31, 2006. Summary statistics are presented in Table 1. Most patients were brought in by friends or relatives (54.2%) or by staffor volunteers (28.0%). Median age was 35 y, with a range of 4-82 y. Thirty patients (9.2%) were under the age of 18 y. Men comprised the majority of patients (252 [77.5%]). Approximately one-half (49.5%) of the men and boys were younger than 36 y ofage. Most patients were married (76.3%). All self-identified asMuslim. The sample included patients from 14 different non- Arabic-speaking tribes, and members of the Fur, Zaghawa, and Dago tribes accounted for nearly 90% of patients. Only two (0.6%)patients were from Arab tribes. Most (84.9%) lived in South Darfur, where the Amel Centre was located. Patterns and Geographic Scope of Alleged Abuses The attacks documented in the patients' records occurred between 2002 and 2006, with a peak frequency in March 2005.Characteristics of these incidents are displayed in Table 2.Between the date of the incident and the date of presentation at the Amel Centre, a median of 101 d had elapsed (inter-quartile range, 22-365 d). Approximately one-third (36.6%) of patientspresented to the Amel Centre within 6 wk of the alleged incident. Alleged attacks on individuals and villages recorded in the patients' records took place in 23 rural council areas (out of 65 total) throughout Darfur (Figure 1). Of the total, 281 (86.5%) occurred in South Darfur, 35 (10.8%) occurred in West Darfur,and eight (2.5%) occurred in North Darfur. Approximately one-third (35.1%) of the attacks disclosed by patients were also described by at least one other Amel Centre patient. Many villages were repeatedly attacked, with five villages reportedly attacked atotal of 41 times during the study period: Marla was attacked 13 times during a 12-mo period from December 2004 to December 2005; Adwa, ten (October (August 2003-August 2004). In addition, 46 (14.2%) patients disclosed that they had been attacked in the vicinity of an IDP camp: 16 (34.8%)of these attacks occurred inside the camp, 15 (32.6%) occurred a median of 3 km outside the camp, six (13.0%) occurred an unspecified distance outside the camp, and nine (19.6%) occurredwithin the general vicinity of a camp but the exact location wasunspecified. Two hundred ninety-three (90.1%) patients described their perpetrators as GoS and/or Janjaweed forces; of these, 48 (16.4%)stated that GoS and Janjaweed forces attacked in concert (Table 3). Thirty-two (9.9%) patients disclosed that they had been attacked by rebel soldiers, bandits, community authorities, or othercommunity members. Among those attacked by GoS and/or Janjaweed, 292 (99.7%) patients were from 12 different non- Arabic-speaking tribes, and only one (0.3%) was from an Arabtribe. Thirty-two (9.9%) patients disclosed to the examiningclinician that a military commander was present during the attack. Nearly all (98.8%) attacks occurred in the absence of active armed conflict between GoS/Janjaweed forces and rebel groups. Theexamining clinician noted when patients speculated as to reasons for the attack: 60 (18.5%) patients stated that they were targeted because the attackers suspected them of being rebels, and 58(17.9%) stated that they were targeted because of their racial ortribal identity.Human Rights Violations in Darfur PLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 3 April 2012 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e1001198Patients' medical records described a wide range of alleged abuses, including beatings (161 [49.5%]), gunshot wounds (140[43.1%]), destruction or theft of private property (121 [37.2%]),involuntary detainment (97 [29.9%]), and being bound with rope,chains, or other material (64 [19.7%]) (Table 4). GoS forces weredescribed as accounting for more than one-half of custody-relatedincidents (61 [59.8%]), whereas Janjaweed forces were alleged tohave accounted for most incidents involving physical assault (148[50.7%]), sexual assault (28 [62.2%]), and destruction or theft ofprivate property (77 [63.6%]).

Consistency between Allegations of Abuse and the Signs and Symptoms Described in the Medical Records The signs and symptoms most frequently documented in the medical records were chronic pain (194 [59.7%]), wounds or scars(167 [51.4%]), functional disabilities (e.g., contractures causingrestricted grasp) (65 [20.0%]), and bone fractures (55 [16.9%])(Table 5). There was 96.3% agreement ( k= 0.92) between the medical reviewers on whether the medical records contained sufficient detail to enable an informed opinion about theconsistency of the recorded signs and symptoms with theallegations documented in the medical record. More than one-third (127 [39.1%]) of the medical records were assessed by at leastone reviewer to lack sufficient detail (i.e., documentation wasincomplete) to enable him or her to render an informed judgmentabout consistency. Of the 198 (60.9%) records that wereconsidered sufficiently detailed by both reviewers, the medicalreviewers agreed that the recorded signs and symptoms wereeither consistent with (101 [51.0%]), highly consistent with (81[40.9%]), or virtually diagnostic of (5 [2.5%]) the alleged abuses.There were no cases in which the reports of medical examinationswere considered not consistent with, or unrelated to, the recordedallegations. In only 11 (3.4%) cases did the medical reviewersdisagree in their consistency scorings, for an excellent inter-rater agreement overall ( k= 0.89). Approximately one-half (36 [49.3%]) of all women presenting to the Amel Centre disclosed that they had been sexually assaulted. One-half of sexual assaults on women were recorded as having occurred in close proximity to an IDP camp, with nine (25.0%) recorded as having occurred in the general vicinity of the camp and nine (25.0%) having occurred within 3 km of the camp. The majority (31 [86.1%]) of sexual assaults on women involved rape or gang rape. Among these, five (16.1%) women disclosed they had become pregnant as a result of the alleged rape; no follow-up information was available on the remainder. Nine men also disclosed that they had been sexually assaulted, including one who had been raped. Twenty-five (55.6%) medical records of sexual assault victims were considered by the medical reviewers to be sufficiently detailed in recorded signs and symptoms to enable him or her to render an informed judgment about consistency. Of these, the medical reviewers agreed that the medical evidence was consistent with (14 [56.0%]), highly consistent with (9 [36.0%]), or virtually diagnostic of (1 [4.0%]) the alleged sexual assault. There were no cases in which the medical findings were considered not consistent with, or unrelated to, the alleged sexual assault. The reviewers disagreed about the scoring for one (4.0%) case, for an excellent inter-rater agreement on sexual assault findings overall (k= 0.92). Figure 1.

Therewere no cases in which the reports of medical examinations wereconsidered not consistent with, or unrelated to, the recordedallegations. Most of the abuses described in the medical records\u2014which included beatings, killings, sexual assault, torture, andinvoluntary detainment\u2014were allegedly perpetrated by GoS andJanjaweed forces and were described as having occurredthroughout Darfur, with five villages attacked a total of 41 timesduring the study period. The spatial distribution of reportedincident locations in our data suggests, at a minimum, that theattacks were widespread. However, our lack of a representativepopulation-based sample makes it difficult for us to generalizeabout the full extent or population incidence of attacks. Manypatients reported attacks by GoS and Janjaweed forces acting inconcert. In some cases, patients disclosed to the examiningclinician the names of specific victims, perpetrators, or militarycommanders, and this information was noted in the medical record. Fewer than 1% of patients reported observing theperpetrators to be in active armed conflict with rebel or othergroups. Although the medical reviewers had no way tocorroborate the identities of the perpetrators, these findings areconsistent with prior research implicating GoS forces in theperpetration of human rights violations upon non-Arabic-speakingcivilians in Darfur [24,25]. Nearly one-half of women presenting for care disclosed that they had been sexually assaulted. The use of sexual violence in armed conflict has been recognized as a means of not only demoralizing individual victims but also destabilizing their familiesand terrorizing communities [51-56]. Rape and other forms ofsexual violence have been recognized as war crimes and crimesagainst humanity [57], as well as instruments of genocide [55,58].Moreover, one-half of these assaults were described as havingoccurred in close proximity to an IDP camp. These data areconsistent with prior reports of rapes occurring near IDP camps[26,55,59], as well as previous work documenting that violencewas responsible for a substantial proportion of deaths amongpersons settled (i.e., not in the villages or in flight) in IDP camps inWest Darfur [11]. Collectively, these data raise questions about thesecurity provided to persons living in IDP camps, notably women,who must frequently venture outside the camp to gather firewoodfor fuel [27]. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee has issuedguidelines that suggest several minimum prevention and responseinterventions that could be implemented with regards to securitymechanisms instituted in areas of close proximity to IDP camps. In contrast to prior studies' reliance on self-report of refugees living outside of Darfur [17,24,25,27,28], our data are based onunusual access to medical records of clinical encounters in Darfurmaintained by local clinicians directly responsible for treatmentand record-keeping. Medical forensic experts reviewed andanalyzed the signs and symptoms described in the medical recordsand evaluated their consistency with the alleged abuses docu-mented in the medical notes. Less than two-thirds of the recordswere detailed enough for the forensic reviewers to substantiate thepatients' claims of abuse, a finding that is not surprising given thatthe Amel Centre medical records were not intended for researchpurposes. In a similar study in which third-party experts assessedthe official medical evaluations of forensic experts working for theMexican Procuradur \u00b4a General de la Repu \u00b4blica (Office of the Attorney General), in 18 of 39 cases (46%) their assessments wereindeterminate because of insufficient documentation to corrobo-rate alleged torture and ill treatment [60]. Their findings areconsistent with ours and highlight the potential value of usingclinical information to corroborate allegations of abuse. In ourstudy, among the medical records that contained sufficient detail,all were assessed to be at least consistent with (if not highlyconsistent with or virtually diagnostic of) the allegations. Thesedata substantially enhance the credibility of the patients' claims ofabuse. Importantly, however, the medical records provided theforensic reviewers with no data that could be used to corroborateeither claims of assailant identities or claims of genocidal intent. Limitations Interpretation of our findings is subject to a number of limitations. First, we used a discrete, comprehensive sample ofpatients, but it was not systematic. During this time period, theSudanese Criminal Procedure Act required all injury or traumavictims to file a report with the police in order to obtain a medicalevidence form (''Form 8''), without which they were legally notpermitted to receive treatment from an authorized medical officer[55,61-63]. In practice the police were known to deny the Form 8Table 3. Characteristics of alleged perpetrators.

Consistent withthis, patients in our sample presented for care a median of 101 dafter the abuses leading to their need for treatment. Furthermore,the majority of patients seen were men, highlighting the issue ofwomen's lack of adequate access to care and their overall limitedpublic mobility in this setting. These barriers are of particularsalience with regards to cases of sexual violence [61], wherevictims may fear reprisals, blame, and other psychosocialconsequences of disclosure [5,26,59,64-68]. A second limitationrelates to the delay in presentation for care. Although physical andpsychological sequelae may persist for years and even for the duration of a victim's lifetime, some symptoms and disabilities may resolve or diminish over time [42-45,69]. Despite their trainingand experience, Amel Centre staff could have under-detected andtherefore under-documented some symptoms, especially thoseconcerning sensitive topics (e.g., sexual violence, psychologicaldistress) that might not be spontaneously disclosed. Moregenerally, the medical chart review literature is characterized byunder-documentation of signs and symptoms [70-73], so weTable 4. Types of abuses disclosed by patients.

Third, because these data were not collected in a research setting, in most if not all cases, the same individual documented both the allegations of abuse and the results of the medical examination. The examining clinician's prior knowledge of the nature of the allegations could have biased the completeness of the documen- tation with regards to signs and symptoms observed. Fourth, few rape cases were scored by our medical forensic experts as virtually diagnostic of the alleged assault. Amel Centre protocol directed all female rape victims to a gynecologist for evaluation [74]. However, these records were unavailable for analysis because they could not be secured and sent out of the country prior to the clinicians' fleeing the country (as described above). Fifth, we were unable to include information on victims who were killed, so it may be more appropriate to regard our data as underestimating the true severity of atrocities inflicted upon non-Arabic-speaking civilians living in this region. Sixth, Amel Centre staff were routinely subject to surveillance, detainment, and interrogation by GoS forces [75,76]. With increasing frequency in 2009, Amel Centre staff were detained, interrogated, tortured, and accused of collaborating with the ICC. Upon Al Bashir's indictment, they were advised to flee the country. Because of ongoing securityconcerns, we could not obtain the records for 2007-2009 to analyze for this study. This limitation underscores that the Amel Centre clinicians provided medical and legal services under dangerous working conditions. Health care workers in other settings have faced similar challenges [77], further emphasizing the need for international support for the protection of health professionals working under similar circumstances. In summary, despite these unavoidable limitations, our study of non-Arabic-speaking civilian patients who visited the Amel Centre in Nyala, Darfur, between 2004 and 2006 found that in all of the medical records that contained sufficient detail, the recorded medical evidence was considered at least consistent with thealleged incidents of torture and other human rights violations. There were no cases in which the reports of medical examinations were considered not consistent with, or unrelated to, the recorded allegations. The widespread, organized, and sustained pattern of attacks documented in our study indicates that the actions of Janjaweed and GoS forces may constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity, and/or possibly acts of genocide.

Conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan between Arabic- and non-Arabic-speaking tribes over the past decade has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis.According to the United Nations, more than 2.7 million people have fled from their homes to camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) or to refugee camps in neighboringChad, and up to 300,000 people have died from war, hunger,and disease since the conflict started. The origins of this conflict go back many years, but in 2003, organized rebel forces began attacking government targets, accusing theGovernment of Sudan (GoS) of oppressing black Africans infavor of Arabs. In response, the GoS attacked the rebel forces, but some observers allege it also targeted non- Arabic-speaking civilians, in contravention of internationallaws of war. Observers have also accused the GoS of having links with the Janjaweed militias, nomadic Arabs who attack settled black farmers, although the GoS denies any suchlinks. Indeed, reports of systematic, targeted assaults on non-Arabic-speaking civilians, of large-scale disruption of rural livelihoods, and of deliberate consignment to living conditions likely to cause death have prompted someobservers to accuse the GoS of genocide (violent crimescommitted against a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group with the intention of destroying that group) and the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants for theallegedly responsible authorities. Why Was This Study Done? Most investigations of claims of violence against civilians in Darfur have relied on self-reported data gathered from people living in refugee camps outside Sudan. Because these data could be biased, in this cross-sectional study (a study that characterizes a populationat a single point in time), the researchers investigate thenature and geographic scope of alleged abuses against civilians in Darfur and endeavor to substantiate these allegations by analyzing the medical records of patientsattending the Amel Centre for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture in Nyala, South Darfur. Opened in 2004, this center provided free clinical and legal services to civiliansaffected by human rights violations. Its staff fled in 2009because of increasingly dangerous working conditions; the medical records used in this study were sent out of Sudan before the staff fled. What Did the Researchers Do and Find? Between September 28, 2004, and December 31, 2006, 325 patients were seen at the Amel Centre. According to their medicalrecords, 292 patients from 12 different non-Arabic-speaking tribes alleged that they had been attacked by GoS or Janjaweed forces in rural areas across Darfur. Nearly all thepatients reported that they had been attacked in theabsence of active armed conflict between GoS/Janjaweed forces and rebel groups. Half of them claimed that they had been beaten, two-fifths reported gunshot wounds, a thirdreported destruction or theft of property, and nearly a thirdreported involuntary detainment. Half of the 73 women seen at the center disclosed that they had been sexually assaulted, often near IDP camps. Only 198 medical records contained sufficient detail to enable the researchers to determinewhether the documented medical evidence was consistentwith the alleged abuses. However, in all these cases, the researchers judged that the medical evidence was consistent with, highly consistent with, or virtually diagnostic of thealleged abuses. What Do These Findings Mean? These findings provide credible medical evidence that is consistent with torture andother human rights violations being inflicted on non-Arabic- speaking civilians in Darfur from 2004 to 2006. These findings cannot be used to estimate the population incidence ofattacks on civilians or to corroborate claims of assailants'identities or of genocidal intent. Moreover, their accuracy may be affected by several limitations of this study. For example, during the study period, only patients whoobtained a medical evidence form from the police werepermitted to receive treatment from an authorized medical officer; obtaining such a form likely represented a considerable hurdle to accessing health care services.Nevertheless, the widespread, organized, and sustained pattern of attacks documented in this study is consistent with the possibility that the actions of Janjaweed and GoSforces during the conflict in Darfur may constitute warcrimes, crimes against humanity, and/or acts of genocide. Importantly, these findings also highlight the need to provide adequate protection for health professionalsworking in countries affected by internal conflicts. Additional Information.

Tsuia*, Debbie aim was to assess whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) was associated with painful symptoms among patients with HIV. Using data from a prospective cohort of HIV-infected adults with alcohol problems, weassessed the effects of HCV on pain that interfered with daily living and painful symptoms (muscle/joint pain, headache and peripheral neuropathy). Exploratory analyses assessed whether depressive symptoms and inflammatory cytokines mediated the relationship between HCV and pain. HCV-infected participants(n/C30200) had higher odds of pain that interfered with daily living over time (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.43; 95% CI: 1.02 /C12.01;p/C300.04) compared to HIV/HCV co-infected participants had higheroddsofmuscleorjointpain(AOR1.45;95%CI:1.06 /C11.97;p/C300.02)andheadache(AOR1.57;95%CI: 1.18/C12.07;pB0.01). The association between HCV and peripheral statistical significance (AOR 95% CI: 0.96 /C11.85;p/C300.09). Depressive symptoms and inflammatory cytokines did not appear to mediate the relationship between HCV and pain. Adults with HIV who are also co-infected withHCV are more likely to experience pain that interfered with daily living, muscle or joint pain, and headachescompared to those not co-infected. Research is needed to explore the association between HCV infection and pain, and to determine whether HCV treatment is an effective intervention. Keywords: pain; hepatitis C; cytokines; symptoms; peripheral neuropathy Introduction representative survey conducted in 1996reported that 67% of HIV-infected persons in the United States had experienced pain in the previous 4 weeks (Dobalian, Tsao, & Duncan, 2004). Pain isamong the most common of symptoms reported by HIV-infected patients, and is strongly correlated with quality of life and psychological distress (Breitbartet al., 1998; Vogl et al., 1999). Substance abuse and unhealthy alcohol use, which commonly occur in the context of HIV-infection (Samet, Phillips, Horton,Traphagen, in HIV-infected individuals is needed to effectively prevent and treat pain in this population. Aco-morbiditywhosecontributiontopainamong HIV-infectedpersonshasbeenrelativelyunexploredis infectionwithhepatitisCvirus(HCV).ChronicHCVinfection has been associated with painful diagnoses such as peripheral neuropathy, arthritis, and arthral- gias(Cacoubetal.,2000),aswellasgeneralizedpaininqualityoflifestudies(Spiegeletal.,2005).Individualswith HCV have been noted to have a high prevalence of chronic pain and treatment for pain (Silberbogen,Janke, & Hebenstreit, 2007; Whitehead et al., 2008), and a study of substance users found that those who wereHCV-infectedweremorelikelytohavepersistentpaincomparedtothosewhowereuninfected(Caldeiroet al., 2008). The majority of injection drug users areinfectedwithHCV(Garfein,Vlahov,Galai,Doherty, & Nelson, 1996; Lorvick, Kral, Seal, Gee, & Edlin, Murrill 2002; Thomas et al., 1995), and15/C130% of HIV-infected individuals are co-infected withHCVbecauseofthesharedriskfactorofinjectingdrugs(Sulkowski&Thomas,2003).Injectiondruguse (IDU) has been associated with greater pain in some studies of HIV-infected individuals (Del Borgo et al.,2001; Pehrsson,Osterberg, Sonnerborg, Hansson, 1999; Riley et al., 2003), and underlying HCV infection may be anunrecognizedcontributory factor. A number of causal mechanisms can be hypothe- sized to explain an association between HCV andpain. Depression, which is a known risk factor forpain in patients with (Richardson et al., 2009; Rileyet al., 2003; Tsao, Dobalian, & University], [Carly Bridden] at 10:04 31 January 2012 2003), is a common co-morbidity among patients with HCV (Dwight et al., Jamal,Regenstein, & Perrillo, 1997). Among HIV-infectedpatients,co-infectionwithHCVhasbeenshowntobeindependently associated with depressive symptoms (Libman et al., 2006). HCV may cause a cytokine- induced depression; a small study demonstratedcorrelations between plasma levels of interleukin-1 b (IL-1 b) and tumor necrosis factor- a(TNF- a) and depressive symptoms (Loftis, Huckans, Ruimy,Hinrichs, & Hauser, 2008). Researchers have alsosuggested that HCV may predispose to chronic painconditions such as fibromyalgia through a cytokine- mediated pathway (Thompson & Barkhuizen, 2003). The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether HCV status was associated with pain thatinterferedwithdailylivingandpainfulsymptomsinacohort of HIV-infected adults with alcohol problems.A secondary aim was to explore whether depressivesymptoms and serum levels of the inflammatorycytokines TNF- a, IL-6, and IL-10 mediated the relationship between HCV infection and pain. Materials and methods Design Datawereobtainedfromaprospective,observational cohort study(HIV-Longitudinal Interrelationships ofViruses and Ethanol [HIV-LIVE]), in which assess-mentsoccurredat6-monthintervalsoveramaximumof 48 months. Subjects Recruitment occurred from a previous cohort study, an intake clinic for HIV-infected patients, HIV primary care and specialty clinics at two hospitals,homeless shelters, drug treatment programs, subjectreferrals, and flyers. Enrollment occurred betweenAugust2001andJuly2003.Eligibilitycriteriawereasfollows:(1)documentedHIVantibodytestbyELISAand confirmed by Western blot; (2) two or moreaffirmative responses to the CAGE alcohol screening questionnaire, or physician investigator diagnosis of alcoholism; and (3) ability to speak English orSpanish. Exclusion criteria included: (1) scoring B21 on the 30-item Folstein Mini-Mental State Examina-tion (i.e., cognitive impairment); and (2) inability toprovide informed consent. The Institutional ReviewBoards of Boston Medical Center and Beth IsraelDeaconess Medical Center approved this study. Informed consent was obtained from each patientandtheprotocolconformstotheethicalguidelinesof the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. Outcomes The primary outcome was any pain interference with dailylife,whichwasmeasuredusingasinglequestion from the SF-12 (Ware, Kosinski, & Keller, 1996): ''During the past 4 weeks, how much did paininterfere with your normal work (including house-work)?'' Pain interference was defined as any re-sponse other than ''not at all.'' Secondary outcomeswere musculoskeletal pain, headache, and peripheralneuropathy. These symptoms were measured usingthe HIV Symptom Index (Justice et al., 2001). This index is a validated 20-question inventory of symp- toms common in the setting of HIV infection whichassessestheirfrequencyandconsequencesinthepriormonth. The questions asked: ''How much haveyou been bothered by each of the following symp-toms: 1) muscle aches or joint pain; 2) headache; and3) pain, numbness or tingling in the hands and feet(peripheral neuropathy)?'' Headache, muscle/joint pain, and peripheral neuropathy were defined as a response other than ''I do not have this symptom.''The primary and secondary outcomes were assessedat baseline and each follow-up visit. Independent variables The main independent variable was chronic HCV infection, as defined as a positive HCV antibodyresult confirmed with detectable HCV RNA level onpolymerasechainreaction(PCR)testing.Participantswho were HCV antibody-positive and HCV RNA-negative were considered not to have chronic HCVinfection (i.e., they had cleared their infection eitherspontaneously or through treatment). HCV status was assessed only at baseline. Covariates included in the analyses were age, sex, race (black vs. non-black),current marital status (married vs. not married),current smoking, past 6 months homelessness past6 months any IDU, past month any heavy alcoholuse, low CD4 count ( B200 cells/ mL), HIV viral load (detectable vs. undetectable), HIV medication use inthepast6months,depressivesymptoms,andbaseline serum levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF- a, IL-6, and IL-10. Hazardous alcohol use was defined as: (1)drinkinggreaterthan14standarddrinksperweek,orgreater than 4 drinks in a day, for men; or (2)drinking greater than 7 drinks per week or greaterthan 3 drinks in a day for women (Saitz, 2005).Depressive symptoms were measured using the Cen-terforEpidemiologicStudiesDepressionScale(CES- D), and a threshold of ]23 was used to define2J.I.Tsuiet al. Downloaded by [Boston University], [Carly Bridden] at 10:04 31 January 2012 substantial depressive symptoms (Golub et al., 2004). The cytokines TNF- a, IL-6, and IL-10 were chosen based on prior research demonstrating that (1) serumlevels are significantly different in the setting of HCVinfection compared to controls (Jacobson Brown &Neuman, 2001); and (2) they play a potential role inthe pathogenesis of central pain conditions and chronic pain (Jacobson Brown & Neuman, 2001; Uceyler & Sommer, 2008; Verri usingChemiluminescent ELISA Labora-tory testing was conducted at the University ofVermont's Laboratory for Clinical Biochemistry Research. Statistical analyses Chi-square and Student's t-tests were used to com- pare baseline characteristics of subjects with andwithout chronic HCV infection. General estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervalsfor each pain outcome. The GEE approach was usedto account for the correlation from using repeatedobservations from the same subject over time. Anexchangeableworkingcorrelationstructurewasused,and empirical standard errors are reported for allanalyses. Collinearity of covariates was assessed by calculating the correlation between independent vari- ables, and no pair of variables had a Spearmancorrelation /C210.40. A two-tailed p-valueB0.05 was considered statistically significant for all hypothesistesting. Final models were adjusted for all covariates.Covariates except for age, sex, and race were allmodeled as time-dependent. Based on the approachdescribed by Baron and Kinney (1986), exploratory analyses were performed to assess whether depressive symptoms and serum levels of cytokines TNF- a, IL-6, and IL-10 mediated the association betweenHCV infection and pain outcomes. As such, modelsthat included and excluded depressive symptoms andinflammatory cytokines were compared to assesswhether HCV coefficient estimates were attenuatedby inclusion of the potential mediators. All subjects had data on depressive symptoms, however, only 309 had data on IL-6 and 343 had data on TNF- aand IL-10 due to insufficient serum sample for testing.Indicator variables were used to create a category formissing values for inflammatory cytokines, so thatthe same subset of respondents was examined in eachanalysis. All statistical analyses were conducted usingSAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).Results Of the 400 participants in the HIV-LIVE cohort, 397hadbeentestedforHCVRNAandwereincludedin the analysis. Of the 397 HIV-infected subjects, 200(50.4%) were found to have detectable HCV RNAand were considered to be co-infected. Participantswho were HCV-infected were more likely to be older,homeless, have recently used injection drugs, dia-betes, and have substantial depressive symptoms(Table 1). At baseline, the prevalence of having painthat interfered with daily living, muscle or joint pain,headache, and peripheral neuropathy was higheramong HIV-infected participants who were co-in-fected with HCV compared to those who were not.HCV-infected participants were also significantlymore likely to have baseline levels above the medianfor IL-6 and IL-10. The median follow-up was 12.2/C131.7 months); the median number of follow-up assessments was 6 (IQR: 4 to 7). Analyses of long-itudinal data included 2371 observations from397 subjects. Results from final GEE logistic regres-sion models (adjusted for time, age, sex, black race,marital status, homelessness, smoking, hazardousalcohol use, IDU, low CD4 count, detectable HIVviral load, use of HIV medications, and additionaladjustment for diabetes for peripheral neuropathyoutcome) are presented in row 1 of Table 2.ParticipantswhowereHCV-infectedhadsignificantlyhigheroddsforexperiencing painthatinterferedwithdaily living over time (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]1.43; 95% CI: 1.02 /C12.01) compared to those who were not HCV-infected.

Discussion In this cohort of HIV-infected persons with alcohol problems, co-infection with HCV was found to beassociatedwithgreateroddsofexperiencingpainthat interfered with daily living, as well as symptoms of muscleorjointpainandheadache.Althoughpainhasbeen demonstrated to affect the majority of HIV- infected persons (Dobalian et al., 2004; Hewitt et al., 1997;Vogl etal.,1999), themechanismsthatunderliepain in this population are relatively poorly under- stood. Co-infection with HCV may be an overlooked and potentially modifiable risk factor for pain. Substance use, and in particular IDU, has been associatedwithincreasedriskforpainatbaselineand over time in HIV-infected patients (Del Borgo et al., 2001; Dobalian et al., 2004; Martin et al., 1999;Richardson et al., 2009; Riley et al., 2003; Tsao, Dobalian, & Stein, 2005). A study by Tsao et al.(2005) demonstrated that HIV-related disease burden mediated the association between illicit drug use andpain in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected per-sons. However, no published studies to date haveexamined the specific contributions of HCV co-infection to pain among persons living with HIVinfection. Because HCV is strongly associated withIDUandhasweakerassociationswithotherdruguse(Armstrong et al., 2006). it may be contributing toassociationsbetweensubstanceuseandpainobservedin other studies. Our findings suggest that HCV mayindependently contribute to pain in HIV-infectedpatients. As prior studies have demonstrated therelative safety and efficacy of anti-HCV therapyamong individuals with HIV (Carrat et al., 2004;Torriani et al., 2004), the potential to modify orprevent painful symptoms may provide additionalmotivation for addressing HCV in co-infectedpatients. Our results demonstrating an association between HCV infection and muscle and joint pain are consis-tent with background studies in HIV-uninfected populations. Quality of life studies using the SF-36 havedemonstratedgreaterbodilypainamongpatientswho are HCV-infected versus HCV-uninfected(Spiegel et al., 2005). Clinical manifestations of HCVinclude extra-hepatic painful conditions. In a largeTable 1.

Downloaded by [Boston University], [Carly Bridden] at 10:04 31 January 2012 series of HCV-infected subjects, the prevalence of arthralgias and neuropathy was found to be 19%and9%,respectively(Cacoubetal.,2000).Astudyof chronicliverdiseasepatientsfoundthatHCV-infected patientshadahigherrelativeoddsformusculoskeletalpain compared to uninfected patients (Barkhuizen et al., 1999). To our knowledge, however, no prior studies have reported an association between HCVand headache. There is evidence, however, that HCVcanbeneuroinvasive(Laskusetal.,2005),andalarge bodyofresearchdemonstrateslinksbetweenHCVand neurocognitive dysfunction (Perry, Hilsabeck, &Hassanein, 2008). The fact that HCV was associated withpainatmultiplesitescouldsuggestthatinfection with HCV affects one's overall tolerance of pain.Studies of pain tolerance using experimental techni- quessuchascold-pressortesthavefounddifferencesin pain thresholds between opioid dependent formerinjection drug controls (Compton,Charuvastra, & Ling, 2000; Compton, Charuvastra, & Ling, 2001; Doverty et al., 2001). It is conceivable that HCV status could, in part, beresponsibleforthesedifferences. We explored whether depressive symptoms and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines were mediators of the relationship between HCV andpain. Adjustment for depressive symptoms did not substantially attenuate the effects of HCV suggesting it is not a mediator. Results of the exploratoryanalyses also did not support that higher baseline levels of inflammatory cytokines were part of the causal pathway between HCV and pain. However,caution must be taken with interpreting these resultsas there were a number of limitations to the analyses. We measured serum levels of inflammatory cytokinesat baseline only, and it is possible that changes in cytokine levels over time might better correlate withpain. Second, serum cytokine levels pathway as cytokine expres- sion can occur in other compartments (cerebrospinal fluid, peripheral blood mononucleocytes) (Loftis,Huckans, & Morasco, 2010). There are additional limitations tothis study. The main study outcome was based on a single questionon the SF-12 questionnaire that reflected pain over the past 4 weeks. There was no information on pain severity,duration,ortreatmentavailableforanalysis.Our findings could be related to undertreatment ofpainamongHCV-infectedpersons.Priorresearchhassuggested that HIV-infected injection drug users areless likely to have pain effectively treated than those whodonotuseinjectiondrugs(Breitbartetal.,1997). Itisalsopossiblethatproviderswhocareforpatientswith HCV infection may be reluctant to prescribecertain pain medications because of concerns aboutpotentialhepatotoxicity.Thestudywasconductedona population of HIV-infected adults with alcohol problem, which may affect the generalizability of its findings. However, given the prevalence of pastalcohol problems among HIV-infected individuals,up to 40% in some studies (Samet et al., 2004), thesefindingswouldstillbeofimportanceevenifnotmore broadly applicable. There may be other unmeasured confounders such as stress or anxiety associated withHCV infection that were not addressed in theanalysis. In summary, this study of HIV-infected adults with alcohol problems found that participants who were co-infected with HCV were more likely to experience pain that interfered with daily living,Table 2.

Mitchell, M.D., M.P.H.1,6 Abstract Objective: To determine the impact of a video on preferences for the primary goal of care. Design, subjects, and intervention: Consecutive subjects 65 years of age or older ( n=101) admitted to two skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) were randomized to a verbal narrative (control) or a video (intervention) describinggoals-of-care options. Options included: life-prolonging (i.e., cardiopulmonary resuscitation), limited (i.e., hos-pitalization but no cardiopulmonary resuscitation), or comfort care (i.e., symptom relief).Main measures: Primary outcome was patients' preferences for comfort versus other options. Concordance of preferences with documentation in the medical record was also examined. Results: Fifty-one subjects were randomized to the verbal arm and 50 to the video arm. In the verbal arm, preferences were: comfort, n=29 Randomization to the video was associated with greater likelihood of opting for comfort (unadjusted rateratio, 1.4; 95% condence interval [CI], 1.1-1.9, p=0.02). Among subjects in the verbal arm who chose comfort, 29% had a of subjects in the video arm choosing comfort had a DNR order ( jstatistic 0.06; 95% CI-0.09 to 0.22). Conclusion: Subjects admitted to SNFs who viewed a video were more likely than those exposed to a verbal narrative to opt for comfort. Concordance between a preference for comfort and a DNR order was low. These ndings suggest a need Clinicaltria ls.gov Identier: patients admitted to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), are at a vulnerable point in their medical care.1 These patients are recuperating from an acute illness and of- ten have underlying complex chronic medical conditions. At the same time, SNF providers are likely to be unfamiliar with these patients' medical history and values. The hazards re-sulting from discontinuity of care between the hospital and SNF setting are well-described. 2-5 Emerging health policy initiatives are increasingly focused on reducing avoidable, costly and burdensome rehospitaliza-tions of older patients, particularly when patients' primary goalof care is comfort. 6,7Optimizing advance care planning by ascertaining the patient's care preferences presents a key op-portunity to promote goal-directed care that avoids unwanted and costly treatments. 8 Over the last decade, an expanding body of evidence sug- gests that video decision aids help patients make better in- formed decisions by clarifying treatment options for a variety of life-limiting conditions including cancer and advanceddementia. 9-13Video enhances communication beyond the usual ad hoc verbal approaches to advance care planning by providing realistic and standardized depictions of treatmentoptions. To date, video support tools for advance care plan-ning have not been studied in the post-acute care setting 1Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. 2General Medicine Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. 3Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts. 4Department of Medicine, Mt.

DOI: 10.1089/jpm.2011.0505 1 where vulnerable older patients are often required to make value-laden decisions about treatment options. To address this gap, we conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial of using a goals-of-care video for elderly pa-tients admitted to a SNF after an acute hospitalization. We hypothesized that compared to subjects randomized to a verbal description of the goals of care, those viewing the videodecision aid would be more likely to opt for treatments that align with comfort as the primary goal of care. An additional aim was to examine the correlation between a stated prefer-ence for comfort with the presence of a do-not-resuscitate(DNR) order in the medical record. Methods Subjects The protocol was approved by the Partners Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written informedconsent. Subjects were recruited from a consecutive sample of patients admitted from acute hospitals to one of two SNFs in the greater Boston area. Both SNFs were located withinnursing homes; one facility had 164 beds and the other had 190 beds. Recruitment occurred between July 1, 2010 and February 28, 2011. At the time of admission, all patients who were 65years of age or older and English-speaking were identied by the SNF admitting clerk and given a flier outlining the study. Patients were then asked by a SNF staff member (e.g., nurse orsocial worker) if they were interested in participating in the study. The nal eligibility of patients who expressed a will- ingness to participate was then determined by a research as-sistant based on an assessment of their cognitive status performed within 72 hours of SNF admission. Patients were excluded if they had a Short Portable Mental Status Ques-tionnaire (SPMSQ) score of less than 7. 14 Design All interviews were conducted in-person by one of two members of the research team (either A.E.V. or E.M.). Subjectsunderwent a baseline interview within 72 hours of admission to ascertain age, self-reported race, gender, religion, educa- tional status, marital status, self-rated health status (excellent,very good, good, fair, or poor), and self-reported completionof advance directives (designated health care proxy or living will). Immediately after the baseline interview, subjects were randomized into one of two decision-making modalities: (1) listening to a verbal narrative describing potential goals of care (control group) or (2) viewing a 6-minute video visuallydepicting treatments comprising the various potential goals of care (intervention group). We used simple randomization at each site based on a computer-generated scheme. Individualassignments were concealed in numbered envelopes. At the end of the trial, the randomization order of subjects was checked against the computer-generated list. The video and verbal narratives were presented to the subjects in a quiet room in the SNF by a trained member of the research team who followed a structured script. Subjects randomized to the verbal control group were read a de-scription of the three goals of medical care framework (life- prolonging care, limited medical care, and comfort care)developed in our previous work. 12,13,15,16This framework was generated from a review of the advance care planning literature, and consultations with geriatric, critical care, palliative care, health literacy, and decision-making experts.Early versions of the framework were tested and validated with elderly subjects. 12,13,15,16 The rst option presented, life-prolonging care, was de- scribed as aiming to prolong life using all available medical care, and includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation and treat- ments in the intensive care unit. The second option presented,limited medical care, was described as aiming to maintainphysical and mental functioning. It includes treatments such as hospitalization, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, but ex- cludes cardiopulmonary resuscitation and treatments in theintensive care unit. The third option presented, comfort care, was described as aiming to maximize comfort and to relieve pain. It includes oxygen and analgesics, but excludes intra-venous therapies and hospitalization unless necessary to provide comfort. Subjects randomized to the intervention group viewed the video decision aid, shown on a portable computer. The6-minute video depicts the three categories of medical care using the same denitions used in the verbal narrative, but includes visual images of the typical treatments comprisingeach goal. For example, life-prolonging care images includes: an intensive care unit with a ventilated patient being tended to by respiratory therapists; a simulated code on a mannequinwith clinicians conducting cardiopulmonary resuscitation and intubation; and vasopressors administered through a venous catheter. Visual images to depict limited medical careinclude: a patient getting antibiotics via a peripheral intrave- nous catheter; scenes from a typical medical ward service; and a patient wearing a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery. Thevideo depiction of comfort care includes: a patient on homehospice care receiving pain medications; a patient with a nasal cannula for oxygen at home; and, a medical attendant as- sisting a patient with self-care. The development of the video decision aid followed a systematic approach, starting with a review of the advance care planning literature. The video's design, content, andstructure were reviewed and edited for appropriateness and accuracy by geriatricians, critical care intensivists, palliative care physicians, and decision-making experts using an itera-tive process. The video was lmed without the use of promptsor stage directions to convey a candid realism in the style known as cinema verite. 17,18All lming and editing was done by the investigative team (A.E.V. and A.D.D.) followingpreviously published lming criteria. 19 After exposure to either the verbal narrative or video, subjects were asked to select which level of care they wouldprefer if their medical condition worsened while at the SNF. Specically, they were asked: ''Imagine that you became very ill and in need of medical treatment, which general approachof medical care would you want provided: life-prolonging care, limited care, or comfort care?'' Subjects unable to select a level of care were considered ''uncertain.'' For those subjects randomized to the video group, a four- point scale was used to assess perceived value of the video by asking subjects whether they were comfortable watching the video, whether they would recommend it to others, andwhether they found the video helpful in their understanding of the goals-of-care options. Subjects who stated they did not2 VOLANDES ET AL. nd the video helpful were asked to comment why, which was transcribed by the interviewer. Last, a chart abstraction by the research assistant was per- formed immediately after exposure to the verbal or videonarratives to ascertain whether or not the patient had a DNR order. Statistical analysis All subject characteristics and outcomes were described using proportions for categorical variables, and means andstandard deviations (SD) for continuous variables. The pri- mary outcome was a preference for comfort care (versus life prolongation, limited care or uncertain) as the goal of care andcompared between the two groups using the exact v 2test. Additional analyses were conducted between subject char- acteristics (age, gender, education, marital status, health sta-tus, presence of advance directive, race, and randomization arm) and desire for comfort care for the entire cohort (i.e., both arms of the study). Rate ratios (RR) and 95% condence in-terval (CI) were used to summarize the associations. Finally, jstatistics were used to summarize the agreement between stated preferences for comfort and the presence of aDNR order in the medical record among the subjects in theintervention and control groups. A two-sided pvalue <0.05 was considered statistically signicant for all analyses. With a target of 50 patients in each group, the power of the study was estimated to be 90% to detect a 30% difference inthe preference for comfort care between the two groups. Data were analyzed and the randomization table was prepared using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Results Subject flow A total of 155 consecutive English-speaking patients 65 years or older admitted to the two SNFs were approached toparticipate in the study, of whom 102 (66%) agreed to partici-pate. Patients who declined did not differ signicantly from the recruited subjects in terms of age, gender, or race. The most common reason given for not participating was lack of interest.Of the 102 patients expressing interest in the study, 1 patient was excluded because her SPMSQ score was less than 7, re- sulting in a total of 101 study subjects. A total of 51 subjectswere randomized to the verbal control group, and 50 subjects were randomized to the video intervention group (Fig. 1). Baseline characteristics of the subjects are shown in Table 1. FIG. 1. Flow diagram of study and subjects' flow.GOALS-OF-CARE VIDEO FOR PATIENTS ADMITTED TO SNFS 3 Outcomes Among the 51 subjects receiving the verbal narrative, 29 (57%) preferred comfort care, 4 (8%) chose limited care, 17 (33%) desired life-prolonging care, and 1 (2%) was uncertain. Among the 50 subjects receiving the video decision aid, 40(80%) chose comfort care, 4 (8%) chose limited care, and 6 (12%) desired life-prolonging care (Fig. 2). The proportion of subjects opting for comfort care was signicantly higher in theintervention group ( p=0.02). Subjects randomized to the video group had a greater likelihood of opting for comfort care (versus other responses; RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.9). None of the other subject charac-teristics were signicantly associated with a preference for comfort care (Table 2). In the verbal group, 28 of the 29 subjects who chose comfort care had a code status documented in their medical record. Only 8 of these 28 subjects (29%) had a DNR order in their medical record ( jstatistic 0.18; 95% CI-0.02 to 0.37). In the video group, among the 40 subjects who chose comfort care, only 13 (33%) had a DNR order in their medical record ( j statistic 0.06; 95% CI-0.09 to 0.22). The video decision aid washighly acceptable to subjects in the intervention group: 45 of 50(90%) subjects said they were ''very comfortable'' or ''some- said theywould ''denitely'' or ''probably'' recommend the video to others. Of the 50 subjects who viewed the video, only 4 (8%) found the video ''not helpful.'' All 4 subjects who did not nd the video helpful stated that they had already made their de-cisions previously and did not nd viewing the video addi- tionally helpful. There were no adverse events in either group. Discussion Elderly subjects transitioning from an acute hospital stay to a SNF who view a video decision support tool for advance careplanning are more likely to state comfort as a goal of care compared to those who listen to a verbal description about medical options. However, only about a third of subjects in botharms of the study who stated that they preferred comfort-ori- ented measures had a DNR order documented in their record. Thus, while a video decision aid increased the expressed desirefor comfort care, our ndings suggest a need to better translate those preferences into a written order to limit treatment. As the rst known randomized controlled trial of a video support tool to help determine the goals of care among elderlypatients transitioning from an a cute hospital to a SNF, this study supports and extends prior rese arch about video decision- making tools in seriously ill patients. 12,13,15,16In our previous work in advanced dementia and advanced cancer, video deci- sion aids elicited preferences for comfort-oriented care, but these studies were conducted in outpatient settings and with patientswho were making hypothetical decisions. Our current study extends this earlier work by showing the efcacy of the video for elderly patients in a clinical environment during periods of se-rious illness and transitioning across health care settings. Delivery of medical care to patients that is consistent with their stated preferences is a critical consideration to providinghigh-quality medical care. The main nding in this study in aSNF is consistent with all earlier trials of video support tools for life-limiting conditions: subjects exposed to the video com- pared to a verbal narrative are more likely to opt for comfort-focused care (vs. life-prolonging or limited medical care). Our prior work also found that video decision support tools im- prove patient knowledge about their condition and treatmentoptions, and reduce disparities among patients due poor health literacy. 12,13,20Federal and state bodies will soon legislate the development of decision aids to assist patients and their fam-ilies facing complex health care decisions. 21Our work supports this initiative and may inform the type of decision support tools selected for further development and implementation. Our ndings show a lack of correlation between docu- mented DNR status and stated preferences for comfort- oriented care regardless of decision-making modality. This suggests that in practice, more attention needs to be placed onproviding patients and their families with opportunities to fully discuss preferences and to ensure these preferences are reflected in medical orders, especially during a vulnerable period as el-derly patients transition between the hospital and post-acute care settings. 22-25Ideally, an out-of-hospital DNR form would be completed that can travel with patients across sites. Our study has several important limitations. First, the re- search staff collecting data were not blinded to randomiza- tion, which could introduce bias into our ndings. Previous randomized studies of interventions aimed at improving end-of-life decision-making have seldom been blinded because limiting the number of interviewers eases the burden onTable 1.Characteristics of Older Subjects Randomized to the Verbal Narrative and Video Decision Aid Groups Characteristics Verbal ( n=51) Video ( n=50) Age, mean (SD), y 76 (7) 79 (9) Women, n(%) 31 (61%) 30 (60%) Race, n(%) Black or African American 33 (65%) 27 (54%)Hispanic or Latino 2 (4%) 2 (4%)White 16 21 (42%) Education, n(%) Elementary 8 (16%) 8 (16%) Some high school 7 (14%) 7 (14%) High school graduate 16 (31%) 16 (32%)Some college 10 (20%) 7 (8%) 6 (12%) Marital n(%) Married or with partner 17 (33%) 16 (32%) Widowed 13 (25%) 17 (34%)Divorced 6 (12%) 7 (14%) Never married 15 (29%) 9 (18%) Not answered 0 1 (2%) Self-reported health status, n(%) Excellent 5 (10%) 5 9 (18%) 5 14 (27%) (36%) 11 (22%) 17 (34%) Poor 12 (24%) 5 Have an advance directive, an(%)28 (55%) 29 (58%) aSubjects were asked if they had an advance directive, either a living will or health care proxy.

Second, one third of eligible subjects declined to participate in the study, although they did not differ signicantly fromthe recruited subjects in terms of age, gender, or race. Third, videos can be manipulated to favor a particular perspective. Our study used one video exploring the goals of care. We didnot assess responses to different videos altering the races and characteristics of the patients in the video. However, the video FIG. 2. Subjects' preferences for their goals of care.

Fourth, we did not incorporate the video into clinical care by informing pa-tients' physicians of their preferences and then following pa- tients longitudinally to determine whether the video support tool had an effect on their advance care planning or actualclinical outcomes over time. This would be an ideal subse- quent study to our present pilot study. Finally, our sample was limited to two SNFs in the Boston area. Thus, our ndingsmight not be generalizable to elderly patients in other geo-graphic areas or health care settings. Discharge from an acute hospital stay to the post-acute care setting is a challenging and critical time of transition for olderpatients. Upon admission to a SNF, the patient's health status is often tenuous, and elucidation of their goals of care is needed to align ongoing treatments with patient preferences,and to help avoid unwanted and costly interventions for those whose goal of care is comfort. Our ndings suggest that video decision aids may be a feasible and effective approach to-wards addressing this need in the setting of a SNF. However,our ndings also demonstrate that ascertainment of goals of care may not be enough, as steps must also be taken to translate those wishes into a medical order (e.g., DNR orders). In summary, elderly patients often face complex decision- making as they transition from the acute hospital setting to the SNF setting. To secure high-quality medical care at thisjuncture, patients must be informed about their options re- garding end-of-life goals of care. Education of patients using video decision aids offers a more concrete portrait of potentialgoals of care compared to verbal discussions. As health care organizations look for innovative tools to inform patients at the end of life and to deliver high-quality medical care that isconsistent with patient preferences, video decision aids mayprovide a useful tool. Future initiatives to improve ascer- tainment of patients' goals-of-care preferences should also include activities to improve the alignment between patientpreferences, medical orders documenting patient goals-of- care, and the care that is delivered.

Alford, MD, MPH Objectives: Among patients receiving methadone maintenance treat- ment (MMT) for opioid dependence, receipt of unobserved dosingprivileges (take homes) and adequate doses (ie, 80 mg) are each associated with improved addiction treatment outcomes, but the as-sociation with acute care hospitalization is unknown. We studiedwhether take-home dosing and adequate doses (ie, 80 mg) were associated with decreased hospital admission among patients in anMMT.Methods: We reviewed daily electronic medical records of patients enrolled in one MMT program to determine receipt of take-homedoses, methadone dose 80 mg or more, and hospital admission date.Nonlinear mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to eval-uate whether take-home doses or dose 80 mg or more on a given daywere associated with hospital admission on the subsequent day. Co-variates in adjusted models included age, sex, race/ethnicity, humanimmunodeciency virus status, medical illness, mental illness, andpolysubstance use at program admission.Results: Subjects (n =138) had the following characteristics: use. During a mean follow-up of 20 months, 42 patients (30%)accounted for 80 hospitalizations.

Take-home status may reflect not only patients' improved ad- diction outcomes but also reduced health care utilization. Key Words: dose, hospital admission, methadone maintenance treatment, take-home status (J Addict Med 2012;6: 186-190) Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in the United States is provided in federally regulated clinics that typ- ically operate separate and in-parallel to mainstream medi- cal Although methadone dosing should individual- ized, as methadone metabolism exhibits individual variabil-ity (Lugo et al., 2005), higher doses are more effective than lower doses at retaining patients in treatment (Peles et al., 2010), diminishing craving, providing opioid blockade, andthus minimizing illicit opioid use and decreasing injection fre- quency (National Consensus Development Panel on Effective Medical Treatment of Opiate, Addiction, 1998; Strain et al.,1999; Faggiano et al., 2003; Center for Substance Abuse Treat- ment, 2005). National surveys of MMT programs have shown that the average methadone dose has been increasing sincethe 1980s and programs with higher average doses are more likely to be accredited by the Joint Commission (D'Aunno and Pollack, 2002; Pollack and D'Aunno, 2008). Thus, suf-ciently high methadone dose may be one marker of MMT quality. A \"take home\" is a dose of methadone given to the pa- tient to take unobserved at home in place of requiring a return to the clinic a subsequent day for observed dosing. Contingent take-home doses are offered as rewards to patients with reg-ular clinic attendance, counseling attendance, and abstinence from illicit drug use as measured typically by urine toxicology tests (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2005). With ad- herence to MMT program expectations, take-home doses may increase up to a maximum of 6 or 13 consecutives doses, soeligible patients present to clinic every 1 or 2 weeks. Thus, contingent take-home dosing results from and reenforces suc- cess in MMT and is another potential marker of MMT quality.In a cohort study, it has been associated with longer reten- tion in treatment and survival (Peles et al., 2011). Controlled studies have demonstrated that contingent take-home dosingincreases abstinence from heroin and cocaine use (Chutuape et al., 1999, 2001) and increases counseling attendance (Kidorf et al., 1994).

Patients receiving adequate methadone dosing and who have treatment successmay be less likely to use acute hospital services, as they may be more capable of self-management (ie, attending to their med- ical needs). Addiction treatment generally is associated with decreased utilization of acute hospital services and, in some cases, lower overall costs (Laine et al., 2001, 2005; Weisneret al., 2003; Friedmann et al., 2006; Gourevitch et al., 2007). However, it is not clear which aspects of MMT are associated with improved medical care utilization. In the setting of national health reform and the prospect of parity for the treatment of substance use disorders, the im- pact of MMT on the broader health system should be of interestto policymakers, providers, and patients. The determination of factors that reflect effective MMT will assist with evaluating health system outcomes. In this study, we reviewed the MMTand hospital electronic medical records (EMRs) of patients to determine longitudinally whether an association exists with hospital admission and 2 easily accessible clinical factors: (1)methadone dose and (2) take-home status. METHODS Study Design and Population We conducted a retrospective medical record review of patients in the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) MMT program from February 1, 2006, to March 30, 2008. Only those individuals who met the following criteria wereeligible for analysis: (1) enrolled in MMT on March 30, 2008; (2) received primary medical care from Boston Medical Cen- ter (BMC), an afliated but physically and institutionally dis-tinct medical center; and (3) had provided an active 2-way release of information with a BMC primary care physician. The release permitted ongoing exchange of medical informa-tion between the BPHC MMT program and providers at BMC for the purpose of clinical care coordination. This release was typically initiated at enrollment in MMT. For the purposes ofthe study, we linked patient data between the MMT program and the hospital. Investigators did not have direct contact with any study subjects as this study was a retrospective review ofmedical record data and therefore did not obtain any informed consents. This study was reviewed and approved by the institu- tional review board of Boston University and BMC, on behalfof the BPHC. Data Collection and Measures Outcomes The primary outcome of the study was hospital admis- sion (yes vs no) on a given day. To document hospital ad- missions, the medical record reviewers recorded start and enddates for each hospitalization listed in the MMT EMR from February 1, 2006, to March 30, 2008. The MMT nursing staff was informed by either hospital staff or the patient upon returnabout any hospitalization that resulted in a missed methadone dose. The nursing staff documented the dates, diagnoses, and locations of these hospitalizations in the MMT EMR after di-rect communication with the hospital staff. Forty-four of 55 hospitalizations (80%) reported to have occurred at BMC were conrmed in the BMC EMR. Periods when patients had no op- portunity to receive take homes were excluded from analyses.These periods included the rst 90 days of program admission, days incarcerated, and days hospitalized. Periods of known pregnancy were recorded and excluded because of expected hospitalizations during this time (pregnancy complications or child birth). Independent Variables There were 2 main independent variables in the study: methadone dose ( 80 mg vs <80 mg) and receipt of take home (yes vs no) on a given day. Methadone dose and take-home status were extracted from the MMT EMR for each day the subject was enrolled from February 1, 2006, to March 30, 2008. Take homes are the primary incentive MMT programsuse for positive reinforcement for patients who are succeeding in treatment and are granted after at least 90 days of complete methadone dosing attendance, counseling attendance, and noevidence of any illicit substances as determined by urine drug testing. Daily methadone doses were categorized as 80 mg or greater or less than 80 mg. This categorization was based onprevious studies that demonstrated that doses 80 mg or more were associated with improved treatment outcomes (Strain et al., 1999). Both methadone dose and take-home status weremodeled as time-dependent variables. Covariates From the BPHC EMR, reviewers recorded age, sex, race/ethnicity, and polysubstance use at the time ofMMT admission. Race/ethnicity categories included 3 mutu- ally exclusive categories\u2014non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black/African American, and Hispanic. Subjects were catego-rized with polysubstance use if alcohol, cocaine, or benzodi- azepine (nonprescribed) use was noted at methadone program admission. From the BMC EMR, we also recorded the ac-tive co-occurring medical and mental health conditions. Sub- jects were categorized as having medical illness if they had any of the following diagnoses documented: chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disorder, diabetes, renal disease, hypertension, cancer, pancreatitis, or hypercholesterolemia. Human immun- odeciency virus (HIV) status was documented and includedas a covariate separately from other medical conditions. Sub- jects were categorized as having mental illness if they had a mood, thought, or anxiety disorder documented. Analysis Descriptive statistics of all subject characteristics at study entry were obtained and stratied by take-home status(ever vs never) and dose status (always 80 mg vs ever 80 mg). We used nonlinear mixed-effect logistic regression models to evaluate whether receipt of take homes or high-dosemethadone were associated with a hospital admission on the following day. The mixed-effects regression model was used to incorporate multiple observations available from the sameindividual (eg, subjects could have repeated hospitalizations) in the analysis while controlling for the correlation within individuals to obtain proper estimates of variability.

J Addict Med rVolume 6, Number 3, September 2012 primary analysis included both independent variables in the same adjusted model. Because some previous studies dene 60 mg of methadone as \"high dose\" (Faggiano et al., 2003), we repeated the model, using a denition of 60 mg or higher in asensitivity analysis. Covariates in the adjusted model included age, sex, race/ethnicity, HIV status, chronic medical illness, mental illness, polysubstance use, length of time in treatment before study enrollment, and time since baseline. To minimize the potential for collinearity, we assessed correlation betweenpairs of independent variables and veried that no pair of variables included in the same regression model was highly correlated (ie, r>0.40). Analyses were conducted using 2-sided tests and a signicance level of 0.05. All analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina). RESULTS Of the 365 patients enrolled in the MMT program, 71 (19%) had no release signed for communication with a primarycare physician and 128 (35%) had a signed release, but not with a physician at the afliated medical center. Of the remaining 166 subjects screened, 28 were excluded because they hadbeen enrolled in MMT less than 90 days as of March 30, 2008. Hence, 138 of the 365 patients (39%) were ultimately found eligible and included in study analyses (Figure 1). The following were patient characteristics at study en- try: mean age of 43 years; 52% female; 49% 52% polysubstance use. Table 1 details patient characteristics over- all and stratied by both take-home status and methadone dose(80 mg or <80 mg). Among the study patients, 52% had at least 1 documented take home during the follow-up periodand 75% had at least 1 documented methadone dose of 80 mg or more. Those patients who ever received take homes were less likely to have polysubstance use at baseline, were older, and had more follow-up months during the study and moremonths in treatment before the study. Those patients with a dose always 80 mg or less were less likely to have mental illness or polysubstance use and had fewer follow-up months during the study. Among the 138 subjects, the total number of eligible observed days in MMT was 83,149 and the meanduration of follow-up time was 20 months. Of the 80 hospi- tal admissions among 42 (30%) subjects, 9 (11%) admissions were among subjects with take homes and 50 (62.5%) admis-sions were among subjects with 80 mg or more of methadone. The overall hospitalization rate was 0.35 hospitalizations per person-year of eligible treatment days. In models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, mental and medical illness, HIV infection, and polysubstance use, receipt of take homes was associated with signicantlylower odds of a hospital admission (odds ratio =0.26; 95% condence interval [CI], 0.11-0.62), whereas dose of 80 mg or more was not (odds ratio =1.01; 95% CI, 0.56-1.83) (Table 2). In a sensitivity analysis, methadone dose of 60 mg or more was also not signicantly associated with hospital admission. In both models, medical illness was associated with increasedodds of hospital admission. Common hospitalization diag- noses were typical for that seen in an urban hospital and are listed in Table 3.

Thus, achieving take-home doses represented not only substantial addiction treatment success but also a marked decreased risk of medical hospitalization during this period. Although thisanalysis does not determine whether take-home status directly reduces hospitalization or is a marker of other unmeasured factors, it does account for other known predictors of hospi-tal admission, including age, HIV infection, chronic medical illnesses, and mental illness. We found no evidence that the dose of methadone was associated with decreased hospitalization. The observed lack of association between doses greater than 80 mg and hospi- talization suggests that the benets of a higher dose do notinclude decreased hospital admissions.

Providing pharmacotherapy foropioid dependence should include demonstrating treatment quality and performance. Hospitalization is an important out- come to consider because of both health and cost implications.Adequate MMT dosing is already recognized as a measure of MMT effectiveness in that lower doses result in poorer addic- tion treatment outcomes (National Consensus DevelopmentPanel on Effective Medical Treatment of Opiate, Addiction, 1998; Strain et al., 1999; Faggiano et al., 2003; Center for Sub- stance Abuse Treatment, 2005). Take-home status has beenless studied, but by denition it is a marker of treatment suc- cess, because abstinence from drugs, participation in coun- seling, and daily dosing are required to receive take homes.However, whether or not such success extends to utilization of medical resources has not been examined in previous studies. By demonstrating an association between take-home status Copyright \u00a9 2012 American Society of Addiction Medicine.

J Addict Med rVolume 6, Number 3, September 2012 and hospitalization, an important medical and health system cost outcome, this study supports consideration of take-home status as a useful performance measure reflecting direct benet to individual patients and the wider health care system. This study' s strengths included the use of the daily MMT program EMR, which allowed us to determine each patient' s methadone dose, take-home status, and hospitalization status for every day they were enrolled in MMT during the study period. By including subjects with a documented primary carephysician and a signed release of information, our sample allowed for documentation of medical problems through the EMR at the afliated medical center. Although this inclusioncriterion limited the proportion of eligible patients included in the analysis and limits the generalizability of our ndings, it is unlikely that this would bias the results, because engagement inprimary care likely decreases acute care utilization. This study was also limited by the nature of retrospective design and focus on a single clinic. However, because MMT is subjectto federal regulations, there are substantial similarities from clinic to clinic. CONCLUSIONS Among MMT patients, receipt of take homes, but not dose of methadone, was signicantly associated with reducedmedical hospitalizations. Thus, take-home status reflects not only patients' improved addiction outcomes but also reduced health care utilization. Given that this characteristic is easyto measure, clinically important and had cost implications, it should be further considered as a useful quality and perfor- mance measure for MMTs. Furthermore, intervention studiesthat seek to increase take-home status among MMT patients should evaluate health care utilization outcomes.

Introduction Integration of substance use treatment and medical care has long promised to enhance the care of patients with alcohol and drug abuse, and related medical conditions ( Samet, Friedmann, & Saitz, 2001 ). In 2006, the Institute of Medicine called for normalization of collabora- tion and coordination among health care providers that serve patients with medical, mental health and substance use disorders ( Committee on Crossing the Quality Chasm, 2006 ). The integration of these services could improve the quality and ef ciency of care by diagnosing and treating more than one condition at once. Integration can be good for patients with more than one condition, because it allows for \"one stop shopping \"resulting in fewer visits to fewer places for care. The potential for longitudinal relationships to develop over time may result in increased understanding and trust, essential components in effective care for substance use disorders. Integration can also be good for providers because it facilitates team-based care where no individual provider takes on the full burden of a patient's multiple conditions, but the work is shared among multiple disciplines. Communication and collaboration can be a daily part of the team culture, eliminating an extra step to coordinate care. In the fall of 2011, JSAT recruited the co-chairs of the Substance Abuse Interest Group of the Society of General Internal Medicine, Dr. Jeanette Tetrault and Dr. Alexander Walley, to serve as guest editors ofa special issue to advance the science in this area. A call for submissions was issued in January 2012. Original research addressing the focus of the special issue received JSAT's standard peer review: two experts and an editor assessed each paper's pertinence andscholarly merit. The papers included in this special issue address a range of topics and settings that are relevant to the integration of medical care and substance use treatment. This diverse group of articles demonstrates that interventions for the detection and management of substance-related disorders can reach patients in medical settings. The converse is also true: the integration of medical care into specialty addiction treatment improves the effectiveness of care for substance-related medical conditions such as hepatitis C and HIV. Some important themes that emerge from this collection of papers enhance our understanding as to when and how these integrated models work. Several of the articles address the challenges of delivering high-quality interventions in medical settings. Others address the critical issue of complex comorbidity, as screening in medical settings will detect patients with substance use and co-occurring medical and psychiatric conditions for whom adequate treatment will require more than brief intervention. Fortunately, effective models exist for delivering care to patients with comorbid needs, of which some examples appear in this issue. Finally, this collection demonstrates the potential of pharmacotherapy as a tool for the innovative treatment of more severe substance use problems by medical providers. 2.

Pantalon et al., 2012 describe the development and psychometric testing of a tool to measure practitioner adherence to a type of brief intervention called the Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI) ( Pantalon ). The BNI Adherence Scale was originally used in the context of a randomized clinical trial of BNI for hazardous drinking in the emergency department. Through review of 342 audio-taped patient encounters in the emergency department, the authors found that the BNI Adherence Scale had excellent internal consistency and good-to- excellent inter-rater reliability. The authors conclude that this tool can serve as a measure of the integrity of BI delivery in randomized clinical trials and as an integral component of BI skills-based teaching exercises allowing trainers to provide structured feedback to trainees. Further research is needed in more diverse populations to understand its application in practice. However, as the eld of integrated medical and addiction care matures, standardized assessments will be essential to efforts to improve the quality of brief interventions. 2.2. Quality of chronic disease management for alcohol and other drug treatment in primary care Although alcohol and other drug (AOD) dependence are increas- ingly recognized as chronic conditions, treatment of these disorders often remains stuck in an acute-care paradigm ( Friedmann, Lemon, Stein, & D'Aunno, 2003 ). Implementing a chronic disease manage- ment approach to treatment of AOD dependence has the potential to improve addiction outcomes and patient satisfaction by providing flexible, patient-centered, longitudinal care ( Samet et al., 2001; McKay, 2009 ). Support for chronic disease management (CDM) models for addiction treatment exists; however, no formal assess- ment exists to measure the quality of CDM for AOD. Visit frequency and timing-based measures have classically been considered quality assessments in this area ( McCorry, Garnick, Bartlett, Cotter, & Chalk, 2000 ), whereas consideration of addiction outcomes has less commonly been considered. As such, Kim et al., 2012 investigated the relationship between quality of CDM measures for AOD dependence and addiction outcomes using data from a randomized clinical trial of access to primary care-based CDM for AOD depen- dence. Visit frequency, based on engagement in the CDM clinic, was not associated with abstinence or addiction severity while self-reported perception of receipt of chronic disease care, regardless of the source of care, was associated with abstinence and alcohol addiction severity. This work supports the efforts to integrate primary health care, mental health services and addiction treatment while showing that the quality of the CDM provided needs to be considered. Speci cally, as we continue to understand and implement integrated medical systems, patient perception of receipt of quality CDM may be a key factor associated with improved disease-speci c outcomes. 2.3. The potential of technology to improve the delivery of screening and brief intervention in medical settings Several barriers exist to implementing behavioral health screening and interventions in emergency department settings, such as time, provider constraints, lack of provider training, and incompleteknowledge of area referral and follow-up resources ( Delgado, Acosta, Ginde, et al., 2011 ). Using computer interfaces and other technology to deliver substance use screening and intervention has been proposed to perform these services, bypassing individual practitioner time and expertise and allowing modi able messages based on patient responses. Choo et al, 2012. explored the accessibility and interest in technology-based substance use health information among patients with alcohol and drug use presenting to the emergency department and the barriers to using such technology. The results of this study suggest that although access to technology was high, interest in receiving health information via technology ranged from 41 to 46% among patients misusing drugs and alcohol. Barriers included concerns over con dentiality \u2014especially among patients with drug misuse, complexity of use and time. Technology will undoubtedly play a key role in the implementation of integrated health care delivery systems. It is clear, however, that con dentiality concerns must be addressed if integrated health care settings are to realize the full potential of technology for screening and intervention. 2.4. Quality of behavioral health integration in medical care Health care reform has provided much impetus for comprehensive and integrated care, including integration of mental health and substance use services into primary care settings ( Humphreys & McLellan, 2011 ). Federally Quali ed Health Centers (FQHCs) will play a central role in these efforts, especially for patients with substance use disorders. McGovern et al., 2012 describe the development and feasibility of an organizational measure, the Dual Diagnosis Capability in Health Care Settings (DDCHCS) index, to assess the level of behavioral health integration in FQHCs. Prior work has established the utility of the Dual Diagnosis Capability in Addiction Treatment and the Dual Diagnosis in Mental Health Treatment to inform policy makers and researchers in efforts toward integrated care delivery ( McGovern, Lambert-Harris, McHugo, Giard, & Mangrum, 2010 ). After establishing DDCHCS feasibility and reliability, the authors utilized this measure to assess 13 FQHCs on level of behavioral health and substance use integration. They found that 3 of 13 FQHCs met standards to be dual diagnosis capable and were more likely to be integrated in behavioral health rather than addiction treatment services. Signi cant variation was noted in center staf ng, treatment practices and program milieu. Although designed to assess feasibility and eld testing of the DDCHCS, this study suggests that further work is needed to enhance the capability of FQHCs to deliver integrated health care to the large population of patients with substance use disorders who will become insured with the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. 3. Meeting the challenge of substance use and co-occurring disorders 3.1. Screening and brief intervention for alcohol use uncovers drug and mental health issues The American College of Surgeons mandates that trauma centers have alcohol screening and brief intervention services integrated into their programs. However, screening for alcohol use may uncover other problems, such as problem drug use and mental illness. Among a cohort of 878 injured trauma survivors, Zatzick et al., 2012 identify a high rate (74%) of illegal drug or alcohol problems and 25% with post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Among the 166 (19%) patients who received the brief intervention for alcohol, 70% had a concomitant illegal drug use or PTSD. So, while alcohol screening and brief intervention are mandated, it uncovers substantial other substance use and mental health issues, which these programs do not typically address. This nding demonstrates that integration to improve quality and ef ciency can yield further challenges in the real world. The authors suggest stepped-care interventions as a potential solution,378 A.Y. Walley et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 43 (2012) 377 -381where the intervention adapts based on the individual's co-morbidities. Whether stepped-care interventions will work awaits further study. 3.2. Integrated models facilitate treatment of HIV and hepatitis C in addiction treatment settings Methadone maintenance treatment for opioid dependence in the United States requires daily face-to-face dosing at the beginning of treatment, with the possibility of earning take-home doses up to once every 2weeks. This regular patient -provider contact creates the opportunity to deliver observed medical treatment for co-morbid medical conditions. Two articles in this issue describe methadone clinic-based treatment programs that seek to improve adherence to medication treatment, one offering directly observed HIV medication dosing, the other offering concurrent group treatment for hepatitis C infection. In both models, patients and providers chose to extend theduration of the integrated care intervention beyond the study period to cover the course of medical treatment. Sorensen et al. report on the implementation of a directly administered anti-retroviral therapy program among 24 HIV-infected methadone patients. They found improved HIV viral suppression and high rates of adherence to HIV treatment. Initially intended as a 24-week pilot that would include a planned step-down in intensity, at 48weeks 38% of the patients were still receiving daily directly administered treatment because the treatment providers and patients were not willing to transition the patients to lower intensity. This small study suggests that directly administered HIV treatment in methadone programs is feasible, popular among patients and staff, and improves HIV outcomes. Stein et al., 2012 describe the novel implementation of a concurrent hepatitis C infection group treatment program among 42 opioid dependent patients, most of whom were receiving methadone maintenance at multi-disciplinary drug treatment center. Concurrent group treatment included weekly group meetings for patients who initiated and continued through treatment together, experiencing the same treatment milestones together. Groups were co-led by a medical provider and peer educator and included elements of a traditional medical visit such as checking vital signs, administering pegylated interferon injections and provision of prescriptions during the group visit. This treatment program achieved treatment success rates comparable to previously published randomized clinical trials ( Jacob- son, McHutchison, Aghemo, Prati, et al., 2010; von Wagner, Huber, Berg, et al., 2005 ). This program, like that of Sorensen et al. above, was extended beyond the initially-intended 12weeks to the full treatment duration (up to 48weeks) because almost all patients wanted to continue group treatment. This study shows the promise of group medical treatment for hepatitis C within addiction treatment settings. It merits further study in controlled trials with more diverse addiction treatment populations \u2014including those on buprenorphine maintenance treatment. 3.3. Primary care models can integrate addiction and medical care for HIV and hepatitis C Ofce-based opioid dependence treatment with buprenorphine is effective in primary care settings ( Fiellin, Pantalon, Chawarski, et al., 2006 ). Clinical guidelines mandate that counseling be available, yet how much counseling should delivered and by whom is not clear (Sullivan, Barry, Moore, et al., 2006 ).Tetrault et al., 2012 report the results of a randomized controlled trial of 15-minute physician- delivered counseling (PM) every other week compared to PM plus an additional 45-minute nurse-delivered counseling every week for opioid dependent patients initiating buprenorphine/naloxone treat- ment in an HIV primary care clinic. No differences in addiction or HIV- related outcomes were demonstrated. However, patients in both groups had improved control of their HIV when taking buprenor-phine/naloxone. This study provides further con rmation that buprenorphine/naloxone treatment integrated into an HIV clinic has multiple bene ts for opioid-dependent, HIV-infected patients, re- gardless of the level of counseling available. For treatment of hepatitis C infection, achieving the success rates found in clinical trials in less selected, more diverse urban populations has been challenging ( Feuerstadt, Bunim, Garcia, et al., 2010 ). Initiation of hepatitis C treatment in real-world patients is a challenge because of the subacute presentation, competing priorities, numerous relative contraindications, and the length, complexity, and side effects of the medication. Islam et al., 2012. describe an Australian effort to increase uptake of hepatitis C treatment through screening and facilitated referral from an integrated primary care and syringe access program. Of 143 patients with con rmed hepatitis C infection, 67% were referred to specialty care and 48% attended at least one appointment, but only 7.5% initiated hepatitis C treatment. This study shows that a primary care model integrated into a syringe access program can facilitate an appointment with a specialist, but treatment initiation remains low. In order to treat more of those at highest risk for hepatitis C infection \u2014 people who inject drugs \u2014innovative and integrated programs are needed that build on the experience of Islam et al., 2012. 3.4. Buprenorphine/naloxone for co-occurring chronic pain and opioid dependence Caring for patients with chronic pain and opioid dependence is challenging because opioid treatment both reduces the pain and has the potential to worsen addiction ( Barry, Irwin, Jones, et al., 2010 ). Pade et al., 2012 describe the concomitant treatment of chronic pain and opioid dependence with buprenorphine/naloxone within a primary care-based co-occurring disorders clinic at the Albuquerque Veteran Affairs Medical Center. The clinic provided team-based primary care, opioid dependence treatment and psychiatric evaluation for patients with chronic pain and opioid dependence. Patient retention was high and pain scores improved in pre -post analyses. While chronic pain is a relative contraindication for buprenorphine treatment because of its partial agonist ceiling effect, this study supports the use of buprenorphine/naloxone by a primary care-based multi-disciplinary care team as a well-tolerated alternative to full opioid agonists for many patients with chronic pain and opioid dependence. Further research should focus on buprenorphine dose ranging and standardization of pain outcomes and may ultimately determine whether buprenorphine/naloxone should be considered as arst-line treatment for patients with chronic pain at high risk for opioid dependence and/or overdose. 4. Realizing the potential of addiction pharmacotherapy When medications are prescribed for substance use disorders, these conditions unavoidably become medicalized. The people with substance use disorders become patients, as a prescriber now must be involved in the care. Side effects and drug interactions need to be monitored. The study by Pade et al., 2012 described above demonstrated how integration of treatment for both medical and substance use conditions occurs by co-locating the care, but also can hinge on the innovative use of medications to treat two problems at the same time. Two other studies in this issue describe pharmaco- therapy innovations within integrated treatment models. 4.1. Buprenorphine/naloxone by mobile medical van Schwarz et al., 2012 describe the delivery of buprenorphine/ naloxone treatment for opioid dependence among a population that was not been included in prior randomized controlled trials. They report on Project BEST (Buprenorphine Entry into Substance Abuse Treatment), a mobile medical van-based program linked to a syringe379 A.Y. Walley et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 43 (2012) 377 -381access program that brought medical care and buprenorphine/naloxone treatment for opioid dependence into four impoverished neighbor- hoods in New Haven, CT. Patients retained on buprenorphine/naloxone for more than 1week had fewer emergency department visits that those retained less than 1week, but hospitalizations and lengths of stay did not differ. Although not a conclusive trial, this study demonstrates that retaining patients in community-based, medication-oriented addiction care might reduce utilization of emergency care. 4.2. Extended-release naltrexone for alcohol dependence delivered in primary care Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is FDA-approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence. It is typically dosed monthly via a medical provider-delivered injection. Lee et al. (2010) previously demonstrated a 56% treatment comple- tion rate and improved drinking outcomes at 12weeks using XR-NTX in a primary care clinic with physician-delivered medical manage- ment counseling. The current study describes extended follow-up (Lee). Of 40 patients who completed the initial 12-week study, 19 (48%) continued treatment for a median of 38weeks with persistently low levels of drinking. Of the original 72 patients who entered the original study, 7 (10%) completed the full 15months of treatment. Thus, in this real world primary care-based study, a small group did continue to bene t from long-term XR-NTX. Further research should focus on improving retention and developing alternative strategies for those patients who are less successful. 5. Conclusions As the implementation of health care reform progresses with conceptual support for the integration of the screening and treatment of substance use disorders and medical conditions, this special issue of theJournal of Substance Abuse Treatment offers multiple examples of innovative care models that put the concept of integration into practice. These papers examine important issues underlying thequality of substance use intervention delivery in medical settings; detection and co-management of co-morbidities that may be uncovered when integrated care is delivered; and innovative pharmacotherapy strategies. Integration is a key feature of health system reform that promises to improve the access, quality and value of care for all patients, but especially those with co-occurring substance use, mental health and medical disorders. Hopefully, the insights from this collection will inform this important work. References Academic, E. D. (2007). SBIRT Research Collaborative.

Tranah, PhD, Henri Wallaschofski, MD, Thomas Kocher, MD, Lenore J. PhD, Nora Franceschini, MD, MPH, Maarten Schipper,PhD, Albert Hofman, MD, PhD, and Henning Tiemeier, MD, PhD In the 20th century, life expectancy at birth increased from 50 years to over 80 years inWestern countries. 1Demographers repeatedly predicted that it had reached a ceiling, but life expectancy in record countries continues to rise by an average of 3 months each year.2Although epidemiological research has identi ed numer- ous predictors of mortality, information abouttheir comparative effect sizes and long-termpredictive power is sparse. Prior research hasoften been limited by a short period of follow-up, a limited set of covariates, or a focus on cause-speci c mortality. Only a few studies have evaluated the potential for explaining mor-tality from a broader perspective by jointlyanalyzing demographic characteristics, lifestylefactors, and indicators of health and disease. 3 --- 7 It is still unclear whether genetic information canbe used to predict mortality, but recent advancesin genomic technology allow for the inclusion of genetic markers in the prediction of mortality. We combined traditional indicators of mor- tality risk with genetic factors, derived froma meta-analysis of 8 genome-wide associationstudies and the literature, and associated themwith mortality over 15 years of follow-up. Ouraims were twofold: rst, to identify indepen- dent determinants of mortality by analyzing 162 a priori identi ed risk factors; second, to provide information on the independent andcombined potential of genetic markers in pre-dicting mortality. METHODS The Rotterdam Study is a population-based prospective cohort initiated in 1990. It wasdesigned to investigate risk factors for diseasesin 7983 participants aged 55 years or older in the Ommoord district of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. 8,9In the initial and subsequent investigation waves, trained research assistantscollected data on health, medication use, medical and family history, and lifestyle factors in exten- sive home interviews. Participants subsequently visited the research center for clinical examina-tions, with a special emphasis on imaging and oncollecting and storing biospecimens to facilitatein-depth molecular and genetic analyses. Dataanalyzed in this study concern 5974 participantswith genetic information available from the rst wave of the Rotterdam Study. Predictors We organized baseline data into related groups: age and gender, genetics, socioeco-nomics, lifestyle, physiology, diseases, andgeneral health. We hypothesized a priorithat genetics, socioeconomics, and lifestylewere associated with long-term health ef- fects, whereas physiology, disease, and gen- eral health were more likely associated withshort-term mortality. 10Overall, we analyzed162 risk indicators in this study: 69 previously studied risk factors for mortality and 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To study possible genetic risk factors of mortality, we used the genetic data of 19 033participants (women = 55%) aged 55 yearsand older from 8 discovery cohorts of Euro-pean ancestry. These people were participantsnot of the Rotterdam Study but of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE), of which the Rot-terdam Study is a part. 11We identi ed the top 50 loci from the meta-analysis of genome-wideassociation studies on time to death. In addition,we used 43 SNPs that mapped to genes fromas e m i n a lr e v i e w . 1For the analysis, we extracted all SNPs from the imputed gene information of the Rotterdam Study, except for apolipoprotein E (APOE ), which we genotyped directly.12Objectives. We investigated the quality of 162 variables, focusing on the contribution of genetic markers, used solely or in combination with othercharacteristics, when predicting mortality. Methods. In 5974 participants from the Rotterdam Study, followed for a median of 15.1 years, 7 groups of factors including age and gender, genetics,socioeconomics, lifestyle, physiological characteristics, prevalent diseases, andindicators of general health were related to all-cause mortality. Genetic variables were identied from 8 genome-wide association scans (n = 19 033) and literature review. Results. We observed 3174 deaths during follow-up. The fully adjusted 0.75, 0.77) predicted mortality well. Most of the additional information apart from ageand sex stemmed from physiological markers, prevalent diseases, and general health. Socioeconomic factors and lifestyle contributed meaningfully to mortal- ity risk prediction with longer prediction horizon. Although specic geneticfactors were independently associated with mortality, jointly they contributed little to mortality prediction (C 15y= 0.56; 95% CI = 0.55, 0.57). Conclusions. Mortality can be predicted reasonably well over a long period. Genetic factors independently predict mortality, but only modestly more thanother risk indicators.

Other than age, all continuous variableswere standardized to facilitate the comparisonof effect sizes. The estimates represent the effectof a change of 1 standard deviation. We analyzed the risk indicators and their association with mortality with Cox proportional hazard models. We calculated unadjusted haz- ard ratios and the con dence intervals of each, and subsequently optimized the prede ned groups separately, adjusting for age and genderwithin each group, by means of stacked imputedbackward regression, with P= .2 as the exclu- sion threshold. 30Finally, we combined all remaining variables in a nal model using back- ward regression. We also used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) pe-nalized regression as implemented in R (R De-velopment Core Team, Vienna, Austria) in thepackage \"penalized \"to validate the results from backward theproportional hazard assumption using Schoen- feld residuals.33Variables that did not ful ll the proportional hazards assumption in the imputeddatasets were modeled with piecewise constantHeaviside functions. 34We considered P<. 0 5 from 2-sided tests as statistically signi cant. We used time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to compare the predictive performance of the different vari-able groups over time. 35ROC curves describe the relationship between sensitivity (true positiverate) and 1 -specicity (false positive rate) for all possible cutoffs of a marker to distinguish be-tween high-risk participants and low-risk partic-ipants. We also computed the C-index, the probability that a participant who dies on any given day during a speci ed time interval has a higher predictive score than one who survivesbeyond that day. For this part of the analysis,we accounted for residual time dependencyusing Schoenfeld smoothing. 35We estimatedcondence intervals using cross-validation in 500 bootstrap samples. RESULTS At baseline, participants were on average 69 years of age (range = 55---99 years;Table 1) and 59% were female. Of the 5974participants, 3174 died (mortality rate = 4.2 per 100 person-years ) during the follow- up period. From 162 a priori identi ed risk factors of mortality (supplemental Table C),backward regression retained 108 variablesindependently in the nal model. Of these, 36 were signi cantly related to mortality (P< .05) as independent risk factors (Table 1). Age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.09; 95% condence interval [CI] = 1.08, 1.10) and female gender (HR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.62,0.81) were strongly associated with mortal-ity (Table 1). Of the candidate genes, a priori identi ed in the literature, APOE, insulin-like growth factor 1 signi cant and of mortality. From the 50 independent loci, identi ed from the meta- analysis of 8 discovery genome-wide associa-tion studies on time to death, 2 SNPs II,b(MAT2B ) were associated with mortality. Social class and living in serviced housing were independently associated with risk of death. Smoking status and pack-years as well as energyintake were also associated with mortality. Thephysiological measures blood pressure, bodymass index, and waist circumference, and, inparticular, the risk indicators assessed in blood(such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leuko-cytes, creatinine, C-reactive protein, and total cholesterol) or with imaging (such as bone mineral density of the femoral neck and aorticcalcication) were all independently related to mortality. Diabetes, cardiac diseases, Parkinson 's disease, cancer, and cognitive function re-mained independently associated with death. Self-perceived comparative health was a good in-dicator of mortality risk, as were unintentional weight loss and serious illn ess in the past 5 years. The predictive power of the variable groups is best explained in 2 ways. First, Figures 1 and2 show the development of predictive quality Note . AUC = area under the curve. FIGURE 1\u2014Time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic curves for prediction of mortality for different groups of variables: The Rotterdam Study, 1990-2009.RESEARCH AND PRACTICE e6|Research and Practice |Peer Reviewed |Walter et al. American Journal of Public Health |April 2012, Vol 102, No. 4over time. For each point during follow-up, the graphs depict the respective time-dependentarea under the curve of a given variable group.Next, Table 2 quanti es the predictive quality for 5 speci c prediction intervals (1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 years). Figure 1 shows that over time, all variable groups except genetic risk markers exhibited decreasing ability to predict death. Figure 1 andTable 2 also demonstrate that prediction basedsolely on age and gender consistently outper- formed all other groups of variables (C-statistic for15-year 15y] Table 2). Physiological risk and socioeco-nomic characteristics each predicted mortality equally well over 15 years (each C 15y=0 . 7 2 ; 95% CI = 0.71, 0.73). Although of signi cantly less predictive quality, th e C-index of genetic risk markers was still better than chance (C 15y=0 . 5 6 ; 95% CI = 0.55, 0.57). Figure 2 shows the performance of the age- and gender-adjusted model compared with thefully adjusted model (C . 8 0 ;9 5 %CI = 0.79, 0.81). Whereas adding socioeconomic and lifestyle information to age and gender(C 15y= 0.77; 95% CI = 0.77, 0.78) only slightly improved the predictive quality, the combinationof age, gender, general health, disease, andphysiology (C 15y= 0.79; 95% CI = 0.78, 0.80) predicted mortality almos t as well as all covariates that remained after backward regression. To allow comparison with other studies of cause-speci c mortality and different popula- tion health status, we report the associations ofthenal model strati ed by prevalent, baseline disease status and for cardiovascular diseasemortality in Table D (available as a supplementto the online version of this article at http:// www.ajph.org). DISCUSSION From a set of 162 established risk factors and candidate SNPs for mortality, we identi ed 36 (31 nongenetic, 5 genetic) independent andsignicant predictors of mortality. Speci cgenetic factors were independently associated with mortality and jointly predicted mortality better than chance. However, genetic infor-mation added little to age, gender, and othertraditional predictors of mortality. This analysis con rms prior ndings that multiple diseases, as well as socioeconomicsand lifestyle, jointly in fluence mortality in the aging adult population. 3,6Numerous predictors remained independently and signi cantly asso- ciated with mortality. Although several markersof prevalent disease remained associated withmortality, their risk ratios were attenuated.Others, such as prevalent dementia, cere-brovascular accidents, and transient ische-mic attacks, were not more effective atpredicting mortality than indicators of dis- ease severity and subclinical disease such as the Mini-Mental State Examination and se-rum C-reactive protein. Several speci c SNPs were independently associated with mortality in our analysis. Inaccordance with the literature, each additionalcopy of the APOE e4 allele increased mortality in our study cohort. 1,36,37Similarly, the IGF1R andWRN genes have been described before as being associated with longevity and aging,respectively, via improvin g stress resistance, in- nate immunity, metabolic maintenance and re-pair of DNA. 1This study also con rmed 2 novel loci in the vicinity of the TRIM32 andMAT2B genes as being associated with death. These 2loci were identi ed from the pool of SNPs iden- tied by the meta-analysis of the discovery co- horts in the genome-wide association studies.These genes have recently been associated withcancer proliferation. 38,39 Interestingly, unlike the predictive ability of all other domains, the ability of genetic markersto predict death remained constant during thecourse of follow-up. The stability of the predic- tive power of the SNPs observed in this study is probably due to the permanent nature ofthe genetic makeup. Other variables showeddecreasing predictive power over time that canbe explained by changes in the value of thesevariables during the course of follow-up. Our results support the view that speci cS N P s can be identi ed that are associated with mor- tality and might be used for risk prediction. 40,41 The results also show, however, that these com- mon SNPs have very limited predictive powerand that, especially when used in combination Note . AUC = area under the curve. FIGURE 2\u2014Time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic curves for prediction of mortality for age and gender and differently combined models: The Rotterdam Study, 1990-2009.RESEARCH AND PRACTICE April 2012, Vol 102, No. 4 |American Journal of Public Health Walter et al. |Peer Reviewed |Research and Practice |e7with traditional risk factors, they contribute very little, if anything at all, to improve the predic-tion of death in the general population aged 55years and older. Another nding relates to age and gender as predictors of mortality. In our study, the re- lative risk for mortality per year of age in the univariate model was only reduced by 25% inthe fully adjusted model. This is compatiblewith the idea that aging is not merely theclinical manifestation of disease but an un-derlying, disease-independent accumulation ofpathophysiological changes that favor mortalityover time. 42- - -44 The gender differences in this study were not due to differences in prevalent diseases atthe onset of the study. Females exhibited evenstronger reduced risks after adjustment forother risk factors. This strongly suggests thatthe gender difference in survival cannot beexplained by differences in health behaviorand disease at baseline. 45We can only specu- late that the survival bene ts of females can be found in gender effects or different geneticorigins not accounted for in this analysis. One ofthe potential genetic candidates that could con-tribute to the female survival advantage is the Xchromosome. 46Another genetic candidate is mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). It has been sug-gested that, because mtDNA is inherited from the maternal line, a possible intergenomic con flictbetween mtDNA and nuclear DNA favors female survival. 47We could not include markers on the X chromosome and mtDNA because the Xchromosome is not commonly analyzed in all thediscovery cohorts and mtDNA is also not avail-able on all genotyping platforms. Prediction of mortality by age and gender improved by only 5% upon inclusion of allindependent mortality predictors over the en-tire 15 years of follow-up. This is particularlyinteresting considering the multitude of inde-pendent risk factors identi ed in this study, and because all groups contributed signi cant variables. From the time-dependent area-under- the-curve analyses, 2 observations are particu- larly noteworthy: rst, most of the additional information beyond age and gender stemmedfrom indicators of physiology, disease, andgeneral health; second, although socioeco-nomic factors were equally good at predictingmortality as indicators of disease, the combi-nation of socioeconomics, lifestyle, and ge- netic markers contri buted visibly to the explanation of mortality risk only after 10years of follow-up and beyond. Thus, al-though socioeconomics and lifestyle wereassociated to mortality, they seeminglyexerted their effects on mortality throughphysiological risk indicators and diseaserather than by acting independently on mor- tality. 48This underscores the importance ofsocioeconomics and living conditions for public policy aimed at reducing health inequalities. To summarize the ndings reported here and in other studies, one can insinuate a cas-cade from gene to individual health to death, inwhich every step is accompanied by environ- mental in fluences, some of which are con- trolled by the individual (such as physicalactivity and obesity) whereas others are de-ned by the individual 's living circumstances, cultural heritage and surroundings. Figure A(available as a supplement to the online versionof this article at http://www.ajph.org) illustratesat which stage during the course of aging different interventions (e.g., improvements in living circumstances or the introduction ofa new therapeutic drug) can feasibly act andwhich health gains could be expected. Limitations Caution is needed in interpreting this study. It was not our aim to evaluate the size of the mortality risk associated with single risk factors. Several of the markers in this analysis describethe same underlying construct (e.g., bodycomposition). Therefore, the speci c relative risks must be interpreted cautiously. Otherimportant aspects of health such as physicalactivity and mental health are barely repre-sented among the risk factors analyzed, as only \"riding a bike \"and \"self-perceived comparativeTABLE 2\u2014C-Index for Different Combinations of Risk Factors at Different Time Points During 15-Year Follow-Up: The Rotterdam age and gender + socioeconomics + lifestyle + general health + disease + interval. The C-indices in this table are the areas under the curve of the graphs in Figures 1 and 2 for 5 different time intervals (1, 3, 5, 1 0, and 15 y). A C-index of 0.50 indicates a prediction of mortality that is no better than chance, whereas a C-index of 1.0 reflects perfect predictive quality.RESEARCH AND PRACTICE e8|Research and Practice |Peer Reviewed |Walter et al. American Journal of Public Health |April 2012, Vol 102, No. 4health \"were available to approximate these important dimensions of health. Another limi- tation concerns the genetic markers used in this study. We included only autosomal SNPs. Genetic risk is transferred through several other mechanisms, including DNA methylation, copy number variations, and mitochondrial DNA. Furthermore, because this study has not been replicated externally, it probably cannot be used for constructing a risk score. We did not seek external replication because of the multitude of speci c risk factors and instead relied on bootstrapping and cross-validation for guiding the LASSO analysis and the esti- mation of the C-index. At the same time, the selection of SNPs is among the strengths of this study, as the SNPs were identi ed from 2 sources, independent of the population under study. Other strengths are related to the multitude of risk factors and the prospective design with long follow-up. Conclusions We found 36 variables that independently and signi cantly predicted mortality in the Rotterdam Study population. Adding furtherrisk indicators to age and gender improved ourability to predict death, but the gain in pre-dictive quality was modest, particularly in thelong run. Surprisingly, speci c genetic risk fac- tors, independently and as a group, predicted mortality, but their added value to conventional predictors of mortality was low. Our ndings also support the importance of primary pre-vention in the areas of socioeconomics andlifestyle, as we could illustrate how these riskfactors continuously in fluence mortality risk independently and through their impact onphysiological risk status and disease. j About the Authors Stefan Walter, Johan Mackenbach, and Stefan Lhachimi are with the Department of Public Health; M.

We conducted a two stage meta-analysis of 50,000 SNPs across 2100 candidate genes to identify genetic variants for ABI. Methods and results: We studied subjects of European ancestry from 8 studies (n = 21,547, 55% women, mean age 44-73 years) and African American ancestry from 5 studies (n = 7267, 60% women, mean age 41-73 years) involved in the candidate gene association resource (CARe) consortium. In each ethnic group, additive genetic models were used (with each additional copy of the minor allele corresponding to the given beta) to test each SNP for association with continuous ABI (excluding ABI > 1.40) and PAD (dened as ABI < 0.90) using linear or logistic regression with adjustment for known PAD risk factors and population stratication. We then conducted a xed-effects inverse-variance weighted meta-analyses considering a p < 2 \u00d7106to denote statistical signicance. Results: In the 0.008, p = 7.01 \u00d7107) were signicantly associated with ABI. None of the SNP associations for PAD were signicant, though a SNP in CYP2B6 (p = 4.99 \u00d7 105) was among the strongest associations. These 3 genes are linked to key PAD risk factors (lipoprotein(a), type 2 diabetes, and smoking behavior, respectively). We sought replication in 6 population-based and 3 clinical samples (n = 15,440) for rs290481 and rs2171209. However, in the replication stage (rs2171209, p = 0.75; rs290481, p = 0.19) and in the combined discovery and replication analysis the SNP-ABI associations were no longer signicant (rs2171209, p = 1.14 \u00d7103; rs290481, p = 8.88 \u00d7 105). In African Americans, none of the SNP associations for ABI or PAD achieved an experiment-wide level of signicance. Conclusions: Genetic determinants of ABI and PAD remain elusive. Follow-up of these preliminary ndings may uncover important biology given the known gene-risk factor associations. New and more powerful approaches to PAD gene discovery are warranted. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with an increased risk for incident cardiovascular disease events and mortality [1,2] . In the reduction of atherothrombosis for continued health (REACH) registry, almost two-thirds of the individuals with PAD had concomitant clinically evident atherosclerotic disease in the cere- brovascular or coronary artery disease (CAD) territories whereas only one-quarter of the individuals with coronary disease had clin- ically evident atherosclerotic involvement of other arterial beds [3]. While PAD and CAD share many common risk factors, cigarette smoking and type 2 diabetes are stronger risk factors for PAD than for coronary artery disease [4]. The variable distribution of the bur- den of atherosclerosis across vascular beds among subjects at risk suggests that other factors exist, including possibly genetic fac- tors, that may contribute to the predilection of atherosclerosis to develop in a given anatomic location. Currently, little is known about the genetic susceptibility to PAD but familial aggregation of PAD and heritability estimates suggest contri- bution [5-10] . The ankle brachial index (ABI) is an easy and reliable diagnostic test used to detect symptomatic as well as asymptomatic PAD [11] . A genome-wide linkage scan for ABI several linkage signals in pathways of inflamma- tion, coagulation, blood pressure regulation, and lipid metabolism [8]. A recent large genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta- analysis of European descent participants found variants in the 9p21 locus signicantly associated with ABI [12] . However, there have been few candidate gene association studies for PAD, most of which have been limited by small sample size, modest number of genes examined, and lack of robust independent replication of ini- tial ndings [13] . We conducted a two stage large scale candidate gene association study of the 2100 candidate genes included in a cardiovascular gene-centric 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array [14] within the candidate gene association resource (CARe) consortium that included 21,547 individuals of European ancestry (1190 with ABI < 0.9) from eight cohorts and 7267 African American individuals (594 with ABI < 0.90) from six cohorts. In the second stage of the investigation, we sought to replicate our signicant associations among individuals of European ances- try in 13,524 individuals from population-based cohort studies and 1916 individuals from clinically based studies. We hypothe- sized that this approach would lead to the identication of novel genetic variants associated with ABI and PAD (as dened by an ABI < 0.90). Furthermore, we hypothesized that some variants may influence both PAD risk factors and PAD itself, as has been observed140 C.L. Wassel et al. / Atherosclerosis 222 (2012) 138- 147 in genome-wide studies of lipids and coronary artery disease [15,16] . 2. Methods 2.1. Discovery studies: CARe consortium and additional studies The CARe consortium (http://public.nhlbi.nih.gov/ GeneticsGenomics/home/care.aspx ) was funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in 2006 to explore the association of a custom cardiovascular gene centric SNP array [14] with a broad set of cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory phenotypes collected across nine longitudinal cohort studies [17] . The following CARe consortium studies contributed data to the present analysis (Tables 1A and 1B): atherosclerosis risk in communities study (ARIC, n = 9031 European Americans, n = 2853 African Americans), the Cleveland family study (CFS, n = 275 Euro- pean Americans, n = 365 African Americans), the cardiovascular health study (CHS, n = 3826 European Americans, n = 722 African Americans), the Framingham heart study (FHS, n = 2701 Euro- pean Americans), the Jackson heart study (JHS, n = 1734 African Americans), and the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA, n = 2280 European Americans, n = 1593 African Americans). The Amish study (n = 1008), the cooperative research in the region of Augsburg (KORA F3, n = 1807), and the Penn diabetes heart study (PDHS, n = 622) cohort all used the same cardiovascular gene centric SNP array and joined the discovery stage analyses conducted in European Americans. Description of each study is provided in the Supplementary Materials . For all studies, each participant self-identied as either White (European, European American) or African American and provided written informed consent. The Institutional Review Board at the parent institution for each respective study approved the study protocols. The characteristics of the discovery study samples at the time of ABI measurement are presented in Tables 1A and 1B by ethnic group. More than half were women and the mean age ranged from 44 years (CFS) to 73 years (CHS) in samples of European ancestry, and from 41 years (CFS) to 73 years (CHS) in African Americans. The mean ABI was 1.10 and the prevalence of PAD (ABI < 0.90) varied across studies, ranging from 4% to 12% in European Americans and from 5% to 21% in African Americans. Risk factor burden appeared greater in African Americans, as demonstrated by higher prevalence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity compared to European ancestry participants. 2.2. ABI phenotypes The details of the ABI protocol for each study are provided in Supplementary Materials, Supplementary Methods Table 1. For each leg, the systolic blood pressure at each ankle was divided by the systolic blood pressure in the arm. In the ARIC study, ABI was measured in only one leg and one arm chosen at random. The lower of the two ABIs calculated with each leg was used for analyses with the exception of the Amish study which used the average of an individual's two ABIs in the analyses. We dened two PAD phenotypes for genetic association anal- yses. First, we used the continuous range of ABI 1.40. Next, we dened PAD as ABI < 0.90 and conducted a case (ABI < 0.9)/control comparison (ABI 0.90 and < 1.40) analysis. Participants with an ABI > 1.40 were excluded as these subjects likely had medial artery calcication and therefore the artery would not be compressible to allow for determination of pressure in the artery. Excluding partic- ipants with ABI did not truncate the distribution substantially, and ABI was still normally distributed.

Genotyping Genotyping in the CARe cohorts and PDHS was conducted at the Broad Institute using the ITMAT-Broad-CARe (IBC) Illumina iSE- LECT custom array [14] . The Old Order Amish Study genotyping was also performed using the ITMAT IBC Illumina iSELECT custom array. For KORA F3 (Discovery stage) genotyping with the same array was performed in the Genome Analysis Centre, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen. The IBC array was designed to capture genetic variation in loci known or postulated to be associated with cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease and inflammatory diseases [14] . Speci- cally, a cosmopolitan tagging approach was used to capture genetic diversity across 2100 candidate genes [14] . Loci were primar- ily chosen in three groups as follows: (1) 435 loci were chosen areas with a high probability of functional signicance, (2) 1349 loci were chosen as having involvement in phenotypes of interest (i.e. cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease-related traits such as inflammation, hemostasis, obesity, diabetes) or were well- established loci requiring a number of SNPs for coverage, and (3) 232 lower priority loci were chosen, which also included larger genes [14] . Further details on the IBC array can be found elsewhere [14] . Details of the genotyping and quality control procedures are provided in Supplementary Methods Table 2. 2.4. Statistical analysis For each study, residuals of ABI stratied by gender and race were created from linear regression models and used as pheno- types in the association analysis; results of gender were pooled but all analyses were stratied by race. The ABI residuals were adjusted for age, clinic site for multi-site studies, principal com- ponents (participants of European ancestry) or global European ancestry (African American participants), ever smoking, type 2 diabetes, hypertension (>140/90 or use of anti-hypertensive med- ication), LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and body mass index (BMI). In each ethnic group, SNPs were modeled additively, and the association of each SNP with ABI was tested using linear regression. The PDHS study did not use diabetes as a covariate as all subjects were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. For CFS and FHS, linear mixed effects (LME) models were used to account for familial correlations. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test for the associa- tion of each SNP with PAD. For CFS and FHS, generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to account for familial correlations. The covariate adjustment for PAD was the same as used for the ABI phenotype.A xed effects meta-analysis with inverse-variance weighting was then conducted in PLINK V 1.0.6 [18] and Stata V 9.0 (College Station, TX) to combine the results for all studies. The association of each additional copy of the minor allele with ABI was quanti- ed by the regression slope (), its standard error [SE()] and the corresponding p-value. We calculated a meta-analysis odds ratio (OR) for each of the most signicant SNP associations for PAD. The meta-analysis OR represents the increase/decrease in odds of PAD for each additional copy of the minor allele of the SNP. We also tested for heterogeneity of study-specic regression parameters using the Cochran's Q statistic in Stata V9.0, and report the p-values for heterogeneity. Associations were considered to be signicant on an experiment-wide level at a p-value 2 \u00d7 106which was deter- mined based on the estimate of the number of independent tests [19] . SNPs with MAF < 0.01 were excluded. A gene-based test of association using the meta-analyzed p-values at the discovery stage was performed using the pro- gram Versatile Gene-Based Association Study (VEGAS) [20] ; http://gump.qimr.edu.au/VEGAS/ ). The SNPs are matched to genes using the UCSC Genome Browser hg18 assembly with the gene region dened by \u00b150 kb up-and downstream of the gene. The test is based on the sum of chi-square-statistics and the linkage dise- quilibrium (LD) of these SNPs is taken into account according to the correlation structure in the HapMap CEU samples. An empiri- cal p-value is provided based on all SNPs, as well as based on the SNPs within the top 20% with regard to their p-value. Since roughly 2100 genes are covered by the IBC chip, a p-value < 2.4 \u00d7 105is considered signicant. 2.5. Replication Given that contemporary genetics consortia and results indi- cate that very large replication samples are needed to successfully replicate SNPs, and that false positives are an ongoing issue in studies such as these, we attempted to replicate only the two SNPs that met experiment-wide signicance for ABI in European Americans in an additional 13,524 individuals of European ances- try from six population-based studies (Copenhagen city heart study, n = 5182; genetic study of aspirin responsiveness (GeneS- TAR), n = 618; KORA F3 (independent of KORA F3 participants in the sample), n = 1440; KORA F4, n = 411; national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES), n = 2358, and prevention of renal and vascular end-stage disease (PREVEND), n = 3515) and 1916 individuals of European ancestry from clinically based samples (cardiovascular disease in intermittent claudica- tion (CAVASIC), n = 434; genetic determinants (2012) Table 2A Candidate gene SNP associations for ankle-brachial index: discovery meta-analysis, p < 104. European and European Americans, n = 21,547. SNP Chr Physical position Nearest gene Feature = 671). GeneSTAR provided in silico genotyping (geno- typed participants with the same candidate gene chip used in the discovery cohorts) while in the remaining studies genotyped the 2 SNPs de novo using Taqman or Sequenom genotyping platforms.

Power and sample size for discovery and replication stages Participants of European ancestry : With a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.10, additive SNP modeling, and experiment-wide signi- cance level of 2 \u00d7106, for each additional copy of the risk allele, we have 80% power to detect a beta coefcient for ABI of 0.0092 and an OR for PAD of 1.45 in the discovery stage (n = 21,547). For European ancestry individuals in the replication stage for ABI (n = 15,440) using the more stringent signicance level of 2 \u00d7 106we have 80% power to detect a beta coefcient of 0.0106; using a less stringent level (i.e. = 0.025 based on carrying forward 2 SNPs for replica- tion), we have 80% power to detect a beta coefcient of 0.0058. In the discovery plus replication stage for ABI (n = 36, 987), we have 80% power to detect a beta coefcient of 0.0065 using 2 \u00d7 106as the type 1 error rate. Participants of African-American ancestry : With a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.10, additive SNP modeling, and experiment- wide signicance level of 2 \u00d7 106, for each additional copy of therisk allele, we have 80% power to detect a beta coefcient for ABI of 0.0155 and an OR for PAD of 1.67 in the sample of 7267 individuals in the discovery stage. No replication sample was available for this ethnicity. 3. Results 3.1. European ancestry studies: meta-analysis of ABI and PAD In European ancestry discovery samples, two SNPs were signi- cantly associated with ABI (Table 2A, Figs. 1 and 2): each additional copy of the minor allele of rs2171209 in SYTL3 was associated with a 0.007 ABI (95% CI 0.010, 0.004, p = 6.02 \u00d7 107, p for heterogeneity = 0.55) and each additional copy of the minor allele of rs290481 in TCF7L2 was associated with a 0.008 lower ABI (95% CI 0.011, 0.005, p = 7.01 \u00d7 107, p for heterogeneity = 0.08). Rs290481 is located in intron 14 within the 3/primeregion of the TCF7L2 gene on chromosome 10 is distinct from a cluster of SNPs in the 5/primeregion of TCF7L2 (represented by rs7903146), previously reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes in genome-wide association studies (r2= 0.001 between rs290481 and rs7903146) [21] European ancestry, rs2171209 was not sig- nicantly associated with the categorical PAD diagnosis made by the ABI threshold of 0.90 - each additional copy of the minor allele was associated with just a 1.09-fold greater odds of PAD (95% CI: 0.97, 1.22, p = 0.14); however, rs290481 was associated with PAD (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.35, p = 0.004), although this Fig. 1.

There was no association 95% CI 0.009, 0.004 p = 0.46) detected in African Americans. One additional SNP was nominally associated with ABI in individuals of European ancestry at p < 104(Table 2A). The most signicant SNP associations for ABI in models minimally adjusted for age, sex, and study site only remained similar to the fully adjusted models. When we removed all participants with type 2 diabetes from the analy- sis of the CARe studies (ARIC, CFS, CHS, FHS and MESA), the beta coefcients were essentially unchanged from those in Table 2A. Similarly, when we removed participants less than 60 years of age from the analysis in the CARe studies, beta coefcients were essen- tially unchanged from those in Table 2A. Because rs290481 is located in a gene previously strongly asso- ciated with type 2 diabetes, we conducted a test for interaction of this genotype with type 2 diabetes for ABI within the CARe discov- ery cohorts (ARIC, CFS, CHS, FHS, MESA). The test for interaction was performed on an additive scale using linear regression within each CARe cohort, and then combining the results in the diabetes and no diabetes strata using xed effect inverse-variance weight- ing meta-analysis. The magnitude of the effect with ABI was greater in diabetics (p for interaction 0.04, Supplementary Results Table 2, with each copy of the minor allele in participants with diabetes con- ferring a lower level of ABI (n = 1896, = 0.03, p < 0.001) compared to participants without diabetes (n = 16,685, = 0.007, p = 0.007). The gene-based analysis using VEGAS at the discovery stage did not reveal any different signicantly associated genes with contin- uous ABI from our individual SNP analysis (Supplementary Results Table 3). SYTL3 and TCF7L2 were among the most signicant genes for both analyses using all SNPs and the top 20% of SNPs) = 0.00161). In the replication stage, the association between ABI and rs2171209 in SYTL3 was not signicant in the population-based ( = 0.0004, n = 13,510, = 0.73) clinically based replicationsamples ( = 0.001, n = 1890, p = 0.82) (Fig. 3). Consequently, in the combined discovery plus replication meta-analysis the association was no longer signicant (n = 36,947, 0.003, p = 1.14 \u00d7 103) (Fig. 3). rs290481 in TCF7L2 also failed to replicate in the population- based replication studies ( = 0.001, n = 13,505, p = 0.38) and in the clinically based replication studies ( = 0.008, n = 1896, p = 0.20) (Fig. 4). In the combined discovery and replication meta-analysis the association between rs290481 and ABI no longer met experiment-wide signicance (n = 36,855, 0.004, p = 8.88 \u00d7 105) (Fig. 4). None of the SNP associations in individuals of European ances- try achieved experiment-wide signicance for PAD (Table 2B). One of the most signicant associations for PAD was in a coding, non- synonymous SNP rs3745274 on chromosome 19 in CYP2B6 (OR 1.24, p = 4.99 \u00d7 105). 3.2. African-Americans: meta-analysis of ABI and PAD In African Americans none of the SNP associations with ABI and PAD were statistically signicant (Tables 3A and 3B). The strongest association for ABI was rs2243100 on chromosome 17 in SLC25A11 ( 0.011 95% CI 0.006, 0.017, p = 5 \u00d7 105) and for PAD was rs4987756 on chromosome 18 in BCL2 (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.88, 4.76, p = 3.78 \u00d7 106). 4. Discussion We conducted a large candidate gene association study of 2100 cardiovascular candidate genes for ABI and PAD in over 21,000 individuals of European ancestry and over 7000 African Ameri- cans. In individuals of European ancestry, a SNP in the TCF7L2 gene (rs290481) and a SNP in the SYTL3 gene (rs2171209) were signicantly associated in the discovery stage with variation in ABI measurements and a suggestive association was identied in a SNP in CYP2B6 for PAD. These ndings are intriguing as the genes are linked to key PAD risk factors. TCF7L2 is the strongest144 C.L.

However, we were unable to replicate the SNP-ABI associations in additional samples from population-based studies or clinically based samples. Furthermore, the associations were not detected in African Americans. We did not observe any signicant associations for ABI or PAD in African Americans, possibly due to the relatively small sample size limiting our power to detect associations.4.1. In the context of the current literature Genetic factors leading to susceptibility to PAD remain largely unknown but are likely to be attributed to variants in many genes, each with small effects [13] or possibly from rare variants (minor allele frequency < 1%) with larger effects. While many of these vari- ants may lead to risk for PAD through effects on established risk factors or shared effects with CAD and other atherosclerotic dis- eases Wassel al. / Atherosclerosis 222 (2012) 138- 147 of arterial disease in the lower extremities. Although our nd- ings after the discovery stage did not bear out in the replication samples, the two genes are interesting candidates for ABI in light of the current literature and deserve some discussion. Genome- wide association studies of individuals of European ancestry have consistently reported an association between genetic variants of TCF7L2 and type 2 diabetes that has been conrmed in Japanese and African American samples [19,22-24,28-30] . However, our SNP in TCF7L2 , signicantly associated with type 2 dia- betes in large scale association analysis [21] . The replicated index SNP in TCF7L2 associated with type 2 diabetes is rs7902146. Fur- ther, (HMG) box- containing transcription factor that is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway [31] and is associated with impaired beta cell function, impaired insulin secretion and increased hepatic glucose produc- tion. Therefore, the TCF7L2 association in our discovery cohorts that presented even after adjusting for type 2 diabetes might deserve further attention in functional studies to elucidate its role in atherosclerosis. The association between SYTL3 and ABI may be mediated by lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)). A genome-wide association study in a small founder population of 386 Hutterites identied an asso- ciation between the extended LPA gene region on chromosome 6q26-q27 including SYTL3 SNPs with Lp(a) levels [32] . Genetic vari- ation within the LPA gene region including a very common copy number variation and other genetic variants explain up to 90% of Lp(a) concentrations [33] . Since Lp(a) concentrations and genetic variants within the LPA region are a strong risk factor for cardio- vascular disease [34] , it might well be that a SNP in the SYTL3 gene reflects a signal from LPA . Polymorphisms within the LPA gene region were associated with PAD in a past study [35] . Lp(a) may be an independent risk factor for PAD [36] but results are conflicting [37,38] . 4.2. Strengths and limitations To our knowledge this study is the largest candidate gene association study concerning ABI conducted in both individu- als of European ancestry and African Americans and includes the most extensive number of candidate genes investigated. In the CARe consortium, imputed GWAS data is available on the African-American participants; however, given our relatively mod- est African-American sample size, we chose to perform analysis of the IBC chip rst. We have also chosen the IBC chip because it was specically designed as a large scale cardiovascular-centric candidate gene array, and the genetic variants on the chip were informed by GWAS for vascular and inflammatory diseases as well as expression QTLs for atherosclerosis. Several limitations of our candidate gene meta-analysis merit comment: (i) The ankle-brachial blood pressure measurement pro- tocols used in the studies were heterogeneous. Hence, phenotype heterogeneity may have impacted our ability to detect associations. (ii) The ARIC study contributed over 40% of the European ances- try sample and measured ABI in only one leg which may have led to phenotype misclassication most problematic for the PAD phe- notype. The mean ABI did differ signicantly between European Americans in ARIC and European Americans from the other CARe cohorts (all p < 0.05) with mean \u00b1 SD of the ARIC ABI 1.12 \u00b1 0.13, CHS ABI 1.06 \u00b1 0.15, CFS ABI 1.08 \u00b1 0.10, FHS ABI 1.13 \u00b1 0.12, and MESA ABI 1.11 \u00b1 0.12. However, a sensitivity analysis excluding the ARIC samples showed parameter estimates of similar size. (iii) Not all studies had information on lower extremity revascularization, which may also have contributed to PAD misclassication. In gen- eral, these misclassications should cause bias toward the null. (iv) Control selection bias could have affected our PAD results insome way, although given that all of our studies except one (the PDHS) contributing to the PAD analysis were prospective cohort studies where knowledge of PAD would not affect exposure (i.e. genotype status) and the genotype precedes prevalent PAD, this is of lesser concern. For ABI analyses, we also analyzed our clini- cal replication samples separately by case-control status to avoid additional bias or heterogeneity. (v) Although we adjusted for pop- ulation stratication using principal components in the European ancestry analysis and global ancestry in the African-American anal- ysis, residual confounding could still be present. (vi) Our sample of African Americans was modest in size and likely limited our power to detect associations. For example, given the sample size of African-Americans we included and a risk allele frequency of 0.10, we only had 80% power to detect an increment in ABI of approxi- mately 0.02 or greater per each copy of the risk allele. The observed effect size of the experiment-wide signicant SNPs in European ancestry participants was much smaller than this value. According to our calculations in the methods section, for the European ances- try analyses, we can detect modest differences in ABI (similar to the ones we observed in this study), but are likely underpowered for PAD. Some of the mentioned limitations might have contributed to the observation that the most important ndings from the discov- ery phase could not be conrmed in the replication phase. However, it is unlikely that this fully explains the differences between the two study stages which necessitate additional large study samples. 5. Conclusions The search for genes influencing ABI and PAD remains chal- lenging. Although we cannot claim new ndings in our study, two associations at the discovery stage for ABI (SYTL3 , TCF7L2 ) may deserve further attention in other populations and functional stud- ies. Further study of the genes identied in this study for ABI (SYTL3 , TCF7L2 ) and PAD (CYP2B6 ) is warranted in other populations as further investigation of the function of these loci may uncover important biological insights into the pathogenesis of PAD. Iden- tication of main effects may have been difcult in our study due to the presence of interactions and heterogeneity across partici- pating studies. New and more powerful approaches to PAD gene discovery are sorely needed.

Methods: Randomised controlled trial. Adults with type 2 diabetes (n = 120), with HbA 1cgreater than or equal to 7.5 %, were randomly allocated (4 \u00d7 4 block randomised block design) to receive an automated, interactive telephone-delivered management intervention or usual routine care. Baseline sociodemographic, behavioural and medical history data were collected by self-administered questionnaires and biological data were obtained duringhospital appointments. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) was measured using the SF-36. Results: The mean age of participants was 57.4 (SD 8.3), 63% of whom were male. There were no differences in demographic, socioeconomic and behavioural variables between the study arms at baseline. Over the six-monthperiod from baseline, participants receiving the Australian TLC (Telephone-Linked Care) Diabetes program showed a 0.8% decrease in geometric mean HbA 1cfrom (8.9% to 8.7%) in the usual care arm (p = 0.002). There was also a significant improvement in mental HRQL, with a mean increaseof 1.9 in the intervention arm, while the usual care arm decreased by 0.8 (p = 0.007). No significant improvements in physical HRQL were observed. Conclusions: These analyses indicate the efficacy of the Australian TLC Diabetes program with clinically significant post-intervention improvements in both glycaemic control and mental HRQL. These observed improvements, if supported and maintained by an ongoing program such as this, could significantly reduce diabetes-related complications in the longer term. Given the accessibility and feasibility of this kind of program, it has strongpotential for providing effective, ongoing support to many individuals with diabetes in the future. Background The rapid increase in rates of diabetes poses a significant public health problem globally. Diabetes is currently esti-mated to affect 285 million adults worldwide, with the prevalence predicted to rise to 438 million by the year 2030 [1]. Its complications contribute significantly to illhealth, disability, poor quality of life and prematuredeath. The associated global economic burden is pro- jected to reach at least US$376 billion in 2030 [2]. Al-though guidelines and targets for optimal diabetes management are well documented [3], it is estimated that 40% of individuals with diabetes have sub-optimal gly-caemic control [4,5], significantly increasing their risk ofcostly and debilitating diabetes-related complications[6,7]. Diabetes self-management education facilitates the acquisition of knowledge and skills to improve disease management and has been found to improve glycaemiccontrol [8], with program duration being a critical * Correspondence: emily.d.williams@monash.edu 1School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, AustraliaFull list of author information is available at the end of the article \u00a9 2012 Williams et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Providing ongoing and long-term diabetes management support, particularly to those people living in rural and remote areas, is a majorchallenge for all health systems around the world. This highlights the need to develop and evaluate more feas- ible, accessible ways of providing such support for largenumbers of people with diabetes than is traditionally offered. Using information and communication technol- ogy (ICT) to provide diabetes management educationand support directly to patients offers such potential, by overcoming many of the barriers associated with more traditional modes of program delivery. Use of ICT hasbeen shown to yield improvements in self-care know- ledge and behaviour of patients and clinical outcomes associated with the prevention and control of chronichealth conditions, including diabetes [10-12]. Some studies have evaluated the role of automated or semi- automated telephone-delivered diabetes managementinterventions on glycaemic control, however, the results have been inconsistent with varying levels of reliance upon health professionals [13-15]. The Telephone-Linked Care (TLC) program is an automated and interactive telephone system designed to emulate telephone encounters between patients andhealth professionals [16] and to complement standard medical care. TLC systems have been previously used to effectively screen people with specific health conditions[17,18], promote self-care behaviours [19-22] and pro- vide monitoring of and feedback to patients with a range of chronic diseases [23-26]. A randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate a TLC program - the Australian TLC Diabetes program - designed to improve type 2 diabetes manage-ment. This paper presents the six-month results for the study 's primary outcomes, glycosylated haemoglobin and health-related quality of life (HRQL), and it alsodescribes the sample baseline characteristics, compared with a large Australian population study. Methods Study design The study methodology has been detailed elsewhere [27]. In brief, the study was a two-arm prospective ran- domised controlled trial, with adults with type 2 diabetes randomised to either the intervention (Australian TLCDiabetes program) arm or 'usual care 'control arm. Data were collected between July 2008 and December 2010. Ethics approval was received from the Human ResearchEthics Committees for all collaborating hospitals and Monash University. Participant recruitment and randomisation Participants were recruited through advertisements in newspapers, flyers distributed to health professionalsand to members of Diabetes Australia -Queensland, community newsletters and through diabetes clinics at three major hospitals in Brisbane (Princess AlexandraHospital, Royal Brisbane and Women 's Hospital, and Prince Charles Hospital). There were two steps to the eligibility screening (Table 1). In the first step, which took place during the initial contact via telephone or in person, research staff excluded individuals who did not meet all of the Step 1eligibility criteria or who met any of the Step 1 exclusion criteria. If potentially eligible, participants attended a baseline appointment at either Princess Alexandra orRoyal Brisbane and Women 's Hospital, where full infor- mation was provided, informed consent was obtained and baseline data collected. At that appointment, base-line questionnaires were completed and fasting blood specimens were taken, along with other clinical data (blood pressure, weight, height and waist circumference).Blood tests were conducted by Queensland Pathology using standardised assays. The second screening step verified the glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) inclusion criterion ( 7.5%). The final sample included 120 adults; n = 60 in each of the study arms. The allocation ratio was 1:1 and the allocation sequence was computer-generated. The arm allocation was conducted using a 4x4 block randomised block design with the partici- pant as the unit of randomisation. Study arms All participants received a quarterly newsletter contain-ing general health information; this aimed to maintain participation in both arms. Participants in both arms were advised to continue with their usual medical care.The usual care arm received no further intervention. The treating physicians were not blinded to the allocation. Intervention arm Australian TLC Diabetes program The intervention took place over six months during which they received the Australian TLC Diabetes pro- gram. Its main component is the Telephone-Linked Care (TLC) Diabetes system, an automated interactive tele-phone system, developed collaboratively by the Austra- lian research team and researchers at the Medical Information Systems Unit, Boston University, USA. TheAustralian TLC Diabetes system has been designed to improve diabetes management by targeting the following key self-management behaviours: blood glucose testing,nutrition, physical activity and medication-taking. Users were asked to call the system weekly using a landline or mobile phone. TLC 's responses, including feedback and encouragement, were tailored according to information entered in the TLC database at the start and the answers that it received from participants during all calls.Williams et al. BMC Public Health 2012, 12:602 Page 2 of 11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/602Training to use the TLC system The TLC Coordinator met with participants within one week of their baseline data collection to instruct themon the use of the TLC Diabetes kit (containing the TLC Handbook, an ACCU-CHEK WAdvantage glucose meter, test strips, and a Bluetooth device for uploading their blood glucose results to the TLC Diabetes system). For current smokers, a smoking cessation information pack was also provided. During this session, participantscompleted a training call to the TLC Diabetes system. Participants were asked to conduct all blood glucose self-monitoring with the study glucose meter and toupload its readings immediately preceding their weekly telephone conversations with the TLC system. Each participant chose a unique personal passwordthat they keyed in at the start of each call that linked the call to their database file and ensured correct par- ticipant identification and confidentiality. Before theparticipants' first call to the TLC system, the TLC Coordinator obtained self-care clinical targets for the participants from their primary healthcare provider(including recommended number of weekly blood glu- cose tests and blood glucose range, and clearance for physical activity). Content of weekly telephone calls Participants were requested to make weekly calls to thesystem over six months, with calls lasting five-20 min- utes, depending upon the call content and participant responses. Blood glucose monitoring was the first topiccovered in each weekly call. It was followed by one of three other topics, with these being medication-taking, physical activity or healthy eating (calls 9 to 12 and 21to 24). When diabetes medication was not prescribed, the medication-taking topic was replaced with physical activity. When clearance for physical activity was notprovided by the patient 's treating physician, physical activity was replaced by medication-taking. In cases when there was no clearance for physical activity and nopharmaceutical treatment of diabetes, the participant did not hear a second topic on some calls. TLC Coordinator The TLC Coordinator briefly telephoned participants after the first two calls and at weeks six, 12, and 20, toidentify and resolve any technical issues with the TLC Diabetes system or to determine reasons for not calling. In addition, the TLC Diabetes system sent email \"alerts\"to a dedicated study email address if any unusual clinical or other issues arose during the conversations, for example, where there were two or more hypoglycaemiclevels in the past week. In this instance, the Coordinator would advise the participant of the importance of visit- ing their primary care physician. More detail on theintervention is available elsewhere [27]. Measurement Participants in both arms completed comprehensive clinical and self-report assessments at baseline (Time 1), six months following baseline (Time 2), and at12 months (Time 3); this paper presents the baseline characteristics and six-month primary outcome findings. Outcome variables The primary outcomes were HbA 1cmeasured by fasting blood tests taken at the hospital appointment, andHRQL assessed by the participants 'self-completion of the SF-36 version 2 (divided into mental and physical component summary scores) [28]. Figure 1 illustrates the stages of recruitment and randomisation. Representativeness of study sample (Table 2) To examine the representativeness of the Australian TLC Diabetes sample, the baseline characteristics werecompared with data from the Australian Diabetes, Obes- ity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study [29], the largest national, population-based sample of Australians measuring theTable 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria for study recruitment Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria Eligibility Step 1 Type 2 diabetes diagnosis of 3 months Diagnosed with dementia/psychiatric co-morbidity Aged 18 -70 years Currently enrolled in another intervention trial Residing in greater Brisbane area, Australia Undergone bariatric surgery in past 2 yearsStable diabetes pharmacotherapy type for 3 months Pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant within next 12 months Ability to clearly speak/understand English via telephone Diagnosed with condition likely to be fatal within 1 yearStable pharmacotherapy dosage for 4 weeks Weekly access to telephone Eligibility Step 2 HbA 1c7.5%Williams et al.

The AusDiab baseline study was conducted during 1999 -2000 with data from 11,247 adults [29]. Demo- graphic and behavioural data were collected during inter-view, and diabetes status was assessed using fasting plasma glucose and oral glucose tolerance tests. A sub- sample of this nationally representative study, thoseidentified as having diabetes (and based on TLCinclusion criteria), provides the best comparison for the TLC study sample. Statistical analyses Detailed power calculations were described in an earlierpaper [27], indicating the need to recruit 340 par- ticipants to detect a small clinical change of 0.4% in HbA 1cwith 90% power assuming a 30% rate of loss to Figure 1 Participant flow diagram.Williams et al.

However, due to the slowness of recruitment (described below), our final sample comprised a total of 120 participants (60 per study arm). Although the com-prehensive recruitment effort achieved a very good response from individuals with diabetes (n = 512), a large proportion of these respondents either did not wish toparticipate or were ineligible due to either not meeting the HbA 1cor age eligibility criteria. Recruitment was stopped after 18 months with 120 participants having been recruited. Therefore, the power calculations were re-evaluated based on this number of participants, againassuming 30% loss to follow-up. With 80% power and a type 1 error of 5% (two-tailed), a difference in our primary outcome, HbA 1c, of 0.61% between the inter- vention and control arms (based on a standard deviation change of 1.0% between the randomised arms) at 12- month follow-up can be detected. This effect size wouldindicate a feasible outcome of clinical significance [30] for the intervention. For the analysis of the six-month results, HbA 1cvalues were logarithmically transformed in order to achieve anapproximate normal distribution. Analyses of covariance were used to examine the effects of the intervention (study arm allocation) on the primary outcomes (logHbA 1cand HRQL), with the inclusion of baseline values of the outcomes as covariates. Results for HbA 1care pre- sented as geometric means for each study arm and as aratio of geometric means when comparing study arms. The geometric mean is a natural quantity to use for pre- senting the centre of skewed data and is computed by exponentiating the average of the logarithmically trans- formed HbA 1cvalues [31]. To assess heterogeneity of the effect of TLC according to baseline values, interac- tions between study arm allocation and baseline values were included in further regression models. Creatinineand e-GFR were included as covariates in these analyses, since their levels at baseline differed sizeably between study arms. The sensitivity of conclusions to imbalancesin baseline characteristics was assessed via additional ANCOVA analyses adjusting for all characteristics exhi- biting any potentially important imbalances. To accountfor subjects lost to follow-up in intention-to-treatTable 2 Baseline characteristics of Australian Telephone-Linked Care (TLC) Diabetes sample (Continued) Clinical measures (%) 15.0 21.7 18.3 NC Doctor-diagnosed diabetic neuropathy (%) 18.3 25.0 21.7 NCDoctor-diagnosed kidney disease (%) 11.7 5.0 8.3 NCDoctor-diagnosed cardiovascular disease (%) 28.3 30.0 29.2 NC Data are presented as means (SD) and percentages, or as{medians (inter-quartile range) for skewed data.

BMC Public Health 2012, 12:602 Page 6 of 11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/602analyses, multiple imputation was performed using ten imputed datasets [32]. For the comparison of the baseline TLC sample char- acteristics with the AusDiab study sample, as well as for the attrition comparisons, independent samples t-tests (continuous data) and chi-square tests (categorical data)were used where the data were normally distributed, and Mann -Whitney U tests were employed for highly skewed data. All analyses were performed using SPSS18.0, with the statistical significance level set at p < 0.05. Results Of the 52 individuals who did not wish to participate at the initial eligibility screening stage, the primary reason for non-participation was lack of interest (n = 21), withan additional 11 reporting potential difficulties with travel for the baseline data collection. Other reasons included lack of time due to work and other commit-ments. There were no age differences between those who were willing and unwilling to participate, although there was a higher proportion of women who wereunwilling to participate compared with those who chose to participate (61.5% compared with 43%). As shown in Table 2, which summarises the baseline characteristics of the TLC and usual care arms, the Australian TLC Diabetes sample had a mean age of 57.4 years (\u00b1 8.3), with a higher proportion of men(62.5%) than women. The vast majority of participants were born in Australia (70.0%), were married or cohabit- ing with a partner (75.0%), with education above second-ary school level (65.0%). Approximately half of the sample were employed (45.8%) and had complementary private medical insurance (55.8%). The mean numberof hours per week spent exercising was reported to be 6.1 (\u00b1 6.4), with the majority of the sample (55.9%) par- ticipating in the nationally-recommended level of weeklyphysical activity (>150 minutes of exercise per week in at least 5 sessions per week [33]). Only 1.7% of the sam- ple were current smokers. Approximately three quartersof the sample rated their health as good or higher (74.2%). Nearly two-thirds of the sample had been previ- ously diagnosed by a doctor with hypertension (65.8%)and hypercholesterolaemia (63.3%), and therefore were likely to be receiving treatment for these conditions as was reflected in their blood pressure and lipid profilesthat predominantly fell within the normal range. Comparison of baseline sample characteristics between study arms The baseline sample characteristics were compared across the usual care and intervention arms to evaluatethe randomisation process (Table 2). Comparison of the baseline characteristics across usual care and inter- vention arms revealed important differences in e-GFR,which showed a significantly greater impairment in renal function in the intervention compared with usual care arm, and creatinine. Other differences observed were inage, education, and self-care behaviours (adherence to blood glucose testing recommendations and daily insulin/ diabetes medications, and foot inspections). Adjustmentswere made for these variables in sensitivity analyses. Post-intervention results at six months Attrition Of the total sample, 92.5% completed the six-month assessment (see Figure 1). Overall, nine participants (twowomen and seven men) withdrew from participation in the study, four in the intervention arm and five in the usual care arm. The reasons given for withdrawalfrom the usual care arm were all related to frustration at 'missing out 'on the intervention. The participants receiving the Australian TLC Diabetes intervention with-drew for a range of reasons, including relocation, being unable to use the blood glucose meter, and disappoint- ment with the intervention. The sociodemographic, beha-vioural or biological profiles were compared between those people who remained in the study and the nine people who withdrew. There were no significant dif-ferences at baseline across any of the domains of risk factor profiles. Use of Australian TLC Diabetes system The mean number of completed calls for the Australian TLC Diabetes participants during the six-month inter-vention was 18 (\u00b1 6), ranging between 2 and 27 calls, with a mean call duration of 11 minutes (\u00b1 1). The mean percentage of completed calls out of the expected weeklycalls for all individuals in the intervention condition was 76% (\u00b1 22). More detailed analyses of the usage of the Australian TLC Diabetes system are beyondthe scope of this paper and are to be presented in a future manuscript. A small number of people in the intervention arm (n = 5) discontinued participation in the intervention but still completed the six-month assessment (Figure 1). Out of these, two participants made less than five calls andone made only seven calls. Study outcomes These analyses were based on intention-to-treat. There was a statistically significant difference in HbA 1cat six months between the usual care and TLC Diabetes arms.The geometric mean (arithmetic means provided with8.9% (9.0%) to 8.7% (8.9%) in the usual care arm, with the adjusted ratio of six-month geometric means of 0.91 (95% CI 0.86-0.93, p = 0.002) (Table 3). The ratio ofWilliams et al. BMC Public Health 2012, 12:602 Page 7 of 11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/6020.91 means that the geometric mean HbA 1cat six months in the TLC arm is 0.91 of the value in the usual care arm after adjustment for baseline covariates. There was slight evidence that the difference in HbA 1cat six months between study arms increased with baseline HbA 1c(p= 0.09 for the interaction term in regression model). This suggested that the difference in six-monthHbA 1cbetween TLC and usual care patients was greater in patients with high baseline HbA 1cvalues than in patients with low values. Of participants in the interven-tion arm, 20 % achieved HbA 1clevels of 7.0% or (95% CI 9.6-29.7), compared with 15% (95% CI 4.4-24.7) in the usual care arm ( p= 0.32). In terms of HRQL, the mental component summary score was found to be significantly different between the two arms at six months (difference = 3.0, p= 0.007), after controlling for baseline mental HRQL, plus other covari- ates (Table 3). Mental HRQL improved in the TLC Dia- betes group, compared with those in the usual caregroup where mental HRQL decreased marginally. There was no interaction between study arm allocation and baseline levels for mental HRQL ( p= 0.4). No differences were observed in physical HRQL between the usual care and intervention arms ( p= 0.7). Comparison of sample characteristics between Australian TLC and AusDiab samples To determine the representativeness of the TLC sample at baseline, we used a comparable subsample of indivi- duals from the AusDiab study, obtained from applying the Australian TLC Diabetes criteria for age range andHbA 1clevels ( 7.5%) to the subsample (n = 643) of those classified in AusDiab as having diabetes. 156 AusDiab participants were identified for comparison with the Aus-tralian TLC Diabetes sample. Overall, the AusDiab and TLC samples were similar (Table 2). There were no sig- nificant differences between the TLC sample and theAusDiab subsample across demographic variables, HRQL, and self-reported health variables. Behaviourally, there were no differences in nutrition self-reports be- tween the study populations, however the TLC samplereported markedly lower smoking rates and were more likely to perform the recommended levels of exercise. In terms of their clinical profiles, the TLC sampleappeared healthier, with lower systolic blood pressure, and generally better glucose and lipid profiles. These results, however, are likely to reflect the increased levelsof doctor-diagnosed hypertension and hypercholesterol- aemia, and therefore probably high levels of treatment in the TLC sample. Interestingly, despite their reportedhealthier behavioural profiles, the TLC sample were sig- nificantly more likely to be obese using both BMI and waist circumference classifications. Discussion This randomised controlled trial evaluated the efficacyof an automated, interactive telephone intervention for improving the management of diabetes. As far as we are aware, this is one of the first studies in the world to for-mally evaluate an automated telephone system for dia- betes management that involves tailoring to individual needs and the findings offer promising results for thelonger term use of this kind of program for people with diabetes. We have demonstrated that the Australian TLC Diabetes program significantly improved glycaemiccontrol and mental HRQL after six months for those who participated in the program compared with the routine care condition. Participation in the Australian TLC Diabetes interven- tion led to a significant improvement of HbA 1c, com- pared with the routine care available to people withdiabetes in Brisbane, Australia. The mean reduction in HbA 1cof 0.8 % in the intervention arm is of substantial clinical significance if maintained long-term.

BMC Public Health 2012, 12:602 Page 8 of 11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/602from the UKPDS study highlight the substantial reduc- tions in all diabetes endpoints associated with 1% reduction in HbA 1c[7], such as 21% of deaths 37% micro- comparable levels of HbA 1cimprovement from the pooled effects of 31 previous interventions providing education on self-management of diabetes [9]. The majority of studies cited in the review, however, directlyinvolved healthcare professionals/health workers for the provision of diabetes management education. Another meta-analysis evaluating the use of mobile phone inter-ventions to improve glycaemic control showed a pooled change of 0.5% over six months, however, again with heavy involvement of healthcare personnel for inter-vention delivery [11]. One previous study of another fully-automated telephone intervention aimed at improv- ing glycaemic control failed to show significant post-intervention differences between intervention and control groups in levels of HbA 1c[13]; however, that system did not provide tailored feedback to individuals. Therefore, amajor advantage of the Australian TLC Diabetes program is its successful impact on glycaemic control and the potential for reduced costs and increased accessibilityassociated with an automated telephone-linked system for the provision of tailored diabetes management. In addition to the observed improvements in glycaemic control, mental HRQL was significantly enhanced in people who received the intervention compared with those who did not, despite this not being a specific focusof the TLC program for the trial. The burden of daily management of diabetes and the development of compli- cations lead to compromised HRQL in populations withdiabetes [34,35], and therefore enhancing well-being, in addition to diabetes management per se, is an addition- ally important outcome. Despite this improvementreflecting only a small effect size (0.20) [36], the litera- ture in this field indicates that even small effect sizes of HRQL improvement may be of clinical significance inthe longer term [37-39]. Interestingly, the physical com- ponent of HRQL did not improve during the six-month intervention period. A brief computer-assisted diabetes self-management intervention on quality of life outcomes showed no change in HRQL, however, their two-monthfollow-up might not have been long enough to detect changes [40]. In contrast, the pooled results from 20 publications showed that people with diabetes experienceimproved HRQL after receiving interventions designed to develop their diabetes self-management behaviours [37], although this meta-analysis did not differentiatebetween the mental and physical components of HRQL. Another important aspect of this study is the focus on people with poor glycaemic control (HbA 1c7.5%), indicating difficulty in their self-management of diabeteswith the available routine care. These people are likely to be most at risk of the development of complications associated with diabetes, and therefore, given the resultsachieved, Australian TLC Diabetes has the potential to improve the health of the highest risk groups. Conse- quently, this program also provides the opportunity tosignificantly reduce the financial burden of type 2 dia- betes on the healthcare system. Subsequent analyses will examine the cost-effectiveness of the program, whichwill have important implications for the widespread implementation of the program. Our comparison of the TLC sample with a 'matched ' subgroup from the AusDiab study sample suggests that the TLC participants did not differ significantly in terms of demographic characteristics from the best availabledata from a general population-based diabetes sample in Australia. The baseline AusDiab study, conducted in 1999 -2000, offers benchmark national data on the prevalence of diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and kidney disease in Australia. This indicates the representative- ness and external validity of our results and their applic-ability to other diabetes populations. The trial was completed in accordance with the Medical Research Council 's guidelines for the effective design and evaluation of complex intervention trials [41]. Principal components of any effective complex intervention include feasibility, participant-engagement,identification of mechanisms for intervention outcomes, and trial fidelity [42]. The feasibility and relevance of the Australian TLC Diabetes program are demonstrablewithin the current context of type 2 diabetes. The acces- sibility of the telephone-delivered intervention over the long-term is particularly important for a widespreadchronic condition, such as diabetes, which requires ongoing management and affects a large proportion of the population. The very high usage of the AustralianTLC Diabetes system and results to date indicate that the participants in the intervention arm engaged with the program, with over three quarters of weekly callsbeing completed. Full details of system usage were recorded as part of the data collection and will be reported elsewhere for full process evaluation of the system 's usability and participant satisfaction, as well as whether the cost of the intervention provides acceptablevalue for money. Furthermore, the intervention was able to affect pathways that led to improvements in glycosy- lated haemoglobin and therefore diabetes management,as well as improvement in mental health-related quality of life for the participants. The fidelity of the trial imple- mentation in accordance with the original design andprotocol [27] was strong. Difficulties were encountered during recruitment and this led to increased recruit- ment opportunities via enhanced presence at DiabetesAustralia -Queensland shops and seminars and hospitalWilliams et al. BMC Public Health 2012, 12:602 Page 9 of 11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/602diabetes clinics. The sample size was smaller than origin- ally planned, however, as discussed, the sample obtained is powered to detect group differences that will be bothstatistically and clinically significant at 12-month follow- up. No changes were applied regarding the randomisa- tion process or implementation of the intervention. Although only glomerular filtration rate significantly varied across the study arms at baseline, other baseline characteristics (Table 2) showed some differences. Separ-ate analyses tested the impact of the inclusion of these variables individually on the main results and the main outcome results did not change. As with most research,it is possible that a selection bias operated in this study, with people willing to participate being more likely to prioritise their health and/or have the social, educational,and economic resources to accommodate participation. The study requirement of access to a telephone meant that there may have been a socioeconomic selectionbias; however in the geographic area from which we recruited, over 96% of households have a fixed phone connection, so we are confident that this criterion didnot appreciably influence participation. It is also possible that the reduced sample size and some of the challenges associated with trial recruitment may limit generalisabil-ity. More research is required to investigate generalis- ability and to explore uptake by others with diabetes. Although there was a suggestion of an increasing effectof intervention with increasing baseline HbA 1cvalues (from the interaction test), this did not reach conven- tional levels of statistical significance and should be reas-sessed in future studies. A substantial body of research conducted over the last 30 years has drawn attention to the importance of on-going support and follow-up to sustain improvements in diabetes management and management of other chronic conditions, with strong links to health and self-carebehaviours [43-45]. Therefore a diabetes management support program such as this, designed to provide easy access to long-term (potentially cost-effective) support,is of paramount importance, and hence, this kind of program also requires detailed evaluation in the longer term as well. A subsequent paper will elucidate the changes in behaviour that may have facilitated the improvements observed. Conclusions Our results indicate that the six-month Australian TLCDiabetes program led to improvements in diabetesmanagement, with significant benefits to mental health functioning and improved glycaemic control. If these results were maintained long term, such results wouldbe expected to lead to important reductions in diabetes- related complications and mortality [30]. With the increas- ing accessibility to and feasi bility of such telehealthinterventions, the TLC program has excellent potential to be 'scaled up 'and deliverable to large numbers of indi- viduals with diabetes.

The objective of this study was to deter-mine the incidence of thrombosis, recurrent GIB, anddeath, as well as the time to resumption of anticoagu-lant therapy, during the 90 days following a GIB event. Methods :In this retrospective, cohort study using ad- ministrative and clinical databases, patients experienc-ing GIB during warfarin therapy were categorized ac-cording to whether they resumed warfarin therapy afterGIB and followed up for 90 days. Variables describingthe management and severity of the index GIB were alsocollected. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to es-timate the survival function of thrombosis, recurrent GIB,and death \"resumed warfarin resume warfarin therapy\" groups, with hazards modeling to adjust for potentially con-founding factors.Results :There were 442 patients with warfarin- associated index GIB included in the analyses. Follow-ing the index GIB, 260 patients (58.8%) resumed war-farin therapy. Warfarin therapy resumption after the indexGIB was associated with a lower adjusted risk for throm-bosis (hazard ratio [HR], signifi-cantly increasing the risk for recurrent GIB (HR, 1.32;95% CI, 0.50-3.57). Conclusions :The decision to not resume warfarin therapy in the 90 days following a GIB event is associ-ated with increased risk for thrombosis and death. Formany patients who have experienced warfarin- associated GIB, the benefits of resuming anticoagulanttherapy will outweigh the risks. Arch Intern Med. 2012;172(19):1484-1491. Published online September 17, 2012.doi:10.1001/archinternmed.2012.4261 GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT bleeding (GIB) affects an estimated 4.5% ofwarfarin-treated patientsannually and is associ- ated with a significant risk for death. 1A history of major bleeding is an importantpredictor for future serious bleeding,suggesting that patients with GIB mightbe considered for discontinuation of war-farin therapy. 2,3However, interruption or permanent discontinuation of warfarintherapy increases the risk of thromboem-bolic complications. 4Thus, patients with warfarin-associated GIB present 2 clini-cal dilemmas: should warfarin therapy bestopped and, if so, when should it beresumed? Although some have suggested that an- ticoagulation can be safely restarted rela-tively soon after a major bleeding event,there is neither high-quality evidence norconsensus about the ideal timing or riskof reanticoagulation. Indeed, surpris- ingly little is known about warfarin therapyinterruption and resumption followingGIB. 2,5An observational study of patients newly initiated on anticoagulationtherapy for venous thrombosis who had major bleeding reported an association between resuming anticoagulation and re-bleeding. 6However, patients whose in- dex bleeding event occurred duringlong-term anticoagulation therapy werenot evaluated. Other studies examining theresumption of anticoagulation therapy fol-lowing major bleeding have been limited by small numbers of patients, selectionbias, or both. 2,5,7,8 In this study of warfarin-treated pa- tients who experienced GIB, we sought toSee Invited Commentary at end of article Author Affi l the end of t hAuthor Affiliations are listed at the end of this article.

Weevaluated patient characteristics as well as the durationof warfarin therapy interruption to identify factors asso-ciated with thromboembolism, recurrent GIB, or death. METHODS STUDY DESIGN AND OUTCOMES OF INTEREST We conducted a retrospective, cohort study using administra- tive and clinical databases from Kaiser Permanente Colorado(KPCO). Anticoagulation services at KPCO are provided by acentralized Clinical Pharmacy Anticoagulation Service (CPAS). 9 We used integrated, electronic medical, pharmacy, and labo-ratory record systems along with the CPAS database (Dawn-AC; 4S Systems Ltd) to identify patients, treatments, and out-comes for this study. Approval to conduct this study wasobtained from the KPCO institutional review board. We used administrative coding data (see the eAppendix for a complete listing of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9 ] codes; http://www.archinternmed.com) to iden- tify adult KPCO members who (1) were hospitalized or hadan emergency department (ED) encounter for GIB (index GIB)between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2008; (2) had anoutpatient purchase of warfarin and an international normal-ized ratio (INR) in the 60 days prior to the index GIB; (3) hadcontinuous KPCO membership in the 180 days prior to and90 days after the index GIB (patients who died within 90 daysafter the index GIB were included); and (4) did not have a GIBdiagnosis recorded during the 6 months prior to the index GIB. The primary outcomes of interest were thrombosis (stroke, systemic embolism, and venous thromboembolism), recur-rent GIB, and death from any cause during the 90 days follow-ing index GIB. Gastrointestinal tract bleeding (index and re-current) and thrombotic events were identified first throughelectronic queries of inpatient and ED claims databases usingICD-9 codes (see eAppendix) and then confirmed via manual medical record review by study investigators (D.M.W. andN.P.C.) using a standardized abstraction form. Validation ofstudy outcomes required objective evidence of either clini-cally tract hemorrhage (eg, or ultrasonogram). Dateand cause of death were ascertained from death certificates andmedical record review. All records were independently re-viewed by 2 investigators (D.M.W. and N.P.C.), with disagree-ments resolved by a third reviewer (E.M.H.). The following variables describing the management and se- verity of the index GIB were collected: presentation INR, war-farin therapy interruption, plasma or blood transfusion, phy-tonadione administration, intensive care unit (ICU) admission,length of ED/inpatient stay, and warfarin therapy resumption.We also recorded age, sex, warfarin indication, INR range, timefrom warfarin therapy initiation to index GIB, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use before index GIB,low-molecular-weight heparin use after index GIB, and pro-portion of INR values in range during the 3 months before in-dex GIB. Information about comorbidities was collected usingICD-9 codes. A validated aggregate measure of patient comor- bidity, the Chronic Disease Score (CDS), was calculated for eachpatient using ambulatory prescription medication data re-corded before the index GIB. 10,11For patients with atrial fibril- lation, the CHADS 2score, a clinical prediction rule for esti- mating the risk of stroke, was calculated by assigning 1 pointfor diagnoses of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75years or older, and diabetes mellitus and 2 points for prior strokeor transient ischemic attack. 12 STATISTICAL ANALYSES All patients were assigned to 1 of 2 groups defined by warfarintherapy resumption after the index GIB (ie, \"resumed \"did not resume warfarin therapy was not interrupted, patients were in-cluded in the resumed warfarin therapy group. Categorical datawere reported as percentages, and continuous data were re-ported as means (standard deviations)) and medians (inter-quartile ranges [IQRs]). Comparisons between groups for cat-egorical data were made with the /H9273 2or Fisher exact tests, whereas continuous data were compared using 2-sample ttests or Wil- coxon rank sum tests. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to estimate the survival function of thrombosis, recurrent GIB,and death between the resumed warfarin therapy and did notresume warfarin therapy groups. Patients were censored atthrombosis, recurrent GIB, death, or 90 days after index GIB,whichever came first. A propensity score 13for resumption of warfarin therapy af- ter the index GIB was estimated for each patient using logisticregression (see the eAppendix for factors included in the pro-pensity score). Cox proportional hazards modeling was usedto adjust for potentially confounding factors in the assessmentof the association of warfarin resumption with time to throm-bosis, recurrent GIB, or death (see the eAppendix for factorsincluded in each model). To limit the effect of the severity of the index GIB on death, post hoc adjusted hazards modeling on time to death was per-formed, in which patients who died within 1 week of the in-dex GIB were excluded. In addition, discrete time-varying andcategorical variables were constructed based on length of timepatients were off warfarin therapy after the index GIB to assessif there was a time-dependent effect of warfarin therapy inter-ruption on the outcomes. Length of warfarin therapy interrup-tion was categorized as 0 days, 1 to 7 days, 8 to 14 days, 15 to90 days, and warfarin therapy not resumed. Individual post hocadjusted hazards models for time to recurrent GIB, thrombo-sis, and death were constructed with the time-varying warfa-rin exposure variable. Because warfarin therapy was not inter-rupted in all cases, individual post hoc adjusted hazards modelsfor time to recurrent GIB, thrombosis, and death were con-structed with binary and time-varying warfarin exposure vari-ables after removing patients who did not interrupt warfarintherapy and had an index GIB location of rectum-anus (n=24)and then all patients who did not interrupt warfarin therapy(n=41). Post hoc tests of association were performed with thecategorical exposure variables and study outcomes. Because ad-justed hazard modeling subanalyses using time-varying war-farin exposure and/or removing patient groups who did not havewarfarin therapy interruption revealed similar results for thethrombosis, recurrent GIB, and death outcomes, only resultsof the initial analysis are reported. Further analyses included comparisons of outcomes and pa- tient characteristics between patients who did and did not ex-perience a recurrent GIB and were and were not dead at theend of follow-up, respectively. Statistical analyses were per-formed using Intercooled STATA version 9.0 software (Stata-Corp). The /H9251level was set at .05, and all tests were 2-sided.

Downloaded From: http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/ by a Boston University User on 01/30/2013RESULTS Of 502 patients identified as having GIB using adminis- trative data, the index GIB was not confirmed during medi-cal record review in 57 patients, and 3 patients were notreceiving warfarin. Therefore, 442 patients with warfarin-associated index GIB were included in the analyses( Table 1 ). The mean age was 74.2 years, 50.2% were male, and 46.4% used aspirin at some point during the90 days prior to the index GIB. Indications for warfarintherapy included the following: prevention of atrial fi-brillation-related stroke or embolization (50.5%);treatment or secondary prevention of venous thrombo-sis (24.4%); and prevention of prosthetic heart valve thromboembolic complications (9.5%). The median (IQR)INR on presentation was 3.0 (2.3-4.3). Approximately one-third of patients (30.5%) were initially treated in theICU; 24.2% were evaluated and discharged directly fromthe ED ( Table 2 ). Following the index GIB, 260 pa- tients (58.8%) resumed warfarin therapy, including 41patients whose warfarin therapy was never stopped. Me-dian (IQR) time to resumption of warfarin was 4 days(2-9 days). Prosthetic heart valve indication for warfa-rin therapy (15.4% vs 1.1%; P/H11021.001) and GIB localized to rectum-anus predominately hem-orrhoidal bleeds) (19.6% vs 7.1%; P/H11021.001) were moreTable 1.

Of the 260 patients who resumed warfarin therapy following the index GIB, 1 (0.4%) hada thrombotic event (deep vein thrombosis) compared with 10 of 182 patients (5.5%) who did not resume warfarintherapy ( P/H11021.001).

For patients re- suming warfarin therapy, thrombosis rates were similarregardless of the duration of warfarin therapy interrup-tion.

Downloaded From: http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/ by a Boston University User on 01/30/2013this difference was not statistically significant (10.0% Multivariable analysis that con-trolled for the propensity score, CDS, age, sex, indication for warfarin use, prior heart failure diagnosis, locationof GIB, pre-GIB target INR, pre-GIB percentage of INRsin range, reception of low-molecular-weight heparin,length of ED/inpatient stay, and acute GIB treatment(blood transfusion) also revealed that the risk for recur-rent GIB associated with warfarin therapy resumption wasnot increased significantly (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.50-3.57) (Figure, B). Compared with all other patients, therate of recurrent GIB was significantly increased whenwarfarin therapy was resumed between 1 and 7 days af-ter the index GIB (6.23% vs 12.4%, respectively; P= .03). Although 5 of the index GIB events were eventually fa-tal, no recurrent GIB resulted in death. The median (IQR)time from warfarin therapy resumption to recurrent GIBwas 27 days (11-58 days). There was no association be-tween more aggressive management of the index GIB (eg,ICU admission, use of blood products) and recurrent GIB(allP/H11022.05) ( Table 4 ). 90-DAY OUTCOMES: DEATH period, 52 patients (11.8%) died ( Table 5 ). The most common causes of death were related to malignancy (28.8%), infection (19.2%), and car-diac disease (17.3%). No deaths were attributed to recur-rent GIB. Compared with survivors, patients who died wereolder ( P= .03) and had higher CDS ( P= .004). Patients with an index GIB localized to the mouth-esophagus died lessfrequently, and those with an index GIB with an uniden-tified bleeding source died more frequently. Warfarintherapy resumption after the index GIB was associated witha lower risk for death (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15-0.62) in mul-tivariable analysis that controlled for the propensity score,CDS, age, sex, location of GIB, ICU admission, hyperten-sion, prior stroke diagnosis, pre-GIB percent of INRs inrange, reception of low-molecular-weight heparin, lengthof ED/inpatient stay, and acute GIB treatment (blood trans-fusion) (Figure, C). This strong association persisted in apost hoc analysis excluding all patients who died within 1week of the index GIB (Figure, D). The death rate duringfollow-up was lowest when warfarin therapy was re-sumed between 15 and 90 days after the index GIB (2.3%,P= .04 compared with all other patients). COMMENT Gastrointestinal tract bleeding is a common complica- tion of warfarin therapy. This retrospective cohort studyevaluated 90-day outcomes among warfarin-treated pa-tients with GIB. The results highlight the clinical di-lemma of managing warfarin therapy following a hospi-talization or ED visit for GIB. Although we observed anumerical increase in recurrent GIB associated with notinterrupting or resuming warfarin therapy in the 90 daysafter the index GIB, this increase was not statistically sig-nificant. However, a decision not to resume warfarintherapy was associated with a significantly increased riskfor both thrombosis and death from any cause. Further-more, while no GIB recurrences were fatal, 3 patients withatrial fibrillation had fatal strokes during warfarin therapyWarfarin therapy not resumed Warfarin therapy resumed Analysis Time in Days100 80 0 20 40 60 80 100% Without ThrombosisA 100 80 0 20 40 60 80 100% Without Recurrent GIBB 100 80 0 20 40 60 80 100% AliveC 100 80 0 20 40 60 80 100% AliveD Figure.

While the in- creased risk of thrombosis and death associated with anywarfarin therapy interruption has been reported previ-ously in a Danish registry of patients with atrial fibrilla-tion, 14to our knowledge, ours is the first study to report this observation in a cohort of patients receiving warfa-rin for diverse indications specifically in the context ofrecent GIB. In our study, the exact date and duration ofwarfarin therapy interruption and adverse events wereverified through medical record review, whereas in theDanish study, 14the date of warfarin therapy interrup- tion was estimated from warfarin prescription claims data,the reasons why patients interrupted therapy were un-known, and adverse events were not confirmed by medi-cal record review. The theoretical concern that abrupt warfarin therapy discontinuation following GIB causes a temporary hy-percoagulable state may be relevant to the observed in-crease in thrombosis in patients who did not resume war-farin therapy, 15although no thrombotic events occurred within 7 days of warfarin therapy interruption. It is dif-ficult, if not impossible, to determine the time course be-tween thrombus formation and subsequent clinical mani-festations. However, the laboratory evidence supportingthe actual existence of \"rebound hypercoagulability\" isinconsistent, and clinical trials have failed to demon-strate increased thromboembolic risk associated withabrupt anticoagulant withdrawal. 15 Our observation that a decision not to resume warfa- rin therapy is associated with higher overall mortality wasunexpected and not readily explained, given that only 3of the 37 deaths in the group not resuming warfarintherapy were attributed to thrombosis. We attempted tocontrol for possible confounding of the warfarin therapyresumption indicator by including pertinent factors inmultivariable analysis and by performing propensity scoreanalysis; however, the association persisted. It is pos- sible that patients with a more serious index GIB (whowould presumably be more likely to die) were also lesslikely to resume anticoagulation. However, the associa-tion between resuming warfarin therapy and lower mor-tality persisted with modeling that adjusted for ICU ad-mission as well as blood transfusions\u2014interventions thatwould be expected to be markers of a more serious ini-tial GIB. To further explore explanations for the asso-ciation between a decision not to resume warfarin therapyand death, we reanalyzed the data after excluding pa-tients who died during the first week after the index GIBbecause these patients would have had less opportunityto resume warfarin therapy. Despite this, we found thatthe association remained significant. We acknowledge thatresidual confounding was likely present despite rigor-ous efforts at mitigation through various analytical ap-proaches. Therefore, the apparent increase in nonthrom-botic deaths when warfarin therapy was not resumed maysuggest that the treating physicians were reluctant to re-sume warfarin therapy in sicker patients with a higherrisk of death in general. Our results provide some guidance regarding the op- timal timing of warfarin therapy resumption followingGIB, but clinical judgment remains a critical factor in thisdifficult decision. Resumption of warfarin therapy be-tween days 1 and 7 following a GIB event was associ-ated with a higher risk of recurrent GIB but lower riskof thrombosis. A better understanding of the propensityfor recurrent hemorrhage and its severity across the spec-trum of anatomic lesions would help to inform the de-cision of optimal timing of anticoagulation resumption,an issue of major importance for individuals at highestrisk of thromboembolism. Our study is limited in that we used data from admin- istrative databases, and thus not all factors that affect clini-Table 4.

However, the con- firmation of thrombosis, recurrent GIB, and deathoutcomes via medical chart and death certificate reviewstrengthens the validity of our results. The observed re-sults are biologically plausible because the thromboticevents correlated with the indication for warfarintherapy\u2014patients with atrial fibrillation experiencedstrokes or systemic embolus, while patients with ve-nous thromboembolism had recurrent venous thrombo-embolism (Table 2). Despite potential confounding, ourstudy likely underestimates the strength of the associa-tion between thrombosis and not resuming warfarintherapy because patients at the highest risk of thrombo-sis (eg, presence of mechanical heart valve, high CHADS 2 score) were probably less likely to remain off warfarintherapy following GIB. Similarly, the strength of asso-ciation between recurrent GIB and resuming warfarin therapy may be underestimated because patients per-ceived at high risk for further GIB probably were less likelyto resume warfarin therapy. Accurate recording of base-line aspirin use status was facilitated by the records main-tained by CPAS. However, aspirin use status was not rou-tinely documented in index GIB discharge summaries,and a sizeable proportion of patients did not resume war-farin therapy and were thus not followed by CPAS afterthe index GIB. Therefore, we were not able to accu-rately record aspirin use following the index GIB and ac-knowledge that lack of information on post-GIB aspirinuse and its potential influence on the risk of recurrentGIB, thrombosis, and death is a limitation. Our study shows that the decision to not resume war- farin therapy in the 90 days following GIB is associatedTable 5.

This study evaluated the association between gender and hospitalutilisation within 30 days of discharge. Design: Secondary data analysis using Poisson regression stratied by gender. Participants: 737 English-speaking hospitalised adults from general medical service in urban, academicsafety-net medical centre who participated in theProject Re-Engineered clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov identier: NCT00252057). Main outcome measure: The primary end point was hospital utilisation, dened as total emergency department visits and hospital readmissions within 30 days after index discharge. Results: Female subjects had a rate of 29 events for every 100 people and male subjects had a rate of 47 events for every 100 people (incident rate ratio (IRR)1.62, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.06). Among men, risk factors included hospital utilisation in the 6 months prior to the index hospitalisation (IRR 3.55, 95% CI 2.38to 5.29), being unmarried (IRR 1.72, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.64), having a positive depression screen (IRR 1.53, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.13) and no primary care physician(PCP) visit within 30 days (IRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.08 to2.50). Among women, the only risk factor was hospital utilisation in the 6 months prior to the index hospitalisation (IRR 3.08, 95% CI 1.86 to 5.10). Conclusions: In our data, male subjects had a higher rate of hospital utilisation within 30 days of discharge than female subjects. For men dbut not for womendrisk factors were being retired, unmarried, having depressive symptoms and having no PCP visit within 30 days. Interventions addressing these factors might lower hospital utilisation rates observed among men. INTRODUCTION Hospital utilisation in the 30 days after discharge is costly and may be a marker of poor quality of care. In 2004, the cost forhospital readmissions among Medicarerecipients was estimated to be US $17.4billion. 1Accordingly, the Affordable Care Actincludes multiple provisions designed toimprove care transitions. The act includesboth funding to stimulate hospitals andcommunity-based providers to coordinatepost-discharge services and a programme to withhold payments, of progressively increasing amounts, to hospitals thatdemonstrate higher rates of readmissionwithin 30 days after discharge. 2The extent to To cite: Woz S, Mitchell S, Hesko C, et al.

Men often use hospital emergency departments for usualsource of medical care. -We aimed to study whether men are thereforemore likely to be readmitted to the hospital within30 days of an index discharge. Key messages -Men have higher rates of 30-day readmission tohospital than women in this study group. Men also were less likely to complete a follow-up appointment with their primary care physicianafter discharge. -Interventions that promote connecting men to primary care, address social isolation and screen for depressive symptoms may reduce the risk forearly readmission among men. Strengths and limitations of this study -This analysis was conducted with the ProjectRED data set, which included, and allowed controlling for certain clinical and social confounders in our analysis such as subjects'comorbidity burden, depression symptoms, homelessness, substance abuse and other similar risk factors, in our analysis. -This study is limited in that it was conducted atan urban safety-net hospital and may not be generalisable to other types of hospital systems. -We also relied on subject self-report of any rehospitalisation events outside of the study site, however, were able to conrm 91% of all events using our hospital electronic medical recordsystem.

In fact, we have shownthat hospital readmissions can be moderately reduced. 5 With prospective identication of patients at high risk of being readmitted, providers could potentially directresources to prevent the readmission. In order to full this goal in an efcient and effective manner, providers will need to be able to identify the patients with high riskand may need to understand how to adapt servicesaccording to the risk factors identied. Several factor associated with 30-day rehospitalisation have been well characterised. These include older age, 67 comorbidity,7income level,8history of prior hospital- isation,67increased length 12alcohol (eg, congestive heart failure).67The role of male gender as a risk factor for post-dischargehospital utilisation has been noted in several disease-specic contexts; yet, to our knowledge, no study of post-discharge hospital utilisation has focused on gender.While gender is not typically considered a modiable factor, established patterns of health service utilisation that are associated with gender (ie, lower rates ofpreventive care and fewer visits to primary care amongmen) may put men at higher risk for poor outcomesafter hospital discharge. 13 Therefore, we conducted a secondary analysis of the Re-engineered Discharge (RED) clinical trial data set toassess the association between gender and the rate of post-discharge hospital utilisation among a cohort of adult patients hospitalised in an urban safety-nethospital. In addition, we sought to identify potentialfactors contributing to gender-based differences. METHODS A full description of the methods for the Project RED tri al has been described previously.5Briefly, the Project RED trial was a two-armed randomised controlled trial ofEnglish-speaking adult patients, 18 years or older,admitted to the teaching service of Boston MedicalCenter. Seven hundred and forty-nine subjects wereenrolled and randomised: 376 in the usual care arm and373 in the intervention arm. Patients had to have a tele-phone, be able to comprehend study details and theconsent process in English and have plans to be discharged to a US community. Patients were not enrolled if they were admitted from a skilled nursingfacility or other hospital, transferred to a differenthospital service, admitted for a planned hospitalisation,on hospital precautions, on suicide watch, deaf or blind.A total of 3873 were assessed for eligibility. Due to a lackof available research staff, 1616 patients were notassessed. Of those assessed for eligibility, 1049 did not meet eligibility criteria, 120 were previously enrolled, 527 refused to participate, 474 were unavailable in theirhospital room at the time of enrolment and 954 were notapproached because the maximum enrolled subjectnumber was reached that day. Seven hundred and forty-nine subjects were enrolled and randomised: 376 inthe usual care arm and 373 in the intervention arm.The Institutional Review Board of Boston Universityapproved all study activities. Baseline demographic andclinical characteristics were similar across the study arms. Primary outcome The primary outcome was the rate of post-discharge hospit al utilisation, dened as the total number of emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions persubject, within 30 days of their index discharge. Any EDvisit in which a subject was subsequently admitted to thehospital was only counted as a readmission. Primary independent variable and covariates The primary independent variable, gender (male or fema le), was dened by the hospital electronic medical record (EMR). Potential confounders were identieda priori from the literature on factors associated withpost-discharge hospital utilisation and gender includingage, marital status, health literacy score, 14Charlson score,15insurance type, employment status, income level, homeless status, hospital utilisation within the6 months prior to the index hospitalisation, educationalattainment, length of hospital stay, race/ethnicity,depressive symptoms and Project RED study groupassignment. Data collection Outcome data were collected by Project RED research staff, blinded to group assignment, by review of the hospital's EMRs and by contacting subjects by telephone 30 days post-discharge. Dates of subsequent ED visits and readmissions at Boston Medical Center were obtainedfrom the EMRs, while those at other hospitals werecollected through subject report. Those subjects whocould not be reached within 60 days post-discharge wereassumed alive and hospital EMRs were relied upon forprimary outcomes. Randomisation provided a balancedstudy sample, with an equal proportion of male and female participants assigned to each arm of the original trial. Of 749 subjects who had participated in a rando-mised clinical trial (Project RED), 737 participants wereincluded in this secondary analysis and 12 subjects wereremoved due to death prior to index discharge, 6 requested removal,13previously enrolled1and missing data.1Data for selected covariates were collected by self- report (age, race, income, marital status, education attainment, employment status, insurance type, home- lessness) or using validated tools (health literacy,depressive symptoms) or EMR (length of stay, priorutilisation, Charlson score). Statistical analysis Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjec ts were compared by gender. Bivariate analyses were conducted to identify gender differences and 2 Woz S, Mitchell S, Hesko C, et al.BMJ Open 2012; 2:e000428. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000428Gender and 30-day readmission group.bmj.com on April 19, 2012 - Published by bmjopen.bmj.com Downloaded from potential confounders between gender and post- discharge hospital utilisation within 30 days of indexdischarge. c2Tests were utilised for categorical variables and t tests for continuous variables. A Poisson regressionwas conducted using relevant potential confounders toconstruct the nal best-t model determining thestrength of association between gender and hospitalutilisation. Several interaction terms in our initial Poisson regression were signicant. We therefore decided to evaluate potential interactions betweengender and hospital utilisation using a stratied Poissonregression analysis. Age, length of stay and Charlson score were used as continuous variables. Gender (male or female), maritalstatus (married, not married) and homelessness(homeless within the last 3 months) were treated as dichotomous variables. Categorical variables were created for prior hospital utilisation (no prior visits, oneto two prior visits or three or more prior visits in theprevious 6 months), educational attainment (less thanhigh school graduate, high school graduate or GED orany college), insurance type (Medicare, Medicaid,private insurance or Massachusetts State Subsidised FreeCare), income level (no income, <$10 000/year, $10 000 e20 000, $20 000 or more or declined to answer), level of health literacy (grade 3 and below, grades 4 e6, grades 7 e8 or grade 9 and above) according to the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine andemployment status (employed, not employed, disabled,retired or other). Hospital utilisation is dened as the sum of emergency room visits and hospitalisations (an emergency room visit that leads to a hospitalisation is counted only as a hospitalisation). Hospital utilisation incidence rateswere calculated as the number of hospital utilisationevents within 30 days of discharge per subject. Person-time was measured in months. The unadjusted incidentrate ratio (IRR) was calculated as the ratio of the rate ofhospital utilisation among male patients versus femalepatients using Poisson regression. p Values and CIs were corrected for over dispersion if necessary. Poisson models were used to test for statistically signicant differences in the number of post-discharge hospital utilisation events at 30 days. Two-sided signi-cance tests were used. p Values of <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical signicance. A Kaplan eMeier survival curve was generated for the time to multiplehospital utilisation events for the 30-day period following the index discharge and compared using a log-rank test. All data were analysed with S-Plus 8.0. RESULTSThe analytic cohort included 367 male subjects and 370fem ale subjects. Socio-demographic, healthcare utilisa- tion and health status indicator variables, stratied bygender, are shown in table 1 . Gender differences existed among a number of variables. For example, malesubjects were approximately 4 years younger and weremore likely to be white non-Hispanic or Hispanic andless likely black non-Hispanic than female subjects. Menreported a relatively higher income, with almost 10%more men reporting an annual personal income of$20 000 or more compared with women. Male subjectswere more likely to have private insurance, while femalesubjects were more likely to have Medicaid. Womenreported having a primary care physician (PCP) atbaseline at a signicantly higher rate than men (88% vs 74%, p <0.001). Women also had higher levels of depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, 2.5 vs 1.9), were more likely to report a history of havingbeen diagnosed as having depression (46% vs 26%) andwere more likely to report currently taking medicine fordepression (26% vs 13%). Hospital utilisation Female subjects had a rate of 29 events per 100 people per mo nth and male subjects had a rate of 47 events per 100 people per month (IRR 1.62, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.06) ( table 2). This difference is largely attributable to a higher rate of ED visits among male subjects (IRR 2.04, 95% CI 1.45to 2.86). Furthermore, Kaplan eMeier survival curves for the time to multiple hospital utilisation events in the30 days following index discharge showed that men weremore likely to return to the hospital (p \u00bc0.04) ( gure 1 ). At the 30-day follow-up telephone call, fewer menreported understanding their appointments after leaving the hospital compared with women (78% and 87%, p\u00bc0.005, respectively) ( table 2 ). In addition, at 30 days post-discharge, women reported visiting their PCPs ata higher rate within the 30 days after their hospitaldischarge (57% and 49%, p \u00bc0.04, respectively). Risk factors for hospital reutilisation by gender A Poisson regression that is stratied by gender is shownintable 3 . The model is controlled for age, previous hospital visits, employment, marital status, depression,study group, having a PCP at baseline and attendinga PCP appointment. Among women, the only predictive factor was hospital utilisation in the 6 months prior to the index hospitalisation. Prior hospitalisation was alsoa risk factor for returning to the hospital within 30 daysamong men; however, additional signicant factors were(1) being retired, (2) not married, (3) having a positivedepression screen, (4) reporting no PCP visit within30 days and (5) not being reached for the follow-up callat 30 days. DISCUSSION Among our subjects, we found that men have a higher rate of hospital utilisation within 30 days of hospital discharge than women. ED visits accounted for most ofthis difference. Among both men and women, priorhospital utilisation is predictive of future utilisation;however, risk factors including being retired, unmarriedand having a positive depression screen were identied as risk factors exclusively in men. Additionally, men fared more poorly at understanding and attending theirfollow-up appointments, which also appeared to be an Woz S, Mitchell S, Hesko C, et doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000428 3Gender and 30-day readmission group.bmj.com on April 19, 2012 - Published by bmjopen.bmj.com Downloaded from Table 1 Baseline characteristics of subjects by gender* Characteristics Male (n[367) Female (n [370) p Value Socio-demographics Study arm, intervention 195 (53) 174 (47) 0.10 Age, mean (SD), years 47.9 (14.5) 51.6 (15.5) <0.01 Race, n (%) White non-Hispanic 113 (34) 92 (27) 0.02 Black non-Hispanic 171 (51) 215 (62) Hispanic 44 (13) 30 (9) Other race or mixed race 7 (2) 9 (3) Annual personal income, n (%) No income 54 (15) 45 (12) <0.01 <$10 000 53 (15) 83 (22) $10 000 e$19 999 59 (16) 71 (19) $20 000 or more 102 (28) 72 (19) Declined to answer 97 (27) 99 (27) Health insurance, n (%) Private 66 (18) 53 (14) <0.01 Medicaid 157 (43) 199 (54) Medicare 46 (13) 52 (14) Free care y 93 (26) 64 (17) Highest educational level, n (%) Some high school 97 (26) 91 (25) 0.75 High school graduate or GED 136 (37) 146 (40) Any college 134 (37) 131 (36) REALM health literacy score, mean (SD) 48.1 (21.4) 49.5 (21.1) 0.35 Health literacy level z, n (%) Grade 3 and below 55 (15) 52 (15) 0.31 Grades 4 e6 45 (13) 31 (9) Grades 7 e8 107 (30) 121 (34) Grade 9 and above 149 (42) 154 (43) Current marital status, n (%) Married 112 (31) 116 (31) 0.83 Not married 253 (69) 253 (69) Current employment status, n (%) Employed 149 (41) 116 (31) <0.01 Unemployed 72 (20) 70 (19) Disabled 78 (21) 86 (23) Retired 58 (16) 73 (20) Other (student, homemaker, other) 8 (2) 24 (7) Homeless in last 3 months, n (%) 40 (11) 35 (10) 0.52 Healthcare utilisation Hospital utilisation (hospital utilisations in 6 months prior to index admission) 0 165 (45) 143 (39) 0.23 1e2 125 (34) 143 (39) $3 77 (21) 82 (22) Prior hospital admissions, mean (SD) x 0.66 (1.4) 0.66 (1.1) 0.97 Prior ED visits, mean (SD) x 0.9 (1.8) 1.0 (1.6) 0.40 Length of stay, mean (SD), days 2.7 (3.6) 2.6 (2.5) 0.51 Had PCP at enrolment, n (%) 271 (74) 324 (88) <0.01 Health status indicators Charlson comorbidity score, {mean (SD) 1.1 (1.9) 1.4 (1.9) 0.05 SF-12,** mean (SD) PCS 40.7 (7.0) 40.2 (7.6) 0.30 MCS 46.6 (9.2) 46.3 (9.9) 0.67 PHQ-9 screen, yymean (SD) 1.9 (2.2) 2.5 (2.3) <0.01 PHQ-9 depression screen, yyn (%) Major depressive disorder, n (%) 48 (13) 72 (19) 0.02 Other depressive disorder, n (%) 56 (15) 60 (16) 0.76 Any depressive disorder, n (%) 104 (29) 132 (36) 0.04 Continued 4 Woz S, Mitchell S, Hesko C, et al.BMJ Open 2012; 2:e000428. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000428Gender and 30-day readmission group.bmj.com on April 19, 2012 - Published by bmjopen.bmj.com Downloaded from independent risk factor for returning to the hospital for men in this study. Identifying and addressing risk factors associated with early post-discharge hospital utilisation is useful so thatresources can be efciently tailored to each individualpatient's risk prole. Ideally, methods to ameliorateimportant risk factors are available. Some risk factors, like gender, however, may seem inherently immutable.Yet, as we demonstrated in this study, male gender is associated with other parameters that could potentiallybe effectively targeted. Our ndings raise the possibility that social isolation das illustrated by the positive association with being retired, unmarried and symptoms of depres-siondmay be important factors to target for interven- tion.

These studies have found that, in general, men are moresocially isolated than women and that this contributes to worse health outcomes among men. 1316Men who were socially isolated were found to be less likely to undergo screening for blood pressure, cholesterol and cancer.16 Other studies suggest that men report less help- seeking behaviours, use primary care less10and are less likely to have a primary care physician when comparedwith women. 13Overall, women use more health servicesthan men due to pregnancy and cervical and breastcancer screening programmes. 6However, lower rate of connectedness to primary care among men may alsocontribute to their excess use of hospital services and thending that they may delay accessing care when it isneeded. 17Perhaps paradoxically, one study showed that increased access to primary care actually increasedsubsequent hospital utilisation; however, this study was conducted in the VA with almost exclusively male subjects and may have reflected appropriate use ofhospital services among those who had been previouslyunderserved. 18Evidence suggests other factors that may impact a man's health-seeking behaviour including (1)men may have an overly optimistic perception of theirhealth status, (2) the role women play in care-seekingdecisions of men, (3) the influence of social networks and mood disorders and (4) the relatively lower value men appear to place on preventive care. 13 17 Mood disorders can exacerbate the impact of social isolation on health. Men are far less likely than women toseek help for depression or anxiety. 19Even when they do present for care, depression is often misdiagnosed oroverlooked by providers. 20These differences may be due to the differences in perceptions of distress experienced by men and women but may contribute to the low help- seeking behaviours exhibited by men. Still, given theeffective treatment available for depression and anxietydisorders, depression represents a targetable risk forreducing unwarranted hospital utilisation by men.p=0.04 Female Male 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Time after discharge (in days)0.50.60.70.80.91.0Probability of survival (no hospital utilisation) Figure 1 Kaplane Meier curve: time to multiple hospitalisation events by gender.

Data on hospital utilisation outside Boston Medical Center were deter- mined using patient self-report and not conrmed by EMR review at other hospitals. We were, however, able toconrm 91% of all events by consulting our own EMR.Second, our results may not be generalisable to popu-lations other than those served by urban safety-nethospitals or other populations excluded from the REDtrial (eg, non-English-speaking patients and patientsadmitted from nursing homes). Third, not all patients were reached at 30 days for the follow-up phone call, which is how the information regarding PCP follow-upwas gathered. Finally, having done our project inMassachusetts, our population may have had anuncommonly high level of access to primary care. In summary, our ndings suggest that male gender is an important risk factor for early unplanned hospitalutilisation within 30 days of discharge. This association may be linked to social behavioural patterns commonly associated with male gender, such as delayed help-seeking behaviours, often resulting in sporadic andepisodic use of health services by men. Interventionstargeting factors at the root of this phenomenon dsuch as social isolation, low rates of primary and preventivehealthcare use and treatment of depressive symp-tomsd may help mitigate this gender effect. As health insurance reform and workforce development inprimary care evolve, special efforts may be needed toacculturate men to the use of outpatient services.

Antithrombotic prophylaxis for stroke is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical ben- e t for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios. Methods: We used the methods described in the Methodology for the Development of Antithrom- botic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Preven- tion of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines article of this supplement. Results: For patients with nonrheumatic AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are (1) at low risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age /H11350 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack] score of 0), we suggest no therapy rather than antithrombotic therapy, and for patients choosing antithrombotic therapy, we suggest aspirin rather than oral anticoagulation or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; (2) at inter-mediate risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score of 1), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, and we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and (3) at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score of /H11350 2), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest dabiga-tran 150 mg bid rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. Conclusions: Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF at high risk of stroke (CHADS 2 score of /H11350 2). At lower levels of stroke risk, antithrombotic treatment decisions will require a more individualized approach.

Remarks : Patients who place an exceptionally high value on stroke reduction and a low value on avoiding bleeding and the burden associated with antithrom-botic therapy are likely to choose antithrombotic therapy rather than no antithrombotic therapy. Other factors that may infl uence the choices above are a consideration of patient-speci c bleeding risk and the presence of additional risk factors for stroke, including age 65 to 74 years and female gender, which have been more consistently validated, and vascular disease, which has been less well validated (see section 2.1.12). The presence of multiple non-CHADS 2 risk factors for stroke may favor oral anti- coagulation therapy. 2.1.9.

At 12 months after intracoronary stent place-ment, antithrombotic therapy is suggested as for patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease (see section 3.1). Remarks : Patients who place an exceptionally high value on stroke reduction and a low value on avoid- ing bleeding and the burden associated with antico-agulant therapy are likely to choose triple therapy rather than dual antiplatelet therapy. Other factors that may infl uence this choice are a consideration of bleeding risk and the presence of additional non-CHADS 2 risk factors for stroke (see section 2.1.12). 3.3. For patients with AF at intermediate to high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score of 1 or greater) who experience an acute coronary syndrome and do not undergo intracoronary stent place-ment, we suggest for the rst 12 months, adjusted-dose VKA therapy (INR 2.0-3.0) plus single antiplatelet therapy rather than dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin and clopidogrel) or triple therapy (eg, warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel) (Grade 2C) . After the rst 12 months, antithrombotic therapy is suggested as for patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease (see section 3.1). For patients with AF at low risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score of 0), we suggest dual anti- platelet therapy (eg, aspirin and clopidogrel) rather than adjusted-dose VKA therapy (INR 2.0-3.0) plus single antiplatelet therapy or triple therapy (eg, warfarin, aspirin, and clopid-ogrel) (Grade 2C) . After the rst 12 months, antithrombotic therapy is suggested as for patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease (see section 3.1). Remarks : Patients who place an exceptionally high value on stroke reduction and a low value on avoiding bleeding and the burden associated with anticoagu-lant therapy are likely to choose adjusted-dose VKA therapy plus single antiplatelet therapy rather than dual antiplatelet therapy. Other factors that may infl uence this choice are a consideration of bleeding risk and the presence of additional non-CHADS 2 risk factors for stroke (see section 2.1.12). 3.4. For patients with AF being managed with a rhythm control strategy (pharmacologic or about major bleeding), we recommend combi-nation therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 1B) . 2.1.11. For patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, for recommendations in favor of oral anticoagulation (including 2.1.9, 2.1.10, and excluding 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3), we suggest dabigatran 150 mg twice daily rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist ( VKA) therapy (target INR (Grade 2B) . Remarks : Dabigatran is excreted primarily by the kidney. It has not been studied and is contraindi- cated in patients with severe renal impairment (esti-mated creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less). Clinicians should be aware that there is no antidote for dabigatran. 2.2. For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend adjusted-dose VKA therapy (target INR range, 2.0-3.0) rather than no therapy, aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily), or combi-nation therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (all Grade 1B) . For patients with AF and mitral ste- nosis who are unsuitable for or choose not to take adjusted-dose VKA therapy (for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding), we recommend combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) alone (Grade 1B) . 3.1. For patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease (eg, no acute coronary syndrome within the previous year) and who choose oral anticoagulation, we suggest adjusted-dose VKA therapy alone (target international normal-ized ratio [INR] range, 2.0-3.0) rather than the combination of adjusted-dose VKA therapy and aspirin (Grade 2C) . 3.2. For patients with AF at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score of 2 or greater) during the rst month after placement of a bare-metal stent or the rst 3 to 6 months after place-ment of a drug-eluting stent, we suggest triple therapy (eg, VKA therapy, aspirin, and clopid-ogrel) rather than dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin and clopidogrel) (Grade 2C) . After this initial period of triple therapy, we suggest a VKA (INR 2.0-3.0) plus a single antiplatelet drug rather than VKA alone (Grade 2C) . At 12 months after intracoronary stent placement, antithrom-botic therapy is suggested as for patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease (see sec-tion 3.1). \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e534S Antithrombotic Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation (Grade 2C) , but that initiation of anticoagulation must not delay any emergency intervention (Grade 2C) . After successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we suggest therapeutic antico-agulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (Grade 2C) . Decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1. 4.3. For patients with atrial fl utter undergo- ing elective or urgent pharmacologic or elec- trical cardioversion, we suggest that the same approach to thromboprophylaxis be used as for patients with atrial brillation undergoing cardioversion. Atrial brillation (AF) is cardiac arrhythmia. One in four individ- uals aged 40 years will develop AF during his or her lifetime, and it has been estimated that by the year 2050, up to 16 million Americans will have AF. 1,2 Nonrheumatic AF is a strong, independent predictor of ischemic stroke associated with a vefold increase in risk. 3 Without thromboprophylaxis, the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with nonrheumatic AF, as seen in the control arms of the original trials of antithrombotic therapy in AF, is /H11601 5% per year. 4 Over the past 2 decades, considerable work has been done to evaluate antithrombotic therapies to prevent stroke in patients with AF, and the eld continues to evolve with the emergence of a new generation of oral anticoagulants. This article begins with a discussion of the methods used to develop our recommendations for antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF. Next, we provide our treatment recommendations, divided into the following sections: 1. Antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF in general (includes patients with permanent, per-sistent, or paroxysmal AF [PAF]) 2. Antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF in special situations: Stable coronary artery disease Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) Intracoronary artery stent Acute ischemic stroke Management with a rhythm control strategy Chronic atrial fl utter 3. Antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF undergoing cardioversion catheter ablation), we suggest that antithrom-botic therapy decisions follow the general risk-based recommendations for patients with AF in section 2.1, regardless of the apparent persis-tence of normal sinus rhythm (Grade 2C) . 3.5. For patients with atrial fl utter, we sug- gest that antithrombotic therapy decisions follow the same risk-based recommendations as for AF. 4.1.1. For patients with AF of greater than 48 h or unknown duration undergoing elective electri-cal or pharmacologic cardioversion, we recom-mend full venous throm-boembolism treatment doses, or dabigatran) for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion or a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided approach with abbreviated cardioversion rather no anticoagulation (Grade 1B) . We recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of the baseline risk of stroke (Grade 1B) . Decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with our risk-based rec-ommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1. 4.1.2. For patients with AF of documented duration of 48 h or less undergoing elective cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic), we suggest starting anticoagulation at heparin or unfraction-ated heparin at full venous thromboembolism treatment doses) and proceeding to cardio-version rather than delaying cardioversion for 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a TEE-guided approach (Grade 2C) . After suc- cessful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we rec-ommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks rather than no anticoagulation, regard-less of baseline stroke risk (Grade 2C) . Decisions about long-term anticoagulation after cardio-version should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1. 4.2. For patients with AF and hemodynamic instability undergoing urgent cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic), we suggest that therapeutic-dose parenteral anticoagulation be started before cardioversion, if possible \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e535Sfrequent blood testing and clinic visits. For recommendations about patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease, intra-coronary stent placement, or recent ACS (sections 3.1-3.3), we also considered the effect of different treatment options on the outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). 1.2 Patient Values and Preferences In developing our treatment recommendations, we attempted to account for patient values and preferences regarding these health states. In this guideline, a systematic review of studies assessing values and preferences related to antithrombotic therapy found that values for health states and preferences for treatments vary appreciably among individuals (MacLean et al 9 ). The avail- able literature has several limitations. The studies eliciting prefer-ences were small and used different methods and tools, and most included a sizeable proportion of participants who had previ-ously taken or were currently taking VKAs. Furthermore, there are inconsistencies across studies that often are dif cult to explain, leaving considerable uncertainty about average patient values. Nevertheless, to make our recommendations, we required an esti-mate of average patient values for the relevant outcomes so that we could judge whether the trade-offs between bene t and harm would favor one course of treatment over another. As described by Guyatt et al 10 in this guideline, to obtain our estimates of average patient values, we have used ratings of key health states from participating guideline panelists informed by our systematic review of the relevant literature. The results of the panelist value rating exercise suggest that on average, patients would nd a typical nonfatal stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) approximately three times as aversive as a nonfatal major extra-cranial bleed (typically a GI bleed) and a typical nonfatal MI as aversive as a nonfatal major extracranial bleed. With the exception of the choice between VKA therapy and no therapy, the choice of one antithrombotic treatment over another for long-term stroke prevention in AF will not lead to differences in all-cause mortality (section 2). Thus, for these choices that are not expected to result in a difference in mor-tality, for every 1,000 patients treated for 1 year, if the number of nonfatal strokes prevented is less than one-third of the number of nonfatal major extracranial bleeds caused by a given antithrom-botic therapy, we have recommended against that intervention. If the number of nonfatal strokes prevented is appreciably more than one-third of the number of nonfatal major extracranial bleeding events that result from a given antithrombotic therapy, we have recommended in favor. Making these trade-offs requires not only estimates regarding average patient values for the relevant outcomes but also best esti-mates of (1) the effect of a given treatment on these outcomes against a given comparator (ie, relative risk) and (2) the absolute event rates for these outcomes in untreated patients (or, for PICO questions of a treatment vs an active comparator, the absolute event rates in patients receiving the active comparator). In the following section, we present the methods used to obtain these estimates for our guidelines. 1.3 Estimating the Magnitude of Treatment Effect For each clinical question, we extracted data regarding the previously discussed outcomes from the relevant clinical trials. When there were multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) addressing the same clinical question, we conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models and the Mantel-Haenszel method to obtain pooled estimates of treatment effect, expressed as relative risk. For studies that did not report the proportion of strokes that were fatal and nonfatal, we used all available data in the published report to obtain a best estimate of the effect of The article ends with a discussion of practical issues in the use of adjusted-dose vitamin K antago- nist (VKA) therapy in patients with AF and sugges-tions for future research. Table 1 speci es the clinical question being addressed in this article (in PICO [population, inter-vention, comparator, outcomes] format) and the types of studies used. This article does not give recommen-dations for antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF around the time of surgical or invasive proce-dures (see Douketis et al 5 ), at the time of presen- tation with acute stroke (see Lansberg et al 6 ), or in patients with AF who have prosthetic heart valves (see Whitlock et al 7 ). This article does not give recom- mendations for patients with AF who are pregnant. For general recommendations on antithrombotic ther-apy during pregnancy (ie, not speci c to AF), see Bates et al. 8 Finally, the recommendations in this article apply to patients with persistent and perma- nent AF and to patients with PAF but do not apply to patients with a single, transient, self-limited episode of AF associated with acute illness. 1.0 Methods To inform our guideline development, we searched for relevant articles published since the last literature search performed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Speci cally, for literature regarding the assess-ment of stroke risk in patients with AF, we searched Medline for articles published from January 1, 2005, to October 2009 using the search prevention of stroke and thromboembolism in patients with AF, we searched Medline for articles published from January 1, 2005, to October 2009 using the search Outcomes of Interest The outcomes most relevant to patients with AF include death, nonfatal stroke, systemic embolism, nonfatal major extracranial bleeding, and the burden and lifestyle limitations associated with outpatient antithrombotic therapy. To facilitate decision-making, the term stroke in this article includes ischemic stroke and intra-cranial hemorrhage (intracerebral, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhage). Although there may be some differences in the impact of these intracranial events (eg, subdural hemorrhage) on quality of life, we judged that on average, the impact would be similar. We also explicitly considered that outpatient antithrom-botic therapy was associated with a burden to the patient, which in some cases, such as aspirin, is a requirement to take a daily medication, or in other cases, such as adjusted-dose VKA therapy, is not only a requirement to take a daily medication but also a requirement to limit one's lifestyle, restrict one's diet, and undergo \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e536S Antithrombotic Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation Table 1\u2014 [Introduction] Clinical Questions Addressed in This Article Section Population Intervention Comparator Outcomes of InterestAvailable Methodology 2.

The CHADS 2 score is the most validated risk scheme, having been independently tested in at least 10 separate cohorts after its original derivation. 24,32,35-46 The CHADS 2 score gives a single point for each of congestive heart failure (originally de ned as a recent exacerbation of congestive heart failure), hypertension (de ned as a history of hypertension, rather than a presence of elevated BP), age /H11350 75 years, and diabetes mellitus and two points for prior stroke or TIA ( Table 2 ). 30 Despite its widespread adoption and ease of use, the CHADS 2 score has limitations. First, congestive heart failure is not a consis-tently demonstrated independent predictor of stroke. Second, the risk associated with a history of hypertension may differ among patients with well-treated vs poorly treated hypertension. 46-48 Third, in most studies, the CHADS 2 score has only a modest ability to predict stroke in patients with AF (C statistic, 0.56-0.70). 24,32,35-46 Finally, the threshold of stroke risk at which treatment with oral anticoagulation will be preferred is likely to decrease with the emergence of new oral anticoagulants that do not require reg-ular monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) and that may be associated with greater reductions in stroke and less risk of bleeding compared with adjusted-dose VKA therapy. 49 Thus, stroke risk strati cation schema will need to evolve to more accurately identify patients who are at suf ciently low risk of stroke and can be treated with aspirin or no antithrombotic ther-apy, whereas all other patients with AF can be considered for oral anticoagulation. The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (congestive heart failure [or left ventric- age prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, female sex) score is a new risk scheme that combines the CHADS 2 score with additional moderate risk fac- tors, which were also included in the 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excel-lence AF practice guidelines. 29,50 Speci cally, the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score assigns points as in the original CHADS 2 score ( Table 2 ) with the exception of age /H11350 75 years, which is assigned two points. It also assigns a single point for each of the following additional treatment on nonfatal stroke by assuming a case fatality rate of 50% for hemorrhagic stroke and 25% for ischemic stroke based on population-based stroke registry data and the case fatality rates observed in the RCTs of patients with AF that reported such data. 11 For nonfatal major extracranial bleeding, we accepted the de nition of major bleeding from the individual studies, and when the proportion of major extracranial bleeds that were fatal vs nonfatal was not reported, we applied the average case fatality rate for major extracranial bleeding reported across the relevant clinical trials ( /H11601 15%). For the outcome of systemic embolism, we used the total number of events (fatal and nonfatal) because systemic embolism was an infrequent event and typically not reported as fatal vs nonfatal. 1.4 Deriving Baseline Risk of Stroke in Patients With AF The risk of stroke varies considerably across different groups of patients with AF. 12 Simple validated tools for the assessment of stroke risk in patients with AF help in identifying those who are more likely to bene t than be harmed from antithrombotic therapy. 1.4.1 Pattern of AF: Guidelines have categorized the pat- tern of AF into (1) PAF, in which recurrent episodes terminate spontaneously within 7 days and usually in , 48 h; (2) persistent AF, in which the episode of AF does not self-terminate within 7 days or is terminated by cardioversion; and (3) permanent AF, in which AF is present for some time and cardioversion either has failed or has not been attempted. 13 For patients with PAF, periods of sinus rhythm theoretically should lessen the risk of stroke, yet transitions from AF to sinus rhythm may acutely heighten risk in a manner similar to the increase in risk caused by cardioversion. Although some studies suggest that PAF is associated with a lower risk of stroke than persistent or permanent AF, patients with PAF generally are younger and have a lower prevalence of other stroke risk factors, and clinical trial data suggest that PAF confers a relative risk of stroke similar to persistent or permanent AF when controlling for associated stroke risk factors. 14-17 Pending further evidence, it seems reasonable to treat patients with PAF in a manner similar to those with persistent and permanent AF; thus, our risk-based treatment recommendations apply to patients with PAF and per-sistent and permanent AF. 1.4.2 Independent Risk Factors for Stroke in Patients With AF: Two recent systematic reviews have identi ed clinical and echo- cardiographic factors that are independently associated with an increased risk of stroke in patients with AF. 18,19 The individual studies from these systematic reviews, in addition to articles identi ed in an updated literature search performed for this guideline, are summarized in Tables S1 through S12 (tables that contain an \"S\" before the number denote supplementary tables not contained in the body of the article and available instead in an online data supplement; see the \"Acknowledgments\" for more information). In terms of clinical applicability, the most consistently identi ed risk factors for ischemic stroke among patients with AF are a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)\u2014the strongest dichotomous predictor of stroke risk\u2014older age, hypertension, and diabetes. Although impaired left ventricular systolic function is a risk factor for stroke in AF, there are confl icting data about whether a history of congestive heart failure per se raises the risk of ischemic stroke in AF. Although age thresholds often are used in stroke risk schemes, stroke risk in AF increases contin-uously with age, appreciably rising from age 65 years onward. 20 There is moderate-quality evidence that women face a higher risk of stroke than men. 18 A history of coronary artery disease has not consistently been found to be an independent risk factor for stroke in patients with AF. 18 However, there is low-quality evidence that the presence of atherosclerotic aor- Table 2\u2014 [Section 1.4.3] CHADS 2 Score 30 for Assessment of Stroke Risk in Patients With Nonrheumatic AF Risk Factor Points Recent C ongestive heart failure exacerbation 1 History of H ypertension 1 A ge /H11350 75 y 1 D iabetes mellitus 1 Prior history of S troke or transient ischemic attack 2 CHADS 2 5 congestive heart failure, hypertension, age /H11350 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack.

We obtained this estimate from observational studies of VKA therapy in cohorts that included exclusively or predominantly patients with AF (median rate of 1.3% per year across these studies). 44,53,54 To estimate the baseline risk of non- fatal major extracranial bleeding off VKA therapy, we used this median rate of bleeding on VKA therapy from the observa-tional studies (1.3% per year) and divided by the pooled relative risk (2.58) of nonfatal major extracranial bleeding associated with VKA therapy, as obtained from RCTs of VKA therapy vs no therapy. Therefore, our estimate of the baseline risk of nonfatal major extracranial bleeding off therapy was 0.5% per year. 2.0 Antithrombotic Therapy for Patients With AF in General Over the past 2 decades, numerous RCTs have investigated antithrombotic therapies to reduce the risk of thromboembolism, principally ischemic stroke, in patients with AF. In this section, we summarize the evidence and give treatment recommendations for VKA therapy, antiplatelet monotherapy (eg, aspirin), dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopid-ogrel, and new oral anticoagulants (eg, dabigatran) in patients with AF. 2.1 Patients 2.1.1 VKAs vs No Therapy: Six RCTs that enrolled a total of 2,584 patients and address the primary pre- vention (Atrial Fibrillation Aspirin and Antico agu lation [AFASAK] Prevention in Nonrheumatic Atrial Fibrillation [SPINAF]) and sec- ondary prevention (European Atrial Fibrillation Trial [EAFT]) of stroke in patients with AF provide high-quality evidence that VKA therapy reduces the risk of death by one-fourth and the risk of nonfatal stroke by two-thirds compared with no therapy ( Table 3 ). 55-61 For patients with a CHADS 2 score of 0, the studies provide moderate-quality evidence that VKA therapy increases the risk of nonfatal major extracranial bleeding due to imprecision of the esti-mate (wide CIs). The stud ies provide high-quality evidence for patients with higher CHADS 2 scores. risk factors: female sex, age 65 to 74 years, and vascular disease (de ned as a history of MI, peripheral arterial disease, or complex aortic plaque). The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score has been evaluated in at least ve separate cohorts since its original description. With the exception of a recent study by Olesen et al, 24 all other studies have found that the predictive ability of CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc is similar to that of the CHADS 2 score (C statistics of each risk score is /H11601 0.6 across the various studies) and not statistically signi cantly greater than that of CHADS 2 . 36,40-43 Because the CHADS 2 score has been extensively validated and is easy for clinicians to remember and use, we use the CHADS 2 score as the principal approach for our risk-based treatment recommendations. 1.4.4 Estimating the Baseline Risk of Nonfatal Stroke by CHADS 2 Score: To develop our recommendations, we required estimates of the absolute rate of nonfatal stroke (ischemic or hem- orrhagic) for patients according to their underlying risk of stroke, as characterized by their CHADS 2 score. Ideally, we would obtain these estimates of baseline risk from published annual rates of stroke, by CHADS 2 score, among untreated patients. However, such data are not available. Therefore, to obtain estimates of annual stroke risk, we used pooled data from aspirin-treated patients enrolled in six clinical trials of antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in AF. 37 This published report presented data regarding ischemic stroke rates (fatal and nonfatal combined) on aspirin , strati ed by CHADS 2 score. We used the following calculations to estimate the annual risk of nonfatal stroke (ie, ischemic and hemorrhagic) on aspirin: (1) multiplication of reported rates of ischemic stroke by 1.08 to account for additional hemorrhagic strokes on aspirin therapy (based on the observed ratio of ischemic:hemorrhagic strokes in aspirin arms of RCTs in patients with AF) and (2) an estimation that 50% and 25% of hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes, respec-tively, were fatal. Depending on the clinical question being addressed by a par- ticular recommendation, we adjusted these absolute rates of nonfatal stroke on aspirin to refl ect the clinical scenario being addressed. For the recommendation addressing VKA therapy vs no treatment, for example, to estimate absolute rates of non-fatal stroke on no treatment, we increased our estimates of the rate of nonfatal stroke on aspirin by 21% to account for the esti-mated ef cacy of aspirin in preventing stroke in AF). We there-fore used the following absolute rates of nonfatal stroke in untreated patients to develop our recommendations: 0.8%, 2.2%, 4.5%, and 9.6% per year for patients with CHADS 2 scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 to 6, respectively. We have chosen to base our treatment recommendations on absolute rates of stroke derived from clinical trials, recognizing that these data have important limitations. Less than 10% of patients screened were enrolled in these historical trials, there was limited racial and ethnic diversity, and there is some evi-dence suggesting that stroke rates may now be lower than at the time these RCTs were conducted 2 decades ago possibly because of improved treatment of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension. 51,52 However, despite these limitations, these clinical trial-based data regarding stroke events were systemati-cally and prospectively collected, and they remain the best avail-able source of stroke rates strati ed by CHADS 2 score. 1.5 Deriving Baseline Risk of Death in Patients With AF We used data from an observational health plan database study of 11,526 patients with nonvalvular AF (the Anticoagula-tion and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation [ATRIA] Study) to obtain an estimate of the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with AF not treated with warfarin (53 deaths per 1,000 patient-years).

The majority (78%) of the patients in ATRIA had a CHADS 2 score of /H11350 1. c VKA therapy likely does not lead to any reductions in all-cause mortality compared with no therapy in low-risk patients with a CHADS 2 score of 0 because there is evidence suggesting that absolute reductions in ischemic stroke heavily depend on stroke risk (eg, small reductions at low CHADS 2 score), whereas the absolute increase in intracranial hemorrhage is relatively consistent across CHADS 2 categories (Singer et al 51 ). d Intracranial hemorrhage includes intracerebral, subdural, and subarachnoid bleeds. For studies that did not report the number of strokes that were fatal and nonfatal (CAFA, EAFT), we imputed values for the number of fatal and nonfatal strokes to estimate the pooled relative risk for nonfatal stroke across all eligible studies. Assumptions underlying these estimates are detailed in the section 1.3 of this article. e Of the 108 nonfatal strokes on no therapy, an estimated 106 (98%) were ischemic, and two (2%) were hemorrhagic. f Of the 36 nonfatal strokes on VKA therapy, an estimated 34 (94%) were ischemic, and two (6%) were hemorrhagic. g We estimated the annual rates of nonfatal stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) on no therapy by extrapolating from observed annual rates of ischemic stroke (fatal 1 nonfatal), strati ed by CHADS 2 score, in the aspirin arms of six historical RCTs in patients with AF (Gage et al 37 ). Assumptions underlying these estimates are detailed in the section 1.4.4 of this article. h Estimate of the rate of nonfatal major extracranial bleeding on no therapy is derived from rates in observational cohorts of predominantly patients with AF receiving adjusted-dose VKA therapy (median, 1.3%/y) and dividing by the relative risk of major bleeding on adjusted-dose VKA therapy observed in the RCTs (see section 1.6 of this article). i Quality of evidence is moderate for patients with a CHADS 2 score of 0 because the recommendation would differ if the true increase in nonfatal major extracranial bleeding was one vs 25 bleeds per 1,000 patients in a given year. j The 95% CI does not exclude the possibility of no effect. k Based on rate of systemic embolism on aspirin of 0.3 per 100 patient-y reported in the IPD meta-analysis of warfarin vs aspirin by van Walraven et al 61 and a relative risk of 0.80 for aspirin vs no therapy for systemic embolism. \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e541S2.1.2 implies that adjusted-dose warfarin is far supe- rior to aspirin for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF but is likely to be associated with a greater risk of bleeding complications. Direct evidence regarding this clinical question comes from 11 RCTs (total of 6,526 patients) comparing adjusted-dose VKA therapy to monotherapy (AFASAK 1, AFASAK Atrial Fibrillation Treat-ment of the Aged [BAFTA], EAFT, National Study for Prevention of Embolism in Atrial [NASPEAF], Primary Prevention of Arterial Throm-boembolism 69 and War- farin vs Aspirin for Stroke Prevention [WASPO]) ( Table 5 ). 55,60,70-77 Antiplatelet therapy was typically with aspirin 75 to 325 mg/d, but in the SIFA and NASPEAF studies, it was with indobufen and trifl usal, respectively. 72,74 In SPAF III and one of the two antiplatelet arms of AFASAK II, aspirin was given in combination with xed mini- dose (ineffective) warfarin. 70,76 These trials provide high-quality evidence that adjusted-dose VKA therapy reduces by one-half the risk of nonfatal stroke compared with antiplatelet monotherapy. These trials suggest that VKA therapy increases the risk of nonfatal major extracranial bleeding by about 50% compared with aspirin (pooled risk ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.89-2.29), but the quality of evidence was rated down to moderate because of imprecision. Indirect evidence from RCTs of adjusted-dose VKA therapy vs aspirin in other populations suggest that VKA therapy is likely associated with a true twofold to 2.5-fold increase in major bleeding risk. 78,79 For the outcomes of death and systemic embolism, pooled estimates of treatment effect from trials of VKA therapy in patients with AF were impre-cise, leaving uncertainty about the impact of VKA therapy on these outcomes compared with antiplate-let monotherapy. 2.1.4 VKAs vs Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Clopidogrel: The Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial With Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events (ACTIVE) W trial assessed dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel as a potential alternative to VKA therapy (INR 2.0-3.0). 80 The trial was stopped early because of ndings of superiority of VKA therapy (for their primary out-come of stroke, systemic embolism, MI, or vascular death) and did not nd evidence of a difference in the risk of major bleeding ( Table 6 ). Most patients (77%) were receiving VKA therapy before randomi-zation, raising some concerns about generalizability of these ndings to patients with AF who are being newly started on VKA therapy (ie, by enrolling mostly The studies also provide moderate-quality evidence that VKA therapy reduces the risk of systemic embo-lism (rated down for imprecision). 2.1.2 Antiplatelet Therapy: Several RCTs antiplatelet monotherapy vs no therapy in patients with AF have shown that antiplatelet therapy leads to, at best, a modest reduc-tion in the risk of nonfatal stroke. Antiplatelet mono-therapy in these trials was either with 1; SPAF I; Low-Dose Aspirin, Stroke, Atrial Fibrillation [LASAF]; European Stroke Prevention Study [ESPS]-2; and Japan Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Trial [JAST]), aspirin in combination with xed (ineffective) minidose warfarin (Swedish Fibrillation Trial [SAFT]), or dipyridamole (ESPS-2). 55,58,60,62-66 Aspirin dosing in these trials typically ranged from 50 to 325 mg/d. In the LASAF, JAST, and SAFT trials, aspirin was compared with a no-treatment control arm, whereas in the remaining trials, comparison was to placebo. 63,64,66 ESPS-2 and UK-TIA were stroke prevention trials conducted primarily in non-AF populations, and only the data from the subset of patients with AF are con-sidered here. 62,65 Pooled data from these trials provide moderate- quality evidence (rated down for imprecision) that antiplatelet monotherapy is associated with a 21% relative reduction in risk of nonfatal stroke com-pared with no treatment ( Table 4 ). Although our con- dence in the bene ts of aspirin therapy is moderate, our con dence in its bleeding risk is high. Although the trials of antiplatelet monotherapy in patients with AF were underpowered to precisely estimate the risk of nonfatal major extracranial bleeding, trials of aspirin for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease have conclusively demon-strated that aspirin is associated with an increased risk of major hemorrhage. An individual patient data meta-analysis combining data from six cardiovas-cular primary prevention trials (95,000 subjects) and a meta-analysis of 60 cardiovascular secondary pre-vention trials (94,000 subjects) found that aspirin is associated with a signi cant 50% to 60% relative increase, respectively, in the risk of major extracra-nial bleeding. 67,68 For the outcomes of death and systemic embolism, pooled estimates of treatment effect from trials of antiplatelet monotherapy in patients with AF were imprecise, leaving uncer-tainty about the impact of antiplatelet monotherapy on these outcomes when compared with no 4 ). 2.1.3 VKAs evidence summarized in sections 2.1.1 and \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e542S Antithrombotic Therapy for 2.1.8] Should Antiplatelet (Aspirin) Monotherapy Rather Than No Therapy Be Used in Patients With AF? a,b Quality Assessment Summary of Findings No. of Studies Risk of Bias Inconsistency Indirectness ImprecisionPublication BiasStudy Event Rates (%) Relative Effect (95% CI)Estimation of Absolute Effects 1 y Time Frame Quality of EvidenceWith No TherapyWith AntiplateletWith No TherapyWith Antiplatelet (95% CI) Death (critical outcome) mean follow-up 2.1 y 6 RCTs No serious limitationsNo serious inconsistencyNo serious indirectnessImprecise c Undetected 231/2,152 (10.7) 215/2,246 (9.6) RR 0.89 (0.75-1.05)53 per 1,000 d 6 fewer deaths per 1,000 (from 13 fewer to 3 more)Moderate Nonfatal stroke (critical outcome) mean follow-up 2.1 y; ischemic and intracranial hemorrhage limitationsNo serious inconsistencyNo serious indirectnessImprecise f Undetected 197/2,274 g (8.7) 174/2,498 h (7.0) RR 0.79 (0.65-0.96)CHADS 2 0 points Moderate 8 per 1,000 i 2 fewer strokes per 1,000 (from 0 fewer to 3 fewer) CHADS 2 1 point 22 per 1,000 5 fewer strokes per 1,000 (from 1 fewer to 8 fewer) CHADS 2 2 points 45 per 1,000 9 fewer strokes per 1,000 (from 2 fewer to 16 fewer) CHADS 2 3-6 points 96 per 1,000 20 fewer strokes per 1,000 (from 4 fewer to 34 fewer) Nonfatal major extracranial bleeds (important outcome) j 60 RCTs No serious limitationsNo serious inconsistencyNo serious indirectnessNo serious imprecisionUndetected 333/47,168 (0.7) 535/47,158 (1.1) RR 1.60 (1.40-1.80)5 per 1,000 k 3 more bleeds per 1,000 (from 2 more to 4 more)High \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e543STable 4\u2014Continued Quality Assessment Summary of Findings No. of Studies Risk of Bias Inconsistency Indirectness ImprecisionPublication BiasStudy Event Rates (%) Relative Effect (95% CI)Estimation of Absolute Effects 1 y Time Frame Quality of EvidenceWith No TherapyWith AntiplateletWith No TherapyWith Antiplatelet (95% CI) (important mean follow-up 2.1 y 5 RCTs No serious limitationsNo serious inconsistencyNo serious indirectnessImprecise l Undetected 21/2,061 (1.0) 17/2,052 (0.8) RR 0.80 (0.43-1.52)4 per 1,000 m 1 fewer systemic embolism per 1,000 (from 2 fewer to 2 more)Moderate ESPS 5 European Stroke Prevention Study; JAST 5 Japan Atrial Fibrillation Fibrillation Trial; UK-TIA 5 United Kingdom Transient Ischaemic Attack Aspirin Trial.

For studies that did not report the number of strokes that were fatal and nonfatal (EAFT, ESPS-2, UK-TIA, JAST), we imputed values for the number of fatal and nonfatal strokes to estimate the pooled relative risk for nonfatal stroke across all eligible studies. Assumptions underlying these estimates are detailed in section 1.3 of this article. f Restricting meta-analysis exclusively to RCTs evaluating aspirin alone vs no antithrombotic therapy (ie, excluding SAFT, which used aspirin in combination with xed minidose warfarin, and excluding the dipyridamole monotherapy arm of ESPS-2) results in an estimate of relative risk that includes no effect (relative risk, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-1.01). g Of the 197 nonfatal strokes on no therapy, an estimated 193 (98%) were ischemic, and four (2%) were hemorrhagic. h Of the 174 nonfatal strokes on antiplatelet therapy, an estimated 170 (98%) were ischemic, and four (2%) were hemorrhagic. i We estimated the annual rates of nonfatal stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) on no therapy by extrapolating from observed annual rates of ischemic stroke (fatal 1 nonfatal), strati ed by CHADS 2 score, in the aspirin arms of six historical RCTs in patients with AF (Gage et al 37 ). Assumptions underlying these estimates are detailed in section 1.1.4 of this article. j We used evidence from RCTs of aspirin for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events to obtain a best estimate of the risk of major extracranial bleeding with antiplatelet monotherapy.

Assumptions underlying these estimates are detailed in section 1.3 of this article. i The 95% CI does not exclude appreciable harm or bene t with VKA therapy. j Rate of nonfatal major extracranial bleeding on aspirin 1 clopidogrel is extrapolated from rates observed in observational cohorts of patients receiving VKA therapy (median, 1.3%/y) and estimated relative risks of nonfatal major extracranial bleeding associated with VKA therapy compared with no therapy (RR, 2.56), aspirin compared with no therapy (RR, 1.60), and aspirin 1 clopidogrel compared with aspirin (RR, 1.50). k Estimate is derived from rate of systemic embolism on aspirin (0.3 per 100 patient-y) reported in the IPD meta-analysis by van Walraven et al 61 and estimated relative risk of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.67-1.40) for systemic embolism with combination aspirin 1 clopidogrel therapy vs aspirin observed in ACTIVE A ( Table 7 ). \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e548S Antithrombotic Therapy for Atrial 18,113 patients with AF in which dabigatran 110 mg bid, and dabiga-tran 150 mg bid, were compared with open-label, adjusted-dose warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0). 84 Based on best estimates of the proportion of strokes and major extracranial bleeds that were nonfatal (the published report did not present the number or proportion of fatal and nonfatal events), dabigatran at a dose of 150 mg bid is associated with a statisti-cally signi cant one-third reduction in nonfatal stroke, with no evidence of a difference in the risk of nonfa-tal major extracranial bleeding compared with war-farin. Moreover, the data raised the possibility that dabigatran 150 mg bid may reduce all-cause mortality compared with warfarin (relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79-1.01) ( Table 9 ). In contrast, dabigatran at a dose of 110 mg bid was not associated with a signi cant difference in the risk of death, nonfatal stroke, nonfa- tal major extracranial bleeding, or systemic embolism ( Table 10 ). ROCKET-AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral direct Factor Xa inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antago-nism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) was a double-blind, double-dummy RCT (INR 2.0-3.0) in 14,264 patients with AF at increased risk of stroke (mean CHADS 2 score of 3.5). 85 In the intention-to- treat analysis, rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin for the primary end point of stroke (ischemic or hem-orrhagic) or systemic embolism but was not superior to warfarin (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74-1.03). The trial did not nd evidence of a difference in major bleeding between rivaroxaban and warfarin (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90-1.20). Major GI bleeding was more common with rivaroxaban than with warfarin (3.2% and 2.2%, respectively, P , .001). Mortality was signi cantly different between rivaroxaban and warfarin. The Apixaban Acid to Prevent Strokes (AVERROES) RCT compared apixaban 5 mg bid to aspirin in 5,599 patients with AF who were demonstrated or expected to be unsuitable candi-dates for adjusted-dose VKA therapy. 86 The trial was stopped early for bene t and was consistent with the trials of VKA therapy vs aspirin (section 2.1.3), reporting that apixaban reduces by one-half the occurrence of the primary outcome of stroke and systemic embolism compared with aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32-0.62). The trial failed to demonstrate or exclude a difference in the risk of major extracranial bleeding with apixaban compared with aspirin (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.74-2.05), and the results were consistent with those of earlier trials of VKA therapy vs aspirin (section 2.1.3), which suggest an increase in the risk of major extracranial prior users of VKA therapy, the study sample may be more representative of patients in whom VKA therapy is well tolerated). In prespeci ed subgroup analyses, the investigators did not nd evidence of a difference in the effect of VKA therapy on primary outcome in patients who were and were not receiving VKA therapy at study entry. However, there was a signi - cant difference (interaction P 5 .03) in the effect on major bleeding, depending on whether patients were prior users of VKA therapy. For patients who were not receiving VKA therapy at study entry, VKA therapy was associated with a nonsigni cant trend toward a 69% relative increase in major bleeding compared with dual antiplatelet therapy, whereas in patients already receiving VKA therapy at study entry, VKA therapy was associated with a nonsigni cant trend toward a 24% relative decrease in major bleeding compared with dual antiplatelet therapy. 2.1.5 Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Aspirin and Clopidogrel vs Aspirin Alone: The ACTIVE A study compared combination aspirin and clopid-ogrel therapy with aspirin alone. 81 The trial enrolled 7,554 patients considered unsuitable for VKA therapy (approximately one-half because of a physician's judg-ment that VKA was inappropriate, one-fourth because of a speci c risk of bleeding, and one-fourth because of the patient's preference not to take a VKA as the sole reason) and found that combination therapy is more effective in reducing the risk of nonfatal stroke in patients with AF but also increases the risk of non-fatal major extracranial bleeds compared with treat-ment with aspirin alone ( Table 7 ). 2.1.6 New Oral Anticoagulants vs VKAs: Anti- thrombotic therapy for AF is evolving rapidly because of the development of new oral anticoagulants that directly target different parts of the coagulation path-way, have a more predictable anticoagulant effect, and do not require INR monitoring. Included in this new group of drugs are direct thrombin inhibitors (eg, dabigatran) and direct factor Xa inhibitors (apixa-ban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban). Results of large phase 3 clinical trials of these agents in patients with AF have been recently published or will be reported soon ( Table 8 ). Although ximelagatran is no longer approved for use by regulatory agencies because of concerns about severe liver toxicity, the Stroke Pre-vention Using an Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Patients With AF (SPORTIF) III and V trials were a proof of principle that a direct thrombin inhibitor can achieve similar protection against stroke compared with war-farin (ie, ndings met the investigators' prespeci ed noninferiority criterion) with no evidence of increased bleeding risk. 82,83 The Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anti- coagulation Therapy (RE-LY) trial reported the \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , e549S(Continued) Table Should Aspirin Plus Clopidogrel Rather Than Aspirin Be Used in Patients With AF?

Therefore, we have not extrapolated the data from RE-LY to these clinical situations and have instead restricted those recommendations for oral anticoagulation to adjusted-dose VKA therapy. There is direct evidence from RE-LY regarding the use of dabigatran in patients with AF undergoing cardiover-sion, and these data are summarized in section 4.1.1. 2.1.8 Recommendations for Patients With AF at Low Risk of Stroke (eg, CHADS 2 Score of 0): Patients at suf ciently low risk of ischemic stroke may opt for no treatment rather than antithrombotic therapy with either aspirin or an oral anticoagulant. For instance, for every 1,000 patients at low risk of stroke with a CHADS 2 score of 0, VKA therapy compared with no treatment is anticipated to result in ve fewer nonfatal strokes at the expense of eight more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds and the additional burden of adjusted-dose VKA treatment ( Table 3 ). Although VKA therapy is expected to reduce all-cause mortality in patients with AF in general, it is likely that this mortality bene t does not extend to low-risk patients. The absolute reduction in fatal ischemic stroke with VKA therapy will be far fewer such patients, whereas their absolute increase in fatal intracranial hemor-rhage will be similar to those with higher CHADS 2 scores. 51 For patients with a CHADS 2 score of 0, treatment with aspirin for 1 year may result in the prevention of two nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients (moderate-quality evidence due to imprecision) at the expense of three additional nonfatal major extracranial bleeds per 1,000 patients compared with no treatment ( Table 4 ). If stroke rates are truly declining over time, bleeding with oral anticoagulation compared with aspirin. ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for the Prevention of Stroke in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation) was a double-blind, double-dummy RCT comparing in 18,201 patients with AF (mean CHADS 2 score of 2.1). 87 Apixaban reduced by 21% the risk of the primary outcome of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or systemic embo-lism (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66-0.95) and reduced by 31% the risk of major bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60-0.80) compared with warfa-rin. There was no evidence of a difference in major GI bleeding between apixaban and warfarin (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.70-1.15). All-cause mortality was with with warfarin (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80-0.998). In all three recently completed trials of novel anticoagulants vs warfarin (RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, and ARISTOTLE), the rate of intracranial hemorrhage (including both hemorrhagic stroke and other intracranial bleeds) was lower in patients assigned to the novel anticoag-ulant than in patients assigned to warfarin. 84,85,87,88 2.1.7 General Approach to Recommendations About New Oral Anticoagulants in This Article: Our guideline panel elected to make recommendations only for those drugs that have received regulatory approval for use in AF (ie, dabigatran). 89 Although based on the results of a single trial, there is evidence from RE-LY that dabigatran is no worse than VKA therapy with respect to nonfatal major extracranial bleeding and that it is similar or superior to warfarin with respect to nonfatal stroke, systemic embolism, and all-cause mortality in patients with nonvalvular AF . Therefore, for patients with non- rheumatic AF, wherever we recommend (or suggest) VKA therapy, we also recommend (or suggest) the use of dabigatran, and in these situations, our rec-ommendations simply refer to oral anticoagulation. 88 We address the speci c question of whether to use Table 8\u2014 [Section 2.1.6] Phase 3 RCTs of New Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With AF Trial Intervention Comparator Status SPORTIF III Ximelagatran Warfarin (INR, 2.0-3.0) Published 82, 83 SPORTIF V (150 or 110 mg bid) Warfarin (INR, 2.0-3.0) Published 84 AVERROES Apixaban (5 mg bid) Aspirin (81-324 mg daily) Published 86 ROCKET-AF Rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) Warfarin (INR, 2.0-3.0) ARISTOTLE Apixaban Currently recruiting ARISTOTLE 5 Apixaban for the Prevention of Stroke in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation; AVERROES 5 Apixaban versus Acetylsalicylic TIMI 48 5 Effective Anticoagulation With Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy; Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation; SPORTIF 5 Stroke Prevention Using an Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Patients With AF. \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e552S Antithrombotic Therapy for 9\u2014 [Section 2.1.11] Should Dabigatran 150 mg bid Rather Than VKAs be Used in Patients With AF?

However, because absolute rates of stroke may have fallen over the past 2 decades, we may be overestimating the abso-lute reduction in nonfatal stroke achieved with VKA therapy. Moreover, the true extent of bleeding risk with VKA therapy compared with aspirin therapy is unclear because the pooled estimate of the relative risk of bleeding from the relevant RCTs is imprecise ( Table 5 ). The limited ability of CHADS 2 to accu- rately predict stroke risk (C statistic, 0.6-0.7), the considerable variability in patient values and pref-erences, and the burden and lifestyle limitations associated with adjusted-dose VKA therapy, intro-duce further uncertainty. Compared with combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, VKA therapy is expected to result in six fewer nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients over a 1-year period, anywhere from four fewer to three more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds, and no reduction in all-cause mortality ( Table 6 ). Uncertainty regarding the small net clinical bene t at a CHADS 2 score of 1 arises as a result of the limitations of the CHADS 2 score in estimating stroke risk and the pos- sibility of declining absolute stroke rates over time. Uncertainty regarding the value of the small net bene t arises from the variability in patient values and preferences and the burden and lifestyle limita-tions associated with adjusted-dose VKA therapy. For patients at intermediate risk of stroke with a CHADS 2 score of 1 who are unsuitable for or choose not to take an oral anticoagulant for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding (eg, dif culty maintaining a stable INR, lifestyle limitations of regular INR monitoring, dietary restrictions that are too burdensome, or costs of new anticoagulant drugs that are too high), combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel provides additional bene t of stroke reduction at the cost of additional bleed ing (ACTIVE A trial) ( Table 7 ). Patients opting for com-bination antiplatelet therapy rather than treatment with an oral anticoagulant should be informed that they are choosing an inferior treatment with regard to stroke prevention. Recommendation 2.1.9. For patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at intermediate risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score 5 1), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy (Grade 1B) . We suggest oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 2B) or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 2B) . For patients who are unsuitable for or choose not to take an oral anticoagulant (for reasons other than concerns then the already small bene ts of antithrombotic therapy (number needed to treat for 1 year to prevent one nonfatal stroke of 500 for aspirin and 200 for VKA therapy) will be even smaller. For patients who do choose antithrombotic therapy, the potential choices are aspirin, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, or oral antico-agulation. For every 1,000 patients with a CHADS 2 score of 0, treatment for 1 year with adjusted-dose VKA therapy or with combination aspirin and clopid-ogrel therapy compared with aspirin is anticipated to result in small reductions in nonfatal stroke and an increase in nonfatal major extracranial bleeding such that the net bene ts of either VKA therapy or dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel would be small, particularly given the possibility of declining stroke rates over time ( Tables 5, 7 ). Recommendation 2.1.8. For patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score 5 0), we suggest no therapy rather than antithrombotic therapy (Grade 2B) . For patients who do choose antithrombotic therapy, we suggest aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) rather than oral anticoagulation (Grade 2B) or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 2B) . Remarks : Patients who place an exceptionally high value on stroke reduction and a low value on avoid-ing bleeding and the burden associated with anti-thrombotic therapy are likely to choose antithrombotic therapy rather than no antithrombotic therapy. Other factors that may infl uence the choices above are a consideration of patient-speci c bleeding risk and the presence of additional risk factors for stroke, including age 65 to 74 years and female sex, which have been more consistently validated, and vascu-lar disease, which has been less well validated (see section 2.1.12). The presence of multiple non-CHADS 2 risk factors for stroke may favor oral anti- coagulation therapy. 2.1.9 Recommendations for Patients With AF at Intermediate Risk of Stroke (eg, CHADS 2 Score of 1): For patients at intermediate risk of stroke with a CHADS 2 score of 1, compared with no therapy, 1 year of VKA therapy is expected to result in 15 fewer deaths and 15 fewer nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients at the cost of eight more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds ( Table 3 ). Regarding the choice between VKA therapy and aspirin, VKA therapy is anticipated to prevent nine nonfatal strokes for every 1,000 patients treated for 1 year compared with aspirin but will result in three additional bleeds and \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e557Sstroke (eg, CHADS 2 score /H11350 2), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy (Grade 1A) , aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 1B) , or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 1B) . For patients who are unsuitable for or choose not to take an oral anticoagulant (for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding), we recommend combi-nation therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 1B) . 2.1.11 Recommendation Regarding Dabigatran vs Adjusted-Dose VKA Therapy: The RE-LY trial showed that dabigatran, at the higher dose of 150 mg bid, leads to reductions in nonfatal stroke, probable reductions in all-cause mortality, and no apparent increase in the risk of nonfatal major extracranial bleeding compared with VKA therapy ( Table 9 ), whereas there was no evidence that dabigatran 110 mg bid leads to a signi cant reduction in relevant outcomes compared with VKA therapy ( Table 10 ). In the United States, the Food and Drug Administra-tion approved the use of dabigatran for the preven-tion of thromboembolism in patients with AF at a dose of 150 mg bid but not at a dose of 110 mg bid. However, the Food and Drug Administration did approve, based on pharmacokinetic considerations rather than direct evidence from RCTs in AF popula-tions, a dose of 75 mg bid for patients with severe renal insuf ciency (de ned as a creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min). 89 For the question of whether to use dabigatran vs adjusted-dose VKA therapy, the evidence suggests net clinical bene t at the 150-mg dose. At the time of this writing, however, knowledge regarding the ef cacy and safety of the new oral anticoagulants for patients with AF is still limited to one large ran-domized trial per agent. Uncommon but serious adverse effects may emerge with large-scale use of the drugs. Performance in usual clinical care may deteriorate because of less-restricted patient selec-tion and suboptimal adherence to the unmonitored drug. For patients who do experience bleeding com-plications, clinicians need to be aware that there is no antidote to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. 90 Given these concerns, it would be rea- sonable for VKA-experienced patients who are well controlled (ie, INR within therapeutic range a high proportion of the time) to continue on VKA therapy if they are satis ed with it and are tolerating it well rather than switching to dabigatran. There is evidence from meta-analyses of RCTs 92 that home monitoring of VKA therapy reduces throm-boembolic events by 42% compared with usual monitoring (see also Holbrook et al 91 ), which is about major bleeding), we suggest combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 2B) . Remarks : Patients who place an exceptionally high value on stroke reduction and a low value on avoiding bleeding and the burden associated with anticoag-ulant therapy are likely to choose oral anticoagula-tion rather than antiplatelet therapy. Other factors that may infl uence the choice among antithrombotic therapies are a consideration of bleed ing risk and the presence of additional risk factors for stroke, including age 65 to 74 years and female gender, which have been more consistently validated, and vascular disease, which has been less well validated (see sec-tion 2.1.12). The presence of multiple non-CHADS 2 risk factors for stroke may favor oral anticoagulation therapy. 2.1.10 Recommendations for Patients With AF at High Risk of Stroke (eg, CHADS 2 Score of /H11350 2, Which Includes Prior Ischemic Stroke or TIA): Patients at high risk of ischemic stroke, which includes patients with a history of ischemic stroke or TIA, can antici-pate large bene ts (ie, 15 fewer deaths and 30 fewer nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients during 1 year of VKA therapy) with anticoagulation ( Table 3 ). For every 1,000 patients with a CHADS 2 score of 2 treated for 1 year with VKA therapy rather than aspirin, we anticipate 19 fewer nonfatal strokes at the expense of three more nonfatal major extracra-nial bleeds ( Table 5 ). For every 1,000 such patients treated with VKA rather than combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, we anticipate 11 fewer strokes and anywhere between four fewer to three more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds ( Table 6 ). There is therefore a substantial net clinical bene t with oral anticoagulation. For patients at high risk of ischemic stroke with a CHADS 2 score of /H11350 2 who are unsuitable for or who choose not to take an oral anticoagulant for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding (eg, dif - culty maintaining a stable INR, lifestyle limitations of regular INR monitoring, dietary restrictions that are too burdensome, or costs of new anticoagulant drugs that are too high), aspirin and clopidogrel therapy will result in a substantial reduction in stroke com-pared with aspirin alone (ACTIVE A trial) ( Table 7 ). Patients opting for combination antiplatelet therapy rather than treatment with an oral anticoagulant should be informed that they are choosing an inferior treatment with regard to stroke prevention. Recommendation 2.1.10. For patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at high risk of \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e558S Antithrombotic Therapy for Atrial Fibrillationbleeding risk because there are insuf cient data to estimate reliably the absolute bleeding rates for patients in different categories of bleeding risk on different antithrombotic regimens. However, the following evidence regarding bleeding risk assess-ment may help to guide individualized treatment decisions for patients with AF. One challenge in bleeding risk assessment for patients with AF is that many of the factors associ-ated with an increased risk of major bleeding are also risk factors for ischemic stroke. For instance, older age, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and prior history of ischemic stroke\u2014all of which are compo-nents of the CHADS 2 score\u2014have been found in various studies of patients with AF to be indepen-dent predictors of bleeding while on VKA therapy. 94 Several bleeding risk scores have been evaluated in cohorts of patients with AF (see Table 11 ). 53,95-98 However, these scores have not been extensively validated. Their ability to predict major bleeding is modest, with comparable C statistics across exter-nal validation studies (range, 0.61-0.66). 53,97-99 In sce- narios where we make weak recommendations in favor of oral anticoagulation (eg, patients with a CHADS 2 score of 1), patients at high risk of major bleeding may decline oral anticoagulation. Additional Risk Factors for Stroke in Patients With AF\u2014 In addition to consideration of bleeding risk and patient values and preferences, for patients with a CHADS 2 score of 0 or 1, clinicians may wish to consider additional stroke risk factors when indi-vidualizing decisions about antithrombotic therapy. For instance, there is high-quality evidence that stroke risk increases continuously with age (rather than as a dichotomous function of age , 75 or /H11350 75 years) and moderate-quality evidence that female sex is an independent predictor of stroke risk in patients with AF. 18,20 Thus, patients may be inclined to choose the more aggressive treatment option (eg, antithrom-botic therapy rather than no therapy for patients with a CHADS 2 score of 0 and oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin for patients with a CHADS 2 score of 1) when these additional risk factors for stroke are present. The presence of multiple non-CHADS 2 risk factors for stroke may favor oral anticoagulation therapy. There is less-consistent evidence support-ing an independent association between vascular disease (ie, prior MI, complex aortic plaque seen on TEE, and peripheral arterial disease) and the risk of stroke in patients with AF (section 1.4.2). 21-23 2.1.13 Percutaneous Closure of of the left atrial appendage (LAA) has recently been evaluated as a nondrug alternative for stroke prevention in patients with AF. The PROTECT-AF (WATCHMAN Left similar to the 33% relative reduction in stroke achieved with dabigatran 150 mg bid compared with VKA therapy ( Table 9 ). 84 Therefore, any advan- tages of dabigatran with respect to thromboembo-lism would likely not exist for motivated patients who are able to participate in home monitoring of their VKA therapy. Although home monitoring will reduce the burden of INR testing and VKA dose adjustment, the burdens of VKA therapy related to dietary restrictions and drug interactions will still exist, and there will be a cost for the home monitoring device and test strips. Therefore, depend-ing on how patients value these burdens, some may choose dabigatran rather than home monitoring of VKA therapy. Before prescribing dabigatran, clinicians need to judge whether the patient is similar enough to those enrolled in RE-LY that the clinical trial results are still likely to apply. In particular, the RE-LY study excluded patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance 30 mL/min or less). 84 The cost-effectiveness of the new anticoagulants compared with VKA therapy is another consider-ation. An economic analysis based on pricing of dabigatran in the United Kingdom (US $13 per day) estimated that dabigatran 150 mg bid would cost $45,372 more per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with warfarin for patients with AF aged 65 years with risk factors for stroke (CHADS 2 score of /H11350 1). The cost-effectiveness estimates in this model were sensitive to the pricing of dabigatran. 93 Recommendation 2.1.11. For patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, for recommendations in favor of oral anticoagulation (including 2.1.9, 2.1.10, and excluding 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3), we sug-gest dabigatran 150 mg twice daily rather than adjusted-dose VKA therapy (target INR range, 2.0-3.0) (Grade 2B) . Remarks : Dabigatran is excreted primarily by the kidney. It has not been studied and is contraindi- cated in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of /H11349 30 mL/min). Clinicians should be aware that there is no antidote for dabigatran. 2.1.12 Tailoring These Recommendations to Indi- vidual Patients: As with all weak recommendations, treatment decisions should be individualized based on patient values and preferences, and in this case, an assessment of bleeding risk, and a consid eration of additional risk factors for stroke. Bleeding Risk Assessment \u2014 We have not made separate recommendations depending on patient \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e559Sno formal recommendations regarding LAA clo- sure devices, pending more de nitive research in this eld. 2.2 Patients With AF and Mitral Stenosis Patients with AF in the setting of rheumatic mitral valve disease, particularly mitral stenosis, are at high risk of stroke. Most RCTs of adjusted-dose VKA therapy in AF excluded such patients. We believe that the results of randomized clinical trials in patients with nonrheumatic AF can be generalized to patients with mitral stenosis. Recommendation 2.2. For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend adjusted-dose VKA therapy (target INR range, 2.0-3.0) rather than no therapy, aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily), or combi-nation therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (all Grade 1B) . For patients with AF and mitral stenosis who are unsuitable for or choose not to take adjusted-dose VKA therapy (for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding), we recommend combination therapy with aspirin Atrial Appendage System for Embolic PROTECTion in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) study randomized 707 patients with AF to percutaneous closure of the LAA using the WATCHMAN device (Atritech, Inc) or adjusted-dose warfarin to achieve a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0. 100 Percutaneous LAA closure was associ- ated with a statistically nonsigni cant reduction in the risk of their primary ef cacy outcome of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), cardiovascular or unex-plained death, or systemic embolism compared with warfarin (absolute risk reduction, 1.9% per year; 95% CI, 3.2% per year less to 1.2% per year more, with percu-taneous LAA closure compared with adjusted-dose warfarin). However, there was a signi cantly higher rate of adverse events (excessive bleeding, procedure-related complications) in the percutaneous LAA clo-sure arm (absolute risk increase, 3.0% per year). In particular, serious pericardial effusion (ie, requiring percutaneous or surgical drainage) occurred in 4.8% of patients in the percutaneous LAA device, PLAATO [percutaneous occlusion], has not been tested in a randomized trial but has been evaluated in prospective, multicenter cohort studies in patients ineligible for warfarin. 101,102 At this time, we make Table 11\u2014 [Section 2.1.12] Bleeding Risk Scores Low Moderate High Calculation of Bleeding Risk Score Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index 95,96 0 1-2 /H11350 3 1 point for each of: Age /H11350 65 y GI bleed in past 2 wk Previous strokeComorbidities (recent MI, 1 point for each of: H epatic or renal disease E thanol abuse M alignancy O lder age ( . 75 yr) R educed platelet count or function ypertension (uncontrolled) A nemia G enetic factors ( CYP2C9 polymorphisms) E xcessive fall risk S troke 2 points for:Rebleeding risk (ie, prior bleed) Shireman et al 97 . /H11350 2.19 (0.49 age . 70) 1 (0.32 3 female) 1 (0.58 3 remote bleed) 1 (0.62 3 recent bleed) 1 (0.71 3 alcohol/drug abuse) 1 (0.27 3 diabetes) 1 (0.86 3 anemia) 1 (0.32 3 antiplatelet drug use), with 1 point for presence of each and 0 if absent HAS-BLED 53,99 0 1-2 /H11350 3 H ypertension (ie, uncontrolled BP) A bnormal renal/liver function (1 point each) S troke B predisposition L abile INR . 65 y) D rugs (eg, concomitant antiplatelet/NSAID) or alcohol (1 point each) Maximum 9 points Hct 5 hematocrit; NSAID 5 nonsteroidal antiinfl ammatory drug.

No bene t was seen with combination therapy in studies of patients with AF or coronary artery disease, although estimates of treatment effect were very imprecise. Combination therapy with VKA and aspirin was associated with a greater risk of major bleeding (pooled OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.00-2.02) compared with VKA therapy alone. 107 Recommendation 3.1. For patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease (eg, no acute coronary syndrome within the previous year) and who choose oral anticoagulation, we suggest adjusted-dose VKA therapy alone (target INR range, 2.0-3.0) rather than the combination of adjusted-dose VKA therapy and aspirin (Grade 2C) . 3.2 Patients With AF and Placement of an Intracoronary Stent (With or Without Recent ACS) Patients bene t from dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin and clopidogrel) for a nite duration following placement of an intracoronary stent (4 weeks after placement of a bare-metal stent; 3 to 6 months after placement of a drug-eluting stent [typically 3 months for -olimus stents and for -taxel stents]) (see Vandvik et al ). 108 The principal objec- tive of dual antiplatelet therapy after placement of an intracoronary stent is the prevention of stent thrombosis. Before the adoption of dual antiplatelet therapy in clinical practice, stent thrombosis occurred in 6% to 24% of patients after bare-metal stent place-ment and was associated with a high case fatality rate of nearly 50%. 109-113 Concomitantly, a number of studies compared a new strategy, aspirin plus ticlopi-dine (a thienopyridine precursor to clopidogrel), to the previously most successful strategy of aspirin plus warfarin in patients undergoing stent placement. A Cochrane systematic review of four randomized and clopidogrel rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) alone (Grade 1B) . 3.0 Antithrombotic Therapy for Patients With AF in Special Situations 3.1 Patients With AF and Stable Coronary Artery Disease Approximately one-third of patients with AF also have coronary artery disease. 51 A recurring question is whether patients with AF for whom oral antico-agulation is indicated because of a high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score of /H11350 2) and who have concom- itant stable coronary artery disease should also use aspirin to prevent coronary heart disease events. In this article, we de ne stable coronary artery disease as the presence (or absence) of angina but no revas-cularization procedure (percutaneous coronary inter-vention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery) or hospitalization for ACS (ie, unstable angina, non-ST-segment elevation MI, or ST-segment elevation MI) in the past year. The studies discussed next provide low-quality evidence that combination therapy with adjusted-dose VKA therapy plus aspirin is not associ-ated with reductions in stroke or MI but that it does increase by 1.5 to 2 times the risk of major bleeding compared with adjusted-dose VKA therapy alone. The FFAACS (Fluindione, Fibrillation Auriculaire, Aspirin et Contraste Spontane) trial is the only RCT that directly compared adjusted-dose VKA therapy and aspirin to adjusted-dose VKA therapy alone. In this study, patients in both arms received fl uindi- one (INR 2.0-2.6), and patients in the combination therapy arm also received aspirin 100 mg/d. The trial was stopped early after enrollment of only 157 patients because of excessive hemorrhage in the group receiving fl uindione plus aspirin. 103 No con- clusion can be drawn regarding ef cacy for preven-tion of stroke or MI because there were so few events during a short duration of follow-up. There is direct evidence from a nonrandomized comparison of patients enrolled in the SPORTIF trials that combination therapy (with warfarin [INR 2.0-3.0] plus aspirin) is associated with a nearly two-fold greater risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin alone, with no signi cant reduction in stroke or MI. 104 Patients receiving aspirin were different from those not receiving aspirin (eg, those receiving aspirin more often had diabetes, coronary artery dis-ease, and previous stroke or TIA). Although the analy-ses were adjusted for baseline differences in patient characteristics, there remains a high risk for bias. A similar nonrandomized comparison of patients enrolled in the RE-LY trial reported that rates (likely unadjusted) of major bleeding were roughly 2 times higher for patients receiving aspirin in \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e561Sbene t compared with dual antiplatelet therapy for patients at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score of /H11350 2), whereas the net bene t at lower levels of stroke risk is uncertain. The duration of triple therapy should be kept as brief as possible given the associ-ated increase in bleeding risk. Because the risk of stent thrombosis falls signi cantly after 30 days with bare-metal stents and 3 to 6 months after drug-eluting stents, triple therapy should be continued only dur-ing this high-risk period and only among patients at higher risk of stroke. After the initial period of triple therapy, patients may be given VKA therapy plus a single antiplatelet drug until 12 months have elapsed from the time of stent placement (particu-larly if stent placement was performed in the setting of a recent ACS [see section 3.3] or if a drug-eluting stent was used). It should be noted that patients with AF who have received a drug-eluting stent and who are at increased risk of late stent thrombosis (eg, ACS at presenta-tion, diabetes, long lesions, narrow diameter of tar-get vessel) 123 may choose to continue triple therapy for a full 12 months after stent placement if they place a low value on avoiding bleeding. At 12 months after stent placement, antithrombotic therapy can be given according to our recommendations for AF and stable coronary artery disease (section 3.1). Recommendation 3.2. For patients with AF at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score of 2 or greater) during the rst month after placement of a bare-metal stent or the rst 3 to 6 months after placement of a drug-eluting stent, we suggest triple therapy (eg, VKA therapy, aspirin, and clopidogrel) rather than dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspi-rin and clopidogrel) (Grade 2C) . After this initial period of triple therapy, we suggest a VKA (INR 2.0-3.0) plus a single antiplatelet drug rather than VKA alone (Grade 2C) . At 12 months after intracoronary stent placement, antithrombotic therapy is suggested as for patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease (see section 3.1). For patients with AF at low to intermediate risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score of 0 or 1) during the rst 12 months after placement of an intra- coronary stent (bare metal or drug eluting), we suggest dual antiplatelet therapy rather than triple therapy (Grade 2C) . At 12 months after intracoronary stent placement, antithrombotic therapy is suggested as for patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease (see section 3.1). Remarks : Patients who place an exceptionally high value on stroke reduction and a low value on avoiding trials including 2,436 patients found that a 30- to 42-day course of ticlopidine plus aspirin vs warfa-rin plus aspirin reduced the 30- to 42-day risk of nonfatal MI (relative risk, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30-0.83; number needed to treat, (relative risk, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.16-0.56; number needed to treat, 33) with a possible reduction in major bleed-ing (relative risk, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.14-1.02) (see Table 11 in Vandvik et al , 108 sections 3.1-3.5). 114 Based on these data, we recommend aspirin and clopidogrel over warfarin plus aspirin for a nite period following stent placement. For patients with AF receiving oral anticoagulation who undergo place-ment of an intracoronary stent, the dilemma arises about whether patients should be continued on oral anticoagulation during the time they are recom-mended to be on dual antiplatelet therapy, given the lack of direct evidence from RCTs addressing this question. Treatment decisions in this scenario must balance the effect of each drug combination on (1) the risk of stroke, systemic embolism, and mortality due to AF; (2) the risk of recurrent MI (including stent throm-bosis); and (3) the risk of bleeding related to anti-thrombotic therapy. Because of the very high risk for bias in the available observational studies that com-pare cardiovascular event rates in patients receiving triple therapy vs dual antiplatelet therapy after stent placement, 115-120 we have instead used indirect evi- dence from relevant RCTs to inform our recommen-dations. We assumed that the relative impact of triple therapy on death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal major extracranial bleeds compared with dual antiplatelet therapy would be similar to that seen in 10 RCTs of warfarin plus aspirin compared with aspirin in patients with ACS. 121 For nonfatal stroke and systemic embo- lism, we assumed that the relative impact of triple therapy vs dual therapy would be similar to that seen in the ACTIVE W trial, which compared war-farin vs aspirin plus clopidogrel in patients with AF ( Table 6 ). 80 This assumption may be underestimating the true effect of triple therapy on stroke and systemic embolism compared with dual therapy. We used the same annual baseline event rates (ie, on dual antiplatelet therapy) for death, nonfatal stroke, and systemic embolism as were used in the evidence pro le comparing VKA to aspirin plus clo-pidogrel in the general AF population ( Table 6 ). For the annual risk of nonfatal MI and nonfatal major extracranial bleeding on aspirin plus clopidogrel, we used the rates reported in the clopidogrel arm of the PLATO (Study of Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial, which compared ticagrelor to clopid-ogrel in patients with ACS receiving aspirin. 122 The indirect data summarized in Table 12 suggest that triple therapy may be associated with net clinical \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e562S Antithrombotic Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation Table 12\u2014 [Sections 3.2, 3.3] Should Triple Therapy Rather Than Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Be Used in Patients With AF After Intracoronary Stent Placement?

This was based on data from Go et al, 44 which reported a mortality rate of 5.33 per 100 person-y in untreated (no warfarin) patients from an observational study (ATRIA cohort), an estimated relative risk of 0.89 for mortality with aspirin vs no therapy ( Table 4 ), and an estimated relative risk of 0.98 for mortality with aspirin 1 clopidogrel vs aspirin ( Table 7 ). d We used data from an RCT of warfarin vs aspirin 1 clopidogrel in patients with AF (ACTIVE W) to estimate the relative effect of triple therapy vs dual antiplatelet therapy on nonfatal stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF and acute coronary syndrome. This assumption may be underestimating the potential bene t of triple therapy vs dual antiplatelet therapy in reducing nonfatal stroke. e We estimated the annual rates of nonfatal stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) on aspirin 1 clopidogrel by extrapolating from observed annual rates of ischemic stroke (fatal 1 nonfatal), strati ed by CHADS 2 score, in the aspirin arms of six historical RCTs in patients with AF (Gage et al 37 ). Assumptions underlying these estimates are detailed in section 1.1.4 of this article. f From clopidogrel (plus aspirin) arm of the PLATO trial of ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome. g Based on the absolute rate of non-coronary artery bypass graft-related major bleeding (TIMI de nition) reported in the clopidogrel (plus aspirin) arm of the PLATO trial minus the rate of fatal bleeding reported in this arm of the PLATO trial. h Estimate is derived from rate of systemic embolism on aspirin (0.3 per 100 patient-y) reported in the individual patient data meta-analysis by van Walraven et al 61 and estimated relative risk of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.67-1.40) for systemic embolism with combination aspirin 1 clopidogrel therapy vs aspirin observed in ACTIVE A ( Table 7 ). \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e564S Antithrombotic Therapy for Atrial Fibrillationthese issues are not relevant for patients already receiving warfarin for AF. Finally, there are no studies comparing warfarin plus aspirin to triple therapy (eg, warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel) in patients with AF and recent ACS. Use of triple therapy in this situation would be appropriate only if the risk reduction in MI and stroke achieved by adding the second antiplatelet agent is greater than the increase in bleeding risk. This seems unlikely in patients who are not under-going stent placement and, thus, where there is no concern regarding stent thrombosis. Given the lack of direct evidence and mindful of the principle to rst do no harm, we do not advocate the use of triple therapy in patients with AF who experience ACS but do not receive an intracoronary stent. However, patients placing a high value on MI and stroke reduc-tion and a low value on avoiding bleeding may opt for an initial period of triple therapy (eg, 3-6 months) followed by warfarin plus aspirin. Recommendation 3.3. For patients with AF at intermediate to high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score of 1 or greater) who experience an acute coronary syndrome and do not undergo intracoronary stent placement, we suggest, for the rst 12 months, adjusted-dose VKA therapy (INR 2.0-3.0) plus single anti-platelet therapy rather than dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin and clopidogrel) or triple therapy (eg, warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel) (Grade 2C) . After the rst 12 months, antithrom-botic therapy is suggested as for patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease (see sec-tion 3.1). For patients with AF at low risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score of 0), we suggest dual anti- platelet therapy (eg, aspirin and clopidogrel) rather than adjusted-dose therapy (INR plus single therapy or therapy (eg, warfarin, aspirin, and clopid-ogrel) (Grade 2C) . After the rst 12 months, antithrombotic therapy is suggested as for patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease (see section 3.1). Remarks : Patients who place an exceptionally high value on stroke reduction and a low value on avoid- ing bleeding and the burden associated with antico-agulant therapy are likely to choose adjusted-dose VKA therapy plus single antiplatelet therapy rather than dual antiplatelet therapy. Other factors that may infl uence this choice are a consideration of bleed-ing risk and the presence of additional non-CHADS 2 risk factors for stroke (see section 2.1.12). bleeding and the burden associated with anticoag-ulant therapy are likely to choose triple therapy rather than dual antiplatelet therapy. Other fac-tors that may infl uence this choice are a consider-ation of bleeding risk and the presence of additional non-CHADS 2 risk factors for stroke (see section 2.1.12). 3.3 Patients With AF and ACS Who Do Not Undergo Intracoronary Stent Placement Dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, with aspirin and clopidogrel) rather than aspirin alone is recommended during the rst 12 months after an ACS, regardless of whether patients also receive an intracoronary stent (Vandvik et al 108 ). Many patients with AF (eg, CHADS 2 score of /H11350 1) will choose VKA therapy (eg, warfarin) to prevent future stroke (section 2.1). Therefore, treatment options in patients with AF and recent ACS may include warfarin plus dual antiplatelet therapy (ie, triple therapy), dual antiplatelet therapy, or warfarin plus single antiplatelet therapy. In this section, we speci cally address patients with AF and ACS who do not undergo placement of an intracoro-nary stent. The indirect data summarized in Table 12 sug- gest that triple therapy may not be associated with net clinical bene t compared with dual antiplatelet therapy unless patients are at substantially high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score of /H11350 2), whereas the net bene t at lower levels of stroke risk is uncertain. Rather than triple therapy, a third therapeutic option in this clinical scenario (where stent thrombosis is not a concern) is to use a VKA plus single antiplatelet therapy. Unfortunately, there are no RCTs com-paring warfarin plus single antiplatelet therapy to dual antiplatelet therapy. As described in Author et al (section 2.4) in this guideline, warfarin plus aspirin is associated with a signi cant reduction in risk of sub-sequent MI (relative risk, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.88) and stroke (relative risk, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.39-0.82) compared with aspirin alone in patients post-ACS. 121 The point estimates for these reductions in MI and stroke are greater than those seen with clopidogrel plus aspirin (relative risk, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.89) vs aspirin alone (relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.63-1.18) in the Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) trial. 124 These data sug- gest that warfarin plus aspirin is at least as effec-tive, and potentially more effective, than clopidogrel plus aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular events after ACS. Warfarin plus aspirin was not given a recommendation in Author et al either as an alterna-tive or in preference to dual antiplatelet therapy for patients post-ACS because of pragmatic issues (physician reluctance, burden of use, etc). However, \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 141 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2012 SUPPLEMENT e565Sclinical trials, but because these patients often have concomitant AF or are at increased risk of devel-oping AF, it is reasonable to base decisions regard-ing antithrombotic therapy on the risk strati cation schemes used for AF (section 1.1). Recommendation 3.5. For patients with atrial fl utter, we suggest that antithrombotic therapy decisions follow the same risk-based recommendations as for AF. 4.0 Antithrombotic Therapy for Patients With AF Undergoing Cardioversion To minimize the risk of stroke and systemic embolism associated with cardioversion, therapeutic anticoagulation (eg, with adjusted-dose oral VKAs; INR 2.0-3.0) conventionally is recommended for a minimum of 3 weeks before, during, and for a min-imum of 4 weeks after the procedure. For some patients with AF of documented short duration (eg, /H11349 48 h), a common practice is to cardiovert with- out prolonged precardioversion anticoagulation. For patients with AF duration of . 48 h or unknown duration, a TEE-guided approach is an alternative strategy that can simplify anticoagulation manage-ment before cardioversion. In this section, we sum-marize the evidence and give recommendations for the use of antithrombotic therapy in patients under-going electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion for AF (or atrial Cardioversion of AF 4.1.1 Cardioversion of AF of More Than 48 h or Unknown Duration: Evidence favoring the ef cacy of pericardioversion anticoagulation is based on observational studies in mostly patients undergoing electrical rather than pharmacologic cardioversion. There is moderate-quality evidence from a system-atic review of 18 observational studies suggesting that the risk of stroke or thromboembolism is sub-stantially lower in patients receiving pericardiover-sion anticoagulation than in those who receive no anticoagulation (0.3% vs 2.0%), translating to a rela-tive risk of 0.16 (95% CI, 0.05-0.48) in favor of anti-coagulation. 139 No data regarding major hemorrhagic events were reported in this systematic review. The conventional duration of a minimum of 3 weeks therapeutic anticoagulation before cardioversion and a minimum 4 weeks afterward is based on indirect pathophysiologic data and evidence from observa-tional studies and remains arbitrary. Observational data showing that thromboembolism was signi - cantly more common at an INR of 1.5 to 2.4 before 3.4 Patients With AF Managed by a Rhythm Control Strategy Some patients with AF will be managed with anti- arrhythmic drugs (AADs) to achieve and maintain normal sinus rhythm. Increasingly, patients with AF are also receiving catheter radiofrequency abla-tion procedures (pulmonary vein isolation) to main-tain normal sinus rhythm. In the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial, in which many patients in the rhythm control arm did not receive anticoagulation, patients in a rhythm control strategy had a similar risk of stroke compared with patients in a rate control strategy (see also section 4.1.1). 125 There are several RCTs of catheter ablation vs AAD therapy in patients with AF, typically those who have failed rst-line therapy with AADs. 126-132 All trials found a signi cant reduction in AF recurrence at /H11601 1 year of follow-up. However, AF recurrence in the catheter ablation arms ranged from 11% to 44% at /H11601 1 year. The studies rarely reported on stroke outcomes, and all were underpowered to address this question. Given the results of the AFFIRM trial, the lack of longer-term follow-up data from catheter ablation RCTs regarding AF recurrence rates, and poor reporting of stroke outcomes, it would be pru-dent to base decisions about long-term antithrom-botic therapy on a patient's underlying risk for stroke as recommended in section 2.1, and not on their underlying rhythm. Recommendation 3.4. For patients with AF being managed with a rhythm control strategy (pharmacologic or cath-eter ablation), we suggest that antithrombotic therapy decisions follow the general risk-based recommendations for patients with AF in sec-tion 2.1, regardless of the apparent persistence of normal sinus rhythm (Grade 2C) . 3.5 Patients With Atrial Flutter Many patients with persistent atrial fl utter have periods of atrial fl utter alternating with periods of AF. 133,134 The prevalence of thrombus in the body of the atria and atrial appendage on TEE in patients with atrial fl utter ranges from 1% to 21%. 135-138 There are few data from longitudinal studies assessing the risk of thromboembolism with well-documented sustained atrial fl utter. A study describing a series of 191 consecutive, unselected patients hospitalized for treatment of atrial fl utter reported thromboembo-lism in 7% of patients during a mean follow-up of 26 months. 134 The role of anticoagulant therapy for patients with atrial fl utter has not been evaluated in \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e566S Antithrombotic Therapy for Atrial Fibrillationbolism. If no thrombus is seen, the patient proceeds immediately to cardioversion. A TEE-guided strategy requires an experienced echocardiographer because accurate visualization of thrombus may be operator dependent. The Assessment of Cardioversion Using Transesoph- ageal Echocardiography (ACUTE) RCT compared a of abbreviated therapeutic anti-coagulation with IV unfractionated heparin (started 24 h before cardioversion) or warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0) (started 5 days before cardioversion) to a strategy of therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion. 145 The evidence is of low quality given the wide 95% CIs around the point estimates of effect on patient-important outcomes ( Table 13 ). Thus, the results do not exclude with con dence the possibility of important bene t or harm with a TEE- guided approach compared with a conventional approach of 3 weeks anticoagulation precardioversion. Acknowledging these uncertainties, a TEE-guided approach may be best suited for patients who are very symptomatic while in AF because cardioversion can be done sooner if the TEE is negative for thrombus. It may also suit patients who would prefer to avoid prolonged oral anticoagulation before cardioversion and those at increased risk for bleeding. However, the ability to avoid anticoagulation with a TEE-guided strategy is most relevant for patients without stroke risk factors and at low risk of recurrent AF in whom long-term anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks after car-dioversion would not be required. For patients undergoing a TEE-guided approach, low-molecular-weight heparin at full VTE treatment doses or IV unfractionated heparin (to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time prolongation cardioversion than an INR of /H11350 2.5 (0.93% vs 0%, P 5 .012) suggests the importance of maintaining a therapeutic INR in the pericardioversion period. 140 After cardioversion, results of observational studies suggest that the highest risk of stroke and thrombo-embolism is in the rst 72 h after cardioversion and that the majority of thromboembolic complications will occur within 10 days of cardioversion. 141 How- ever, TEE studies have demonstrated that despite restoration of sinus rhythm on the ECG, atrial mechanical dysfunction may persist for several weeks postcardioversion. 142 A nonrandomized comparison of 1,270 patients enrolled in the RE-LY trial who underwent 1,983 car-dioversions suggests that there may be no excess harm with dabigatran compared with warfarin when used for pericardioversion anticoagulation. Most cardioversions in this study ( /H11601 80%) were performed after the protocol-assigned study anticoagulant was given for a minimum of 3 weeks before the proce-dure, and rates of stroke and systemic embolism at 30 days after cardioversion were low when oral anti-coagulation with either warfarin or dabigatran was given before cardioversion 0.3%, and 0.6% with dabigatran 110 mg bid, dabigatran 150 mg bid, and warfarin, respectively). 143 A TEE-guided approach with abbreviated antico- agulation before cardioversion is an alternative to the conventional approach of using a minimum of 3 weeks therapeutic precardioversion anticoagulation. 144 Under a TEE-guided strategy, patients receive anticoagula-tion and once therapeutic, undergo screen ing TEE. If thrombus is seen in either atrial appendage or atrium at the time of TEE, cardioversion is post-poned, given the presumed high risk of 13\u2014 4.1] Abbreviated Anticoagulation With TEE-Guided Cardioversion Conventional Anticoagulation for at Least 3 Weeks Before Cardioversion Anticipated Absolute Effects (Time Frame Is 8 wk) OutcomesRisk With Conventional AnticoagulationRisk Difference With TEE 1 Abbreviated Anticoagulation a (95% CI)Relative Effect (95% CI)No. of Participants (Studies), Follow-upQuality of The Evidence (GRADE) Death 10 per 1,000 b 14 more deaths per 1,000 (0 more to 52 more)RR 2.44 (0.95-6.24) 1,222 (1 RCT), 8 wk Low c Nonfatal strokes 3 per 1,000 b 5 more strokes per 1,000 (2 fewer to 38 more)RR 2.44 (0.47-12.50) 1,222 (1 RCT), 8 wk Low c Nonfatal major extracranial bleeds d 15 per 1,000 b 7 fewer bleeds per 1,000 (12 fewer to 9 more)RR 0.54 (0.18-1.61) 1,222 (1 RCT), 8 wk Low c ACUTE 5 Assessment of Cardioversion Using Transesophageal Echocardiography; GRADE 5 Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation; TEE 5 transesophageal echocardiography.

For AF of short duration (eg, /H11349 48 h), a common practice is to cardiovert without a TEE or prolonged precardioversion anticoagulation. However, observa-tional studies have found left atrial thrombus on TEE in as many as 14% of patients with acute AF of short duration. 158,159 Moreover, because many indi- viduals develop AF asymptomatically, it is often dif accurately determine a patient's dura- tion of AF, making the 48-h rule dif cult to apply. 160 No RCTs have compared different anticoagulation strategies in patients with AF of documented dura-tion of /H11349 48 h. Observational data suggest that the risk of stroke or thromboembolism in these patients is similar to those who have received conventional anticoagulation for a minimum of 3 weeks before cardioversion. 140,161 Recommendation 4.1.2. For patients with AF of documented duration of 48 h or less undergoing elective cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic), we suggest starting anticoagulation heparin thromboembolism doses) and proceeding to cardiover-sion rather than delaying cardioversion for 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a TEE-guided approach (Grade 2C) . After suc- cessful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we rec-ommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks rather than no anticoagulation, regard-less of baseline stroke risk (Grade 2C) . Decisions about long-term anticoagulation after cardio-version should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term anti-thrombotic therapy in section 2.1. 4.2 Patients Undergoing Urgent Cardioversion for Hemodynamically Unstable AF There are no published data regarding the opti- mal anticoagulation strategy to use before or dur-ing urgent cardioversion for patients with AF and hemodynamic instability. Initiation of anticoag-ulation immediately before (eg, with IV unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin) would be expected to reduce the risk of stroke or thromboembolism based on studies that corresponds to plasma heparin levels of 0.3-0.7 International Units/mL antifactor Xa activity) should be started at the time of TEE and cardioversion per-formed within 24 h of the TEE if no thrombus is seen. A few observational studies and one RCT have suggested that low-molecular-weight heparin has similar ef cacy compared with heparin or warfarin for immediate anticoagulation before TEE. 146-150 Out- patients undergoing a TEE-guided approach may be started on a VKA (INR 2.5; range, 2.0-3.0) and the TEE and subsequent cardioversion scheduled for 5 days later (if the INR is in therapeutic range at that time). The new oral anticoagulants may also be suitable for outpatient treatment before TEE-guided cardioversion given their ease of use (eg, dabigatran achieves steady-state concentrations in 2-3 days after bid administration), 151 but they have not yet been studied for this purpose. There is no direct evidence to guide decisions about the long-term management of anticoagula-tion in patients who appear to be in sinus rhythm 4 weeks after cardioversion. Several observational studies indicate that approximately one-half of patients will have recurrence of AF at 1 year after cardioversion. 152-156 The AFFIRM study, in which many patients stopped anticoagulation after initial (apparently) successful restoration of sinus rhythm, found similar rates of thromboembolism with a rhythm control strategy compared with a rate con-trol strategy. 125 Finally, patients with PAF often are asymptomatic during episodes of AF recurrence, with one series suggesting that only one in every 12 paroxysms are symptomatic. 157 These observations suggest that decisions about long-term antithrom-botic therapy should be primarily based on a patient's risk for stroke (see section 2.1) rather than on the prevailing rhythm at 4 weeks postcardioversion. Recommendation 4.1.1. For patients with AF of greater than 48 h or unknown duration undergoing elective electri-cal or pharmacologic cardioversion, we recom-mend full venous throm-boembolism treatment doses, or dabigatran) for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion or a TEE-guided approach with abbreviated anticoagu-lation before cardioversion, rather than no anticoagulation (Grade 1B) . We recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of the baseline risk of stroke (Grade 1B) . Decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with our risk-based \u00a9 2012 American College of Chest Physicians at Boston University on March 6, 2012 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from e568S Antithrombotic Therapy for Atrial Fibrillationies assessed oral anticoagulation at very-low INR targets or xed low doses compared with adjusted-dose anticoagulation targeted at an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 and found that anticoagulation targeted at an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 was more effective in reducing the risk of stroke. 164 Observational studies have shown that the risk of ischemic stroke is much greater once INR levels are , 2.0 and that there are no appre- ciable gains in ef cacy with levels . 2.0. However, there is a sharp increase in the risk of bleeding com-plications, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, as INR levels rise to . 3.0 to 4.0. 165-169 A target INR value of 2.0 will result in patients spending a substan-tial proportion of time at subtherapeutic INR levels (ie, , 2.0). 170 Given that bleeding risk does not rise substantially until INR levels are . 3.0, and particu- larly . 4.0, data from AF populations support an optimal target INR range of 2.0 to 3.0, with a tar- get value of 2.5 to maximize the time spent in the optimal INR range. 165-170 5.2 Time in Therapeutic Range For a full discussion of the importance of time in therapeutic range while on adjusted-dose VKA therapy, see Ageno et al 171 regarding oral antico- agulation in this guideline. With respect to patients with AF, there are several observational studies indi-cating that increasing time out of range is associated with poorer outcomes (eg, mortality, ischemic stroke, thromboembolism, major bleeding). 172-175 6.0 Future Research Approximately one in every three patients with AF also has coronary artery disease. 51 However, the opti- mal approach to antithrombotic therapy in these patients is unclear. Research is needed to determine the effect of treatment with oral anticoagulation and aspirin compared with oral anticoagulation alone on patient-important outcomes of vascular death, nonfa-tal stroke, MI, nonfatal major extracranial bleeding, and nonfatal systemic embolism. Research is also needed to inform recommendations about dif-ferent antithrombotic therapy regimens for patients with AF undergoing placement of an intracoronary artery stent or who experience an ACS (eg, triple therapy with oral anticoagulation, clopidogrel, and aspirin; dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin; or combination oral anticoagulation and aspirin or clopidogrel). Finally, all existing stroke risk strati cation and bleeding risk strati cation schema for patients with AF have modest predictive value, and development of more-accurate risk strati cation systems is needed to facilitate a more-accurate esti-mation of net clinical bene t for individual patients. of elective cardioversion. It is important to note that the initiation of anticoagulation therapy should not delay any emergency interventions to stabilize the patient. Recommendation 4.2. For patients with AF and hemodynamic instability undergoing urgent cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic), we suggest that therapeutic-dose parenteral anticoagulation be started before cardioversion, if possible (Grade 2C) , but that initiation of anticoagulation must not delay any emergency intervention (Grade 2C) . After successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we suggest therapeutic anticoag-ulation for at least 4 weeks after successful car-dioversion to sinus rhythm rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (Grade 2C) . Decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1. 4.3 Patients Undergoing Elective or Urgent Cardioversion for Atrial Flutter There are no published data regarding the optimal anticoagulation strategy to use for patients under-going cardioversion for atrial fl utter. Although some observational studies suggest that the risk of throm-boembolism after cardioversion for atrial fl utter is low, even without anticoagulation, other studies have documented a similar risk of thromboembolism in patients after cardioversion for atrial fl utter and 140,162,163 This may be because AF and atrial fl utter often coexist. Recommendation 4.3. For patients with atrial fl utter undergo- ing elective or urgent pharmacologic or electri- cal cardioversion, we suggest that the same approach to thromboprophylaxis be used as for patients with atrial brillation undergoing cardioversion. 5.0 Practical Issues in the Management of VKA Therapy 5.1 Optimal Target INR Range For a full discussion of optimal target INR range with VKA therapy across a variety of indications, see Holbrook et al 91 regarding evidence-based man- agement of anticoagulation in this guideline.

Antithrombotic prophylaxis for stroke is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treat-ment based on net clinical bene t for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk. Oral anticoag-ulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS 2 score /H11350 2). At lower levels of stroke risk, antithrombotic treatment decisions will require a more individualized approach that takes into con-sideration patient values and preferences, bleeding risk, and the presence of non-CHADS 2 stroke risk factors. The role of oral anticoagulation for the pre-vention of stroke in patients with AF will evolve as the results of large, ongoing, phase 3 RCTs of new oral anticoagulants are published and as experience with these new agents in clinical practice continues to grow.

Yi, BA John S. Kim, BA, MA Khalil I. Hussein, BA Richard Saitz, MD, MPH ABSTRACT. This study describes khat behavior, knowledge, and attitudes among Yemeni medical students (MS) and the effects of a seminar. The students completed a survey ( n=62); a subgroup partici- pated in a discussion-based seminar and follow-up survey ( n=18). Although the students demonstrated knowledge about khat's health effects and considered it unacceptable for health professionals to chewkhat, they disagreed that health professionals should advise patients to quit. Knowledge and attitudesimproved post-seminar (not signicant, except for a borderline signicant increase in students correctlyidentifying khat as addictive; P=0.063). Although effects were small, seminars may help health professionals address khat use in Yemen. KEYWORDS. Attitudes, khat, knowledge, medical students, seminar INTRODUCTION Khat (also spelled \"qat\") use is prevalent in Yemen and in many other parts of the Middle East and eastern Africa, especially Somalia and Ethiopia, and it has signicant health and socioe-conomic consequences (1).

Khat's role in causing Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:24 05 February 2013 374 SUBSTANCE ABUSE cardiovascular, oral, hepatic, neurobehavioral, and psychiatric illness is well documented (4). Estimates of daily khat chewing rates in Yemen are as high as 90% for men and 73% for women(1) and, in a country predicted to be the rst inthe world to run out of water, 40% of Yemen's water supply is directed towards khat irrigation (2). To our knowledge, there has been no study of knowledge and attitudes towards khat focusing on health professionals who could intervene inYemen or elsewhere. The recent surge in syn- thetic cathinone use in Europe and the United States (3) may make khat and cathinone a sig-nicant health issue in the western world in theyears ahead. The purpose of this descriptive report is twofold: (1) To describe the behavior, knowl-edge, and attitudes of medical students at a medical school in Yemen towards khat chewing and (2) to describe these measures in these stu-dents before and after a khat seminar conducted through English conversation. METHODS Population/Sample We conducted a written survey of Yemeni medical students at Taiz University (TU) Facultyof Medicine in July 2010. A subgroup partici-pated in one 3-hour seminar on Khat as part of a public health course, open to all TU medical stu- dents, entitled \"Health Education Through En-glish Conversation Course\" (HETECC), and was surveyed a second time at the end of the course. The HETECC course and our survey were ad-vertised by fliers placed around the TU campus and by word of mouth. The course required an English prociency test. Survey Administration We administered the 10-minute survey before and 10 to 11 days after the khat seminar and during the HETECC course. At the beginning of each administration, we described our studyto the students in English and informed themthat the study would be anonymous, voluntary,and have no impact on their academic standing. Additionally, each survey came attached with a cover letter written in Arabic stating the pur- pose and the voluntary, anonymous nature of thestudy. The investigators were not present whenthe survey was completed and the participants had the option to not participate and to omit an- swering any survey questions. Participants werenot compensated for survey completion. Seminar The stated goal of the khat seminar was \"to clarify the medical, social, economic, and en- vironmental effects of qat on Yemeni society.\"There were 3 seminar groups based on English prociency level, each facilitated by native En- glish speakers in groups of two. The seminarconsisted of 6 activities conducted in English: (1) open discussion on an article, titled \"A Medical View of Qat,\" from the Yemen Times newspaper; (2) ll-in-the-blank exercise for an article miss-ing words, titled \"Qat's Enormous Cost,\" also from Yemen Times ; (3) oral reports and discus- sion of the results of families' weekly khat consump- tion and expenses, motivation for chewing khat, and willingness to give up khat; (4) discussionof the effects of khat on physical health, the en- vironment, Yemen's economy, and Yemeni soci- ety; (5) role-play about 2 common scenarios inYemeni society involving khat; and (6) discus-sion of the agricultural economics of khat. Survey Content and Design We developed a survey based on the World Health Organization Global Health ProfessionalSurvey (GHPS), a standardized questionnaire as-sessing behavior, knowledge, and attitudes of health care professional students towards to- bacco; we modied the version of the GHPSused by Hodgetts et al. to be specic to khat (5). Our survey consisted of 35 questions covering 4 domains: (1) demographics; (2) khat and othersubstance use; (3) knowledge about khat; and (4) attitudes towards the role and use of khat in Yemeni society. We developed the survey andaccompanying cover letter rst in English; anArabic speaker fluent in English subsequently Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:24 05 February 2013 Brief Reports 375 translated them into Arabic. Two Arabic speak- ers fluent in English then reviewed the translated survey and assured that the translation was ac- curate. The Boston University Medical CampusInstitutional Review Board and the HETECCcourse director at TU approved all research ac- tivities. Our survey is available upon request. Analyses Analyses were descriptive and we used Mann- Whitney, Fisher exact, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and McNemar tests as appropriate. RESULTS A total of 62 students completed the survey; the mean age was 22 years, 74% were female,97% were unmarried, 39% reported ever chew- ing khat (73% of males and 26% of females), 34% had drunk 8 or more cups of coffee in theprevious 30 days, 3% reported ever smoking 100 or more cigarettes, and 3% reported knowing medical students who consume alcohol. Correctresponse rate to knowledge questions were 90% for khat containing cathinone, 79% for leading to psychosis, 60% for khatchewing (KC) being a risk factor for heart attack,and 90% for up to 90% of Yemeni men chewing khat 3 to 4 hours daily. Regarding attitudes, 87% agreed or strongly agreed that KC is harmful tohealth, 30% that khat is not addictive, 93% that most people in Yemen chew khat, 6% that khat is not a problem in Yemen, 97% that childrenand adolescents should not chew khat, 12% that khat chewers are immoral people, 51% that KC is not an immoral activity, 58% that KC makespeople more popular with their friends, 27% thatKC makes talking to people easier, 47% that KC does not help people to relax, 77% that KC helps people to stay awake, 87% that health profes-sionals (HPs) serve as role models for patients and the public, 8% that it is acceptable for HPs to chew khat, 10% that HPs should routinely askpatients about their KC habits, 94% that HPs should not routinely advise patients to quit KC, 92% that HPs should get specic education onkhat, and 50% that they had received educationabout khat in medical school prior to the survey.Among khat chewers, 55% consumed 1 or more wraps per day, 29% had chewed khat on 20 or more days in the 30 days prior to the sur- vey, 81% had chewed khat within the previous7 months, 65% were ready to quit KC, and 20%were thinking about quitting KC. Coffee con- sumption did not differ between chewers and nonchewers, but chewers were more likely tohave used greater than 100 cigarettes in a life- time and more likely to know a medical student who had used alcohol in the previous 30 days(9.1% of chewers vs. 0% of nonchewers for both items), both borderline signicant at P=0.064 andP=0.061, respectively. For all knowledge and attitude survey items, results were not signif-icantly different between chewers and nonchew- ers, except for borderline signicance at P= 0.069 towards acceptability of HPs to chew khat(17% of chewers vs. 3% of nonchewers agreed or strongly agreed that it is acceptable). Of 23 students who participated in the discussion-based khat seminar, 18 completed an identical follow-up survey 10 to 11 days after the seminar. Although in general, knowledge andattitudes improved after the seminar, improve-ments were not statistically signicant except for a borderline improvement in the number of students correctly identifying khat as addictive(33.3% of students pre-seminar vs. 61.1% post- seminar; P=0.063). DISCUSSION Less than 50% of Yemeni medical students ever chewed khat, but the majority of males re- ported ever chewing khat. Of the chewers, two thirds expressed readiness to quit chewing khat.Overall, the students demonstrated good knowl-edge about khat chewing. Most students also agreed that khat chewing is harmful to health and a problem in Yemen, and that it is not acceptablefor health professionals to chew khat. However, paradoxically, they did not agree that health pro- fessionals should inquire about or advise theirpatients to quit their khat chewing habits. Not surprisingly, more khat chewers than nonchew- ers agreed that it is acceptable for health pro-fessionals to chew khat. A seminar had modesteffects on knowledge and attitudes towards khat. Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:24 05 February 2013 376 SUBSTANCE ABUSE The majority of adults and medical students in Yemen chew khat (1, 6), with higher use in males than females (2). Although we found that a minority of students chews khat, whenstratied by gender, our results are more consis-tent with prior estimates. Yemeni citizens have knowledge regarding the physiological proper- ties of khat (2) and Yemeni citizens and Yemeniexpatriates in the United Kingdom report atti- tudes that khat is harmful to health and causes socioeconomic problems (2, 7), which is consis-tent with our results. The majority of medical students in over 48 countries agree that health professionals serve as role models and that theyshould advise patients to quit smoking cigarettes(8), which is consistent with our results regard- ing the students' views of health professionals as role models, but inconsistent with their attitudestowards advising patients to quit chewing khat. A 3-hour lecture-and-discussion-based seminar on tobacco performed at a medical school inHong Kong was shown to be effective in im- proving medical students' knowledge of and at- titudes towards tobacco control (9), which is notinconsistent with our ndings regarding the khatseminar, although we found no statistically sig- nicant improvements. The importance of khat in Yemeni culture and society (1, 2) may help explain why the medical students in our sample were reluctant to agree that health professionals should inquire aboutor advise their patients to quit khat chewing, even though they agreed that it is not accept- able for health professionals to chew khat them-selves; to denounce khat, perhaps, is to denounceYemeni culture. Another explanation may be in the use of khat for stress relief and academic enhancement within the medical profession. Astudy of Yemeni physicians concluded that not chewing khat was a predictor of burnout (10). In Saudi Arabia, Yemen's geographical neighborto the north and where khat is prohibited, medi- cal students smoke tobacco to overcome school- related stresses, despite being knowledgeable ofits detrimental health effects (11). As the major-ity of the khat chewers in our sample agreed that khat chewing helps people to stay awake and to relax, khat chewing among Yemeni medicalstudents can thus be considered a cultural ana- logue to tobacco use in Saudi Arabian medicalstudents to relieve stress and coffee consumption in American medical students to aid in studying. Our study should be viewed in light of its limitations. One limitation was that our samplewas a small convenience sample. Additionally,our seminar subgroup demonstrated high levels of knowledge prior to the seminar, which made it difcult to detect a difference in knowledgeafter the seminar (ceiling effect). Our study also had strengths. First, we are unaware of any other study assessing the knowl-edge, use, and attitudes of Yemeni medical stu- dents towards khat. In developing survey items, we took cultural and religious sensitivities intoaccount. We asked about knowledge of alcoholuse among medical students, rather than per- sonal alcohol use, because alcohol is illegal in Yemen; however, when asking about additionalstimulant use, we failed to take into considera- tion that tea is the caffeinated beverage of choice over coffee. Third, our survey was anonymousand voluntary and we had no control over the students' grades or standing at the university. The solution to the paradox of students con- sidering it unacceptable for health professionalsto chew khat, but being unwilling to advise pa- tients to quit, is not purely a matter of knowledge, as the students demonstrated good knowledgeabout khat. Khat's role in Yemeni culture may be a primary reason for these conflicting attitudes. Therefore, perhaps Yemeni public health of-cials need to make public statements on khat's health hazards before current and future health professionals in Yemen will feel that it is accept-able to get involved with their patients' chew-ing habits. Studies on khat policy have called for governments to actively pursue regulation of khat focused on harm and risk reduction (12).In this regard, the Yemeni government has made efforts in the past, such as limitations of khat use to certain days of the week (12) and formerPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh has discouraged khat use on several occasions (1). Nevertheless, continued and increased efforts may be criticalto empowering current and future health profes-sionals in Yemen to advise their patients about khat. Another part of the solution may involve the clinical education of health professionals.Given khat's unique cultural place in Yemeni society, current and future health professionals Downloaded by [Boston University] at 13:24 05 February 2013 Brief Reports 377 may benet from being trained to ask about khat in culturally and socially appropriate ways, for example, to have an open discussion about khat and to leave the decision up to the patient. Al-though our seminar had few effects, the border-line signicant effect observed, the likely need for a discussion forum to adequately address the problem, and the effects of such seminars ontobacco suggest that discussion-based seminars may be a part of the solution.

Attitudinal barriers towards analgesic use among primary care patients with chronic pain and substance use disorders (SUDs) are not well understood. We evaluated the prevalence of moderate to signicant attitudinal barriers to analgesic use among 597 primary care patients with chronic pain and current analgesic use with 3 subscales from the Barriers Questionaire II: concernabout side e ects, fear of addiction, and worry about reporting pain to physicians. Concern about side e ects was a greater barrier for those with opioid use disorders (OUDs) and non-opioid SUDs than for those no SUD (95% (1.44-3.68), P< 0.001 and 1.64 (1.02-2.65), P =0.041, resp.). Fear of addiction was a greater barrier for those with OUDs as compared to those with non-opioid SUDs (OR (95% 2.12 (1.44-5.03), P=0.002). Conversely, participants with non-opioid SUDs reported lower levels of worry about reporting pain to physicians than those with no SUD (OR (95% CI): 0.43 (0.24-0.76), P=0.004). Participants with OUDs reported higher levels of worry about reporting pain than those with non-opioid SUDs (OR (95% CI): 1.91 (1.01-3.60), P=0.045). Concerns about side e ects and fear of addiction can be barriers to analgesic use, moreso for people with SUDs and OUDs. 1. Introduction Chronic pain is commonly encountered in primary care [ 1], where the majority of patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) receive health care [ 2]. Patients with SUDs are at signicant risk of pain [ 3,4] and are likely to be undertreated for pain. Not only do patients with SUDs report continued pain despite engaging in medical care [ 5], but few providers caring for these patients follow recommended guidelines [ 6]. Many pathways may be responsible for such undertreatment,from health systems issues, like insurance coverage andlimited access to specialists, to clinician attitudes and skills [7]. For example, clinicians may be appropriately reluctant to prescribe opioid pain medications to patients with historiesof substance use disorders out of concern that patientsmay divert or misuse them [ 8]. One possible and relativelyunexplored reason for undertreatment is patient attitudinal barriers to analgesic medications, such as concerns aboutside e ects, fear of addiction, and worries about reporting pain to physicians. Indeed, patients with SUDs who are HIVpositive or are enrolled in methadone maintenance programsreport signicant attitudinal barriers to pain medications,including concerns regarding addiction potential, need forescalating doses, and di culty communicating with their clinicians regarding pain [ 9,10]. However, such attitudinal barriers to analgesic use, such as opioid medication use,among patients with SUDs in primary care settings have notbeen well described. Several patient characteristics have been associated with attitudes that may result in more barriers to the use of anal-gesic medications (i.e., higher attitudinal barriers) includingnon-White race, lower education, more physical symptoms2 Pain Research and Treatment [10], older age [ 11], higher pain severity and disability [ 12], unemployment [ 13], and depression [ 14], while the data on gender are mixed [ 13,15]. Other characteristics have not been explored but seem likely to impact attitudinal barriers,such as whether patients are currently or previously addictedto substances, the substances to which they may be addicted (e.g., opioids versus nonopioid drugs), and recent use of analgesics. For example, patients with past addiction, whoare currently in recovery, may have more negative attitudesabout opioid analgesics than those currently addicted.Similarly, patients with opioid use disorders (OUDs) maybe more likely than patients with nonopioid SUDs to havenegative attitudes regarding the addiction potential of opioidpain medications. Finally, though psychiatric illnesses, suchas depression and anxiety, are known to be associatedwith more attitudinal barriers [ 14], the ways in which other psychiatric illnesses, like posttraumatic stress disorder,common among people with chronic pain [ 16,17] and SUDs [18], aect attitudinal barriers has not yet been explored. Our objective was to compare attitudinal barriers to analgesic use among patients with SUDs and those without,across three domains: concern about side e ects, fear of addiction, and worries about reporting pain to physicians.We hypothesized that the majority of primary care patientswith SUDs would have moderate-to-severe attitudinal bar-riers and that those with SUDs would have greater barriersin all three domains as compared to those without SUDs.We also explored whether two subcategories of SUDs\u2014(1) current versus lifetime disorder and (2) OUD versusnonopioid SUD\u2014report greater barriers. We hypothesized that people with lifetime SUDs as compared to current SUDs, and OUDs as compared to nonopioid SUDs, would havegreater barriers in all three domains. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants and Setting. We conducted a cross-sectional study of a sample of primary care patients with chronicpain. We recruited participants between February 2005 andAugust 2006 from waiting rooms of an academic, urbanhospital primary care practice. We approached patientswaiting for appointments and included patients who were18-60 years of age, spoke English, had pain for three monthsor more, reported use of any analgesic medication (over- the-counter or prescription) in the prior month, and had a scheduled primary care appointment. Informed consentwas obtained from eligible patients. Trained interviewersadministered surveys. We compensated participants with$10. The Boston University Medical Center InstitutionalReview Board approved the study, and a certicate ofcondentiality was obtained from the National Institutes ofHealth. 2.2. Instruments Dependent V ariables. The dependent variables of interest were the Barriers Questionnaire II (BQ-II) subscale scores.The BQ-II, a validated 27-item self-report survey, was origi-nally designed to measure barriers to obtaining pain relieff o rc a n c e rp a t i e n t s[ 11]. We selected the BQ-II because it is a widely used instrument and has been adapted foruse with adolescent cancer patients [ 19] and HIV/AIDS populations [ 10], and is used in ambulatory settings [ 10, 19]. We eliminated all questions referring to cancer pain and the immune system in order to make it applicable to a primary care population. The resulting 9-item version, displayed in Ta bl e 1 , contains three subscales including concern about side e ects, fear of addiction, and worries about reporting pain to physicians. The questionnaire refersto \"pain medications\" and does not specify opioid analgesics.The items are scaled on a 6-point Likert scale from 0 (donot agree) to 5 (agree very much). A-one point increase onthe overall BQ-II has previously been shown to be associatedwith a twofold greater likelihood of being undermedicatedfor pain control [ 10]. A BQ subscale score cuto of 3h a s been previously used in the literature [ 10]; we considered as c o r eo f3 to be indicative of moderate-to-signicant barriers. Independent Variables. The main independent variables of interest were mutually exclusive categories of substanceuse disorders identied using the Composite InternationalDiagnostic Interview v. 2.1 Drug Use Disorder module, awell-validated interview instrument that yields current andpast DSM-IV diagnoses [ 20,21]. We assigned participants into three mutually exclusive categories of substance use disorders: those with \"OUDs\"(which included opioid abuse and dependence), \"nonopioidSUDs\" (met criteria for a substance use disorder but not anOUD\u2014includes abuse and dependence on alcohol or otherdrug) and no SUD. If a participant met criteria for morethan one substance use disorder and one was opioids, wecategorized them as \"OUD. '' Covariates. We adjusted analyses for factors known to be associated with attitudinal barriers to analgesic use [ 11, 13-15], or, in the absence of data, due to clinical sus- picion that a factor might be associated with attitudinalbarriers. These factors were (1) sociodemographic vari-ables including sex, race/ethnicity (Black/African American,Hispanic/Latino/Other, White), employment (unemployed,including receiving disability payments versus employed partor full time), education ( <high school, high school+); (2) depression (major or other versus none) determined by thePatient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for Depression, a 9- item validated measure correlated with past two-week major depression [ 22]; (3) somatic symptom severity (high versus others) determined by the Patient Health Questionnaire-15, a validated measure that correlates with somatizationdisorder [ 23]; (4) a lifetime history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis derived from the CIDI v. 2.1PTSD module [ 20]; (5) opioid prescription in the past year. We determined the proportion of participants meeting Pre-scription Drug Use Disorder (PDUD), dened as any opiateuse disorder that was not heroin alone, but did not includePDUD as a covariate in the models because it is a subsetof OUD. We determined the proportion of participants withmoderate versus severe pain and disability using the GradedPain Research and Treatment 3 Ta ble 1: Modied Barriers Questionnaire. Subscale Item Side e ectsDrowsiness from pain medicine is di cult to control. When you use pain medicine, your body becomes used to its e ects and pretty soon it will not work anymore. Using pain medicine blocks your ability to know if you have any new pain. Pain medicine can keep you from knowing what is going on in your body. AddictionThere is a danger of becoming addicted to pain medicine. Pain medicine is very addictive. Reporting pain to physiciansIt is important to be strong by not talking about pain. It is important for the doctor to focus on curing illness, and not waste time controllingpain. Doctors might nd it annoying to be told about pain. Chronic Pain Scale [ 24], a 10-item validated measure of pain and disability; we did not include pain severity and disabilityas a covariate in the models because there is little variation inthis measure (90% reported severe pain). 2.3. Statistical Analysis Prevalence of Moderate-to-Signicant Barriers. We compared the proportion of participants with moderate-to-signicantbarriers in each category of SUD using chi square analyses. Current versus Lifetime SUD. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine the relationship between the nonmu-tually exclusive categories of lifetime (includes both current and past) and current SUDs, and prevalence of moderate-to- signicant barriers. Because we did not detect large di er- ences, we used lifetime disorders only for subsequent anal-yses. OUD versus Nonopioid SUD. We conducted bivariate anal- yses using general linear models with the Duncan multiplerange test for di erences to examine the relationship between the independent variable of interest (OUD, nonopioid SUDand no SUD), and the BQ-II subscale scores. Becausethe three categories di ered in their relationship to BQ-II subscale scores (data not shown), we maintained this variableas a three-part variable in further analyses. Logistic Regression Analysis of Barriers. In bivariate analyses, the main independent variable impacted the subscales inopposite directions. We therefore examined the subscalesseparately. We rst conducted bivariate analyses to examinethe relationship between covariates and the barrier subscales. We then constructed three multivariable logistic regressionmodels\u2014one for each subscale\u2014in order to examine therelationship between substance use category (OUD, nono-pioid SUD, and no SUD) and the odds of having moderate-to-signicant barriers. Each model was adjusted for the main independent variable and all covariates .T ests for colinearity among the covariates were carried out using correlationcoecients and any colinear variables were eliminated. 3. Results 3.1. Participant Characteristics. Of 822 eligible patients, 597 (73%) enrolled and completed the research interview.Enrollees were more likely than those who declined enroll-ment to be black (61% versus 55%, P =0.04), less likely to take over-the-counter pain medication (66% versus 79%,P< 0.001), and more likely to take opioid pain medication (41% versus 30%, P =0.002). Participant characteristics are shown in Ta bl e 2 .Am a j o r - ity of the study sample was female, unemployed, and non-white. Roughly half of participants had no SUD, one quarterhad an OUD and one quarter had a nonopioid SUD. Ofthose with an OUD, 104/138 (75%) met criteria for alifetime prescription drug use disorder. As noted in previousliterature [ 25], the prevalence of OUD is higher among whites (28%) versus blacks (19%) and among males (32%)versus females (17%). 3.2. Attitudinal Barriers Prevalence of Moderate-to-Signicant Attitudinal Barriers. In the full sample, moderate-to-signicant fear of side e ects (60%) and concern about addiction (71%) were commonwhile worry about reporting pain to physicians was relatively uncommon (27%). Participants with OUDs more often reported moderate-to-signicant fears of addiction thanthose with no nonopioid with nonopioid SUDs less often reported moderate-to-signicantworries about reporting pain to physicians than those withno SUDs (18% versus 31%, P =0.01). Current V ersus Lifetime SUD. There were no di erences in prevalence of moderate-to-signicant barriers betweenthose with current and lifetime SUD for any of the subscales(concern about side e ects (66% versus 64%), fear of addiction (83% versus 78%), and worries about reportingpain to physicians (23% versus 18%)). Unadjusted Analyses. Unadjusted logistic regression analy- ses of moderate-to-signicant barriers comparing substanceuse groups are presented in Ta bl e 3 .C o n c e r na b o u ts i d e eects and fear of addiction scores were greater among participants with OUDs than they were for those with noSUDs. Similarly, participants with OUDs had greater fearof addiction than those with nonopioid SUDs.

Similarly, those with OUDs continued toreport higher fears of addiction and higher concern aboutreporting pain as compared to those with nonopioid SUDs.Dierences in worry about reporting pain to physicians between those with nonopioid SUDs remained lower thanamong those with no SUDs in adjusted analyses. Afteradjustment, participants with nonopioid SUDs had higherconcerns about side e ects than those with no SUDs, and participants with OUDs had higher concerns aboutreporting pain than those with nonopioid SUDs. 4. Discussion In our sample of 597 primary care patients with chronicpain, moderate-to-signicant fear about side e ects and concern about addiction was common, and more so forparticipants with OUDs and nonopioid SUDs than thosewith no SUDs. Conversely, moderate-to-signicant worriesabout reporting pain to physicians were less common overall,and less so for participants with nonopioid SUDs. In adjustedanalyses, participants with OUDs reported more concernabout side e ects and fear of addiction yet similar worries about reporting pain to physicians as those with no SUD.Participants with nonopioid SUDs reported lower worriesabout reporting pain to physicians than those with no SUDand those with OUDs. Interestingly, those with current andlifetime substance use disorders reported similar barrierswith regard to all three subscales. Why might people with OUDs and chronic pain report a greater degree of attitudinal barriers to analgesic use thanparticipants with nonopioid SUDs? In our study, there wereno di erences in baseline characteristics between those with OUDs and those with nonopioid SUDs, which suggeststhat there is something about the experience of the opioiditself (such as the potential addictive quality of opioids)that is associated with increased barriers. Because relapseor worse addiction may be triggered by exposure to opioid medications, those with OUDs may have heightened concern compared to those with nonopioid SUDs, who may perceiveless risk of addiction with exposure to opioids. This ndingis consistent with other studies showing that HIV-infectedpatients with a prior injection drug use history are moreconcerned than their noninjection drug using counterpartsabout the addictive potential of pain medications [ 10]. Greater attitudinal barriers among participants with OUDs are particularly interesting because this observationis in contradiction to the experience of many clinicianswho describe patients with pain and opioid abuse as\"drug seeking\" [ 26]. In fact, while the majority of partici- pants in our study reported attitudinal barriers to analgesicmedications, in a study of physicians' perceptions of barriers to AIDS pain management, only a minority of physicians (24%) believed patient reluctance to take opioids to be a barrier to pain management [ 27]. This discrepancy between physician perception of patient reluctance to take opioidsand patient concerns about taking opioids may be a sourceof miscommunication between patients and physicians. Infact, a clinical encounter for a patient with a substance usehistory that is focused on pain may have competing demandson the part of both the clinician and the patient. Cliniciansbalance ambiguity in pain assessment, treatment goals, andtreatment risks [ 28]; similarly, though attitudinal barriers may play a role for the patient, these barriers may not beexpressed due to a desire to obtain pain medications forpain relief or misuse, including for their euphoric e ect or diversion, all of which are common among patients withprior substance use disorders [ 5]. The nding that attitudinal barriers were similar for those with current and lifetime opioid use disorders suggeststhat patients with past SUDs may harbor as many negativeattitudes regarding concerns about side e ects and fear of addiction potential as patients currently struggling withopioid addiction. This caution about taking pain medica-tions in patients with past SUDs and chronic pain may beappropriate. While opioids may provide good short-termpain relief, chronic opioid use can produce a number ofproblems, including relapse [ 29]. However, these perceptions may also lead to undertreatment of pain. Why might individuals with SUDs have lesser attitudinal barriers to reporting pain to doctors than individuals without SUDs? Patients in this study all su ered from chronic pain and may therefore have developed a certainlevel of comfort discussing pain. In addition, patients in ourstudy also had ongoing relationships with regular primarycare clinicians, a key characteristic identied by patientsas essential to good communication and clinical decisionmaking [ 30]. Finally, patients with SUDs may nd it easier to talk about pain than other areas, such as addiction or mentalhealth. Several limitations apply to our ndings. The sample was derived from a single academic urban hospital primary care practice and is therefore potentially subject to idiosyncratic practices, which may limit its generalizability. Nonetheless,the sample reflects a demographically heterogeneous groupand is likely similar to patients in many other urban primary care practices in the US. In addition, the questions focused on possible side e ects, addiction potential, and reporting of pain, and not about attitudes towards requesting or receiving prescriptions for opioid pain medications. Thus, we may have missed the potentially contentious part of the medical encounter: namely, the dispensation of opioid prescriptions.Finally, the questions did not explicitly delineate whichclasses of pain medications (e.g., opioid versus nonopioid analgesics) to consider. We expect that most participants assumed questions were referring to opioid medications;indeed recent opioid prescription was common in our sam-ple, suggesting that many participants had experience with prescription opioids.6 Pain Research and Treatment Despite these limitations, the study o ers a preliminary look into the nature of patient attitudinal barriers to anal-gesic use in primary care patients with pain and addictions.It also o ers an alternative perspective on patient-physician interactions than that previously described. Prior studieshave demonstrated that the patient-physician interaction regarding pain medications is characterized by mutual mistrust and di cult communication [ 26]. Primary care providers display discomfort and avoidance in discussingunhealthy alcohol use [ 31], suggesting that physicians expe- rience di culty communicating about substance use. How- ever, in this study, patients with SUDs reported low atti-tudinal barriers to reporting pain to clinicians. They alsoreported similar concerns to those of physicians, namely,concern regarding pain medication side e ects and addiction potential of these medications [ 10]. These ndings may therefore highlight common ground between patients andphysicians that o ers a basis for patient-physician alliance rather than the previously described \"mutual mistrust\" [ 26]. 5. Conclusions In summary, patients with opioid use disorders and chronic pain have greater attitudinal barriers to analgesic use than those without opioid use disorders. Patients with substance use disorders have lower attitudinal barriers to reportingpain to physicians. Given the substantial functional, social,and psychological consequences of undertreated pain, thereis an imperative for physicians to work with patientswho have comorbid pain and substance use disorders toaddress their attitudinal barriers to pain medications. Thisstudy highlights a modiable barrier to e ectively treating chronic pain in patients with SUD. Further clinical careand research should focus on addressing attitudinal barriersso that patients may have maximum pain relief withoutcompromising recovery from addiction.
