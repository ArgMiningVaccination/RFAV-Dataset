Despite this, maternal vaccination uptake is low, varies by region and is inequitable, with Mori and Pacific mm (mothers) less likely to receive vaccination. Aim: To determine what interventions currently exist to support and encourage maternal vaccination against influenza and pertussis and what changes and interventions could be implemented to improve coverage, with a focus on Mori and Pacific hap mm (pregnant mothers). Methods: Interviews with six participants with diverse roles in the vaccination workforce were conducted. Participants were involved in education, certification and supporting vaccinators, high-level strategising, and vaccination. Interviews aimed to determine what interventions currently exist for hap mm, what changes need to be made to improve coverage and how Mori and Pacific people have been specifically engaged. Qualitative data analysis was used to determine themes. Results: Participants identified that interventions must focus on prioritising and emphasising the importance of maternal vaccination, promoting collaboration and innovation, making interventions accessible, and empowering Mori- and Pacific-driven avenues to vaccination. To create positive foundations, participants identified the importance of building and maintaining trust and affording mothers' time and autonomy in vaccination. Discussion: Healthcare professionals need to proactively engage hap mm about vaccination and collaborate in service delivery. Interventions must be suitably accessible and allow for the autonomy of hap mm over vaccination decisions. Equity should be considered at the foundation of vaccine interventions to improve the accessibility of vaccines to all communities.
