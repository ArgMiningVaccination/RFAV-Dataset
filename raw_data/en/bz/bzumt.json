As a result, post-military service outcomes, especially those related to health and well-being, may be different as well. As you transition out of the military, it is important that you become proactive about your health and fully understand your health care options. Because women are a distinct minority in VA, there is a widely held misperception that gender-specific care is not available through VA. Over the last two decades VA has made significant strides to become a place for women Veterans to receive high quality health care from providers that understand their unique health care needs. It is no longer your \"grandfather's VA\" or the VA that is often portrayed in the media. The VA health care system is here to serve you! The transition out of the military into civilian life will encompass many areas of your life. It is not only a career change\u2014it is also a psychological and cultural transition and it will require developing your own path for a rewarding post-military life. This course aims to help you on your transition journey. This journey is uniquely yours and can look different for everyone. You will need to set goals for your own health and well being and work toward and manage them. You will need to be your own advocate and we are here to help you get started.Why WHTT? 5 REASONS Top 5 reasons former Women's Health Transition Training participants recommend this course: 1 Gained knowledge on earned health services and women-specific services that every Servicewoman needs to know 2 Women-only course design created a supportive environment and was conducive to honest conversation 3 Empowering and positive mental preparation for transition 4 VA eligibility and enrollment navigation 5 Thorough curriculum and resources WHTT Participant Handbook 4 PHASE 2 PHASE 3 PHASE 1 PHASE 4 PHASE 5 APPENDIX INTROShift from Active DutyWHTT Positive Impact VA IS HERE TO HELP YOU. Over the last 20 years, VA has tracked health data and supplemented findings with published research on military and Veteran women populations. Studies have shown during and after military service, women may confront or react to military experiences differently than men, potentially affecting their health. In a study on women's barriers to VA health care system use, non-VA-users had \"substantial deficits and misperceptions regarding VA eligibility, benefits and [women's health] services,\" and cited the media, other Veterans or friends for these misperceptions. Some concerning trends have emerged from this research indicating that women Veterans are more likely than their civilian counterparts to experience negative impacts on their mental health, such as higher rates of depression and suicide, as well as on their physical health such as higher rates of chronic pain. In response to these findings, VA designed and developed the Women's Health Transition Training for Servicewomen transitioning out of the military to the civilian sector with the overall goal of increasing their enrollment and utilization of VA health care services. VA has women-specific care designed to address the concerns of women Veterans, such as: yWomen reported they were not comfortable seeking women-specific care in a male dominated health system and often under report health issues yWhen screened by their VA health care provider, about 1 in 3 women report having experienced military sexual trauma (MST) yWomen Veterans have higher rates of depression than non-Veteran women and higher rates of pain and chronic conditions than male Veterans yMore than 40% of women Veterans who use VA have been diagnosed with at least one mental health conditionLEVEL OF TRUST REACHES 90.1% Veteran Signals The VA routinely surveys VHA outpatient services through a customer feedback survey known as Veterans Signals. This program was launched in June of 2017. Feedback through this program has been used to drive improvements in the services and care delivered through VHA programs. Since the program's inception in 2017 they have received more than 4 million surveys from Veterans. Recently released survey results show Veteran trust in the VA has increased, with 90.1% of Veteran responses indicating they trust the VA as of April 2020.

You can learn more about VA, each administration and your benefits by visiting VA .gov .National Cemetery Administration (NCA) Supports burial and memorials for United States military Veterans. NCA honors Veterans and their families with final resting places. They provide the gravesites, headstones and the U.S. flag. NCA also provides funding to establish, expand, improve and maintain Veteran cemeteries across 47 states as well as tribal lands, Guam and Saipan.Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Is the largest integrated health care system with a patient-centered, holistic approach to care in the United States and provides care to Veterans at more than 1,200 health care facilities. VHA serves Veterans of all ages, offering services ranging from primary care, including women-specific health care, to a full continuum of gender-sensitive mental health services, as well as specialty care services such as neurology, cardiology and dermatology. VA Office of Women's Health is part of VHA.Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) Provides a variety of benefits and services to Service members, Veterans and their families. Some of these programs include: disability compensation, Veterans pension, dependency and indemnity compensation, insurance services, education services, home loans and employment services. VBA also runs the VA Benefits and Services course as part of the Transition Assistance Program (TAP). Center for Women VeteransOffice of the Secretary of VA WHTT Participant Handbook 12 Understanding the VA PHASE 2 PHASE 3 PHASE 1 PHASE 4 PHASE 5 APPENDIX INTROVA Health Care Facility Structure The VA health care system is America's largest integrated health care system with a patient-centered, holistic approach to care . The VA system is divided into 18 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). See page 16 for a map of the VISNs. Within each VISN there are three different types of health care facilities: yVeterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC): VAMCs (i.e., hospitals) are the largest facility type within the VA system and offer the most services. They provide comprehensive health care to all Veterans. yCommunity Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC): VA implemented CBOCs to make access to health care easier. These clinics provide the most common outpatient services\u2014including health and wellness visits\u2014without needing to visit a larger medical center. yVet Center: The goal of the Vet Centers is to provide a broad range of counseling, outreach and referral services to Veterans in order to help you transition to civilian life. Within VA health care facilities, you will find roles dedicated specifically to women's health care using a Whole Health approach that is all about you and what matters most to you regarding your health and well-being.

Women's Health Primary Care Provider (WH-PCP) Once enrolled in VA services, you will be assigned or may request a WH-PCP with the gender of your choice, as staffing allows, at your preferred facility. The role of the WH-PCP is to provide comprehensive primary care services, including general primary care and gender-specific care to women Veterans enrolled in VA. Your WH-PCP will: yProvide a long-term patient-provider relationship yBe your first point of contact with the VA health care system yServe as the foundation for your VA health care experience Women Veterans Program Manager (WVPM) All VAMCs have a designated WVPM to help women Veterans access VA benefits and health care services. The WVPM is an advocate for women Veterans by establishing, coordinating and integrating accessible high-quality health care services with multiple disciplines within VA medical facilities. The WVPM: yIs a health care professional yIs the administrative leader of the Women's Health Program at the facility with at least 3 years of experience and expertise in program administration yHas experience in Women's health care service delivery Each VA facility has a designated WVPM you can contact with questions about health services, enrollment and general health system navigation. Women's Health Medical Director (WHMD) The WHMD works closely with the WVPM to form the foundation and subject matter expertise of the Women's Health Program at their VAMC. The WHMD works to develop clinical leadership (including quality improvement and educational initiatives), determine appropriate and available models of care, and ensure women Veterans are offered and assigned to a WH-PCP . Each VAMC has a WHMD or a Women's Health Clinical Champion responsible for clinical oversight of the women's health program.Did you KNOW? WVPMs are there to: yAssist with enrollment of women Veterans in need of health care yPromote practices that enhance women Veterans' satisfaction with their care and connect Veterans with other Veteran peers yIdentify gaps in health care services yEnsure the environment of each VA facility addresses the privacy and quality needs of women ySupport improvement activities to continually enhance Veteran experience yDevelop and provide education for staff to enhance their awareness around unique needs of women Veterans, leaving them better equipped to provide high quality care yDevelop new programs and services that align with the needs of women Veterans and empowers them to take charge of their health and well-being WHTT Participant Handbook 14 Understanding the VA PHASE 2 PHASE 3 PHASE 1 PHASE 4 PHASE 5 APPENDIX INTROWomen Veterans Clinic Models The VA system is comprised of three comprehensive primary care clinic models . Women's primary care is provided by Women's Health Primary Care Providers in any of three following models of care at each VA site. The comprehensive primary care clinic models include the following: Model 1: General Primary Care Comprehensive women's primary care is delivered to women Veterans within primary care clinics serving both men and women . Mental health services for women are also offered in general primary care clinics through Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI). Efficient referral to specialty gynecology care is made available at all sites. Model 2: Separate but Shared Space Comprehensive women's primary care is delivered to women Veterans in a separate space that may be located within or adjacent to primary care clinic areas . The clinic may be open part-time or full-time and may be used for other non-gender-specific services when women Veterans are not being seen. Gynecological care and mental health services are also available in this space and readily available. Model 3: Comprehensive Women's Health Center (WHC) Comprehensive women's primary care is delivered to women Veterans in an exclusive, separate space. When possible, a WHC should have: yA separate entrance yA separate waiting room Services and sub-specialty services provided in the space often include: specialty gynecological care, mental health, social work services, breast care, neurology, nutrition and pharmacy. Note: Telehealth options are available in all three models.1General Primary Care 2Separate but shared space 3Comprehensive Women's Health Center (WHC) Women's Health Centers make sure you have access to the appropriate number of health care providers you need for primary care, as well as appropriate support staffing for specialty services.

WHTT Participant Handbook 16 Understanding the VA PHASE 2 PHASE 3 PHASE 1 PHASE 4 PHASE 5 APPENDIX INTROMISSION Act The MISSION Act streamlines and improves VA's community care programs, providing Veterans better customer service when receiving community care . If you are eligible for health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs, our goal is to provide you with the care you need in a VA facility. When services are not available within a VA or other government medical facility, eligible Veterans may be referred to a community provider through the VA Community Care Program. In June 2019, the MISSION Act replaced the Choice Program. If you are already enrolled in VA, the VA MISSION Act allows you to receive health care within the community. You may be eligible for community care if: 1.You need a service that is not available at a VA medical facility 2.You live in a U.S. state or territory without a full-service VA medical facility 3.You qualify under the \"Grandfather\" provision related to distance eligibility for the Veterans Choice Program 4.VA cannot furnish care within certain designated access standards\u2014averagedrive time and appointment wait time a.Average drive time to a specific VA medical facility 30-minute average drive time for primary care, mental health and non-institutional extended care services (including adult day health care) 60-minutes average drive time for specialty care Note: Average drive times are calculated by VA using geo-mapping software that uses inputs such as traffic tocalculate the average driving time b.Appointment wait time at a specific VA medical facility 20 days for primary care, mental health care and non-institutional extended care services, unless the Veteran agrees to a later date inconsultation with their VA health care provider 28 days for specialty care from the date of request, unless theVeteran agrees to a later date in consultation with their VA healthcare provider 5.It is in the Veteran's best medical interest 6.A VA medical service line does not meet certain quality standardsPlease note: You need to confirm whether the location will accept VA benefits before receiving services.Through the MISSION Act, eligible Veterans can receive urgent care from an urgent care provider who is part of the VA's contracted network of community providers, without requesting prior authorization from VA. WHTT Participant Handbook 17 Understanding the VAPHASE 2 PHASE 3 PHASE 1 PHASE 4 PHASE 5 APPENDIX INTRO PHASE 2 PHASE 3 PHASE 1 PHASE 4 PHASE 5 APPENDIX INTROAll Veterans are welcome at VA, including those who identify as a sexual or gender minority. Veterans enrolled in VA are treated and addressed by their gender identity. Did you KNOW? Women currently comprise: y20% of new recruits y14.5% of the active-duty force y18% of the reserve componentsDriving VA Transformation Women Veterans are the fastest-growing segment of the U .S . Veteran population . The number of women Veterans is expected to increase at an average rate of about 18,000 women per year for the next 8 years. That is an average expected increase from 2 million in 2016 to 2.2 million in 2026. The growing number of women Veterans also brings with it greater diversity in race, ethnicity and sexual orientation in all age groups over time. This underscores the importance of efforts to ensure that services are sensitive to age, gender, culture and intersectionality (i.e., interactions) among gender, age and race/ethnicity. At the end of FY19, approximately 760,000 women Veterans were enrolled in the VA health care system, of which nearly 530,000 actively used VA health care services. The current VA market penetration rate for women Veterans is 42%, compared to 49% for their male counterparts. The reasons for this disparity are unclear, but in a study on women's barriers to VA health care system use, non-VA-users had \"substantial deficits and misperceptions regarding VA eligibility, benefits and [women's health] services,\" and cited the media, other Veterans or friends for these misperceptions.

The Whole Health approach to care empowers, equips and treats you so you can take charge of your health and well-being and live your life to the fullest. Whole Health encourages you to develop a Personal Health Plan, set goals based on what is important to you and work toward those goals with your health team. Many plans include well-being approaches such as yoga, aquatic therapy, mindfulness meditation, acupuncture or creative writing classes. The aim is to equip you with what you need to reach your goals. yA PACT achieves coordinated care through collaboration. All of your team members have clearly defined roles. They meet often to talk with you and each other about your progress toward achieving your health goals. The focus is on building trusted, personal relationships resulting in coordination of all aspects of your health care. yA PACT uses a team-based approach. You are the center of the care team that also includes your family members, caregivers and health care professionals. When additional services are needed to meet your health goals, other care team members may be called in to support your Personal Health plan.

However, each person's screening timing is different based on your specific situation and potential risk factors. Since 2008, one of VA's major initiatives has been to enhance preventive screening services, specifically for breast and cervical cancer. All women Veterans are eligible for screening mammography either on-site or in the community. VA has expanded access to on-site mammograms by 62% since 2010. Additionally, some facilities offer mammograms to walk-in patients as well as same-day ultrasounds. Through VA you can expect services including but not limited to: yCervical cancer screenings , which include Pap smears to look for precancerous changes on the cervix that might evolve into cervical cancer if not treated appropriately, and HPV tests to detect the human papillomavirus (HPV) that can cause cancer cell changes. |Screening recommendation: Every 3-5 years based on age and risk factors yBreast cancer screening , which looks for changes in breast tissue to detect cancer. Mammography is currently available on-site at 62 VAMCs and is also covered by VA at mammography centers in the community. |Screening recommendation: Annually for ages 45-54 and biannually after age 55 yLung cancer screenings , which detect cell abnormalities in the lungs. |Screening recommendation: Adults aged 55-80 with a history of smoking yColorectal cancer screenings, which detect cancerous colon cells through colonoscopy procedures. |Screening recommendation: Starting at age 50-75. Frequency depends on the type of test done and the results Please reference the Preventive Care Recommendations Chart on Pages 92-93 and talk to your WH-PCP about your individual screening risks.Eligibility yAll Veterans who are enrolled in VA health care are eligible for cancer screenings, which includes cervical and breast cancer screenings. ySome VA facilities have on-site mammography while others will refer your mammography into the community. Access yYour WH-PCP will place an order for your mammogram. yYou can talk to your WH-PCP about any screening questions and needs. VA adopted the American Cancer Society guidelines for breast cancer screening\u2014women should be able to start screenings as early as age 40, if desired.

Looking at women's health over the past two decades, researchers have noticed that after being separated from the military for 2-5 years, women's risk for cardiovascular disease increases, even in the youngest age group. Women are more likely to have additional risk factors for CVD, such as depression, certain autoimmune conditions and pregnancy-related CVD diagnoses (e.g., gestational diabetes), than their male counterparts. Your WH-PCP will assess your risks and help you get started with any needed cardiovascular prevention strategies that should be included in your Whole Health plan, which might include more exercise, changes in nutrition, weight loss, smoking cessation or medications. The following measures are recommended to prevent cardiovascular issues: yMaintaining a healthy, balanced diet yStriving for a healthy weight yCompleting around 3 hours of exercise per week yKeeping conditions like diabetes and hypertension well-controlled yManaging your stress levels yAiming to get 7-8 hours of sleep every night yAvoiding smoking and excessive alcohol intake If you have any symptoms of cardiovascular disease, your provider may recommend further testing including: electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG), stress tests, cardiac catheterization and/or cardiac MRI. Additionally, heart attacks may present differently for women. While a man's presentation of a heart attack is more sudden, women often experience the following symptoms: yUncomfortable pressure, squeezing or pain in the center of your chest yPain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach yShortness of breath yCold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness For Veterans in need of cardiovascular treatment, appointments and services are coordinated through your WH-PCP . All medically necessary prescriptions for cardiovascular treatment are covered by VA.Eligibility yAll Veterans who are enrolled in VA health care are eligible for cardiovascular risk assessments, prevention services and treatment. ySpecific programs may vary by facility. Access yConnect with your WH-PCP for questions, assessments and treatment needs. yCardiology consultation requires a referral from yo u r W H - P CP. VA providers now have access to DOD records to support a smooth transition into VA care. Veteran patients with a high cardiovascular risk category receive a closer hand-off.

VA empowers and equips all Veterans to take charge of their health and life. Whole Health is about maintaining a comprehensive health and well-being plan, not just attending individual appointments. You will work with your WH-PCP to create a personal health plan. Your WH-PCP will ask you questions from the Personalized Health Inventory (PHI) as the first step in the process to develop your Personal Health Plan. It can be helpful to complete the PHI prior to your first appointment, you can create your PHI online at www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTH/phi.asp . Example questions include: yWhat brings you a sense of joy and happiness? yWhy is your health important to you? yWhat do you live for? yWhat's on your bucket list? yWhat really matters to you in your life? The Components of Proactive Health and Well-being (see sidebar) is a tool your health care team will use to help you focus on those areas of your life that impact your health and well-being. You will identify areas of strengths and opportunities where you can make healthy changes, create your own goals and your health care team will partner with you to provide education, resources or tools to help you reach those goals! Your Personalized Health Plan may have a combination of clinical care, health coaching, well-being programs and complementary and integrative health (CIH) services. CIH services available but not limited to include: acupuncture (including battlefield acupuncture), biofeedback, chiropractic care, guided imagery, clinical hypnosis, mindfulness/meditation, tai chi or qi gong, yoga and massage for treatment of certain conditions.

VA provides treatment for musculoskeletal conditions and injuries, which can be caused by high impact activities and/or heavy combat gear. Musculoskeletal injuries are injuries that affect the human body's movement or musculoskeletal system (i.e., muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, discs, blood vessels). Early enrollment in treatment and physical therapy/rehabilitation can help prevent the development of chronic pain, additional injuries, limited muscle function and negative mood/motivation. Treatment includes primary care, rheumatology, orthopedics, physiatry referrals and surgery, if needed. Veterans are also eligible for the following services to treat musculoskeletal injuries: yOccupational therapy yComplementary and integrative health services |Including yoga and tai chi Fundamental musculoskeletal services are available at all VAMCs.

IPV occurs on a continuum of frequency and severity and does not require intimacy or cohabitation. Trauma-informed care is a strengths-based approach to delivering health care rooted in understanding of the impact of trauma. It seeks to maximize physical, psychological and emotional safety in all health care encounters, not just those that are specifically trauma-focused. It fosters healing through safe and collaborative patient-clinician relationships. The Veteran community may be more likely to experience IPV than their non-Veteran counterparts. Some of the Veteran-centric risk factors include: yPosttraumatic stress yLoss of trust/moral distress yMilitary family life stress ySeparation and isolation yMental health concerns yAlcohol and/or drug use yTBI yIncreased anger yDecreased frustration tolerance Knowledge of potential risk factors for IPV as well as education of the profound impacts can aid in prevention. Did you know: yIPV is often known to begin or increase during pregnancy. yWomen Veterans who report IPV are 3 times more likely to have housing insecurity. y72% of all murder-suicides involve an intimate partner. yLesbian and bisexual women, as well as transgender and gender diverse individuals, are at increased risk of interpersonal violence. yBrain damage or TBI can begin in 5-10 seconds and death in only 62-152 seconds during strangulation. VA provides many intervention and prevention resources to support those impacted by IPV. These include access to education, resources, community referrals, consultations, assessments and treatment by connecting with your local IPVAP Coordinator and/or WH-PCP . You may access additional information on the Intimate Partner Violence Assistance Program or find your local IVPAP coordinator through the online roster at www.socialwork.va.gov/IPV/Index.aspEligibility yYou must be enrolled in VA care. All women enrolled in VA care should be screened for IPV. Universal education, screening, resources and referrals are available to Veterans' intimate partners, regardless of partners' Veteran status. Access yMost sites have an IPV Assistance Program Coordinator available to assist. If one is not available, please contact your WH-PCP or mental health provider. yYou may access the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1.800.799.SAFE or connect with your IPVAP Coordinator. WHTT Participant Handbook 34 Available Women's Health Services PHASE 2 PHASE 3 PHASE 1 PHASE 4 PHASE 5 APPENDIX INTROPreventive Care and Wellness Immunizations Immunizations are designed to protect you from the seasonal flu and other vaccine-preventable diseases. VA offers vaccinations against a range of infectious agents including: yHepatitis A and B yHuman papillomavirus (HPV) yPneumococcus yInfluenza Influenza The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone over the age of 6 months receive an annual flu shot. In the military, it is mandatory to receive an annual influenza vaccination; however, once you are a civilian it is your choice as to whether or not to be vaccinated. Common Myths Myth The flu shot can give you the flu. Fact The flu shot cannot cause flu illness. Flu vaccines that are administered with a needle (flu shots) are currently made in two ways: a ) flu vaccine viruses that have been killed and are therefore not infectious OR b ) with proteins from a flu vaccine that are not infectious. Myth It is too late to get the flu shot after Thanksgiving. Fact Influenza vaccination can protect you for as long as flu viruses are circulating. The flu is unpredictable and seasons can vary. Seasonal flu disease usually peaks between December and March most years, but the disease can occur as late as May. Getting an annual flu shot later in the flu season\u2014December or later\u2014can still be protective. Myth The flu shot increases your risk of getting COVID-19. Fact There is no evidence that getting a flu vaccination increases your risk of getting sick from a coronavirus, like the one that causes COVID-19. Myth Thimerosal, present in multi-dose flu vaccines, is harmful to humans. Fact Thimerosal use in vaccines and other medical products has a record of being very safe. Flu vaccines in multi-dose vials contain thimerosal to safeguard against contamination of the vial. Most single-dose vials and pre-filled syringes of flu shot flu vaccine do not contain a preservative such as thimerosal because they are intended to be used once.Eligibility yYou must be enrolled in VA care. Any treatment (including medication and counseling) must be medically necessary. Access yWork with your WH-PCP to determine which vaccines and immunizations are right for you, discuss any possible side-effects and schedule an appointment. WHTT Participant Handbook 35 Available Women's Health ServicesPHASE 2 PHASE 3 PHASE 1 PHASE 4 PHASE 5 APPENDIX INTRO PHASE 2 PHASE 3 PHASE 1 PHASE 4 PHASE 5 APPENDIX INTROPreventive Care and Wellness Immunizations (continued) High-Risk Populations and Influenza yChronic Conditions: A history of stroke, heart attack, kidney, liver and heart diseases put your body at risk for complications or even death if you become infected with the flu. The CDC reports people with a positive flu test are at an increased risk of heart attack that is 6 times higher than normal the week following an infection. In fact, adults living with diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and pregnancy are hospitalized more often from the flu than adults without these conditions. yOver 65: Women over 65 are encouraged to receive the vaccine to prevent flu infection. As we age our immune systems become more sensitive and are unable to fight off infections as well as younger women. Additionally, the flu is highly contagious and active seniors can share the virus with others who are at risk of complications from the virus. |In recent years, it's estimated between 70% and 85% of seasonal flu-related deaths have occurred in people 65 years and older. |Between 50% and 70% of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations have occurred among people in this age group. |Ask for a special \"high dose\" flu shot for people 65 and older for the best protection this season. yPregnancy: If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant this flu season, consider getting your vaccine now. The shot is safe in all trimesters of pregnancy and may help prevent a trip to the hospital. A 2018 CDC study reported that a flu shot may reduce a pregnant woman's risk of hospitalization from the flu by 40%. An additional benefit of the flu shot is that it may continue to protect the baby for a few months after birth. This is very important because infants are not able to get a flu shot until they are 6 months old. |Changes in the immune system, heart and lungs during pregnancy make pregnant women more prone to severe illness from flu. In addition, infection with the flu, may be harmful for a pregnant women's developing baby. The flu shot reduces the risk of flu-associated acute respiratory infection in pregnant women by about one-half. |Flu shots have been given to millions of pregnant women over many years with a good safety record. There is a lot of evidence that flu vaccines can be given safely during pregnancy. CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) continue to recommend pregnant women get a flu vaccine during any trimester of their pregnancy because flu poses a danger to pregnant women and a flu vaccine can prevent serious illness, including hospitalization, in pregnant women.Please see page 93 for a list of vaccines available from VA, as well as age-specific recommendations on dose and timing of vaccination. The Preventive Care Recommendations chart is also available online at www.prevention.va.gov . High-risk populations can lower their risks for complications by getting an annual flu shot.

During menopause, a woman's body slowly produces less estrogen and progesterone hormones. Menopause is a gradual process\u2014often taking 3-5 years. In general, menopause starts between ages 45-55, but it could range from ages 40-60 (menopause beginning prior to age 40 is considered premature and requires evaluation). Checking hormone levels in the blood can help determine if you are in menopause. Often, menopause will start for you around the same age that it started for your mother. Menopause happens in three stages: yPeri-menopause |Women will start to experience symptoms that indicate menopause is coming as female hormone levels begin to slowly decrease. Menstrual periods become irregular, women may experience hot flashes, night sweats, sleep problems and/or mood swings. Be careful to consistently use contraception during this stage as pregnancy can still occur. |Not all women will experience the same signs or symptoms of menopause; these represent examples of what you may experience. yMenopause |Menopause is the permanent ending of menstrual periods. You have reached menopause when you have not had a menstrual period for 12 consecutive months. yPost-menopause |This is the period of time after menopause. During this time, a woman's body makes only a very small amount of estrogen. A woman's risk of heart disease and osteoporosis (weaker bones) increases. |WH-PCP support services can include hormone replacement therapy, non-hormonal treatments for symptom management and medication to protect your bones.Eligibility yYou must be enrolled in VA care. Any treatment (including medication and counseling) must be medically necessary. Access yRequest an appointment with your WH-PCP. Routine menopause management can be delivered by your WH-PCP. If needed, they can refer you to gynecology. Symptoms related to menopause can start as early as your 30s and can last well into your 60s. You can be evaluated and treated for these symptoms, if necessary, regardless of age.

WHTT Participant Handbook 58 Available Women's Health Services PHASE 2 PHASE 3 PHASE 1 PHASE 4 PHASE 5 APPENDIX INTROMental Health and Substance Use Additional Services (continued) Women Veterans have a greater likelihood of using firearms, which are highly lethal, compared to non-Veteran women. This may explain some of the differences in suicide rates between Veteran and civilian women. Data indicate that using VA health care services may have a protective effect for women Veterans. The rate of suicide among women Veterans who have recently used VA services is lower than the rate of suicide among women Veterans who have not recently used VA services. In fact, among women Veterans who were VA users, there was a slight decrease in the age-adjusted suicide rate and a decrease in the number of suicide deaths from 2017 to 2018. While women who use VA services tend to experience more known risk factors for suicide than non-VA users, they have about the same actual risk as non-VA users. VA is a national leader in suicide prevention with advances in universal suicide risk screening, primary care mental health integration (PCHMI), same day mental health care services and Veterans Crisis Line performance.

You can schedule appointments in person, via phone or online through My HealtheVet. WH-PCPs will coordinate all specialty appointments. yWhen enrolling, you can state your gender preference for your WH-PCP . These will be assigned based on availability. yYou will also be given the option to be assigned a WH-PCP . These clinical providers have been trained in primary care and women-specific health care. Note: At some sites, you are auto-assigned to a WH-PCP . yOnce enrolled, you are eligible for most VA health services. Service eligibility and affiliated copays are dependent on your assigned Priority Group. A list of all Priority Groups is provided on pages 77-78 . yThe disability claim process is separate from your VA health care enrollment. yMedication for service-connected conditions is free and Veterans with greater than 50% service-connected disability never pay for medication. yMany services are available on site, but if they are not, can be referred out to the community by your WH-PCP .Even if you don't think you are eligible for VA health care, talk to your enrollment coordinator, as you might be eligible for certain services. * The services you can expect with comprehensive women's care include acute and chronic illness, gender-specific primary care, preventive services, mental health services and coordination of care.

For active-duty Service members, you should begin this process 180 days before separating or retiring. 2Enroll in VA Your VA enrollment will not be final until you separate or retire and receive your final DD Form 214. The DD Form 214 is your ticket into VA! 3Schedule your first appointment Call your VA facility or use the VA Online Scheduling Tool on My HealtheVet. See page 25 for details on how to prepare for your first appointment. The figure above illustrates the key steps transitioning Servicewomen should take to enroll in VA health care.Each person's individual situation will likely be unique and we encourage you to talk to your Eligibility Office to discuss your specific situation. Some individuals will need to submit a disability claim to start the enrollment process, but this may not be needed in all cases.

Why is the Disability Claims Process Important? The disability claims process is how VBA determines your service-connected status, which ultimately affects your VA priority group and what services you receive at no cost. The recommended way to file claims for disability compensation is 180 days prior to separation or retirement. You can do this through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. Claims processing times tend to be much shorter. Applying for your claim will not automatically enroll you in VA. Pre-Transition Exams Separation History and Physical Exam (SHPE) Timing: at least 180-90 days before separation or starting terminal leave yOne of the eligibility requirements for receiving post-service VA disability compensation benefits and health care is that there be a record of referrals, complaints, symptoms, treatment or diagnosis of disease, injury, disorder, or disability during active military service. yYou can receive medication or treatment for any ailments at your SHPE. yYou are responsible for scheduling your exam at a military hospital/clinic or VA facility. yVisit https://health.mil/SHPE to learn more. Compensation and Pension Exam (C&P) Timing: 180-90 days before separation yThis exam helps VA determine if you have a disability related to your military service or if your condition should receive an increased rating due to it worsening. yThe examiner will only perform a medical review to identify or confirm any disabilities shared in your claim application. The examiner won't prescribe any medicine or treat any ailments. yA VAMC or VA partner is responsible for reaching out to you and scheduling your C&P exam via mail or phone. yFor more information visit: www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/docs/claimexam-faq.pdf .How is Disability Rating Determined? To determine a Veterans' Combined Disability Rating the VBA uses a concept called the Whole Person Theory . A disability rating can never be greater than 100 since a person can never be more than 100% able-bodied. VBA makes a determination about the severity of a disability based on the evidence submitted as part of a claim or that VBA obtains from military records. All medical challenges should be documented for an accurate rating. Some transitioning Service- women will go through a different process to separate\u2014Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) : a joint DOD and VA disability evaluation process. Determinations for ill or injured Service members are made regarding fitness for continued military service.

If you served on active duty, separated under any condition other than dishonorable and served for 24 consecutive months, you are eligible for VA care starting when you separate. However, there are exceptions to coverage levels as each situation is assessed individually. yOnce you enroll in VA and receive your final C&P exam results, you will be able to determine what care is provided to you at no cost and what care will require a copay. yIf you are eligible for care at VA, you are eligible to receive all medically necessary health care services. yOnce you are eligible for VA care, you are always eligible. yIf you are a combat Veteran (active duty in a theater of combat operations) with service-related health issues, you are eligible for 5 years of free comprehensive VA care for that service-related issue starting from your discharge date. During these 5 years of free care, service-related issues are presumed and all of your comprehensive care will be delivered at no cost. yIf you have TRICARE and/or private insurance, you are still eligible for VA services.If you have any questions regarding VA eligibility, please call the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) at 1-877-222-VETS (8387) or contact your VAMC and ask for the Eligibility Specialist.

Please work with the Eligibility Office to determine your eligibility.Reserve Components Eligibility For National Guard and Reserve members, there are 2 ways to qualify for VA health care. You must have separated under any condition other than dishonorable to be eligible. 1Veteran Status Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations defines a Veteran as \"a person who served in the active military, naval or air service and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable .\" Once Veteran status is obtained, you must meet one of the minimum active-duty service requirements defined in Title 38 USC 5303A to qualify for VA health care. yTitle 10 - Active duty defined as full-time duty in the U.S. Armed Forces, such as unit deployment during war, including travel to and from such duty\u2014this does not include active duty for training yTitle 32 - Full-time National Guard duty defined as duty performed for which you are entitled to receive pay from the federal government, such as responding to a national emergency These orders do not have to be a certain length; the requirement is that you serve for the full timeframe in which you were called to active duty. OR 2VA Adjudicated Service-Connected Disability If you have a VA adjudicated service-connected disability , then you would automatically gain Veteran status . This disability does not need to have occurred while activated. WHTT Participant Handbook 74 Enrolling in VA PHASE 2 PHASE 3 PHASE 1 PHASE 4 PHASE 5 APPENDIX INTROReserve Components Eligibility (continued) There are several other key points to highlight for National Guard or Reserve members enrolling in the VA. Disability Claims While the process is similar to that of active duty members, National Guard and Reserve members should keep in mind the following items when enrolling in VA yExaminations: |You should complete a Separation physical after each deployment. It is important to keep a running list of existing issues. |After you submit your disability claim, the C&P exams will be the same for you as for civilian VA clients. |If you have been activated multiple times, you can complete multiple claims. yMedical records: |You will need to request your medical records from each active duty location where you have served. |Unlike active duty, your medical records are not consolidated and do not travel with you. |Double check your medical records to ensure they are complete and accurate. Military Drill Pay Versus Disability Compensation Pay You are not able to receive VA compensation at the same time you are receiving military (drill) pay. You will be required to waive either your VA pay or your military compensation. Most Veterans choose to receive drill pay instead of disability compensation or pension because drill pay is typically the greater benefit. These Veterans must waive their VA benefits for the same number of days they received drill pay. You will need to elect which pay you would like to receive. More information can be found at www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin21/m21_1/mr/part3/subptv/ch04/M21-1MRIII_v_4_secC.doc .

Then, based on your priority group, a copay might be applicable. Service-Connected Service-connected is an injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated during active military service that is still causing issues . You must have been separated or discharged under conditions other than dishonorable to be eligible. A C&P exam will determine your level of service-connected disability. This service-connected status will help determine your priority group; your status and resulting priority group, can change if the conditions worsen. Copays Based on your priority group, you might have to pay copays to receive care at VA. Many Veterans qualify for free health care services based on a VA compensable service-connected condition or other special eligibilities. However, most Veterans are required to complete a financial assessment (based on IRS data) at the time of enrollment to determine if they qualify for free health care services. Veterans whose income exceeds VA income limits, as well as those who choose not to complete the financial assessment at the time of enrollment, must agree to pay required copays for health care services to become eligible. A copay comparison can be found above. More information, including copay amounts, can be found at: www.va.gov/health-care/copay-rates .Make sure to document all of your health care needs now.
