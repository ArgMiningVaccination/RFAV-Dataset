Teague Nancy H. Watkins UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION Accreditation7 The University of South Florida St. Pe tersburg and all colleges, departments and programs therein establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. These requirements concern such things as cur- ricula and courses, majors and minors, and academic reside nce. Advisors, directors, department chairs, and deans are available to help the student understand and arrange to m eet these requirements, but the student is responsible for fulfilling them. At the end of a student's course of study, if requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. For this reason, it is important fo r all students to acquaint them selves with all regulations, remain informed throughout their college careers and be responsible for completing the requirements. Courses, pro-grams, and requirements described in the catalog may be su spended, deleted, restricted, supplemented or changed in any other manner at any time at the sole discretion of the University and the USF Board of Trustees. What is accreditation? Accreditation is intended to assure stakeholders, students an d the general public of the qu ality and integrity of higher education institutions and programs. Through a continuous improvement process, accredit ation also assures that the programs at the institutions are constantly advancing. Th ese outcomes are achieved through rigorous internal and external review processes during wh ich the institution is evaluated against a common set of standards. SACS-COC The University of South Florida St. Petersburg is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award degrees at the baccalaureate an d master's levels.

AACSB International is the prem ier accrediting agency for bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs in business administration and accounting, and as such is the most widely-recognized and sought-after endorsement of business schools. Less than one-third of U.S. business school programs and only 15 percent of business school programs worldwide meet the rigorous standards for AACSB accreditation. NCATE The College of Education is accredited under the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) Standards, through the Council for the Accreditation of Educ ator Preparation (CAEP) Accreditation System. Formed in 2013, CAEP is the single specialized a ccreditor for educator preparation, an d administers NCATE accreditation. The College of Education received reaccreditation under NCATE standards through the CAEP Ac creditation System in May 2015. ACEJMC The Department of Journalism and Media Studies (JMS) at USF St. Petersburg is one of 115 journalism programs na- tionally accredited by the Accrediting Council for Education in Journalism and Mass Communications. ACEJMC is the national accrediting body for professional programs in jo urnalism and mass communications. JMS, founded in 1991, was first accredited in both its undergraduate and graduate prog rams in 2004. Both programs were re-accredited in 2010 and 2016. About 25 percent of all journalism and mass communicatio n programs in the United States are fully accredited. A far smaller percentage of programs are accredit ed at both undergraduate and master's levels.

Applicants with fewer than 60 transferable semester credits are considered lower-level transfers; upper-level transfers are those with 60 or more transferable semester credits (s ee below). Regardless of category, grade point averages (GPA) for purpose of admission will be computed based only on grades earned in courses that are acceptable for transfer credit and as calculated by USF St. Petersburg. USF St. Petersburg accepts transfer credit s, without a course by co urse evaluation of the pr ior coursework, only from institutions that are accredited by one of the regional accrediting agencies/commissions recognized by USF St. Petersburg at the time the credits are earned. (See \"Evaluation of Transfer Credit\").

For an applicant applying from a non-regionally accredited school, the admissions decision will be based on prior work at a region ally accredited institution or on the transferable work completed at a non-regionally accredited in stitution as approved by SCNS. If all post-secondary work is from a non-regionally accredited sch ool, not including SCNS approved coursewo rk, the evaluation will be based on the high school record and test scores an d the applicant will be regarded as a freshman for purposes of admission. Transfer students who apply for admission to a limited a ccess undergraduate program must meet the overall admission GPA criteria for that program in order to be admitted to the University. USF St. Petersburg reserves the right to evaluate specific co urses and deny transfer credit. USF St. Petersburg does not award transfer credit that is determined to be occupational or vocational in nature unless that work is specifically approved as part of the Bachelor of Science in Applied Scie nce program or approved by the academic department of the student's major.

The admission of Florida community/state college A.A. transfer st udents is governed by the articulation agreement between state universities and public community/state colleges in Florida. Undergraduate transfer students who have not earned the A. A. degree from a Florida publ ic institution or who have attended another college after receipt of the A.A. must meet the following requirements to be considered for admission; however, satisfying these minimum requirements does not guarantee admission: 1.Be in good standing having at least a 2.0 as calculated by USF St. Pete rsburg and eligible to return to the last regionally accredited institution attended as a degree-seeking student; 2.

Admissions and Related Matters19 Students Entering the Florida College System Planning to Finish their Degrees at USF St. Petersburg High school graduates planning to start their college education at a Florida comm unity/state college should confer with the community/state college counselor and ask that their acad emic program be planned with the assistance of the USF St. Petersburg Undergraduate Catalog. This catalog explicitly describes the undergraduate program requirements and Florida's common prerequisites that sh ould be followed to ensure maximum ea se of transfer in to the students' upper-level programs on a par with their native USF St. Petersburg counterparts. An articulation agreement, in effect si nce April 13, 1971, and later adopted by the Florida Legislature in statute form as Florida law, governs an effective and orde rly transfer of Florida College System st udents into the State University System (SUS). The agreement defines and establishes the Associate in Arts degree from a Florida State College as the basis for all articulation rights. Among these guarantees, the following are central to the transfer process: A.A. graduates will be granted admission to a university within the SUS but not necessarily to the university or program of choice. A.A. graduates will have the same opportunity to enroll in a university limited access program as the native university student. Upon transferring to a publ ic university in the Florida SUS, A.A. gr aduates will be awarded at least 60 credit hours towards the baccalaureate degree, exclusive of occupational courses and basic required physical education courses. Credits that are part of the A.A. degree earned th rough articulated acceleration mechanisms, such as Advanced International Certificate of Education, Ad vanced Placement, dual enrollment, International Baccalaureate, early admission and credit by exam will be transferable to the stat e university. Such credit needs to be received directly from the credit-granting agency. As participants in the Statewide Course Numbering Sy stem, receiving institutions must accept all courses taken at the transfer institution if the courses at each institution have the same prefix and the same last three digits of th e course number. The university catalog in effect the year the A.A. degree student first enrolled at the community/state college will remain in effect for th e student's entire program, provided the student maintains continuous enrollment as defined in that catalog. Once a student has completed the general education core and this fact is noted on the transcript, regardless of whether or not an A.A. degree is awarded, no ot her state university or community college to which the student may transfer can require additional courses to the general education core. Included in these transfer guarantees is the right of appeal . Students may appeal to the university and to the Statewide Articulation Coordi nating Committee Evaluation of Transfer Credit The receipt and evaluation of transfer cr edit is the responsibility of the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will evaluate the acceptability of total credits transferable to the University. The college of the student's major will assign equivalent courses in de termining which courses are applicable toward a specific degree at the University. In some instan ces, exact course equivalents will also be determined by other colleges that offer the same or similar courses as part of their programs of study. Transfer students should be prepared with personal copies of their transcripts of all past course work to di scuss advisement and placement with the appropriate academic advisor and should contact the college of their major soon af ter registration so that an official evaluation may be completed. USF St. Petersburg will consider credits only from those in stitutions accredited by one of the regional accrediting agencies/commissions* at the time the credits are earned. (See * below for agencies recognized by USF St. Petersburg.) Credits earned at an institution that is currently in \"candi dacy\" status will not be considered for transfer credit until such time as the awarding institution receives full accreditat ion. Courses approved for transfer by the Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS) from non-regionally accredited instit utions will be considered for transfer credit the same as credits from regionally accredited institutions if the course is offered at USF St. Petersburg. USF St. Petersburg reserves the right to deny credit for specific courses. USF St. Petersburg does not award transfer credit from institutions that it determines to be occupati onal, college preparatory/remedi al or vocational in nature except for work that is specifically approved as part of th e Bachelor of Science in Applied Science program or approved by the academic department of the student's major. A course-by-course transfer credit evaluation will be done fo r all out-of-state and private in -state A.A. degree holders. Effective Fall Quarter 1976, all courses from a Florida commu nity or state college/university bearing the same State Common Course prefix and last three numbers as a USF St. Pe tersburg course are automati cally transferred Transfer 20Admissions and Related Matters students may not be required to repeat these courses unless a college age-of-r ecord policy is involved. That same automatic transferability of cr edits applies to courses completed at non-regi onally accredited institutions that have been specifically approved by the SCNS. Excluded are graduate courses, studio courses in art, internships, practica, and performing arts courses. All undergraduate degree programs at USF St. Petersburg require a minimum of 48 hours of upper-level. This policy does not affect approved articulated programs based on the A.S. degree. For information regarding specific articulated A.S. degree programs, consult the USF St. Petersbu rg Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Credit will not be awarded for GED tests. Military service school courses will be evaluated with reference to the reco mmendation of the American Council of Education when official credentials have been presented. Such recommendation, however, is not binding upon the University. For ROTC and military science courses taken after Fall Quar ter 1975, the maximum credit will vary with each college. A student must confer with a college advisor to determine the acceptability for his/her major. ROTC and military science taken prior to Fall 1975 are not acceptable for transfer credit. A maximum of 45 semester hours of College Level Examinatio n Program (subject and general examinations) credits can be accepted for transfer credit. A maximum of 30 semester hours of extension, corresponden ce, and military service education credits can be applied toward a degree. Grades earned in transferred courses are not computed in th e student's USF St. Petersburg GPA except for the purposes of admission to limited access programs, the awarding of honors at graduation, and cl ass ranking of baccalaureate students. International credentials must be evaluate d by an independent evaluation service with associated costs to be paid by the student. A list of independent eval uation services is available at http://www.usfsp.edu/undergradua te-admissions/in ternational/. A continuously enrolled USF St. Petersburg degree-seeking st udent must obtain pr ior written approval from the college of the student's major in order for courses taken at other regi onally-accredited institutions to be applied to the USF St. Petersburg degree program. *Accrediting Agencies/Commissions: New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Co mmission on Institutions of Higher Learning Middle States Association of Colleges and Second ary Schools, Commission on Higher Education North Central Association of Colleges and Schools; Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges Southern Association of Colleges an d Schools, Commission on Colleges Western Association of Schools and Colleges, Accred iting Commission for Senior Colleges and Accrediting Commission for Junior Colleges.

Failure to meet these conditions result s in permanent academic dismissal from the University. Applicants admitted on a provisional basis must submit an y requested missing credentials, such as official final transcripts or test scores that substant iate eligibility for admission, before a second registration will be permitted. USF System Admission Criteria vs . Differential Admission Criteria Undergraduate students are admitted to USF St. Petersbu rg based on state university system admission criteria. Differential admission criteria, which are higher than the sy stem admission criteria, are required for admission to USF Tampa. Students admitted to USF Tampa may register fo r classes offered by any US F System institution or campus. Students admitted to USF St. Petersburg or USF Sarasota-Manatee, who do not meet the differential criteria are restricted from changing their home campus or registering for courses offered by USF Tampa until they achieve the required academic credentials. Students may apply to their Academic Advisor to remove the registration restriction by submitting a Change of Institution Form , which will allow the students to take courses of fered by any USF institution, when they have a cumulative postsecondary GPA that meets the curr ent transfer admission criteria for USF Tampa. A freshman who does not meet the differential admission cr iteria must earn at least 24 credit hours and earn a 2.5 cumulative GPA. A transfer student who does not meet the di fferential admission criteria must earn at least 60 credit hours and have a 2.5 cumulative GPA to have access to courses offered at all US F institutions. Any exceptions must be requested on a course-by-course basis and will be approved only when the course is requ ired for on-time progression toward degree for the student. Requests for exceptions mu st be initiated through the academic advisor at the home institution or campus and must be approved by the Dean of the appropriate college at USF Tampa. Admission Denials An undergraduate applicant who is denied admission may be el igible to appeal and will be advised of applicable appeal procedures by the Department of Enrollment and Marketing Services.

The University may refuse admission to a student whose record shows previous misconduct not in the best interest of citizens of the Un iversity community. 22Admissions and Related Matters Receipt of final, official credentials that fail to substantiate eligibility will result in rescission of admission, reclassification to non-degree status for the initial term of enrollment, an d denial of continued enrollment in subsequent terms Likewise, failure on the part of the student to provide final, official cr edentials by the start of the initial term of enrollment may result in similar actions. Required Summer Term Attendance All students entering the Univer sity with fewer than 60 seme ster hours of college level academic work are required to earn at least 9 semester hours during one or more Summer terms prior to graduation. Required Orientation Prior to beginning classes, all new under graduate students (freshme n and transfers) are required to participate in an Orientation program at USF St. Petersbu rg. (Former USF System students are exempt from this requirement.) This program is designed to help new students become acquainted with the University , choose courses, regi ster for classes, and complete all other necessary procedures. New students receive Orientation/Academic Advising/ Registration information after admission.

Limited Access Programs Undergraduates seeking entrance to limited access degree programs must meet special program requirements in addition to requirements for admission to the University. Wh ile many limited access programs admit students only at the junior level, some programs admit students for the freshman or sophomore years. The admission criteria and procedures for limited access programs at USF St. Petersburg furnish eq ual access to A.A. degree holder s from Florida public state colleges, transfers from other SUS institutions, and US F St. Petersburg students of equivalent status. Transfer applicants with 60 or more transferable semester hours who are seeking admission to limited access programs must meet the grade point average requirement specified by the program to be eligible for admission to USF St. Petersburg. Transfer applicants with 30 to 59 transferable semester hours who are seeking admission to certain limited access programs may also be required to meet the grade poin t average requirements necessary for eventual admission to such degree programs. The USF System, with approval of the Board of Governors an d the Articulation Coordinating Committee, has established the following undergraduate programs as limited access: Mass Communications with Journalism and Media Studies Concentration; all programs in the Colle ge of Business except Affiliated Econom ics; all programs in the College of Education; and the program in Graphic Design. The admissions requirements for these programs may be found with other program information in appropriat e sections of this catalog. Other Admission Categories Transient Applicants An undergraduate transient student is on e who comes to the Universi ty from another regionally accredited institution and wishes to take courses at USF St. Petersburg for one term only before returning to the parent institution. Transient students may enroll at USF St. Petersburg as non-degree-seeking students. Transient students who wish to take US F St. Petersburg courses MUST HAVE PRIO R WRITTEN APPROVAL from their college Academic Advisor to receive credit for courses taken. The Transient Student/Cross Enrollmen t form should be used for this purpose. USF St. Petersburg Cross Enrollment - Transient Enrollment Cross Enrollment is approved only when coursework, critical to tracking for graduation is not available at USFSP. Students submit for cross enrollment appr oval through Florida Virtual Campus at www.flvc.org . Students must consult with and receive approval from their Academic Advisor to cross enroll. Students may not be cross-enrolled at another institution during their first term of enrollment at USFSP. Transient study is typically approved in the summer semester when students le ave the USFSP service area but wish to continue in coursework toward their degree requirements at another regionally accredited institution. One semester must be completed at USFSP prior to becoming a transient st udent. Students should consult with and receive approval from their Academic Advisor regarding residency requirements prior to requesting transient enrollment. Admissions and Related Matters23 Cross enrollment and transient enrollment ca n affect eligibility for financial aid and the ability to register for USFSP courses, particularly during the first term of enrollment. Students seeking cr oss enrollment or transient enrollment are strongly encouraged to consult with the Office of Financial Aid regarding the potential impact. Credit hours taken under cross enrollment or transient enrollm ent will apply toward graduation only if prior approval was received from the student's USFSP Academic Advisor. The grade point average obtained under transient enrollment or cross enrollment will not transfer toward the USFSP institutional grade point average. Non-Degree-Seeking Student Non-degree-seeking student enrollment is on a space-available basis and has been established for those individuals who, while not desirous of earning a degree, would like to enroll in all levels of university course s. Teachers needing to take courses for certification purposes, high school students (w ith the permission of their re spective guidance counselor), individuals desirous of taking courses fo r self-enrichment, and senior citizens are examples of those eligible to utilize this enrollment method. Former USF system undergrad uate degree-seeking students may only enroll as non-degree-seeking students if they have completed their previous degree program or earned an equivalent degree at another institution. Should the latter be the case, an official transcript (reflecting the degree) from that institution must be sent to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions prior to registration. Individuals enrolling as non-degree-seeking students who plan to make formal application to the University may not apply more than 14 semester hours toward an undergraduate degree. Applicants denied admission to USF St. Petersburg as degree-seeking undergraduates may not enroll as non-degree-seeking students. Performance in courses taken in this category will not qualify an applicant for admission as a degree-seeking student. A non-degree-seeking student who has been dismissed from any USF System institution is not eligible for admission to USF St. Petersburg as a degree-seeking student at the underg raduate level. If extenuating circumstances contributed to the academic dismissal and the student meets other admissions requirements, a request for waiver of this rule may be submitted to the Faculty Committee on St udent Admissions. This rule does not apply to a student who has earned a degree from a regionally-accredited institut ion subsequent to academic dismissal. Non-degree-seeking students are subject to the same academ ic policies as undergraduate degree-seeking students and must adhere to deadline dates publishe d in the University Schedule of Classes. Non-degree-seeking students are not eligible to receive University honors or participate in the USF St. Petersburg/Flori da Public Community College cross-registration program. Non-degree-seeking students also are not eligible to receiv e financial aid. Non-degree-seeking students are subject to the academic probation and dismissal policy listed in this catalog. Potential no n-degree-seeking students should also refer to the section of the catalog of the college(s) offering the course(s) of interest to them to determine whether any special college requirements exist th at must be met prior to enrolling. NOTE: Prior to registering for classes, all students born after 1956 are required to present documentation of proof of immunity to MEASLES (Rubeola) and RUBELLA (German Measles). It is further required that all students must present proof of immunity to Hepatitis B and Meningitis or decline immunization by signature. (See Immunization Policy .) Readmission (Former Students Returning) A former student returning (FSR) is any degree-seeking undergraduate student who has not earned his/her degree, has not been enrolled at USFSP in any of the last three terms, and wish es to re-enroll in the Un iversity. Former students returning must be readmitt ed to the University. In order to be considered for readmission, a former student should file a new application for admission with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by the deadline indicated on the web site for the term of requested re-entry. A new application fee is required. The residency affidavit must be completed and residency status will be reassessed. (Former College of Education majors must contact the College of Education Academic Advisor for additional readmission requirements.)

Students who have atte nded one or more institutions since their last enrollment 24Admissions and Related Matters must request official transcripts of all work attempted at the other institution(s) be sent to the USF St. Petersburg's Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Ac ceptability of transfer credits toward completion of US F St. Petersburg degree programs will be determined by the college of the student's major. FSRs who have been readmitted are not required to part icipate in Orientation. Students must meet with their academic advisor for course selection. Transient students and non-degree-seeking students are not considered FSRs. These students who wish to enter as degree-seeking students must file an application with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions prior to the published application deadline listed at http:// www.usfsp.edu/undergraduate-admissions/. A student may not work on a second undergraduate degree if he/she has been accepted into a graduate program. Initial Florida Residency Classification For Tuition Purposes This notice summarizes the provisions of Florida Statutes an d University Policy/ Procedure concerning Florida residency for tuition purposes. In determining residency classification, students fa ll into one of two categories. They are either (1) Independent students who are students not claimed on parent's or legal guardian's federal income tax statement or whose parents do not provide 50% or more of their support or (2) Dependent students who are students younger than 24 who are claimed as dependents by parent or legal guar dian on federal income tax statement or whose parents provide 50% or more of their support. As per criteria set forth in Section 1009. 21 of the Florida Statutes, a U.S. citize n/permanent resident alien/independent student or a dependent student's parent/legal guardian has established and maintained a LEGAL Florida residence for at least twelve (12) months before the fi rst day of classes of the term for whic h Florida residency status is sought. The student who comes to Florida to enroll full-time in a Florid a higher education institution as an out-of-state resident and continuously enrolls in a Florida institution will not no rmally meet the Florida residency requirement for in-state tuition regardless of the le ngth of time enrolled. USF St. Petersburg is required to obtain documentation of 12-months legal residence in Florida before a student is classified as a Florida resident for tuition purposes. A st udent must request Florida residency in writing and submit supporting documents at least 12 months before the first day of classes of the term for which Florida residency is sought. The following are acceptable, non-conclusi ve means of establishing a legal residence in Florida. Two documents must be dated or issued at least 12 months befo re the first day of classes of the term for which Florida residency is sought. Required Documentation At least one of the two necessary docume nts submitted must be from this list: Florida Driver's License Florida Voter Registration Card Florida vehicle registration State of Florida Identification Card Proof of a permanent Florida home which is occupied as your primary residence Proof of a Florida homestead exemption Proof of permanent- full-time employment in Florida (one or more jobs for at least 30 hours per week for 12-month period; official employer letterhead required). Secondary Documentation A declaration of domicile in Florida (the date that the Clerk of Circuit Court notes the declaration was established shall be 12 months prior to the start date for the term in which the applicant applies for admission consideration A Florida professional occupational license Proof of Florida-based ch aritable or professional organization membership Documents of evidence of Florida incorporation Documents supporting the applicant's clai m of Florida residence status includ ing, but not limited to, proof of 12 consecutive months of payment of utility bills, a lease ag reement or official state, Federal or court documents depicting Florida legal ties PLEASE NOTE: Rental receipts, leases, employment records, tax returns and school/college records are NOT evidence of establishing a legal Florida residence. Students who are de pendent on out-of-state parent s or who come to Florida for educational purposes are generally ineligib le for reclassification to Florida status . In rare cases, the law allows some students (e.g., military, public school teachers, etc.) who do not meet the basic requirements to be classified as Florida residents for tuition purposes. For more information about exceptional categories, contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Admissions and Related Matters25 Students who do not provide appropriate supporting documents to established their initial residency classification by the first day of classes of their first semester of enrollment have until th e last day of classes of their first semester (prior to final examinations) to finalize their residency for tuition purposes. Additional Initial Residency Classification Categories Out-of-State Veterans Tuition Exemption : HB 7015-Florida GI Bill, created the \"Congressman C.W. Bill Young Tuition Waiver Program.\" This will waive out-of-state tuition fees fo r honorably discharged veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces, Reserves, or National Guard who physically reside in Florida while enrolled at a Florida state university. Persons who are entitled to and use educational assistance provided by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs also qualify for this waiver if they physically reside in Florida while enrolled at the university in any term beginning after July 1, 2015. Tuition and fees charged to a veteran or person who qualifie s for the out-of-state fee waiver under this section may not exceed the tuition and fees charged to a resident student enrolled in the same program. Out of State Waiver Eligibility Process: Bill HB 851-Postsecondary Education Tuition and Fees is a law that allows students, including but not limited undocumented students wh o meet certain guidelines, to receive waivers to attend college at Florida resident tuition rates. These non-resident students, who do not have suffic ient ties to Florida as set forth under Florida School Code (SB-20E) section 1009.21, Fl orida Statutes, may qualify for an out-of-state tuition waiver. Child Protection & Welfare Tuition Exemption: Section 402.403, Florida Statutes, es tablished the Child Protection and Child Welfare Personnel Tuition Exemption Program for the purpose of recruiting and retaining high-performing individuals who are employed as child protection and ch ild welfare personnel. For th ose personnel who meet the requirements of the program up to 6 credit hours of course s per term are exempt from the payment of tuition and fees at a Florida state university.

Students can also find specific information about types of aid available, college affordability, verification process, enrollment ch anges, as well as financial aid forms. For more detailed information about an individual student acco unt, we encourage students to become very familiar with the \"Financial Aid\" tab in OASIS, our on line student information system. Through OA SIS, students can also view the status of their financial aid, see any needed documents to complete their financial aid file, and see any awards offered. Prior to any payment of financial aid funds, students will need to complete the online Terms and Conditions annually. Keep in mind that most types of financial aid require a minimum of half-time enrollment to disburse (6 Undergraduate Credit Hours for Undergraduate Students, and 5 Gradua te Credit Hours for Graduate Students). Throughout the year, University Scholarships & Financial ai d Services (USF System), and USF St. Petersburg Office of Financial Aid & Scholarships (Campus specific) communicates important information regarding financial aid via the official USF email address located under the \"Personal\" tab in OASIS. Theref ore, it is extremely important that students ensure that they are reading these emails on a regular basis. APPLY : The first step in obtaining financial aid is filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at http://www.fafsa.gov . Be sure to list school code #009016 or #001537, to ensure USFSP receives an electronic copy of your information. Students, and for dependent students, th eir parents as well, will need to apply for a Federal Pin number at http://www.pin.ed.gov , then complete and subm it the FAFSA online at http://www.fafsa.gov PRIORITY FILING DATE by MARCH 1st : Since many programs are funded on a limited basis, it is an advantage to apply early. Meeting the priority date allows a student the best opportunity to be considered for the maximum amounts and types of aid possible, since many programs are funded on a limited basis. Complete the FAFSA annually between January 1st and March 1st for the 2016-2017 academic year. Please note: There will be a change in the 2017-2018 FAFSA priority date (to be announced). The 17-18 FAFSA will be available October 1, 2016 and will use the same 2015 tax information as the 16-17 FAFSA. Scholarships are another financial aid option for incoming students. See the \"Scholarships\" section below. DEFERMENTS : Tuition, Housing and Meal Plan Deferments are au tomatically posted for qualified financial aid appli- cations. Please note that tuition deferments and housing deferments have different qualifications. A tuition deferment will not automatically qualify the student fo r a deferment of housing charges or meal plan charges. Be sure to check the \"My Requirements, Bookstore Authorizations, and Deferments\" li nk in the Financial Aid tab of OASIS PRIOR TO the start of classes (each term) to see if which deferments have b een posted and to see the expiration date(s) for those de- ferment(s). Tuition deferments are provided to Degree-seeking, Financia l Aid students enrolled at least half-time. A tuition de- ferment prevents cancelation of registration for non-paymen t of fees and temporarily prev ents assessment of the late payment fee. Financial aid is disbursed after drop/add, and a pplied against charges on the student account. If a refund results, a check or e-deposit is issued for any remaining leftover funds. Avoid paying a late payment fee by paying any remaining balance before the deferment deadline. Since tuition deferments prevent cancelation for non-payment, a student must officially withdraw from a ll classes by the end of drop/add week to be relieved of liability to pay and to ensure that tuition is not later paid by disbursed financial aid. Students must be making Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) to receive a tuition deferment. Housing Deferments are provided to students wh o qualify for Tuition Deferments, and who have accepted a specific amount of financial aid to ensure housing contracts will be covered by incoming financial aid. Contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships each year for the amounts of a ccepted financial aid required to qualify for both in-state and out-of-state students. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS for FINANCIAL AID STUDENTS : Federal regulations require all schools partici- pating in Title IV federal financial aid programs to have a Sa tisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy that confirms to the two requirements: Qualitative and Quantitati ve detailed on the financial aid web page: http://www.usf.edu/financial-aid/sap/index.aspx . These requirements apply to all students as one determinant of eligibility for financial aid. A student's satisfactory academic progress is based on their entire academic record , at all schools attended, regardless of whether the student received financial aid or not. SAP is calculated each semester after grades have been posted to academic history by the registrar. One week after the last day of final exams is a good time to check your status. If your SAP status is ineligible, FINANCIAL AID AND SCHOLARSHIPS Financial Aid and Scholarships27 you will not qualify for a tuition deferment and must pay by the payment deadline (end of drop/add, which is the fifth day of classes) or your re gistration will be canceled. WITHDRAWAL and FINANCIAL AID: If you withdraw from USFSP before the en d of a semester, either officially or un- officially, you may be required to repay all or a portion of the aid you received. For detailed information on the Federal Return of Title IV Fund s requirement, go to http://usfweb2.usf.edu/finaid/withdraw.aspx 28Scholarships Scholarships are administered by a number of different offices within the University.

Military and Veterans Success Center (MVSC) USF St Petersburg's Military and Veterans Success Center opened its doors to student veterans in November 2015. The mission of the MVSC is directly aligned with the mission of the USF Office of Veterans Success. The primary goal of both is to provide a seamless transition for our nation's veterans from military to collegiate life by enhancing personal development and academic success. The MVSC is a communal space where student veterans gather daily to share transitional strategies, study, network, host meetings of the Student Veterans Organization (https://orgsync.com/97272/chapter ), and reintegrate in civilian life. Resources include peer counselors; access to employment counseling; computers and free printing; lounge space with free coffee and snacks; and quiet spaces. The MVSC is located in The Terrace (TER) 301/302. Please contact us at va@usfsp.edu or call (727) 873-4467. Apply Students who may be eligible for benefits are urged to cont act the Military and Veterans Success Center to speak with a peer counselor.

Bill Young Tuition Waiver Program (Chapter 1009.26, Section 36, Subsecti on (12)(a) Florida Statutes) to waive the out-of-state fee portion of their tuition. Visit our US F System webpage for more information: http://www.usf.edu/student-a ffairs/veterans/programs/out- of-state-tuition-waiver.aspx Tuition Deferment The tuition deferment program for Veterans is set up throug h USF and the VA. Due to VA payments being delayed at times, a tuition deferment gives the stud ent and the VA an extra 60 days past th e start of the semester to pay for a student's tuition and fees. As long as the Clockwork Education Benefit Request is submitted by 4:50 pm on the last day of add/drop week (the first week of classes), a veteran or dependent of a veteran stud ent will receive a tuition de- ferment.

Academic Regulations and Information Semester System USFSP operates on a semester system. Semesters begin in August and January with Summer Sessions beginning in May and June. See Academic Calendar website ( http://www.usfsp.edu/academic-calendar/ ) for appropriate dates. Academic Load The maximum load of an undergraduate student is 18 hours (Fall & Spring semesters) and 14 hours (Summer Term) unless approval is received from the dean or an authorized repr esentative of the student's college. Students classified as Undecided must receive approval from the freshman/sophomore advisors in the Advising Cent er. In the fall or Spring Semester, 12 hours is the minimum load for an unde rgraduate student to be considered as full-time. Full-time Undergraduate Student Definition - Summer Term Sessions \"A\" & \"B\" (6 weeks) For: Academic purposes - 6 hours or more each session For: Financial aid - Students must enroll for 12 hours (undergraduate) in any combination of Sessions \"A,\" \"B\", and \"C.\" Session \"C\" (10 weeks) For: Academic purposes - 9 hours or more For: Financial aid - Students must enroll for 12 hours (undergraduate) in any combination of Sessions \"A,\" \"B\", and \"C.\" Students receiving Veterans Administration benefits shou ld confirm their Summer Term enrollment with the USFSP Military and Veterans Success Center. Undergraduates may not enroll in 6000-leve l courses or higher without approval of the college/department in which the course is offered. Availability of Courses USFSP does not commit itself to offer all the courses, programs, and majors listed in this catalog unless there is sufficient demand to justify them. Some courses, for example, may be offered only in alternate seme sters or years, or even less frequently if there is little demand. Excess Credit Hour Surcharge (USF Regulation 4.0102) In 2009, the Florida Legislature implemented Section 1009.286, Fl orida Statutes to encourage students to complete their baccalaureate degree as quickly and effici ently as possible. It established what is commonly referred to as an \"Excess Credit Hour Surcharge.\" The provisions of this sect ion became effective for students who entered a Florida state/community college or a Florida stat e university for the first time in the 2009-2010 academic year and thereafter. The bill requires universities to add a surcharge to each credit hour taken in excess of the total hours calculated, based on a percentage defined in law. See the following table: Students entering as FTIC SUS (First time in college State University System of Florida) or FTIC FCS (First time in college Florida College System) Fees to be Charged Prior to Fall 2009 NONE 38 Academic Policies and Procedures Fall 2009 -Summer 2011 50% for credits above 120% of total program hours Fall 2011-Summer 2012 100% for credits above 115% of total program hours Fall 2012 and thereafter 100% for credits above 110% of total program hours The surcharge is assessed only on the tuition portion of the se mester hour cost, not on the fees. The number of total program hours required for the baccalaureate degree will be id entified by the student's declared major. This is typ- ically 120 semester hours, although, some programs have been approved to requ ire more than 120 semester hours. Note: No institution may waive the excess hours surchar ge as the language of the statute is mandatory. Transfer of Credit to USF St. Petersburg USFSP will accept credits only from those institutions ac credited by one of the accrediting agencies/commissions recognized by USFSP. However, USFSP reserves the right to de ny credit for specific courses. The receipt and evaluation of total transfer credit are the responsi bility of the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. The college of the student's major will determine which courses are a pplicable toward a specific degree an d will assign equivalent courses (see Evaluation of Tran sfer of Credit under Admi ssions and Related Matters). USFSP subscribes fully to all of the pr ovisions of the statewide Articulation Agreement (Rule 6A-10.024) and strongly recommends that students complete the Associate in Arts cert ificate before transferring. A ll transfer students should also refer to other entries about undergraduate transfers in the Admissions section of this catalog. Award of Credit for On-line Coursework Policy 10-071 8/25/2015 Undergraduate students who are admitted to the University of South Florida System (\"USF System\") and who have completed on-line college-level courses prior to initial en rollment in undergraduate education may request that the university evaluate that work to dete rmine if credit might be awarded. Award of credit for work must meet the following criteria: USF System Faculty have determined the on-line course and learning outcomes to be comparable to a course offered at the institution; On-line courses meet the quality and accreditatio n standards intended for a transfer course; and The subject area faculty, have determined that the on-line course is relevant to the st udent's intended program of study. Students wishing to have such on-line coursework evaluated for the purpose of receiving credit should inform Office of Undergraduate Studies, or the Chief Academic Officer at thei r regional institutions, upon being admitted but prior to enrolling in classes at the university. If credit for the on-l ine coursework was awarded by another institution of higher education the student must submit an official transcript refl ecting the award of credit an d the transferability of that work will be determined with the same processes and criteria for other transferred courses, including coursework recommended for credit by the American Council on Education (ACE). If the on-line college coursework did not result in credit awarded by the institution offering the on-line course or if the transferab ility of the work is not clear, the stu- dents must provide the following information for evaluation of the work by qualified faculty: A syllabus for the course; Credentials of the facult y teaching the course; Course objectives and learning outcomes for the course; and Other information requested by the subject area faculty memb er to determine demonstrated mastery of course learning outcomes and competencies. Former Student Returning The Office of Admissions will evaluate the acceptability of tr ansfer credits taken at regionally-accredited institutions since last enrolled at a USF System institution. The colle ge of the student's major wi ll determine which courses are applicable for his/her major. In some instances, exact course equivalents will also be dete rmined by other colleges that offer the same or similar course(s) as a part of their programs of study. Academic Policies and Procedures39 Continuously Enrolled Degree-Seeking Student The Office of Admissions will determine the acceptability of transfer credits for continuing, degree-seeking students who take courses at regionally accredited institutions. However, PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL MUST BE OBTAINED from the student's academic advisor if these credits are to be a pplicable to the USFSP degree program. A properly-executed Transient Student form or Cr oss Enrollment form should be used for this purpose. Registration for Admitted Degree-Seeking Students Continuing degree-seeking students register by appointmen t for their next term's course s during the preceding term, either on-line or in-person. Appointmen t times and instructions for all registration periods may be viewed on the USF System's OASIS on-line schedule of classes for the appropriate term.

A written, dated statement signed by a phys ician on his/her stationery that specifies the date seen and stating that the person has had an illness characterized by a generalized rash lasting three (3) or more days, a fever of 101 Fahrenheit or greater, a cough, and conjunc- tivitis, and, in the physician's opinion, is diagnosed to have had the 10 day measles (rubeola). 2. RUBELLA: a. Medical documentation of immunization with live rubella virus vaccine on, or after, the first birthday. Persons born before 1957 may be consid ered to have had a natural infection, and therefore meet the proof of immunity requiremen t. The documented date of immunization for rubella should indicate the day, month, and year. However, month and year will suffice if the month and year indicate that the immunization was given at least 13 months after the month of birth, OR b. Copy of laboratory (serol ogic) evidence of ru bella immunity (IgG rubella titer). 3. HEPATITIS B: a. Medical documentation of immunization with 3 doses of Hepatitis B vaccine, OR b. Copy of laboratory (serologic) evidence of Hepatitis B immunity (anti-HBs titer), OR c. Signed declination (waiver) of the vaccine. 4. MENINGITIS: a. Medical documentation of immunization with Meningitis vaccine at age 16 or later, OR b. Signed declination (waiver) of the vaccine. E. EXEMPTIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED AS FOLLOWS: 1. RELIGIOUS: Students may request an exemption due to religious beliefs from the general immunization requirements by contacting USF Student Health Services. 2. MEDICAL: Requests for temporary or permanent medical exemptions must be submitted to USF Student Health Services by the attending physician and must include reason for exemption and duration of exemption. 3. ON-LINE COURSES: Students registered in 100% on-l ine courses may be exempt from the requirements of this Po licy. However, if a student regist ers for any on-campus course at any time, the immunization requirements of this Policy will be in effe ct for all future courses. In the event of a disease outbreak, students exempted from immunization requirements may be re-quested by the University, at the direction of public health officials, to show titer Proof of Immunity, become immunized, or remain off campus for the du ration of the outbreak. All requests for exemp- tions will be reviewed to ensure consistency in application. F. CONSEQUENCES: Students who fail to comply with the requirements as stated above will be blocked from registration, may be referred to Student Rights and Responsibilities, restricted from on-campus housing assignment, and/or may be subject to a registration hold. In specific circumstances a temporary override may be granted, however, vaccination requirements must be completed before further registration in sub-sequent terms will be permitted and current registra tion may be suspended if any deficiency in im- munization status is identified.

Academic Policies and Procedures41 SUS Health Insurance Requirement for International Students The State University System of Florida requ ires that all international students have medical insurance in order to register for classes within the USF System. Academic Advising for Undergraduate Students USFSP seeks to guide all students in sele cting programs and courses best suited to their personal abilities, educational interests, and career objectives. Students who have been ad mitted to the University shou ld meet regularly, by ap- pointment, with their Academic Adviser in the Academic Advising Center locate d in Davis Hall 134. This Center also serves as an initial point of contact for non-admitted, pr ospective, and/or non-degree seeking students who need in- formation about the Universi ty's academic structure. All students are encouraged to establish an advising relationsh ip with the Academic Advising Center and periodically visit their advisors to keep abreast of any policy, procedure, or curriculum changes that may affect them. In fact, some colleges require advisor approval of studen t programs each semester. It is important for students to keep in mind that, although the University pr ovides advising services to assist students wi th academic planning, it is each student's re- sponsibility to see that all gr aduation requirements are met. Initial Advising and Registration It is necessary that all students meet with their academic advisors prior to first-class registration. The purpose of this initial contact is to provide the advising unit with routine in formation to assist advisors in collecting and maintaining the necessary records to assure the student' s proper progress toward education goals. Transfer students should bring an unofficial or student copy of their transcript(s) to this advising session. Declaration of Major Some first-year students enter the univer sity undecided about their career plans and intended majors. Many of the more than 24 undergraduate majors at USFSP allow students consid erable options in their early course choices. Conversely, many other majors, and often the most popular majors, requir e completion of particular courses within the first two years. In fields, such as education, business, and graphic design, students must satisfy state mandated course prereq- uisites and complete specific general education courses duri ng the first two years to be admitted to those major as juniors and to allow graduation on a timely basis. It clearly is advantageous for students to make early decision s about their majors to be on track and to remain on-track toward their degrees and to graduate in a timely manner. Students are urged to declare a major upon entry to the university. All students must be officially declared in a major or a pre-major before they complete 36 credits. Be ginning Fall Se- mester 2005, Continuing students who will have completed 36 or more credits will not be allowed to register for further credit coursework at the university until they have declared a major or pre-major. Transfer students must declare their majors upon entry to the university. Many resources are made available by the university to assist students in making career decisions an d choosing their majors. Information about these resources is readily available from academic advisors. Advising for Limited Access Programs Students are cautioned that admission to the University does not imply admission to all the programs and courses offered by the individual colleges; this is espe cially true with respect to colleges with programs designated as limited-access. Colleges such as Business and Education, as well as, Mass Communications-Journalism and Media Studies, and Graphic Design programs within the College of Arts & Sciences have been designated as limited-access and require completion of certain prerequisites before a student may declare a major. It is important that students check the college sections of the catalog for program specific admission requirements. Stud ents planning to enter a limi ted-access program should be aware that their admission by the college may be denied or delayed and should be prepared with alternative plans of action. Course Attendance at First Class Meeting This policy was implemented so that USFSP may effectively ut ilize classroom space and to insure that all students have maximum opportunity to enroll in classes wher e demand exceeds availability of seats. Students are required to attend the first class meeting of every undergraduate course for which they registered. Names of students who register prior to the first day of the term ar e shown on the instructor's First Class Roll in Canvas for each course section. The First Day Class Roll is used by instructors to drop students who do not a ttend the first day of class. In accordance with USF System policy (10-006), instructors are required to take attendance on the first day of class and to drop students who do not attend th e first day of class. Students having extenuating circumstances beyond their 42 Academic Policies and Procedures control who are unable to attend the first class meet ing must notify the instru ctor or the department prior to the first class meeting to request waiver of the Fi rst Day Class Attendance requirement. Distance learning students must log on to their course(s) during the first five (5 ) weekdays from the calendar start date of their on-line course(s). Stud ents who are unable to log on due to circumstances beyond their control must notify the instructor(s) prior to the calendar start date of the course to request waiver of th e First Day Class attendance re- quirement. Instructors may i nitiate course deletions (drops) after the add/drop period if the instru ctor discovers that the student has not attended the first or any subsequent class meeting. When dropped for non-attendance, the student will be removed from the class roll and will not earn any grade or credit for the course. Although instructors are authorized to initiate this first-day drop, st udents are still fundamentally responsible for knowing the registration status of ea ch course on their schedule. To avoid fee liability and academic penalty, the student is responsible for insuring that he/she has dropped or been dropped from all undesired courses by 5:00 p.m. on the 5th day of classes. This policy is not applicable to courses in the following categories: Educational Outreach, Open University (TV), FEEDS Program, Community Experienti al Learning (CEL), Cooperative Education Trai ning, and courses that do not have regu- larly scheduled meeting days/times (such as, directed readin g or study, individual research, thesis, dissertation, in- ternship, practicums, etc.). Students are responsible for dropping undesired courses in these categories by 5:00 p.m. on the 5th day of classes to avoid fee liability and academic penalty. Please note that the Registrar's Office does not add students to any courses. Students are required to add their courses via OASIS during the add/drop period. Students who add a co urse during the add/drop period but after First Day Class Attendance has been submitted for that course are no lo nger subject to being dropped for non-attendance and are responsible for finalizing their schedule by the end of the add/drop period. General Attendance Only officially registered students or st udents approved to audit a class are entitled to attend class. Students are re- sponsible for being aware of all instructor -based and University issued attendance policies and the requirements of the Registrar for enrollment, add/drop and fee liability. Students are responsible for completing the academic requirements of each class as defined by the instructor and as set forth in each class syllabus. An in structor may make attendance mandatory and may impose penalties, includ ing failing a class, for excessive absences . It is university policy that student absences will be excused for military du ty, jury duty, and religious days (as se t forth in University policy 10-045). Ex- cused absences for other documented reasons may be allowed at the discretion of the instructor. Though excused, the student is responsible for completing all academic work, examinations, assignments and labs in a timely fashion. Procedures for Excused Absences and Make-up Work Students are expected to notify their instructors at the beginning of each academic term if they intend to be absent from a class or announced examination for the approved reason as noted above in accordance with this policy. In the event that a student is absent for one of these noted reasons on a day when the instructor collects work for purposes of grading (homework, quiz, etc.), the student shall be given a reasonable opportunity to make up such work or shall not have that work averaged into the student's grade, at the discretion of the instructor. If excused for an absence, the student is responsible for co mpleting all academic work, examinations, assignments, and labs within a period of time and in a manner deemed appropriate by the instructor. The manner for accommodating excused absences appropriately is in the hands of the inst ructor, but a student who is absent for an excused reason should not be at a disadvantage when compared to other students. The approved reasons for excused absences apply even if a student in a course has the op tion of dropping an assignment grade (e .g., dropping the lowest quiz score). Excused absences for other reasons may be allowed or de clined entirely at the discretion of the instructor. Even if individual absences are excused, excessive absenc es may threaten a student's satisfactory completion of a course. Absences may count from the first class meeting, incl uding for students who hope to add the class after the first day. Jury Duty The University respects the need for all ci tizens to serve on a jury when called to duty. If a student serves as a juror, class absences will be considered excused when the student provides advance notice to th e instructor, the instructor acknowledges the request, and the student provides written ve rification of jury selection and proof of service. It is important to note that excuse d absence only applies to physical presence , and not to the academic work missed. A student, though excused, is responsible for all academic wo rk, examinations, assignments and labs if applicable. These issues are unique to University students and clearly may pres ent undue hardship for a student to serve while enrolled in an active course of study. Academic Policies and Procedures43 Any potential student juror may notify the court of conflicts or undue hardship and request an excuse from service. The individual student must make the decision as to whether ju ry service will present an undue hardship and then take the affirmative action to request to be excused from service and may need to provide a written explanation to the court. If a student does not request to be excused and is selected to serve, the student may miss a prolonged period of time resulting in the inability to complete the academic requirements of classes. Documented Medical Attention for Illness Students are excused for absences from documented illnesses that require medical attention. While students should not attend class with infectious conditions, even if medical atte ntion is not sought, the decision to excuse absences from undocumented illnesses is at the discretion of the individual instructor. Considerat ion should also be given to students whose dependent children experience serious illness. Extended illnesses may interfere with the satisfactory completion of courses, and in such cases a student should drop the cour se by the posted \"drop without academic penalty\" deadline via OASIS. After the drop deadline, students may submit an Academic Regulations Committee (ARC) petition with proper documentation to drop a course or withdraw for medical reas ons. Students may find additional information through their college's ARC representative and on the Registrar's Office website, http://www.usfsp.edu/registrar/ . Early Notification of Instructor Requirement for University Sponsored Activities The University recognizes the importance of participation in University-sponsored activities such as music performances, athletic competition, and debate. It also recognizes that such participation may result in conflicts with scheduled class times. It is the responsibility of participating students to pr ovide a full list of anticipated conflicting days to instructors by the end of the first week of the term, and directors and advi sors of University activity pr ograms have an obligation to assist students with this task. Students are responsible for id entifying potential absences specific to a particular class; a general schedule for a team or ensemble does not satisfy this requirement. St udents should provid e instructors with addenda and changes to scheduled conflicts (e.g., end-of-sea son tournaments, newly scheduled events, or rescheduled events) as soon as they are available. Directors and advisors of University activity prog rams should consult with par- ticipating students prior to registration to help them choose courses that do not have excessive anticipated conflicts Religious Days The university has an official Attendance Policy for the Ob servance of Religious Days (University policy 10-045) which provides that all students, faculty, and st aff at the University have a right to expe ct that the University will reasonably accommodate their religious observances, practices and beliefs. Students are expected to attend classes and take examinations as determined by the University. The University will, at the beginning of each academic term, provide written notice of the class schedule and formal examination periods. The university, through its faculty, will make every attempt to schedule required cl asses and examinations in view of cus- tomarily observed religious holidays of those religious grou ps or communities comprising the University's constituency. No student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an ex amination at a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief. Students are expected to notify their instructors at the begi nning of each academic term or as provided in the course syllabus if they intend to be absent for a class or announ ced examination, in accordance with this policy. Students absent for religious reasons will be given reasonable opport unities to make up any work missed in the event that a student is absent for religious reasons on a day when the inst ructor collects work for purposes of grading (homework, pop quiz, etc.), the student shall be given a reasonable opportunity to make up such work or shall not have that work av- eraged into the student's grade at the discretion of the in structor. Any student who believes that he or she has been treated unfairly with regard to the above may seek review of a complaint through established University Academic Grievance Procedures (found in the Graduate and Undergraduat e Catalogs) and those provided by the University's Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity. Enrollment for Continuing Students and Schedule Changes Continuing students may register for classes while their de signated registration period (appointment) is open. The registration appointment is assigned to students based on th eir classification, GPA and earned hours. Students can view their appointment period on-line though OASIS or by cont acting their Academic Advisor. Some courses may require special approval from Academic Advising before they can be added. Students who register for the first time after their designated registration period will be subject to a late registration fee. PLEASE NOTE: Class days, times and room assignments are sub ject to change as late as the first scheduled day of classes. Students are responsible for verifying their schedule s on-line through OASIS prior to their first class meetings. Course Adds After a student has completed his/her registration during the designated registration period, he/she may add courses on a space-available basis until the add/drop deadline specified in the Academic Calendar. Deadlines for each term can be found here, http://www.usfsp.edu/ academic-calendar/ . 44 Academic Policies and Procedures Course Drops A student may also reduce their course load between the en d of the add/drop period and tenth week of the semester (except for summer sessions - see the Summer Schedule of Cla sses for dates). However, tuition and fees will be assessed for any course(s) dropped by the student after the add/dr op period. The student's permanent academic record will reflect a \"W\" grade for any course(s) dropped between the end of the add/drop period and tenth week of the semester. Under specific conditions, a refund of tuition and fees ma y be requested in writing from the Cashier's Office. See \"Refund of Tuition/Fees Payment and/or Release of Tuition/ Fees Liability\" under Financial Information for complete details. Effective fall 2011, all undergraduate studen ts will be limited to a total of five course drops while enrolled as a de- gree-seeking or non-degree seeking student within the USF Sy stem. The five course drops will be limited to three course drops for students with less than or equa l to 60 semester credit hours, and two co urse drops for students with more than 60 semester credit hours. Only in extenuating circumstances will approval be granted for mo re than five course drops. Appeals for additional course drops due to extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the Ac ademic Regulations Committee. Auditing Privileges and Fees A student who wishes to sit in on a class to review the course material may do so; however, the student is not allowed to take exams, earn grades, or receive credit. The student's stat us for that class is an audit and his/her presence in the classroom is as a listener. A student must register to audit courses during the la te registration period. No audit regis- trations are processed during the regular registration peri ods. Fees for audited courses are the same as for full en- rollment for credit courses, except out-of -state tuition is not charged. See University Schedule of Classes for detailed instructions and dates. Cancelation Before First Class Day Students may cancel their registration by notifying the Registra r's Office in writing prior to the first day of classes. If fees have already been paid, the student may reques t a full refund of fees fr om the Cashier's Office. Withdrawal A student may withdraw (drop all course s from their term schedule) from the University without academic penalty during the first ten weeks of any term (except for Summer Sessions). He/she must drop all of their courses on-line through OASIS or by petition through the Academic Regulations Committee. No entry is made on the permanent aca- demic record for withdrawals completed prior to the add/drop deadline. All subsequent wi thdrawals (through the tenth week of classes in the fall and Spring Semesters) are posted to the academic record with \"W\" grades assigned to the courses. After the tenth week of classes (fall and Spring Se mesters) students must go th rough the Academic Regulations Committee petition process to withdrawal from the University. Withdrawal deadli nes for the summer sessions are listed in the Academic Calendar and are publis hed in the Schedule of Classes for the Summer Term. Students who withdraw are not permitted to continue attending classes. Students who withdraw during the add/drop period as stated in the Academic Calendar may receive a full refund of fees paid in advance. All refunds must be re quested in writing from the Cashier's Of fice. No refund is allowed after this period except for specified reasons. See \"Refund of Tuition/Fees Payment and/or Release of Tuition/Fees Liability\" under Financial Informatio n for complete details. Repeat Course Surcharges Initiated by the Florida Legislature (H.B. 1545 of 1997) to reduce costs, all state universities must monitor under- graduate student progress and charge students the full cost of instruction for certain repeats of undergraduate courses. This policy became effective fall 1997 and requires USFSP to charge students a substant ial per-credit-hour surcharge when they attempt a course three or more times at any USF Sy stem institution, unless the course is specifically designed to be repeated or is required to be repeated by their majo r. Contact Academic Advising to verify if a course is re- peatable. Requirements to earn a passing or higher grade than previously earn ed in a course do not exempt the sur- charge. Students will be required to pay the surcharge in addition to the approp riate in-state or out-of-state tuition rates. It is important to note that a ll attempts count, including withdrawals af ter the first week of classes and courses with incomplete grades. The University may grant exceptions to this rule based on extenuating circumstances and financial hardship. However, the University may only approve one appeal per course. Th e exceptions included in the Statute are extenuating cir- cumstances and financial hardship and are defined as follows: Extenuating circumstances are those circ umstances determined by the University to be exceptional and beyond the control of the student and may include but not be limited to serious illness, documented medical condition preventing completion; death of an immediate family member, involunt ary call to active duty, unive rsity error, other emergency circumstances or extraordinary situations. The criteria used by the University for determining financial hardship should include, but not be limited to, qualification for federal need-based financial aid. Students with other documented financial hardships may also be considered. Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures45 The student must fill out a Fee Adjustment Request Form and in dicate the request is for a waiver of the repeat course surcharge. He/she must also submit a st atement that explains the request and pr ovide all documentation relating to it. The completed form with documentatio n should be submitted to the Registrar's Office for consideration. Transcripts Official transcripts which need to be mailed to a specific address may be ordered on-line through the student's OASIS account (currently enrolled students only ) or by completing the USFSP Transcript Request Form and bringing it to the Registrar's Office, BAY 102. Transcript requests not hand delive red to the Registrar's Office should be mailed with check or money order made payable to USF St. Petersburg to: USF St. Petersburg, Bayboro Hall 102 140 7th Avenue South, St. Petersburg, FL, 33701 Current USFSP students and USFSP students who were last enrolled fall 2006 or later may order a transcript by pre- senting the USFSP Transcript Request in-person at the Registra r's Office in BAY102 and receive it the same day. Students will need to show a photo ID before thei r official transcript will be released to them. Official transcripts for USFSP students who were last enrolled prior to Fall 2006 and other USF System students will be delivered by US Mail. Please allow adequate time for your transcript to arrive at the address specified. Official transcripts cost $10.00 each. The f ee must be paid at the Cashier's Office prior to submitting the form to the Registrar's Office. Current students can obtain an unofficial transcript through OASIS at no charge. GRADES , FINANCIAL AID REQUIREMENTS , AND REVIEW PROCEDURES The University is interested in each student making reasonable progress toward s his/her educational goals and will aid each student through guidance and faculty advising. To make students aware of their academic progress, the University has enacted a system of grading and policies of Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal that indicates whether or not a student is showing sufficient progress toward meet ing degree requirements. Notations of Grades, Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal are posted to the student's permanent academic record. When a student is academically dismissed from the Univer sity the student can petition the Academic Regulations Committee (ARC) for consideration of readmission only after co mpleting all criteria for Acad emic Renewal I or Academic Renewal II. Please refer to the Academic Renewal sectio n in the catalog to see requirements and limitations. Academic Dismissal may have additional implications for a student receiving financial aid. If required, a student may need to complete the Satisfactory Progress for Financ ial Aid Recipients Petition. For more information, see http://www.usfsp.edu/financial-ai d/satisfactory-academic-progress . Grading System Effective Fall Semester, 2000, USFSP faculty may use a plus/mi nus grading system to assign student grades. The use of the plus/minus grading system is at the di scretion of the indivi dual faculty member. A student's measure of academic achievement is recorded on the academic record base d on the following grading system: Plus/Minus Letter Grades A+ 4.00 A Excellent performance 4.00 A- 3.67 B+ 3.33 B Good performance 3.00 B- C Average performance 2.00 C- 1.67 D+ D Poor performance 1.00 D- 0.67 F Failure 0.00 Other Grades E Course repeated, not included in GPA 46Grades, Financial Aid Requirem ents, and Review Procedures FF Failure/academic dishonesty I Incomplete IF Incomplete grade changed to Failure IU Incomplete grade changed to Unsatisfactory M No grade submitted by instructor MF Missing grade changed to Failure MU Missing grade changed to Unsatisfactory N Audit S Satisfactory (Pass) U Unsatisfactory (Fail) W Withdrawal from co urse without penalty WC Withdrawal for extenuating circumstances Z Indicates continuing registration. Please note that the grade of C- will satisfy specified minimum requirements of the Gordon Rule courses and the common prerequisites unless otherwise specified in the Catalog. Grade Point Average The University uses the quality points for the letter grades listed above. The grade point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of quality points by the total hour s attempted within the USF System. The total quality points are figured by multiplying the number of credits assigned to each course by the quality point value of the grade given. Credit hours for courses with grades of I, IU, M, MU, N, S, U, W, Z, and grades that are preceded by an \"E\" (excluded) are subtracted from the total hours atte mpted before the GPA is calculated. Multiple attempts on courses designated as repeatable in th e course catalog will provide for hours and quality points on each attempt to be applied to the student's GPA. \"D\" and \"F\" grades established in USF System coursework not designated as repeatable for additional credit will be calculated into th e student's GPA as many times as \"D's\" or \"F's\" are earned in the same course. If a student earns a grade of \"C-\" or higher in a course that may not be repeated for additional credit and earns a \"C-\" of higher on a subsequent enrollment the new grade is not computed into the student's GPA unless the student applies for and is eligible to receive a Grade Forgiveness for that course. \"I\" Grade Policy An Incomplete grade (\"I\") is exceptional and granted at the instructor's discretion only when students are unable to complete course requirements du e to illness or other circumstances beyond th eir control. This applies to all gradable courses, as well as pass/fail (S/U). Students may only be eligible for an \"I\" when: A majority of the student's work for a course is comp lete before the end of the semester (more than 50%). The work that has been completed is qualitatively satisfactory. The student requests consideration for an \"I\" grade as soon as possible but no later than the last day of classes. The student must request consideration for an incomplete grad e and obtain an \"I\" Grade Contract from the instructor of record. Even though the student may meet the eligibility requ irements for this grade, the course instructor retains the right to make the final decisi on on granting a student's request for an Incomplete. The course instructor and student must complete and sign the \"I\" Grade Contract Form that describes the work to be completed, the date it is due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete assign- ments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by st udent/instructor as long as it does not exceed two terms from the original date grades were due for that cour se for undergraduates and non-degree-seeking students. The instructor must file a copy of the \"I\" Grade Contract in the department/college that offered the course and the Registrar's Office by the date grades are due. The instruct or must not require students to either re-register for the course or audit the course in order to complete the \"I\" grad e contract. Students may register to audit the course, with the instructor's approval, but cannot re-take the course for credit until the \"I\" grade is cleared. An \"I\" grade contract that is not comple ted within the agreed to time frame (inc luding summer semester) will revert to the original grade noted on the contract. \"I\" grades are not computed in the GPA, but the grade noted on the contract will be computed in the GPA, retroactive to the semester the course was taken, if the contract is not fulfilled by the specified date. \"M\" Grade Policy An \"M\" (missing) grade is automatically assigned as a defaul t grade when the instructor does not submit a grade for a student. (Undergraduate rules also apply to non-degree-seek ing students.) Unless a change of grade is submitted, the \"M\" grade will remain on the transcript and will not be computed in the student's GPA. Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures47 S/U Grade System No-option Courses : Certain courses have been designated as S/U courses. The \"S\" and \"U\" grades are used to indicate the student's final grade. These S/U only courses are identified with (S/U only) after the course de finition in this catalog. No letter grading system option is available to students or faculty in these courses. Option Courses: Most undergraduate course may be taken on an S/U basis by a student under the following conditions and restrictions: 1. Required courses in the major may not be taken on an S/ U basis unless specifically designated in the catalog. 2. Courses supporting the student's major and state mandat ed common prerequisites may not be taken on an S/U basis. 3. Courses to satisfy 6A-10.30 (Gordon Rule ) may not be taken on an S/U basis. 4. Courses to satisfy USFSP's B.A. foreign language requirement may not be ta ken on an S/U basis. 5. All elective courses for the major and all elective cour ses in the general education requirements, and all other free elective courses may be taken on an S/U basis except where: a. The certifying college restricts the number of course s that may be taken on an S/U basis in any one or all of the above areas or restricts the total number of S/U courses that can be accepted for all of the above areas. b. The certifying college specifie s that certain courses may not be taken on an S/U basis. c. The instructor of a course refuses to allow the course to be taken on an S/U basis. 6. One of the Major Works and Major Issues courses, if taken outside the student's major discipline(s) may be taken S/U credit with instructor consent. Mechanism for Assigning S/U Grades: The method by which a student receives an \"S \" or \"U\" grade in an option course will consist of the following: 1. A written agreement signed by both instructor and stud ent shall be filed with th e college offering the S/U course. . The college shall set the deadli ne (no later than the last day of classes for the term) for the student to decide if he/she wishes to take the course on an S/U basis. 2. The instructor shall assign final letter grades A, B, C, D, F, or I, but will transmit to the Registrar \"S\" or \"U\" consistent with the following: a. Letter grades of C- or higher sha ll be equivalent to a grade of \"S.\" b. Letter grades of D+ or lower shall be equivalent to a grade of \"U.\" \"S\" and \"U\" grades are not computed in the student's GPA. Grade Forgiveness Policy USFSP's forgiveness policy permits an undergraduate to re peat a course and have the repeated grade computed in his/her GPA in place of the original grade, providing the repeat grade is posted as \"D-\" or higher (exception - see Honors at Graduation) and is also higher than the first grade. No rmally, grade forgiveness may on ly be applied to a specific course that a student chooses to repeat. No course taken on the S/U grade basis may have the grade forgiveness applied. Under unusual circumstances, a different but similar course ma y be used if the substitute course has been previously approved by the college dean and is on file in the Registrar's Office. The grade forgiveness policy cannot apply to any cour se in which the grade of \"FF\" has been recorded. Any undergraduate or non-degree-seeking student who wishes to implement grade forgiveness must: 1. Complete a \"Grade Forgiveness Request Form\" (avail able in the Registrar's Office or on-line at, http://www.usfsp.edu/registrar/) fo r each course to be repeated. 2. Adhere to the following conditions: a. A limitation of applying grade forgiveness to three USF System courses with no more than one repeat per course. b. With prior approval of the college dean, a course different from a cour se on the approved list may be substituted in the following cases: 3. The substitute course is a change in prefix, number, hours, or title, but not a substant ive change in content from the original course. 4. The substitute course replaces a course no longer offered by the institution. a. The repeated course must be taken under the standa rd grading system (A-F) and the latest grade must be posted as \"D-\" or higher (grades of S/U are no t permitted) and be higher than the first grade. b. All grades remain on the transcript. The original cour se grade will be annotated with \"E\" to indicate that the course has subsequently been repeated and the original grade is not computed in the GPA. 48Grades, Financial Aid Requirem ents, and Review Procedures c. Individual colleges may have further restrictions; therefore, the student should consult with his/her academic advisor. This policy is applicable to undergraduate and non-de gree-seeking students only, and applies to 1000-to-5000-level courses. Once students have been awarded a bachelor's degree from USFSP, they may not repeat a course and be forgiven the original grade, taken prior to graduation. The policy applies only to courses taken originally at an y USF System and repeated at a USF System institution. Good Standing USFSP students will be considered in g ood standing if they are currently enro lled or eligible to return to USFSP. Academic Record The student's academic record shall not be changed after the student has graduated. Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal for Undergraduate Students The first time an undergraduate student's USF (GPA) falls be low a cumulative 2.00, the st udent will be placed on Ac- ademic Probation (AP). To be removed from academic probat ion, the student must earn at least a 2.00 GPA each term, and may not totally withdraw fr om any term without cause. Any student who withdraws from all classe s after the fifth day of classes while on Academic Probation will automatically be academically dismissed. Academic advising is required fo r every student on Academic Probation prior to registration. The student may remain on Academic Probation indefinitely as long he/she earns a term GPA of 2.00 or greater each term. If at any time while on Academic Probation, the st udent's term GPA falls below a 2.00, the student will be Ac- ademically Dismissed from the University . Once Academically Dismissed, a studen t may only return to USFSP under the University's Academic Renewal Policies. If academically dism issed from USFSP, a student may not return to USFSP as a non-degree seeking student. Academic Probation or Academic Dismissal will be annotated on the student's permanent academic record. If a student is Academically Dismissed or falls below a 2.00 GPA from US FSP and subsequently receives a BA/BS degree from another four-year institution, that student, when accepted to th e University with the post-baccalaureate status, will have his/her academic record cleared. Academic Renewal USFSP recognizes that not every student's academic record is flawless and that many times students get off to such a poor start that their fu ture academic opportunities are limited. USFSP can offer many of those students a second chance. The University's Academic Renewal policy allows st udents previously dismissed from the university, to renew their pursuit of baccalaureate degrees without the responsibili ty of having to overcome th e entire burden of prior low grades and low GPAs. To facilitate this opportunity, studen ts who qualify for Academic Renewal may, with the approval of the Academic Regulations Committee, ha ve portions of their academic record excluded from calculation of their GPAs. The entire academic record, however, will continue to be reflected on the official transcripts even though a selected portion is not calculated in their GPAs. Academic Renewal students are admitted with the same terms of academic probation and dismissal as other undergraduate st udents. Academic Renewal will only be applied to a stu- dent's academic record one time at USFSP. Students petitioning for Academic Rene wal must also submit a re-admission ap plication with the Office of Under- graduate Admissions. Students who do no t enroll for the approved term of renewa l may need to submit a new petition for consideration of a different term. Academic Renewal I (ARI) - Students who have been acad emically dismissed or former students returning with a USF GPA below 2.00 may petition the Academic Regulations Committee to return to the University under AR-I if they have been away from the University for at least one academic seme ster. A student will be considered for reinstatement to the University under Academic Rene wal I if they complete all requirements for a Bachelor's, or Associate of Arts degree (including general education, and Gord on Rule requirements) at a two or fo ur-year college. Under the Academic Re- newal I policy, students will return to the University with a 0.00 GPA and Academic Renewal I students will enter USFSP as juniors and their USF GPA will be calculated from that point forward. While AR-I is best utilized by students who have earned less than 60 credit hours, it is not restricted to those students. Students with more than 60 credit hours returning to the University under AR-I will likely incur excess hours and associated mo netary penalty. In order to graduate fol- lowing re-admission under AR-I, all degree requirements must be met, and a minimum of 30 credit hours must be taken in residence at USFSP. Students who are admitted under AR -I may be excluded from ad mission to limited access pro- grams and will not be considered for University Honors at graduation unless they meet the criteria using all grades earned. Academic Renewal II (ARII) - Available to students who were academically dismissed and have 60 or more earned credits from USFSP or other institutions of higher education. Thes e students may be re-admitted to the University under Ac- ademic Renewal II if they are able to provide convincing evidence indicating they are likely to be successful upon return. Generally, such students will have been engaged in successful non-academic ac tivities such as work or military service Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures49 for at least one year or will have demonstrated recent acad emic success defined as the co mpletion of at least 12 se- mester hours with a GPA greater than or equal to 2.00, no gr ades below C, and no course withdrawals. In order to be considered for re-admission under ARII, students must subm it a request to the Academic Regulations Committee, who will, make a final decision regarding re-admission. Following re-admission under Academic Renewal II, students will have their pr ior USF GPA set to 2.00. In order to graduate, students must maintain a cumu lative GPA of 2.00 and at least 30 USFSP credit hours, including a minimum of 15 USF System credits earned following readmission under ARII. Students re-admitted under ARII may be excluded from admission to limited ac cess programs. Further, students who exercise the Academic Renewal II policy will not be considered for University Honors at graduation unless they meet the criteria using all grades earned. College Policies for Academic Progress Colleges may determine and implement standards of academ ic progress for undergraduat e students (majors in the college) in addition to those established by USFSP. Students who do not meet the academic standards of progress set by their colleges will be placed on probation and may be dism issed. The college Dean is responsible for implementing standards of academic progress and for notifying studen ts of their probationary or disenrollment status. Colleges may restrict the course selections and the number s of hours a student may take that do not apply toward completion of degree requirements. Students who exceed this limit may have part or all of their registration canceled. Colleges are responsible for publicizing and students are resp onsible for knowing their college's policies for academic progress. Class Standing A student's class is determined by the number of credit s he/she has earned without relation to his/her GPA. 0C Unclassified Non-degree-seeking students 1F Freshman:0 - 29 semester hours passed 2S Sophomore: 30 -59 semester hours passed 3J Junior: 60 - 89 semester hours passed 4R Senior: 90 or more semester hours passed; however, no baccalaureate degree ea rned here or elsewhere 5B Baccalaureate degree-holder working on a second undergraduate program or degree 6M Graduate student admitted to Master's Degree Program 6A Graduate student admitted to Specialist Degree Program 6C Graduate student Admitted to Candidacy 6D Graduate student admitted to a Doctoral Degree Program 7A-7D 1st-4th year professional program (M.D.) or post-doctoral status Change of Major All undergraduate students desiring to change their major should consult the Academic Advising Center. Administrative Holds A student may be placed on administrative hold for failure to meet obligations to the Univ ersity. When a student is on administrative hold, he/she may not be allowed to register , receive a diploma, or receive a transcript. Settlement of financial accounts must be made at the Cashier's Office. Through OASIS, each student placed on administrative hold should determine which office placed him/her on hold and then clear the obligation wi th that respective office. Student Information Changes Notifications regarding changes of address, name, residency, and citizenship should be fi led promptly with the Regis- trar's Office. Mid-term Grades (USF System Regulation 10-504) It is the student's sole responsibility to be aware of their academic standing and grade status in all courses. In an at- tempt to assist the student in evaluating his/her academic status mid-term, the Un iversity requires Instructors to submit mid-term grades electronically for each student enrolled in 1000, 2000 and 3000* level courses. This is a courtesy to the student and failure of an instructor to post the mid-term grades will not be grou nds for a student academic grievance nor will it be justification for a retroactive drop as the stud ent is presumed to be aware of current academic status. Examinations Examinations in academic subjects are, for most courses, an integral part of the learni ng process and one part of a procedure for evaluating student performance as a basis fo r grades. USFSP requires certain standards for the exami- nation process in order to protect the ac ademic integrity of courses and the best interests of both the student and the Instructor. 50Grades, Financial Aid Requirem ents, and Review Procedures Testing in General: In each academic course, the student is expected to undergo a meaningful te sting and evaluation that will reveal the student's intellectua l growth in the subject ma tter covered or otherwise re flect the achievement of the course objectives. The Instructor has the responsibility of maintaining a fair and impartial testing and examination procedure, has the right to define and structure the testing process, and shall not be restricted as to form, style or content of the examination. It is the policy of USFSP that all students facing an examin ation (of any type) shall have equal advance notice of the form and content of that examination. The University regards the ro utine use of all or part of the same formal examination for successive academic terms as unsound policy except when used with adequate safeguards such as a random selection of questions from a large pool. Comprehensive Final Examinations: The last 6 days of the fa ll and spring semesters shall be set aside for final exami- nations and any comprehensive final examination must be give n during this designated period. If a segment examination is given in lieu of a comprehensive examination, the segment examination must be given in the period designated during final examination week. The period of two hours shall be allo tted for each final examination. If a student has a direct conflict of scheduled final examinations or has three or more final examinations scheduled on the same day, the student may petition the appropriate instructor to reschedule one of the examinations. The final examination schedule shall be published in the same manner and place as the Academic Calendar. Regional Chancellor's Scholar List Full-time USFSP undergraduate students who demonstrate superior academic achi evement during a given term will be honored on a \"Regional Chancellor's Scholar List.\" To be eligib le for the Regional Chancellor' s Scholar List, a student must complete at least 12 USF graded hours with no incomplete, S/U or withdrawal grades duri ng the term and earn a 4.0 term GPA. Dean's List Full-time undergraduate students who demonstrate superior academic achievement during a semester will be honored on a \"Dean's List\". To be eligible for Dean's, a student mu st complete at least 12 USF graded hours with no incomplete, S/U or withdrawal grades during the term , earn a 3.5 or better term GPA, and be within the top 10% of the college. The dean of the college in which the student is majoring or the Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs for the undeclared students will recognize th is academic honor. Academic Regulations Committee and Appeal Board The USFSP Academic Regulations Committee (ARC) is responsibl e for serving as an undergraduate academic regulatory board for students who are designated as USFSP students an d wish to be exempted from an Undergraduate Academic Policy. The Committee is authorized to act both individually and collectively in responding to student petitions. Since any student has the right to appeal academic decision s, there is also an Academic Appeal Board to hear and adjudicate appeals to ARC decisions. The ARC Appeal Board is th e final point of petition for a student - there is no higher authority. Students should contact their Academic Advisor if considering an ARC Petition. Student Academic Grievance Procedures (USF System Regulation 10-002) I. Introduction (Purpose and Intent) The purpose of these procedures is to provide all undergr aduate and graduate students taking courses within the University of South Florida System an opportunity for object ive review of facts and events pertinent to the cause of the academic grievance. Such review wi ll be accomplished in a collegial, non- judicial atmosphere rather than an adversarial one, and shall allow the parties involved to part icipate. All parties will be expected to act in a profes- sional and civil manner. The procedures that follow are designed to ensure objectiv e and fair treatment of both students and instructors. These guidelines are meant to govern all colleges, however, as individual USF institutions and the appropriate col- leges may have different levels of authority or titles, each st udent must obtain the specific designations used by each entity for levels of authority and titles in this process. In the case of grade appeals, the University reserves the ri ght to change a student's grade if it is determined at the conclusion of the grievance process that the grade given was incorrect. In such circum stances, the Dean or Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs may file an administrative grade change. The term \"incorrect\" means the assigned grade was based on something other than performance in th e course, or that the assignment of the grade was not consistent with the criteria for awarding of grades as de scribed in the course syllabus or other materials distributed to the student. In the case of all other academic grievanc es, the University reserves the right to determine the final outcome based on the procedures detailed herein. Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures51 In the case of Academic Integrity (USF System Regula tion 3.027) violations, these Student Academic Grievance Procedures apply and include an Academic Integrity Review Process at the College Level as described in section III below. II. Terms and Guidelines An \"academic grievance\" is a claim that a specific academic decision or action that affects that student's academic record or status has violated published policies and proc edures, or has been applied to the grievant in a manner different from that used for other students. Grievances ma y relate to such decisions as the assignment of a grade seen by the student as incorrect or the dismissal or failur e of a student for his or her action(s). Academic grievances will not deal with gene ral student complaints. \"Instructor\" shall mean any classroom instructor, thesis/d issertation/directed study supervisor, committee member or chair, or counselor/advisor who interacts with the student in an academic environment. \"Department Chair/Director\" shall mean the academic head of a college department or th e director of a program\u2014or in all cases a \"Department's designee\" ap pointed to handle ac ademic grievances. \"Dean\" shall mean a College Dean or the equivalent as indicated\u2014or in all cases a \"Dean's designee\" appointed to handle academic grievances for the unit. \"Time\" shall mean \"academic time,\" that is, periods when University classes are in session. The person vested with authority at the appropriate level may extend any of the time periods contained herein for good cause. Any ex- tensions must be communicated in writing to all parties. For the purposes of this policy, each step shall be afforded three (3) weeks as a standard time limit. When a depa rtment considers a grievance according to published de- partmental procedures approved by the College Dean and Regional Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, as perti- nent, the time line specified in this academic unit's proced ures will govern the process and no additional notice of time extension is needed. \"Written communication\" shall mean communication by hard copy to the recipient's address of record. The \"burden of proof\" shall be upon the student such that the student challenging the decision, action or grade assigned has the burden of supplying evidence that proves that the instructor's decision was incorrect, in all cases except alleged violations of academic in tegrity. In cases where the issue is ac ademic integrity, the burden of proof shall be upon the instructor. In considering grievances, decisions will be based on the preponderance of the evi- dence. Neither party shall be entitled to bring \"legal representation \" to any actual grievance proceeding as this is an internal review of an academic decision. As some Colleges may use different titles, the next leve l that applies to that Coll ege shall be substituted. III. Statement of Policy A. Resolution at the Department Level 1. The student shall first make a reasonable effort to resolve his or her grievance with the instructor con- cerned, with the date of the incident triggering the start of the process (i.e. the issuance of a grade; the receipt of an assignment) and the instructor shall accommodate a reas onable request to discuss and at- tempt to resolve this issue. 2. If the situation cannot be resolv ed or the instructor is not available, the student shall file a notification letter within three weeks of the triggering incident to the department Chairperson/Director. This shall be a concise written statement of particulars and must incl ude information pertaining to how, in the student's opinion, University policies or procedures were vi olated. The department Chairperson/Director shall pro- vide a copy of this statement to the instructor. 3. The department Chairperson/Direct or shall discuss the statement jointl y or individually with the student and the instructor to see if the grievance can be re solved. If the department maintains its own grievance procedure,* it should be applied at this point. If the grievance can be resolved, the Chairperson/Director shall provide a statement to that effect to the studen t and the instructor with a copy to the College Dean. *Departments may develop their own formal procedures for considering grievances. Such procedures must be consid- ered and approved by the College Dean and the Vice Chan cellor for Academic Affairs, and published on the Depart- ment's web site. When such procedures exist, the Department 's examination of the grievance will unfold as specified in the procedures. If the Departmental process upholds the student's grievance, the Depart ment Chair will work with the College, the student and the instructor to remedy the situation. If the Department does not uphold the grievance, the Chair will report the fact to the Dean. The student may, in such cases, request the College Level review as outlined in these University procedures. 4. If the grievance cannot be resolved, the department Chair/Director shall notify both the student and the instructor, informing the student of his/her right to file a written request within three weeks to advance the grievance to the College Level. The instructor ma y file a written response to the grievance petition. Upon receipt of the student's reques t to move the process to the Colle ge Level and the instructor's re- sponse to the grievance (if provided), the Chairperson/ Director shall immediately notify the College Dean 52Grades, Financial Aid Requirem ents, and Review Procedures of the grievance, providing copies of the student's in itiating grievance statement, any instructor's written response to the grievance, and the written request fr om the student to have the process advanced to the College Level (which may include additional responsive or final statements by the student). Should the student not file a written request to move the grieva nce to the College Level wi thin the prescribed time, the grievance will end. If the grievance concerns the Chairperson/Director or other officials of the department, the student has a right to bypass the departmental process an d proceed directly to the College Level. B. Resolution at the College Level 1. Upon receipt of the grievance, the College Dean sh all either determine that the matter is not an academic grievance and dismiss it or within three weeks sha ll establish an Academic Grievance Committee. The membership of the Committee sha ll be constituted as follows: a. Three (3) faculty members and two (2) students (under graduate or graduate as appropriate to the case) shall be selected from the college by the Dean. b. Wherever practical, the Committee shall not includ e members of the faculty or students of the de- partment directly involved with the grievance, or faculty or students of the student's major depart- ment. The student or faculty may address the committee. However, if requested by the committee; faculty or students from the department involved with the grievance or from the student's major department may provide expert or other relevant testimony in the proceedings. 2. The Committee will operate in the following manner: a. The Committee Chairperson will be appointed by the College Dean from among the three faculty members appointed to the Committee. b. The Committee Chairperson shall be responsible for sc heduling meetings, overseeing the deliberations of the committee and ensuring that full and fair consid eration is provided to all parties. The Committee Chairperson shall vote on committee decision s only when required to break a tie. c. In Committee reviews involving Academic Integrit y, the following Academic Integrity Review Process shall be followed: 1. The Committee Chairperson shall notify the stud ent and instructor of the date and time of the meeting. 2. The student and instructor may submit a list of questions to the Committee Chairperson to be answered by the student and instructor. If subm itted, the questions will be disseminated by the Committee Chairperson and the Committee Chairper son will ensure that the questions are an- swered in writing and submitted for review by th e Committee, student, and instructor before the initial meeting. 3. The student or instructor may request to attend a Committee meeting as designated by the Chairperson to present any final statement to the Committee and either may be present during the other's final statement. Neither the student nor instructor may be present during the delibera- tions. 4. The student or instructor may bring an advisor (n ot to act as legal counsel or to participate in the meetings) to the meeting. 5. Students shall be permitted to remain in th e course or program during the Academic Integrity Review Process. However, if the student is in a clinical or internship setting, the student may be removed from such setting until the issue of Acad emic Integrity is resolved. In such cases, the program will attempt to identify an alternative educ ational option to the clinical or internship to enable the student to continue progressing in the program. d. All deliberations shall be in private and held confidential by all members of the Committee. The rec- ommendation of the Committee shall be based on the factual evidence presented to it. e. Within three weeks of the Committee appointment, the Committee Chairperson shall deliver in writing to the student, instructor, department Chairperson/ Director or Program Director, and College Dean a report of the findings and a recommended resolution. f. Within three weeks of receipt of the Committee re commendation, the College Dean shall provide a de- cision in writing to all parties. g. The student or the instructor may appeal the decision of the College Dean to the University Level only if the decision of the College Dean is contrary to the recommendation of the Committee or if there is a procedural violation of these Student Academic Grieva nce Procedures. Such an appeal must be made in writing to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs within three weeks of receipt of the decision from the College Dean. Otherwise, the College Dean's deci sion is final and not subject to further appeal within the University. C. Resolution at the University Level The Vice Chancellor for Academic Affa irs at USFSP may delegate authority to a designated academic adminis- trator at USFSP to hear the a ppeal at the University level. 1. The student or the instructor may appeal at the Un iversity Level within three weeks of the receipt of a decision made at the College Level, when (1) the de cision by a College Dean is contrary to the recom- Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures53 mendation of a college Grievance Committee, or (2) ther e is cause to think a procedural violation of these University Academic Grievance Procedures has been made. Within three weeks of receipt of the appeal to the decision, the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affair s in consultation with the Faculty Senate and the Student Senate, shall appoint an Appeals Committee co nsisting of three faculty members drawn from the University Undergraduate Council or Graduate Counci l (as appropriate), and two students, undergraduate or graduate (as appropriate). 2. The structure, functions and operating procedures of the Appeals Committee will be the same as those of the College Committee (i.e. chaired by one of the appointed faculty members appointed by the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs who will not vote except in the case of a tie, having no representation from either party's respective departments, developing a recommendation to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. 3. Within three weeks of the appointment, the Comm ittee Chairperson shall delive r in writing to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs a report of the find ings of the Committee and a recommended resolution. 4. Within three weeks of receipt of the Committee re commendation, the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs shall provide a decision in writing to all parties. 5. If the Vice Chancellor' s decision is that a grade change is meri ted, the Vice Chancello r shall initiate the grade change on the authority of the Provost and so inform all parties. In all academic grievance appeals, the Vice Chancellor's decision is final and not subject to furthe r appeal within the University. These procedures shall take effect co mmencing (February 10, 2009) and shall su persede all other academic grievance procedures currently in effect. * Departments may develop their own formal procedures fo r considering grievances. Such procedures must be con- sidered and approved by the College Dean and the Vice Ch ancellor for Academic Affairs, and published on the De- partment's web site. When such procedures exist, the De partment's examination of th e grievance will unfold as specified in the procedures. If the Departmental process upholds the student's grievance, the Department Chair will work with the College, the student and the instructor to remedy the situation. If the Department does not uphold the grievance, the Chair will report the fact to the Dean. The student may, in such cases, request the College Level review as outlined in these university procedures. Procedures for Alleged Academic Dishones ty or Disruption of Academic Process Alleged violations of academic integrit y or alleged disruptions of academic process will be handled initially by the instructor, who will discuss the incident with the student. It must be noted that the Facu lty Senate considers the tra- ditional relationship between student and faculty member as the primary mean s of settling disputes that may arise. If the instructor observes the alleged dishonesty occurring duri ng an examination, he/she should, with discretion, notify the student of the fact before the student leaves the examinat ion. In all cases, the instruct or must attempt to schedule a meeting with the student to discuss th e alleged dishonesty or disruptions. After the discussion, if the student and instructor have reached a mutual agreement as to th e solution, the instructor shall file a statement with the College Dean, responsible for the course outlining the facts of the incident and the agreed-upon solution signed by both the instructor and studen t. A copy of this statement sh all be given to the student. If no solution is reached, the matter should be re ferred to the College Dean, for attempt at resolution. Integrity of Students 1. Fundamental principles: Academic integrity is the foundation of the University of South Florida System 's (University/USF) commitment to the academic honesty and personal integrity of its University community. Academic integrity is grounded in certain fundamental values, which include honesty, respect and fairness. Broadly defined, academic honesty is the com-pletion of all academic endeavors and claims of schola rly knowledge as representati ve of one's own efforts. Knowledge and maintenance of the academic standards of hone sty and integrity as set fort h by the University are the responsibility of the entire academic community, in cluding the instructional faculty, staff and students. 2. General Policies: The following policies and procedures apply to all studen ts, instructional faculty and staff who participate in ad- ministration of academic classes, programs and research at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg. This regulation asserts fairness in that it requires notice to any student accu sed of a violation of academic integrity and provides a directive for discussion between the instructor and student to seek a fair and equitable resolution. If a fair resolution is not accomplished in this discussion, this regulation allows the student contin ued rights of due process under the academic grievance procedures based upon the preponderance of the evidence. The policies described below are the only policies and procedures that govern vi olations of academic integrit y at the University and su- persede any previous policies or regulations. 3. Violations of Academic Integrity: Undergraduate and Graduate Behaviors that violate academic integrity are listed below and are not intended to be all inclusive. 54Grades, Financial Aid Requirem ents, and Review Procedures (a) Cheating Definition: Cheating is using or attempting to use materials, information, notes, study aids, or other assistance in any type of examination or evaluation which have not been authorized by the instructor. Clarification: 1. Students completing any type of examination or evaluation are prohibit ed from looking at or transmitting materials to another student (including electronic repr oductions and transmissions) and from using external aids of any sort (e.g. books, notes, calculators, phot ographic images or conversation with others) unless the instructor has indicated specifically in advance that this will be allowed. 2. Students may not take examinations or evaluations in the place of other persons. Students may not allow other persons to take examinations or evaluations in their places. 3. Students may not acquire unauthorized information about an examination or evaluation and may not use any such information improperly acquired by others. 4. Instructors, programs and departme nts may establish, with the approval of the colleges, ad ditional rules for exam environments and behavior. Such rules must be announced in advance in a course syllabus or other ad-vance written notice to students. (b) Plagiarism Definition : Plagiarism is intentionally or carelessly presen ting the work of another as one's ow n. It includes submitting an as- signment purporting to be the student's original work which has wholly or in part been created by another person. It also includes the presentation of the work, ideas, representations, or words of another person without cus- tomary and proper acknowledg ement of sources. Students must consult wi th their instructors for clarification in any situation in which the need for documentation is an i ssue, and will have plagiarized in any situation in which their work is not properly documented. Clarification: 1. Every direct quotation must be identified by quotatio n marks or appropriate indentation and must be properly acknowledged by parenthetical citation in the text or in a footnote or endnote. 2. When material from another source is paraphrased or su mmarized in whole or in part in one's own words, that source must be acknowledged in a footnote or en dnote, or by parenthetica l citation in the text. 3. Information gained in reading or research that is not common professional knowledge must be acknowledged in a parenthetical citation in the text or in a footnote or endnote. 4. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, the us e of papers, reports, projects, and other such materials prepared by someone else. (c) Fabrication, Forgery and Obstruction Definitions: Fabrication is the use of invented, counterfeited, altered or forg ed information in assignments of any type including those activities done in conjunction with academic courses that require students to be involved in out-of-classroom experiences. Forgery is the imitating or counterfeiting of im ages, documents, signatures, and the like. Obstruction is any behavior that limits the academic opportunit ies of other students by improperly impeding their work or their access to educational resources. Clarification: 1. Fabricated or forged information may not be used in any laboratory experiment, report of research, or academic exercise. Invention for artistic purposes is legitimate under circumstances explicit ly authorized by an in- structor. 2. Students may not furnish to instructors fabricated or fo rged explanations of absences or of other aspects of their performance and behavior. 3. Students may not furnish, or atte mpt to furnish, fabricated, forged or misleading information to University officials on University records, or on records of agencies in which students are fulfilling acad emic assignments. 4. Students may not steal, change, or destroy another st udent's work. Students may not impede the work of others by the theft, defacement, mutilation or obstruction of resources so as to deprive others of their use. Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures55 5. Obstruction does not include the content of statemen ts or arguments that are germane to a class or other educational activity. (d) Multiple Submissions Definition: Multiple submissions are the submissions of the same or substantia lly the same work for credit in two or more courses. Multiple submissions shall include the use of any prior academic effort previously submitted for aca- demic credit at this or a different institution. Multiple submissions shall not include those situations where the prior written approval by the instructor in the current course is given to the student to use a prior academic work or endeavor. Clarification: 1. Students may not normally submit any academic assi gnment, work, or endeavor in more than one course for academic credit of any sort. This wi ll apply to submissions of the same or substantially the same work in the same semester or in different semesters. 2. Students may not normally submit the same or substant ially the same work in two di fferent classes for academic credit even if the work is being graded on different bases in the separate courses (e.g. graded for research effort and content versus grammar and spelling). 3. Students may resubmit a prior academic endeavor if there is substantial new work, research, or other appro- priate additional effort. The student shall disclose the use of the prior work to the instructor and receive the instructor's permission to use it PRIOR to the submission of the current endeavor. 4. Students may submit the same or substantially the same work in two or more courses with the prior written permission of all faculty involved. In structors will specify the expected academic effort applicable to their courses and the overall endeavor shall re flect the same or additional academic effort as if separate assignments were submitted in each course. Failure by the student to obtain the written permission of each instructor shall be considered a multiple submission. (e) Complicity Definition: Complicity is assisting or attempting to assist anothe r person in any act of academic dishonesty. Clarification : 1. Students may not allow other students to copy from their papers during any type of examination. 2. Students may not assist other students in acts of acad emic dishonesty by providing ma terial of any kind that one may have reason to believe will be misrepresented to an instructor or other University official. 3. Students may not provide substantive information about test questions or the material to be tested before a scheduled examination unless they have been specifically au thorized to do so by the course instructor. This does not apply to examinations that have been administered and returned to students in previous semesters. (f) Misconduct in Research and Creative Endeavors Definition: Misconduct in research is serious deviation from the accepted professi onal practices within a discipline or from the policies of the University in carrying out, reporting, or exhibiting the results of re search or in publishing, ex- hibiting, or performing creative endeavors.

Students must abide by the University's policies on Misconduct in Research where applicable, which can be found in the University's Policies and Procedures Manual at the General Counsel's website. (g) Computer Misuse Definition : Misuse of computers includes unethical or illegal use of the computer s of any person, institution or agency in which students are performing part of their academic program. Clarification: 1. Students may not use the University computer system in support of any act of plagiarism. 2. Students may not monitor or tamper with another person's electronic communications. (h) Misuse of Inte llectual Property Definition : Misuse of intellectual property is the illegal use of copyright materials, trademarks, trade se crets or intellectual properties. Clarification: Students may not violate state or federal laws concerning the fair use of copies. (4) Violations and Sanctions for Undergraduate Students: Violations for undergraduate students at the University of So uth Florida St. Petersburg are classified into four levels according to the nature of the infraction. For each leve l of violation a corresponding set of sanctions is recom- mended, however, specific academic programs may include additional and different sanctions. These sanctions are intended as general guidelines for the academic community with examples cited below fo r each level of violation. These examples are not to be considered all-inclusive. It is recommended that the instructor forward a concise wr itten statement describing the academic dishonesty of an incident with its particulars to the Vice Chancellor for Ac ademic Affairs for violations in Levels Two through Four. These records will be maintained until gr aduation or until they are of no fu rther administrative value. This will enable better handling of multiple violations. (a) Level One Violations Level One violations may occur because of inexperience or la ck of knowledge of principles of academic integrity on the part of persons committing the violation. These violatio ns address incidents when intent is questionable and are likely to involve a small fraction of the total course work , are not extensive, and/or occur on a minor assignment. The following are examples: 1. Working with another student on a laboratory or othe r homework assignment when such work is prohibited. 2. Failure to footnote or give pr oper acknowledgment in an extremel y limited section of an assignment. Recommended sanctions for Level On e violations are listed below: Reduction or no credit given for the original assignment. An assigned paper or research project on a relevant topic. A make-up assignment at a more difficul t level than the or iginal assignment. Required attendance in a non-credit workshop or seminar on ethics or related subjects. (b) Level Two Violations Level Two violations are characterized by dishonesty of a more serious charac ter or that which affects a more sig- nificant aspect or portion of the course work. The following are examples: 1. Quoting directly or paraph rasing, to a moderate extent, without acknowledging the source. 2. Submitting the same work or major portions thereof to satisfy the requirements of more than one course without permission fr om the instructor. 3. Using data or interpretative material for a labora tory report without acknowledging the sources or the col- laborators. All contributors to preparation of data and/or to writing the report must be named. 4. Receiving assistance from others, such as research, statistical, computer programming, or field data collection help that constitutes an essential el ement in the undertaking wi thout acknowledging such assistance in a paper, examination or project. Recommended sanctions for Level Tw o violations are listed below: Failing grade for the assignment involved with the gr ade in the course determined in the normal manner. Failing grade for the course, which may be an \"F\" or \"FF\" on the internal transcript. (c) Level Three Violations Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures57 Level Three violations are those that go beyond Level One or Two violations and that affect a major or essential portion of work done to meet course requirements, or in volve premeditation, or are preceded by one or more vio- lations at Levels One and/or Two. Examples include: 1. Copying on examinations. 2. Plagiarizing major portions of a written assignment. 3. Acting to facilitate copying during an exam. 4. Using prohibited materials, e.g. books, notes, or calculators during an examination. 5. Collaborating before an exam to develop methods of exchanging information and implementation thereof. 6. Altering examinations for the purposes of regrading. 7. Acquiring or distributing an examination from unauthorized sources prior to the examination. 8. Presenting the work of another as one's own. 9. Using purchased term paper or other materials. 10. Removing posted or reserved material, or prev enting other students from having access to it. 11. Fabricating data by inventing or deliberately altering mate rial (this includes citing \"sources\" that are not, in fact, sources. 12. Using unethical or improper means of acquiring data. Recommended sanctions for Level Three violations are listed below: Failing grade for the course with a designatio n of \"FF\" on student' s internal transcript. Possible suspension from the University for one semester. (d) Level Four Violations Level Four violations represent the most serious breaches of intellectual honesty. Examples of Level Four violations include: 1. All academic infractions committed after return from suspension for a previous academic honesty violation. 2. Infractions of academic honesty in ways similar to criminal activity (such as forging a grade form, stealing an examination from a professor or from a University office; buying an examination; or falsifying a transcript to secure entry into the Un iversity or change the record of work done at the University) . 3. Having a substitute take an examinatio n or taking an examination for someone else. 4. Fabrication of evidence, falsification of data, quot ing directly or paraphrasing without acknowledging the source, and/or presenting the ideas of another as one's own in a senior thesis, within a master's thesis or doctoral dissertation, in scholarly articles submitted to refereed journals, or in other work represented as one's own as a graduate student. 5. Sabotaging another student's work through actions designed to prevent the student from successfully com- pleting an assignment. 6. Willful violation of a canon of the ethical code of the profession for which a student is preparing. Recommended sanctions for Level Four violations are listed below: The typical sanction for all Level Four violations is pe rmanent academic dismissal fr om the University with the designation of \"Dismissed for Academic Dishonesty\" to be placed permanently on a student's external transcript. (5) Additional Undergraduate Guid elines for Academic Dishonesty: (a) Grade Assignment 1. An \"FF\" grade assigned to indicate academic dishones ty is reflected only on inte rnal records and prevents the student from repeating the course using the Grade Forgiv eness Policy. Students with any \"FF\" grade on record will not be eligible for honors at graduation. 2. If a student who has been accused of academic dishon esty drops the course, the st udent's registration in the course will be reinstated un til the issue is resolved. 3. Any assigned grade may be changed to an \"FF\", \"F\", or other grade depending on the instructor's decision or the ultimate resolution of an academic gr ievance procedure. This includes any instance of academic dishonesty that is not detected by the instruct or until after the student has dr opped or completed the course. 4. Notification to the student of the \"FF\" grade and th e option of appeal concerning the alleged academic dis- honesty shall be the responsibility of the instructor and/or department chair (See Student Academic Grievance Procedures). 5. Notice that a student has been dismissed for reasons of academic dishonesty will be reflected on the student's transcript with the formal notation: Dismissed for Academic Dishonesty. 58Grades, Financial Aid Requirem ents, and Review Procedures 6. More serious violations of academic integrity may be referred to the Office of Students Rights and Responsi- bilities as a student conduct violation. (b) Multiple Violations: 1. For the first \"FF\" recorded in an undergraduate stud ent's USF academic record, the student will receive a letter from the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs informing him or her of be ing placed on \"Academic Dishonesty Warning\" for the remainder of enrollment at USF and of appeal rights for the \"FF\" grade. 2. For the second \"FF\" recorded, the undergraduate student will be suspended fo r one full semester and readmitted only after writing a clear statement indicating remorse, understanding of the seriousness of the offense, and understanding of the importance of integrity in all areas, including academic work. A letter informing him or her of this action and appeal rights will be sent from th e Dean of Undergraduate Studies. 3. For the third \"FF\" recorded, the undergraduate studen t will be permanently dismissed from the University for violations of academic integrity and wi th notice of that dismissal as a part of the formal record and transcript. 4. The maximum penalty for receipt of any \"FF\" grade may be permanent dismissal from the University for vi- olations of academic integrity and with a notice of that dismissal as a part of the student's formal record and transcript. (6) Violations and Sanctions for Graduate Students: The Graduate School holds academic in tegrity in the highest regard. Graduate students are responsible for being aware of and complying with University Regulations and Poli cies and must conduct themselves accordingly. Sanctions for Academic Dishonesty will depend on the seriousness of the offense and may range from the receipt of: An \"F\" or \"Zero\" grade on the subject paper, lab report, etc. An \"F\" in the course or activity in which credit may be earned. An \"FF\" in the course (leading to expulsion from the University). Academic Dismissal for any violations of acad emic dishonesty polici es or regulations. Possible revocation of the degree or Graduate Ce rtificate following a th orough investigation. Graduate students who are assigned an \"FF\" grade will be academically dismissed from the University and will not be eligible to apply to any graduate program at USF. Proced ures regarding Academic Dishonesty and Academic Dismissal may be found on the Graduate School website. (7) Additional Graduate Guidel ines for Academic Dishonesty: 1. If a graduate student who has been accused of academ ic dishonesty drops the course, the student's registration in the course will be reinstated until the issue is resolved. 2. Any assigned grade may be changed to an \"FF\", \"F\", or other grade depending on the instructor's decision or the ultimate resolution of an ac ademic grievance procedure. This includes any instance of academic dishonesty that is not detected until after the student has dropped or completed the course. 3. Notification to the graduate studen t of the \"FF\" grade and the option of appeal concerning the alleged academic dishonesty and academic dismissal remains with the inst ructor and/or department chair (See Student Academic Grievance Procedures). 4. A graduate student who has been dismissed for reasons of academic dishon esty will have this reflected on the student's transcript with the formal nota tion: Dismissed for Academic Dishonesty. 5. More serious violations of academic integrity may be referred to the Office of Students Rights and Responsi- bilities as a student conduct violation. (8) Appeals: Undergraduate and Graduate Once the initial violation of the acad emic integrity regulation has been documented and fairly discussed by the student and the instructor, the student may appeal the instru ctor's decision that a viol ation has occurred. At that point the student will follow the procedures outlined in the University of South Florida's student Academic Grievance Procedure Policy. For academic integrit y violations that are reviewed at th e department and college levels, the respective committees will consider all evidence available to determine if the instructor's decision was correct. The student's ability to proceed within an academic program while an Academic Grievance is in process will be deter- mined by the individual academic program chair/director. 1 These policies apply to Undergraduate Students, even if ta king graduate coursework. Graduate students are students admitted to a graduate degree program or graduate certificate, and/or non-degree seeking students taking graduate coursework (such students should refer to Section IV Violations and Sanctions for Graduate Students) 2 These policies apply to Graduate Students (students admitted to a graduate degree program or graduate certificate, and/or non-degree seeking students taking graduate course work). Undergraduate students should refer to Section III Violations and Sanctions for Undergraduate Students) Authority: Art. IX, Sec. 7, Fla. Constitution and Resoluti ons issued by the FL Board of Governors History-New 12-11-08. Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures59 Disruption of Academic Process (USF System Regulation 3.025) (1) Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the educational process. Although disruptive student conduct is already prohibited by the University of South Florida syst em (University/USF) Student Code of Conduct, the purpose of this regulation is to clarify what constitutes disruptive behavior in the academic setting; what actions faculty and relevant academic officers may take in response to disruptive conduct; and the authority of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (or designat ed office handling conduct issues in Student Affairs) to initiate separate disciplinary proceedings against students for disruptive conduct. (2) Disruption of the academic process is defined as the act, words, or genera l conduct of a student in a classroom or other academic environment which in the re asonable estimation of the instructor: (a) Directs attention away from the academic matters at ha nd, such as noisy distractio ns, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of lecture, exam, academic discussion, or general Un iversity operations, or (b) Presents a danger to the health, safety or well-being of self or other persons. References to classroom or academic area include all acad emic settings (live or on-lin e, and including field expe- riences). References to Instructor include the course inst ructor, USFSP St. Petersburg faculty, administrators, and staff. Misconduct occurring in other campus areas on Universi ty premises or which adversely affects the University community and/or the pursuit of its missi on is already prohibited by the Student Code of Conduct and will be handled by those procedures. Academic discussion that includes disagreement with the co urse instructor during times when the instructor permits discussion is not in itself disrupti ve behavior and is not prohibited. Some disruptive students may have emotional or mental heal th disorders. Although such students may be considered disabled and are protected under the Rehabilitation Act/ADA, they are held to the same standards of conduct as any student. The following applies to all campuses of the University of South Florida system; however, non-substantive procedural modifications to reflect the particular circumstances of each separately accredited USF System institution are permitted. Information concerning these procedures is available through th e Student Affairs Office. (3) Procedures for Handling Di sruption of Academic Process. (a) General Guidelines for Instructor: 1. If a student is disruptive, the In structor may ask the student to stop th e disruptive behavior and/or warn the student that such disruptive behavior can result in acad emic and/or disciplinary ac tion. Alleged disruptions of the academic process will be handled initially by the In structor, who will discuss the incident with the student whenever possible. It must be note d that the Faculty Senate considers the traditional rela tionship between student and instructor as the primary mean s of settling disputes that may arise. 2. The Instructor is authorized to ask a student to le ave the classroom or academic area and desist from the disruptive behavior if the Instructor deems it necessary. If the Instructor does this, s/he will send an Academic Disruption Incident Report with in 48 hours simultaneously to: a. The department chair, b. The Assistant/Associate Dean of the College (as determined by the College), c. The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (O SRR) or the separately accredited institution's/regional campus' designated office in Student Affairs, and d. The student. If the situation is deemed an emergency or circumstance s require more immediate action, the instructor should notify the appropriate law enforcement agency, OSRR and ot her authorities as soon as possible. Any filed Incident Report can, and should, be updated if new info rmation pertinent to the situation is obtained. 3. An Instructor may also further exclude the student from the classroom or other academic area pending reso- lution of the matter. If the Instru ctor recommends exclusion (temporary or permanent) fr om the classroom pending resolution, the student must be informed of th e exclusion before the next scheduled class (either by phone, email or in-person). That notice must: a. Inform the student of the exclusion, b. Inform the student of his/her right to request an ex pedited review of the exclus ion within two days to the Chair of the Department. If such academic exclusion occurs, and if the student reques ts a review, the Chair of the Department shall review the exclusion within two days of the date the student requests the review and decide if the student can return to the specific class and/or any academic setting. This decision may be appealed in writing by the student within two (2) days to the Dean of the college or the institutional desi gnee (as appropriate) for review and decision within two 60Grades, Financial Aid Requirem ents, and Review Procedures days. Any decision rendered at that point must be in writing and will serve as the final and binding academic decision of the University. Each academic decision or sanction must be communicated to the Office of Students Ri ghts and Responsibilities or the separately accredited institution's/regional campus' designated office as soon as possible. (b) Possible Academic Sanctions and Grading Guidelines: Authority of an Instruct or and the appropriate Chair or Assistant/Associ ate Dean may result in any of the following sanctions: Warning to the student. Voluntary withdrawal by the student from the class(es). Temporary exclusion and/or permanent dismissal from th e instructor's classroom or academic area, program, or college, pending an expedited appeal. Academic sanction, including assignment of a final grade. -- If the final determination is a dismissal from class, the grade assigned for the class will depend on the student' s status at the time of dismissal. If the student had a passing grade in the class at the time of dismissal, a grade of \"W\" will be assigned for the course. If the student had a failing grade in the class at the time of dismissal, a grade of \"F\" will be assigned for the course. These grades will become a part of the student's perman ent record. In addition, if the academic disruption results in dismissal from more than th e classroom or academic area of the incident, this grading policy may be applied in all classes affected. (c) Documentation and Academic Disruption Incident Report: Instructors should be aware that notes of the dates, times, witnesses and deta ils of the incidents of disruption and the impact of the disruption on those present may be important in any future proceedings which may be nec- essary. Referrals to the Office of Stud ent Rights and Responsibilities or desi gnated office in Student Affairs re- quire written documentation containing factual and descript ive information. The student is entitled to see this documentation. The Academic Disruption Incident Report must be submitte d by hardcopy (not email) simultaneously within 48 hours to: 1. The department chair, 2. The Assistant/Associate Dean of the College (as determined by the College), 3. The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or the separately accredited institution's regional campus' designated office in Student Affairs, and 4. The student. The form can be downloaded from the designated website in Student Affairs or comple ted by way of memorandum containing the following information: Date of report Student's name USF Student ID number Instructor's name Instructor's phone number Instructor's e-mail Title of course, course number and section Date/time/location of incident Detailed summary of the incident, including a description of the disruptive behavior Witnesses Action, if any, taken by the instructor (e.g., student warned, asked to leave the class, etc.) Recommended course of action and reasons for this recommendation Instructor's signature (d) Possible Disciplinary Sanctions for Conduct by the Office of Stud ent Rights and Responsibilities: Upon receipt of the Academic Disruption Incident Report or other academic referral for disruptive conduct, the Office of Student Rights and Responsibi lities or designated office in Student Affairs may initiate the disciplinary process resulting in the imposition of any of the following sanctions in a ddition to any academic sanctions im- posed (in section b): Educational sanctions to include but not limited to educational programs/classes and written assignment Grades, Financial Aid Requirements, and Review Procedures61 Disciplinary probation Provisional suspension Suspension Restriction from certain or all class (es), program, colle ge, residence hall, or any part or all of USF System institutions. Expulsion When an incident is being reviewed by OSRR or designated office in Student Affairs for possible disciplinary sanctions, current provisions affecting the student's academic status (temporary or otherwise) will be communicated by the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or designated office in Student Affairs to th e Instructor and ap- propriate academic administrators/instructors responsible for the student's current academic standing as soon as possible, but within two weeks of the reported incident. On ly final disciplinary sanction s that affect the academic status of the student will be communi cated to the Instructor(s) and appropriate academic administrators after the disciplinary process is complete.

Liberal Arts Exit Requirements for Undergraduates in all Disciplines (9 Semester Hours) A student's liberal arts education will continue throughout the college years and not be li mited to a relatively small number of required courses in the first two years of college. Exit requirements will provide students with an opportunity during their junior and senior years at USF St. Petersburg to integrate their knowledge within the context of liberal arts. Courses that satisfy the exit requirements will, where appropriate, incorporate considerations of values and ethics; international and environmental perspectives; race and ethnicity; and gender. By their junior and senior years, students will have a foundation in liberal arts and be better able to reflect upon ethical issues in a constructive way. Students seeking second baccalaureate degrees (those coded as 5B ) are exempt from the libera l arts exit requirements. Students will take at least one of the Liberal Arts Exit courses outside their disciplinary cluster(s). For purposes of this policy, the term \"discipline\" refers to the following fields: business, educatio n, fine arts, arts and letters, natural sciences, and social sciences (See list below of \"Outside the Disciplinary Cluster\" Liberal Arts Exit Courses). One of the Major Works and Major Issues courses, if taken outside the st udent's major disciplinary cluster(s), may be taken for S/U credit with the consent of the instructor. Only courses num bered 3000 or above may be used to satisfy the exit re- quirements. Exit requirements must be completed with courses ap proved on the USF St. Petersburg course list and must be taken at a University of South Florida System Institution. All exit requirement courses will be seminar-size courses in which enrollment will be target ed at approximately 20 to 25 students. These courses will be taught by regular faculty. Students majoring in the College of Education are permitted to graduate with only six credits of Liberal Arts Exit courses, all of which may be taken in the College. I. Major Works and Major Issues (6 credit hours required): A portion of the exit requirements consists of a minimum of six (6) semester hours of approved coursework con- cerning major works and major issues. Courses will focus on major issues, documents, or works, and will allow students to read primary texts. These co urses may allow students to delve into topics on an interdisciplinary basis. One of the Major Works and Major Issues courses, if taken outside the student's major discipline(s), may be taken for S/U credit with the cons ent of the instructor. Major Works and Major Issues courses must offer the opport unity for integration of content. These courses will have liberal arts content and, when appropriate, will contain in -depth discussions of values and ethics, international and environmental perspectives, race and ethnicity, and gend er. Courses may be interdisciplinary and may be team taught. This will provide students with an opportunity to explore, in-depth an d on an interdisciplinary basis, major topics that are important but outside of the major field of study. J. Literature and Writing (3 credit hours required): In addition, students will take three (3) semester hours of approved exit requirement coursework in literature and writing. These courses will allow students to read significant literature of th e world and write at least 6,000 words. These courses also meet the Gordon Rule Communications requirement. The writing requirement may be satisfied 64Grades, Financial Aid Requirem ents, and Review Procedures with assignments that include, for instance, revision and process writing. The course ma y be taken within the major if appropriate. The courses will focus on the dimensions of values and ethics, inte rnational and environmental perspectives, race and ethnicity, and gender. All courses listed are certified as meeting the Exit requirement. Additional courses may have been certified since publication of this catalog. Please consult with an ac ademic advisor for current and additional information. Courses to Satisfy Gordon Rule Prior to receipt of an Associate in Arts certificate/degree fr om a public community college or university or prior to entry into the upper division of a public university or co llege, a student shall complete successfully the following: 1. Six (6) semester hours of English course work and six (6) semester hours of additional coursework in which the student is required to demonstrate college-level writing skills through multiple assign ments. Each institution shall designate the courses that fulfill the writing requirements of this se ction. These course designations shall be submitted to the Statewide Course Numbering System. An institution to which a student transfer s shall accept courses so designated by the sending institution as meeting the writ ing requirements outlined in this section. Six (6) semester hours of mathematics cour sework at the level of college algebra or higher. For the purposes of this rule, applied logic, statistics and other such computation cour sework which may not be plac ed within a mathematics de- partment may be used to fulfill three (3) hours of the six (6) hours required by this section. Students awarded college credit in English based on their demonstration of writing skills through dual enrollment, advanced placement, or international baccalaureate instru ction pursuant to Rule 6A-10.024, F.A.C., and students awarded college credit based on their demonstration of math ematics skills at the level of college algebra or higher through one (1) or more of the accelerati on mechanisms in Rule 6A-10.024, F.A.C., shall be considered to have satisfied the requirements in subsection 6A-10.030(2), F.A.C ., to the extent of the college credit awarded. Note: The Gordon Rule communication and computation requir ements are considered met for any student entering the university with an A.A. from a Florida public University or community college. Gordon Rule communication require- ment is considered met for any student entering the universi ty with 60 or more semester hours.

Freshman English Requirement All first-time-in-college students are requ ired to take Freshman English (a sequenti al two-semester cour se of study) in accordance with the following conditions: 1. First-time-enrolled students who have not completed the Freshman English requirement through CLEP, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate or Dual Enrollment, must take ENC 1101 and ENC 1102 sequentially. If a student fails the first course, he/she must repeat it before proceeding to the next Freshman English course. Students should normally take these courses during their freshman year, but these courses are high demand and it is possible that registration space will not always be available. 2. First-time-enrolled students who wish to attempt CLEP for Freshman English during their first nine (9) weeks should provide documentation of successful completion of ENC 1101 and/or ENC 1102 during their first semester. If a student either fails or doesn't attempt the CLEP examinat ion during his/her first nine (9) weeks, the student nor- mally should take ENC 1101 in the followi ng semester. In this case, the studen t will normally complete the sequence by the first semester of his/her sophomore year. These policies do not apply to first-time-enrolled students who can meet the Freshman Engl ish requirement with credit transferred from another instit ution or those with appropriate AP or IB English credit. Credit by Examination A student who feels he/she has already acquired the basic co ntent of a course on his/her approved schedule should inquire about credit-by-examination. Some exams are offe red through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). Interested students should obtain additional information from their advisors or the USF System Office of Evaluation and Testing. 68Baccalaureate Degree - University Requirements University minimum requirements for graduation consist of the following: earn a minimum of 120 semester hours with an overall 2.00 GPA, including a 2.00 GPA in all courses attempte d at within the USF System; a transfer student must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher when combined with all work attempted at other in stitutions; satisfactorily complete writing and computation course requirements of 6A-10.030; earn a mi nimum of 48 semester hours of upper-level work (courses numbered 3000 and above); complete Liberal Arts requirements; complete the USF St. Petersburg residency require- ment; complete program requirements as determined by the department and/or college; and be recommended for graduation by the dean of the appropriate college. The requ irements must be met by every student upon whom a degree is conferred. The total number of semester hours needed to complete the baccalaureate degree depends upon the academic major field of study. No grad es may be changed fo llowing graduation. In recognition that students seeking a second Bachelor's degree have completed a rigorous program of study at a re- gionally accredited or comparable international institution, some graduation requirements are considered met by virtue of their previous degree. These include: Gordon Rule, Summe r Enrollment, the Foreign Language Entrance Requirement, General Education and the Exit Requirem ents. Each degree program will determ ine degree applicability of transfer courses for the major. All students entering USF St. Petersburg with fewer than 60 semester hours of credit are required to earn at least 9 semester hours of credit prior to graduation by a ttendance during one or more summer semesters. Summer Enrollment Requirement All students entering the Univer sity with fewer than 60 seme ster hours of college level academic work are required to earn at least 9 semester hours at a State of Florida Univer sity during one or more Summ er terms prior to graduation. Foreign Language Graduation Requ irement for B.A. Students In addition to the foreign language entr ance requirement, all studen ts applying for a Bachelor of Arts degree from USF St. Petersburg must demonstrate competency in a foreign language. To demonstrate this competency, students may take either two semesters of a beginning college-level foreign language or one semester of a higher-level course and earn a letter grade of \"C-\" (no \"S\" grades) or above in the a ppropriate level course or demonstrate equivalent competency by passing an examination. Languages offered at USF St. Petersburg include: Spanish French Sign Language Transfer credit for languages other th an those listed above may be applied toward the B.A. foreign language re- quirement. Please see your academic advisor for further information. American Sign Language Approval needed by the student's program/department majo r. The following programs accept Sign Language Compe- tency for the foreign language exit requirement: Anthropology , Criminology, Affiliated Econ omics, History, Interdisci- plinary Social Sciences, Mass Communications with Journali sm and Media Studies Concentrations, Political Science, Psychology. Students taking the placement examination in French or Spanish should view the World Languages website at www.usfsp.edu/scl/placement-test-w/ for test dates and times. Foreign Language Placement Students with two or more years of study in a foreign language in high school, or with postsecondary course(s) in foreign language, or with experiential learning of a foreign language may not enroll fo r credit in courses in that language without first taking a placement examination administered by World Language Education. Should the placement ex-amination indicate that remedial work is required (1120 -1121), the student will be allo wed to enroll with the under- standing that the grade eventually ea rned will be either an \"S\" or \"U.\" Under no circumstances will a student wh o places above the first year level or who passes a higher-level course be allowed to register for or receive credit for a lower-level co urse in that specific language . Students to whom this reg- ulation applies should inquire of the Department of World Languages for the placement examination. Academic Residency USF Regulation 3.007 BACCALAUREATE DEGREE - UNIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS Baccalaureate Degree - University Requirements69 Candidates for graduation must have completed at least 30 ho urs of their last 60 hours of their undergraduate credits in courses offered by the USF System In stitution (home institution) from which the degree is to be conferred (USFSP). Individual colleges and programs may have more st ringent requirements, approved by the university, such as the number of specific courses in the major that must be co mpleted at the institution from which a student may receive a degree. Exceptions to the above rules may be made for students who are enrolled at other USF System Institution's approved exchanges, co-op training programs or corresponden ce courses from the University of Florida. CLEP credit does not count toward academic residence. Beginning fall semester 2012, students mu st successfully complete at least 50 pe rcent of the required courses in the major in courses offered by the USF System Institution conferring the degree. In cases of hardship or lack of course availability, individual exceptions may be approved by the respective College Deans or de signee to help ensure timely graduation. Academic Major USF St. Petersburg offers curricula leading to the baccalaur eate degree in the following fields. The degree is indicated in parentheses after each major code. For clarification, the following terms are defined: Specialization: Those courses required to give the studen t academic concentration and baccalaureate identification such as Mathematics, Accounting, Psychology, etc. Supporting or Related: These courses may be prerequisites to the specialization courses, or they may support specialized courses by giving preparation or breadth to the area of spec ialization. These courses are often referred to as college or program core courses. Program Electives: These are usually a broad band of courses offered by the college offering the major to further enrich the student in the general academic field of the major.

Students interested in a particular minor should obtain the specific re- quirements from the appropriate department. The department may require the same admission or retention standards as required for the major. Students are strongly encouraged to consult with their academic advisor to determine the 70Baccalaureate Degree - University Requirements impact of the addition of the minor on the State of Florida Excess Credit Hour Su rcharge on page 28 prior to declaring a minor.

Internal processes (such as auditions, portfolio reviews, and placement tests) utilized in the various departments for the sole purpose of determining a student's most appropriate are a, level, or section placement in a program of study are not to be construed as examining mechan isms for the gran ting of credit. Academic Learning Compacts In accordance with the Board of Governors Policy Guidel ine #PG 05.02.15 each baccalaureate program develops and implements \"Academic Learning Compacts.\" The Academic Learning Compacts include concise statements of what program graduates will know and be able to do (i.e. the expected core student learning outcomes). Each Academic Learning Compact includes the following components: Identifies the expected core student learning outcomes for program graduates in the areas of: Content/discipline kn owledge and skills. Communication skills. Critical thinking skills. The Academic Learning Compacts are posted on each prog ram's USF St. Petersburg website and will be provided to students when they begin their degree programs and are advised in their declared majors. 72Baccalaureate Degree - University Requirements Student's Choice of Catalog USF System Policy 10-059 amended 7/25/2015 University of South Florida System (USF System) institutio ns publish undergraduate and graduate catalogs on each campus. Catalogs are not contracts, but are the source of general information including the USF System, its campuses, community, curricular offerings, degree and admission requir ements, academic calendar, and facilities available to students, faculty and staff. In order to graduate from USF St. Petersburg, each degree-s eeking student must meet all of the graduation requirements specified in the USF St. Petersburg catalog of his/her choice. A degree-seeking student may choose any USF St. Pe-tersburg catalog published during his/her continuous enrollmen t. Students who have transfer red from one Florida public institution to another are affected by th is policy: Graduation requir ements in effect at the receiving SUS institution at the time a student enrolls at a Florida public institution of hi gher learning shall apply to th at student in the same manner that graduation requirements apply to it s native students provided the student has had continuous enrollment as defined in the SUS institution's catalog. At USF St. Petersburg, continuous enrollment is defined as en rolling as a degree seeking student at least one term each twelve month period. Therefore, students cannot choose a USF St. Petersburg catalog published prior to or during an academic year in which they did not maintain continuous enro llment. (Each catalog is considered to be published during the academic year printe d on the title page.) If the student cannot meet all of the graduation requirements specified in the catalog of his/her choice due to university decisions and changes in policy matter, course offering, etc ., appropriate substitutions will be determined by the dean of the college of the student's major. USF St. Petersburg's policies are subject to change and apply to all students regardless of their choice of catalog. If the student's graduation requirements are affected by changes in University policies, appr opriate arrangements will be made to preclude penali zation of the student. http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies-and-procedures/pdfs/policy-10-059.pdf Repeat Course Work The hours for a course that has been repeated may be co unted only once toward the minimum 120 semester hours of credit (earned hours) required for gradua tion. All credit hours (except when grade forgiveness is applied) are calculated in the GPA (See Repeat Course Surcharges.) Undergraduate Degrees USF St. Petersburg awards three undergra duate degrees. They are the Bachelor of Sciences, the Bachelor of Arts, and the Bachelor of Fine Arts. Double Undergraduate Major Students may elect to graduate with two majors within the same undergraduate de gree. In that event, they must apply independently to each department/college and be assigned an advisor for each discipline . The student must meet all requirements of each major se parately, must be certified for graduation by both majors and meet all of the university requirements for the degree. The student will earn the appr opriate bachelor's degree with two majors indicated and receive one diploma. .

Application for Graduation In order to graduate, a student must subm it the on-line application for the bachelor's degree or Associate in Arts cer- tificate. This application is available through the student's OA SIS account and must be submitted in the term of expected graduation by the deadline noted in the academic calendar for the student to be assured of availability of academic regalia for participation in the graduation ceremony, certific ation of graduation by the end of the term, inclusion of name in the graduation Bulletin, and time ly ordering of the diploma. Students who submit the application for graduation after the posted deadline but prior to the last day of classe s for the academic term and who are determined to have met all graduation requirements in that semester may have their graduation posted that term. Students must note that a late application may not be processed before the next term's re gistration period if they ha ve not met all degree require- ments. Applications received after the la st day of classes will result in the grad uation being posted at the end of the following academic term. If a student applies for graduation and is not approved, a new application for degree must be submitted by the deadline in a new term. In order for the degree statement to appear on a student's academic record, the student must file the aforementioned application whethe r or not participation in the commencement ceremony is desired. The application must be certified by the Advising Center re presentative prior to the graduation application deadline. Inquiries concerning approval or denial of graduation should be made to the Academic Advising Center, DAV 134. It is the student's responsibility to clear all \"I\" grades (i ncompletes) in courses required for graduation and to provide official transcripts of all transferred course work needed for graduation at least 3 weeks prior to the end of the term in which he/she expects to graduate. A student applying for a second undergraduate major must do so within the same deadline set for applying for a degree. A student applying for a minor must: 1. indicate their minor on the on-line application for the bachelor's degree have no \"I\" grades in required courses. Posthumous Degrees or Degrees in Memoriam The University may award a posthumous baccalaureate and master 's degree to a student who was in good standing at the University at the time of his or her death and who had completed all substantive requirements for the degree. The 74Baccalaureate Degree - University Requirements University may also award baccalaureate and master's degrees in memoriam to a student wh o was in good standing at the University at the time of his or her death. To award a non-thesis degree, the student would need to ha ve completed all courses required for the degree. Courses required for the degree, in which the student is enrolled at th e time of his or her death, must have been completed to the satisfaction of the faculty so that passing grades might be posted. All other requirements (e.g., grade point average, CLAST and other tests) must ha ve been satisfied as well. To award a thesis degree, all courses must be completed as described above and the thesis must be sufficiently complete to the satisfaction of the faculty so that certification of completion may be posted to the student's record. Procedures for Award of Posthumous Degrees or Degrees in Memoriam The chairperson of a department, on his or her own initiative or upon the request of the family of the student, may recommend a posthumous degree, or a degree in memoriam, by forwarding the recommendation to the respective dean of the college. If approved by the Dean, the recommendati on with supporting documentation will be forwarded to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for approval. If th e Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs approves the recom- mendation, the Office of the Registra r will be notified and the degree will be awarded at the next commencement ceremony or will be presented to the stud ent's family in an appropriate setting. Diplomas for posthumous degrees will be identical to other degrees awarded in the same colleges and majors. Diplomas for Degrees in Memoriam will be prepared to read \"Bachelor of Arts in Memori am, Bachelor of Science in Memoriam, Master of Arts in Memoriam,\" etc., depending upon the degree the student was pursuing at the time of his or her death. Undergraduate students who have not chosen a major at the time of death will be awarde d the \"Bachelor of Arts in Memoriam.\" Honors at Graduation To be considered for honors at graduation, a baccalaureate candidate must have completed at least 40 credits of graded upper level work at a USF System Institution and have earn ed a grade point average of 3.50 or higher for all graded coursework attempted at a USF System Institution. For those students in programs requiring multiple clinical experi- ences (such as Education), a baccalaureate candidate must have completed at least 30 hours of graded upper level coursework and have earned a grade point average of 3.5 or higher for all graded coursework attempted at a USF System Institution. In addition, to be eligible for honors, transf er students and USF St. Petersburg students who have post- secondary work elsewhere must have an overall GPA of 3.50 or higher counting all USF System courses as well as all transferable work attempted at other in stitutions. The forgiveness policy at US F or other institutions and plus/minus grades awarded at other instit utions will not be applicable in computing th e GPA for honors.

Baccalaureate Degree - University Requirements75 Associate in Arts Certificate Requirements Upon the student's successful completion of the minimum requ irements for the Associate in Arts Certificate, the Uni- versity will present the student who has properly ma de application with an appropriate certificate. 1. To receive the Associate in Arts (AA), the student must comp lete 60 semester hours of university credit; at least 20 of the last 30 semester hours or a total of 36 credit ho urs must be completed at USF St. Petersburg; the minimum grade point average must be 2.0 based on work attempted within the USF System; in addition, a transfer student must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher wh en combined with transfer work accepted and evaluated by the USF St. Pe- tersburg Office of Admissions; satisfy rule 6A-10.030 (Gor don Rule) and the General Education Requirements of USF St. Petersburg must be satisfied. Physical Education and mi litary science credits do not count within the 60 semester hours toward the Associate in Arts Certificate. In addi tion, the student must fulfi ll the writing and computation course requirements of 6A-10.030 prior to re ceiving the Associate in Arts Certificate. The application for the Associate in Arts Certificate is availa ble on the student's OASIS acco unt. It should be submitted prior to the application deadline. The dead line to apply for a degree/certificate each semester is stated in the Academic Calendar. The Associate in Arts certificate must be awarded prior to the term that the student becomes eligible for the bacca- laureate degree. Final processing for the Associate in Arts Certificate will be done after grades are processed at the end of the semester for which the student applied. All work, in cluding transfer work taken in that seme ster will be evaluated with respect to the requirements for the Associate in Arts Certificate. Any incomplete grades shown on the permanent record of an A ssociate in Arts applicant at the time grades are processed will be treated as an F in the ca lculation of grade point average. The General Education Requirements will be based on the approved University poli cy in effect in the catalog year the student chooses according to the University policy regarding the choice of catalog. The co nsideration of whether or not General Education Requirements are met will be made without consideration of the student's choice of major at the time he/she applies. Residence credit will be broadly defined to include USF sp onsored student exchange prog rams and the University of Florida Correspondence Division . University of Florida Correspondence Divisi on credit will not be included in the stu- dent's USF St. Petersburg grade point average. When the grades from USF sponsored student exchange program insti- tutions are included in the grade point average calculation, they will also be counted in the student's grade point av- erage as work attempted at USF for the Associate in Arts Certificate. An applicant who has not been enrolled within the USF System for three semesters may be contacted to ascertain whether or not that applicant m eets the residency requirements. In approving any application for the Associate in Arts Certif icate, satisfactory/unsatisfactory grades will be accepted according to the approved University policy in effect during the terms of the student's en rollment without regard for the student's declared major. Students must be aware that if they have taken any courses on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis where such grades are not acceptab le by the college of the major, the st udents may be required to repeat par- ticular courses for a traditional letter gr ade or take additional courses for a trad itional letter grade to meet the college requirements. All USF St. Petersburg colleges will accept the AA Certificate from any USF institution. That is, the student will be placed at least at the junior level and will be considered to ha ve met the University's Genera l Education Requirements. The applicability of the courses taken by the student toward his/ her major program will be determined by the college of the student's major. Similarly, any special requirements for a st udent's professional certificat ion (e.g., Education) are not necessarily met by the Associate in Arts certificate, but could be included as part of the General Education Require- ments. Thus, students should check with their colleges conc erning meeting any special requirements in an efficient manner. The awarding of the Associate in Arts Certificate is posted on the permanent record but does not alter the calculation of the grade-point average; nor does it interrupt the accumulation of the student's record. Students who follow a baccalaureate degree program as recomm ended by a college will not ne cessarily be eligible for the Associate in Arts certificate prior to the completion of 90 semester hours.

Thus, students may not receive duplicate credit for the course and the CLEP test in the following areas: English Composition with Essay - ENC1101 & ENC 1102 Mathematics - MAC 1105 will not satisfy USF St. Petersburg's residency requirement; Credit for the General Natural Science examinat ion will be granted for non-majors only; and Each College at USF St. Petersburg has the prerogative to ex clude CLEP from the required 48 hours of upper level credit. Certain General and Subject CLEP Examinations may apply to the General Education Libera l Arts Requirements. Some programs do not award credit toward the degree for certain CLEP examinations, and certain graduate or professional schools such as law, medicine and engineering may not grant equal recognition to students with extensive examination credits. An academic advisor should be consulted to ascertai n the applicability of a specific CLEP examination toward a student's degree requirements and the advisability of taki ng the examinations in a student's specific situation.

The bases of education are a capacity for and an appreciation of social change within a context of prior human achievement. The faculty of the Arts and Scienc es strive to instill in thei r students a history of human ideas, a sense of love for learning, and an understanding of th e means that scholars have used in their search for beauty and order in the natural world. The education provided by the disciplines of the Arts and Scie nces is the foundation upon which the lives and professions of our students are built, and the basis from which personal growth occurs. The College of Ar ts and Sciences takes as its goal a melding of the natural, humanistic frameworks and social philosophies into a comprehensive whole that en- courages the development of new ideas and new ap proaches to the understanding of our universe. Great universities provide direction for their communities and service for their needs. The faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences as well as the staff, who support and encourag e their work, explore their scholarly interests within the home and community created by the academic society. It is th e responsibility of scholars to share their discoveries for the betterment of society. Thus, the Arts and Sciences em brace disciplines that strive to make immediate use of knowledge in the service of social goals as well as disciplines whose discoveries contribute to the fund of basic infor- mation that is the stepping stone of applied knowledge.

The undergraduate program a llows students to explore th is subject through the disci- pline's four main areas of research: Biological Anthropology ; Archaeology; Cultural Anthro pology; and Linguistics. Our perspectives are worldwide, but we also study nearby communities, in trying to understand patterns of human physical College of Arts and Sciences89 differences, language, religion, marriage customs, conflict re solution or the evolution of societies themselves. Students with an undergraduate degree often go on to graduate progra ms in Anthropology but also find employment in a wide variety of settings including: archeological contract compan ies; conducting research on urban community development; studying immigrant populations and how best to serve the health, social and educational needs of our increasingly diverse society. Students may also concentrate their studies in anthropology by choosing this as one of the two cognate disciplines required for Interdisciplinary Studies (ISS) Majors. This allows students to take introducto ry and advanced anthropology courses and combine them with a second cognate discipline and a specific set of ISS courses. Students majoring in other fields may find anthropology coursework an exci ting and valuable supplement to their primary academic interest. A minor in anthropology has been developed with this purpose in mind. The minor program is structured to allow the student maximum flexibility in co urse selection within a broadl y defined progression of an- thropological interests. Thus, the student is able to tailor a minor in anthropolo gy to best suit a special focus in the context of an overall curriculum. Further information about the major, new courses, and the Anthropology faculty can be found on the web at http://www1.usfsp.edu/c oas/scl/anthro.htm Prerequisites: Students wishing to transfer to USFSP should complete the A.A. degree at the community college. Students should complete two lower leve l, 2000 or 3000 level introductory courses in Anthropology prior to entering the university. If not taken at the community college, they must be completed before the degree is granted. Some courses required for the major may also meet General Education Requirements thereby transferring maximum hours to the university. A grade of \"C\" is the minimum acceptable grade. If students transfer with fe wer than 60 semester hours of acceptable credit, the students must meet the university's entering freshman requirements including ACT or SAT test scores, GPA, and course requirements. The transfer student sh ould also be aware of the immunization, foreign language, and continuous enrollment policies of the university.

The program concentrates on achiev ing balance in the above aspects of the system from the perspective of the criminal justice prof essional, the offender, and society. The program provides a solid background in the theory, issues and methodol ogy comprising Criminology. The objective of the undergraduate progra m in Criminology is to develop a sound educational basis either for graduate work or for professional training in on e or more of the specialized areas comprising the modern urban criminal justice system. Recommended Prerequisites (State Mandated Common Prerequisites) Students wishing to transfer to USF sh ould complete the A.A. degree at the community college. Some courses required for the major may also meet General Education Requirements thereby transferring maximum hours to the university. If students transfer with fewer than 60 semester hours of acceptable credit , the students must meet the university's entering freshman requirements including ACT or SAT test scores, GPA, and course requirements. There are no State Mandated Common Prerequisites for this degree program. Transfer students should be aware that by university regulation they are obliga ted to establish academic residency by completing the equivalent of one academic year (30 semester hours) in \"on-campus\" courses. All undergraduate transfer students electing Criminology as their major will be required , moreover, to take a minimum of 30 credit hours in major coursework at the University of South Florida. The transfer student should also be aware of the immunization, foreign language, and continuous enrollment policies of the university. Criminology Major Requirements A minimum of 36 semester hours is required of a ll undergraduate majors in Criminology including: 1. Each of the following core courses: (18 hours) CCJ 3024 Survey of Criminal Justice* 3117 Theories of Criminal Behavior* 3 CJE 3656 Introduction of Crime Analysis 3 CCJ 3701 Research Methods I 3 CCJ 3718 Applied Statistics in Crime 3 CCJ 4934 Senior Seminar 3 2. 18 semester hours of electives within the major.

A student may take an unlimited amou nt of CCJ 4933 or 4934 as long as they vary in topics. These residence requirements are designed to ensure that transfer students who subs equently receive their bacca- laureate degree from the University of South Florida with a major in Criminology will have been exposed to the same body of knowledge in their major as those students who co mplete all or a major portion of their coursework at the University of South Florida. Any student who receives a grade of \"D\" or lower in more than one USF CCJ cour se will be automatically barred from continuing as Criminology major. College of Arts and Sciences95 English (ENG) 23.0101 The program in English provides two areas of sp ecialization/concentrations (divided into two degree-options below): Literature and Cultural Studies (LCSP) The undergraduate program in Literature and Cultural Studies prepares studen ts to be excellent communicators and researchers, whether they move forward into careers or into graduate and professional schools. The program highlights three areas of study - American, British, and World Literatures - focusing on specific kinds of skills: reading deeply and analytically, writing critically and creati vely, thinking conceptually and contextu ally, and using multiple research tools from the archives to the Intern et. Literature and Cultural Studies considers how language works in a variety of historical, rhetorical, and artistic contexts. Students who graduate from this program are both well si tuated and expected to be excellent, multifaceted users of language in the global communities they inhabit. Writing Studies (WSSP) The undergraduate program in Writing Stud ies prepares students to work as innovative professional communicators in a variety of fields -- from government to business to medici ne. The program brings together professional and public discourse within specific rhetorical situat ions so that writers experience specific local, global, organizational, and civic dimensions. We research, develop, evaluate, and practice prof essional and public discourse. Students are encouraged to collaborate with schools, corporations, agencies, and commu nity-based organizations to design, develop, use, and evaluate oral, written, and digital arti facts. The program is designed to em power individual communicators in the ethical and strategic use of language in a variety of public and professional communities. The program will produce graduates who can effectively compose using a variety of tools in order to communic ate with their audiences.

Environmental Science an d Policy (ESVR) 03.0104 The status of the Earth's environment has been a major conc ern since the 1960s. Currently, it represents one of the most critical issues facing nearly a ll nations. Increased popula tion, technology, globalization and diminishing natural resources all play important roles in the changing environment. As a consequence, governments at all levels are devoting resources to help understand and mitigate the problems we are facing. The actions of people, as individuals or society as a whole, are crucial for environmental we ll-being and long-term sustainability. This degree emphasizes the understanding of interrelatio nships between social phenomena and the natural (i.e., bio- logical-physical-chemical) environment. It is intended to (1) increase student awareness of these interconnections in their everyday lives; (2) introduce students to a variety of social science perspectives (inc luding politics and policies) along with hard environmental science perspectives, that help students make sense of these connections; (3) identify the contributions of each of these perspectives to our under standing of environmental problems; (4) discuss how natural resource management and environmental policy reflect these perspectives; and (5) produce graduates who promote sustainability in all face ts of human enterprise. The environmental industry is a growing arena for employment for degree holders at all levels. Students completing the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Environmental Science and Policy have found employment with government agencies (city, county, state, and federal), private industry, and non-profit organizations. Examples of ca reers include field scientist, research scientist, policy analyst, lobby ist, conservationist, and educator. Some also go on to attend graduate or law school. The B.S. in Environmental Science and Policy was approved in 1995. This interdisciplinary program is housed in the College of Arts and Sciences. All students must complete the Univer sity's General Education Requirements. All majors in the program must complete the required core courses and se lect among the elective courses from the lists below. Please note that the concentration cour ses differ between the Science, Policy , and Sustainability concentrations. Finally, all majors must complete an uppe r division seminar and an internship or project. Unless stated otherwise, a grade of \"C-\" is the minimum acceptable grade. College of Arts and Sciences99 Students wishing to tran sfer to USFSP should complete the A.A. degree at the commun ity college. Some courses re- quired for the major may also meet General Education Requ irements thereby transferring maximum hours to the uni- versity. If students transf er with fewer than 60 semester hours of acce ptable credit, the students must meet the university's entering freshman requirements including ACT or SAT test scores, GPA, and course requirements. The transfer student should also be aware of the immunization, foreign language, and continuous enrollment policies of the university. Transfer students are encouraged to complete the following required suppo rting major courses prior to entering the university. Unless stated otherwise, a grade of \"C-\" is the minimum acceptable grade. Environmental Science and Policy Major Requirements The Environmental Science and Policy Major offers three concentr ations i) Science, ii) Policy and iii) Sustainability.

(19 credit hrs. for degree core , 9 for concentrations, 3 for capstone and 6 for degree electives). Conc entration offers to specializations in: i) Geospacial Sciences ii) Society and Environment. The degree core focuses on physical geography and envi ronmental systems including the hydrosphere, atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere. Particular emphasis is placed on the human modification of th e natural environment and the global interconnections of the major earth systems. Electives for the degree program focus on human geography (t he social and spatial effect s of urban growth, including issues such as the conflicts, economic restructuring, grow th and decline of inner-cities, and urban racial and ethnic relations and disease) and physical geography (land-use change s and impacts of urbanization on the quality and quantity of water resources qualities and quantities). The Geospatial Science concentration focuses on the quantita tive and analytical study of relationships of events and processes in space and time. In recent years, powerful new technologies and techniques have emerged that greatly improve our ability to acquire, archive, analyze, and commu nicate information regarding people, places, and processes on or near the Earth's surface. These same technologies and analytical frameworks allow us to combine this information into multi-tiered databases describing inter-related aspect s of our physical and social world. The Environment and Society concentration provides students with an in-depth und erstanding of the socio-cultural and political contexts in which specific environmental problems arise and are addres sed. Popular conceptual frameworks in human-environment interactions, such as political ecology, sustainable development, and natural ha zards, are applied to a range of envi- ronmental problems at the local, national, and global scales. Minimum Requirements for Major Students must earn a C- or better in all major course work.

Graphic Arts (B.F.A.) 50.0409 Graphic Arts Requirements for the B.F.A. Degree The Graphic Arts degree offers students a sequence of rigo rous courses that balance critical thinking and pragmatic experience, complimented by the enriched experience of the liberal arts environment of the University of South Florida St. Petersburg. Graphic artists develop the images that gi ve voice to the world around us. Using th eir raw materials - the ability to think, draw, write, speak, and design - students learn the skills to solve specific visual prob lems. The study of typography, design concepts, and digital technology develops an unders tanding of the tradition, practice, and process of graphic design. This program guides students in building the imagination, aesthetic sensitivity, and powers of critical thought required to succeed as visual communicators. The curriculum emphas izes expertise in image development, typography, print and screen-based graphics, and interactive design. The program prepares students for the rigor of professional design practice through an internship program, courses in production, and portfo lio development. Additi onally, students de- sign, organize and promote an exhibiti on of their final senior project. The B.F.A. Degree in Graphic Arts is a limited access, upper-level program. Students are accepted in the spring and begin the program as a cohort in the fall semester. An Apple Macintosh laptop computer, software and fonts are required for this program. Admission into the B.F.A. program is contingent upon the student having a 3.25 or higher major GPA, which must be maintained after admission for the degree to be awarded. Student competency will be evaluated individually and is based upon criteria such as GPA, writing skill, and a po rtfolio of work indicative of : (1) concept, execution and presentation of studio artwork, (2) conceptual understanding of art and design standards, 3 application of art and design concepts, (4) examples of drawing methods and materials, an d (5) historical knowledge of art and design as evidenced by previous assignments in visual proble m solving. Applicants to the program must have a 2. 5 or higher overall grade point average. Students are admitted in the fall semester of each year only and must submit all materials (including the portfolio) for fall admission by early spring (see web page www.usfsp.edu/vva/g raphic-design/ for exact deadline date.) Transfer credit from other institutions is accepted on th e basis of portfolio and transcript evaluation. USFSP accepts transfer credit from all Florida programs that are part of the \"common course prerequisites.\" The following courses are necessary for completing a B.F.A. degree in Graphic Design. In addition to the 3.25 minimum grade point average, a minimum grade of C-minus is required for each course listed in prerequisites and the major. I.

All three courses in the Journalism and Media Studies pre-core curriculum (MMC 2100, MMC 3602, and VIC 3001) must also be completed with a minimum grade of \"C\" before taking additional Journalism and Media Studies courses. Students failing to achieve a minimum grade of \"C\" in MMC 2100, MMC 3602* and VIC 3001 will not be allowed to beco me majors in this concentration. Departmental course s that qualify as general education requirements may be counted both as gene ral education courses and as departmental requirements. While completing the pre-core curriculum course MMC 2100, students take an exam that tests basic skills and knowledge in grammar, style and usage. Students interested in becomi ng majors in the Journalism and Media Studies concentration must pass that exam with the score of at least 70%. Transfer students must also take an entrance exam that proves proficiency in grammar, style and usage at the 70% or better level. The exam is given external to classwork for transfer applicants to the major. In addition to the nine hours of pre-core curriculum co urses (MMC 2100, MMC 3602* and VIC 3001), the major requires 35 hours of required and selected courses for a total of no mo re than 44 hours in Journalism and Media Studies within the 124-hour degree requirement. Six hours in Journalism and Media Studies writing courses are a part of the graduation requirement. A 2.5 GPA in Journalism and Media Studies coursewo rk is required for graduation. A grade of \"D\" or \"F\" will not be counted toward a Journalism and Media Studies major. Journalism and Media Studies majors taking more than 44 hours of Journalism and Media Studies courses, regardless of the departments in which those courses are listed, must take those hours in addition to the 124 hours required for graduation. In particular, film, writin g, photography and other communication courses offered in other departments may be counted as part of the 44 maximum number of credits to be taken in Journalism and Media Studies courses. Please seek advising before determining which courses count as \"outside of the department\" electives and which do not. Journalism and Media Studies majors are required to take a minimum of 72 hours in courses outside the Journalism and Media Studies areas, with no fewer than 65 hours in the College of Arts and Sciences. For a student to graduate with a major in Journalism and Me dia Studies, at least twenty-two (22) hours of resident department courses on the USFSP campus are required. All material submitted by students as assignments in writing, reporting, editing, photography and digital news gathering and production classes is subject to publication or broadcas t. The department uses a variety of print and electronic media outlets. Sign Language may be used as an option by Journalism and Media Studies majors to fulfill the lang uage requirement. Most Journalism and Media Studies courses have prerequisites as specified in the course de scription (these prerequisites are separate from the state -mandated common prerequisites fo r program admission). Refer to each prerequisite listed to determine progressive prerequisites for each course. Stud ents also should note that Journalism and Media Studies major is a four-semester program. As courses are offered in a sequenced way over semesters and academic years, it may be impossible to complete the major in fewer than four academic semesters, not including summer.

Minor in Geospatial Sciences (GSSP) 00.0000 Geospatial Science is the quantitative an d analytical study of relationships of ev ents and processes in space and time. In recent years, powerful new technologies and techniques ha ve emerged that greatly improve our ability to acquire, archive, analyze and communicate information regarding peop le, places and other processe s on or near the Earth's surface. These same technologies and analytical frameworks allow us to combine this information into multi-tiered databases describing complex and inter-related aspects of ou r physical and social world. Such databases can then be analyzed in novel ways that take the spatial nature of disparate phenomen a and processes into account. The insights produced by these analyses are revolutionizing many fields of science including environmental science, oceanography, geology, criminology, an d anthropology. These analyses also facilitate decision making, government operations in- cluding emergency response and disaster recovery planning . It also helps market analysis for businesses. Through now-commonplace consumer products such as web-based ma pping systems and Global Positing Systems (GPS) units integrated with cellular phones are directly impact ing the everyday lives of ordinary individuals. The mission of the minor in the Geospatial Sciences progra m is to offer students with a broad understanding of the fundamental theories and concepts underlying spatial anal ysis, hands-on experience with contemporary Geospatial Science hardware and software, and experience with the applic ation of geospatial analysis to contemporary problems in environmental management, urban planning, business management, disease and health management, crime analysis and other fields.

Requirements for Admission to the Kate Tiedemann College of Business Admission to the Kate Tiedemann College of Business is based upon availability of faculty and space within each disci- pline.

Individual cour ses will be evaluated by an academic advisor and appro- priately credited toward requirements in the student's program at USF St. Petersburg. Florida public junior/community college students enrolled in an Associate in Arts (AA) program should normally com- plete the general education requirements and the State Mandated Common Prerequisites at the junior/community KATE TIEDEMANN COLLEGE OF BUSINESS Kate Tiedemann College of Business129 college. As a rule, AA students should av oid taking any business courses at the j unior/community college that are listed as 3000 and 4000 level courses at USF St. Petersburg. Normally , courses in finance, marketing, management, and ac- counting, as well as other business and economics courses, ta ken at the lower division leve l that are offered as upper division courses at USF St. Petersburg will not be accepted for upper division credit in business or economics. Exceptions to this policy will be made only upon proper validation of such courses. Vali dation consists of written examinations prepared and administered by the College of Business or by successfully completing specif ied advanced courses in the discipline. Students who earned an AS from a Fl orida public institution are not auto matically admissible to the Universi- ties. Students who earned an AS in Firefighting or Dental Hygienist, for example, are not admitted without additional credentials. The AS (in Florida) in Business Administration is an articulated program so those students are admissi- ble. If the AS in not in Business, the student needs to co ntact Admissions to find out if the University will admit them, and if they are admissible, they will be referred to Business Advising. Florida public junior/community college students pursuing an Associate of Science (AS) pr ogram in any other discipline should contact the USF St. Petersburg Office of Admiss ions, BAY 128, (727) 873-4142 for information regarding course transferability and degree articulation.

Global business (or International business as it is popularly known) refers to business that is conducted across national borders. Companies who pursue cross-border business activi ty are called multinational firms. These firms face unique challenges due to differences in countr y-specific political, economic, social, cultural, technological, institutional, regulatory, and organizational contexts. Indeed, the very na ture of global business usua lly impacts several functional areas within firms. Thus, to be profitable, multinationals must systematically understan d the intricacies of global business. In fact, given the inter-conn ectedness among world economies, even purely domestic firms are not immune from the above imperative. The Global Business major provides a holistic basis for acquiring this proficiency. Program Overview: The Global Business program (24 credit hours) o ffers a wide range of internationally-oriented 'business' as well as 'non-business' courses. Students also have the opportunity to particip ate in a Study-abroad course that synthesizes the Global Business program experience. Career Opportunities: Global business accounts for approximately 20% of Florida's economy. According to a recent study, South Florida is home to 1,200 multinationals with co mbined revenues of over U$ 200 billion, including more than 40 billion-dollar multinationals. Moreover, the economic futures of Florida and the Tampa Bay area increasingly depend upon the global economy. The Tampa Bay region is home to companies that operate in a diverse range of global in- dustries such as financial services, banking, agriculture, electronics, communication, healthcare and tourism. Many of these companies are expected to recruit well-trained, talented individuals who have a thorough grasp of global business. Program Details: The Global Business program (24 credit hours) has th ree parts: i) Required major courses (12 credit hours), ii) Elective major courses (9 credit hours), and iii) Global Business Culture Experience courses (3 credit hours). The program starts with Global Business-specific core co urses. Students have the flexibility to choose Global Business and/or Global Knowledge electives that cater to students' specific interests. Moreover, the program requires students to participate in a meaningful forum that promotes greater cross-nati onal, cross-cultural awar eness of global business issues. Requirements for the B.A./B.S. Degree: A minimum of 24 credit hours are required for the Global Business major. Within the 120-credit hour program listed in the General Requirements section, students must complete a minimum of 21 hours of upper-level Global Business Required major cour ses and/or Elective major courses (beyond the Foundation courses for business) plus 3 hours of Glob al Business Culture Experience course.

Marketing deals with people who are constantly changing in their needs, want s, and desires; and coupled with these changing tastes is a fiercely competitive environment sustaine d by all the resources of a rapidly evol ving technology.

The curriculum is designed to develop students' leader ship potential and improve students' pl anning, organizational, and managerial skills. USF St. Petersburg has partnership agreements with Clearwater Christian College , Eckerd College and St Pe- tersburg College. Army ROTC training is divided into two phases: the first two years constitute the Basic Course; the last two the Advanced Course. The Department offers both a four- and a tw o-year program, each leading to a commission as a Second Lieu- tenant in the United States Army. The four-year program requires completion of the Basic Course, a five-week field training course, and the Advanced Course. Students with prior active military service or pr evious training at military schools may be exempt from some or all of the Basic Cour se. Students with questions co ncerning the various options should contact the Professor of Military Science for more in formation. Enrollment is open to qualified students at all levels, including graduate students. Offerings are published each semester. Army ROTC training provides scholarships, pay, free uniforms and textbooks. Scholarships are awarded on a competitive basis in all academic majors. The scholarship pays full tuition or room and board, books, lab and mandatory fees, and certain other academic expenses. All Advanced Course and scholarship students receive a monthly subsistence payment that ranges from $300.00 as a freshman to $500.00 as a senior . This is in addition to the pay of approximately $700.00 while attending the five-week field training course at the Leadership Development and Assessment Course at Fort Lewis, Washington. Additional skills training: Airborne School, Air Assault Sc hool, and the Northern Warfare School are available to both Basic and Advanced Course students during semester breaks. A dditional skills training and internships are also available during the academic and summer session year to include first aid, rappelling, orienteering, color guards, etc. Basic Course: The Basic Course consists of four semesters of classr oom instruction of one and a half hour each week and a leadership lab . Students incur no military commitment by participating in the Basic Course. In lieu of attending the basic course classroom instruction, a student may attend the four-week Leadership Training Course at Fort Knox, Kentucky during the summer of the student's sophomore year. Advanced Course: The Advanced Course consists of four semesters of classroom instruction of three hours each week, leadership lab, physical fitness and field training exercises, and a five-week training phase at Leadership Development and Assessment Course . The Advanced Course is designed to prepare th e student who desires to be a Professional Army Officer for duty, either Active Army, Reserve or National Guard. Additional follow-on training is available to selected cadets at both US based and overseas active Army units. Job Opportunities: The newly commissioned officer can be guaranteed Reserve or National Guard duty, or compete for an Active Duty commission. Prior to commissioning the studen t may request to serve in a number of career fields to include aviation, engineering, medi cal, law, law enforcement, logist ics, and personnel administration. Requirements for an ROTC Commission: Students who desire to earn a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army must meet the following requirements: four seme sters of the ROTC Advanced Co urse, successful completion of the Professional Military Education Courses (written co mmunication skills, computer literacy, water survival and military history), attendance at Leadership Development and Assessment Course , maintain and graduate with a min- imum of a 2.0 GPA, successful completi on of the Army Physical Fitness Test, compliance with the Army height and weight standards, and other requirem ents of the United States Army. Military Science and Leadership Faculty at USF St. Petersburg Assistant Professors of Military Science: SFC Ronald Gordon; SFC Miguel Ramirez MILITARY SCIENCE AND LEADERSHIP - ARMY RESERVE OFFICERS TRAINING CORPS (ROTC) Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System153 Courses in this catalog are identified by prefixes and numbe rs that were assigned by Florida's Statewide Course Num- bering System (SCNS). This numbering system is used by a ll public postsecondary institutions in Florida and 28 partic- ipating non-public institutions. The major purpose of this sy stem is to facilitate the tr ansfer of courses between par- ticipating institutions. Students and administrators can us e the online Statewide Course Numbering System to obtain course descriptions and specific information about course transfer between participating Florida institutions. This information is at the SCNS website at http://scns.fldoe.org . Each participating institution controls th e title, credit, and content of its own courses and recommends the first digit of the course number to indicate the level at which students no rmally take the course. Course prefixes and the last three digits of the course numbers are assigned by members of facu lty discipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Talla hassee. Individuals nominated to serve on these committees are selected to maintain a representative balance as to type of institution and di scipline field or specialization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). The list of course prefixes and numbers, along with th eir generic titles, is referred to as the \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the content of courses are re ferred to as \"statewi de course profiles.\" Example of Course Identifier Subject Level Code (first digit) Century Digit (second digit) Decade Digit (third digit) Unit Digit (fourth digit) Lab Code ENC 1 1 0 1 English Composition Lower (Freshman) Level at this institution Freshman Composition Freshman Composition Skills Freshman Composition Skills I No laboratory component in this course General Rule for Course Equivalencies Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same prefixes and same last three digits of the course number and are guaranteed to be transferable between part icipating institutions that offer the course, with a few exceptions, as listed below in Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency. For example, a freshman composition skills course is offe red by 84 different public and nonpublic postsecondary in- stitutions. Each institution us es \"ENC_101\" to identify its freshman compos ition skills course. The level code is the first digit and represents the ye ar in which students normally take the course at a specific institution. In the SCNS taxonomy, \"ENC\" means decade digit \"0\" represents \"Freshman Composition Skills,\" and the unit digit \"1\" represents \"Freshman Composition Skills I.\" In the sciences and certain other areas, a \"C\" or \"L\" after the course number is known as a lab indicator. The \"C\" represents a combined lecture and laboratory course that meet s in the same place at the same time. The \"L\" represents a laboratory course or the laboratory part of a course that has the same prefix and course number but meets at a dif- ferent time or place. Transfer of any successfully completed course from one partic ipating institution to another is guaranteed in cases where the course to be transfer red is equivalent to one offered by the receivin g institution. Equivalencies are established by the same prefix and last three digits and comparable facult y credentials at both institutions. For example, ENC 1101 is offered at a community college. The same course is o ffered at a state university as ENC 2101. A student who has successfully completed ENC 1101 at a Florid a College System institution is guarante ed to receive transfer credit for ENC 2101 at the state university if the student transfers. The student cannot be re quired to take ENC 2101 again since ENC 1101 is equivalent to ENC 2101. Transfer credit must be awarded for successfully completed equivalent courses and used by the receiving institution to determine satisfaction of requirements by transfer st udents on the same basis as credit awarded to the native students. It is the prerogativ e of the receiving institution, however, to offer transfer credit for courses successfully completed that have not been designated as equivalent. NOTE: Credit generated at institutions on the quarter-term system may not transfer th e equivalent number of credits to institutions on the se- mester-term system. For example, 4.0 quarter ho urs often transfers as 2.67 semester hours. FLORIDA 'S STATEWIDE COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM 154Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System The Course Prefix The course prefix is a three-letter designator for a major di vision of an academic discipline, subject matter area, or sub-category of knowledge. The prefix is not intended to id entify the department in which a course is offered. Rather, the content of a course determines the as signed prefix to identify the course. Authority for Acceptance of Equivalent Courses Section 1007.24(7), Florida Statutes, states: Any student who transfers among postsecond ary institutions that are fully accred ited by a regional or national ac- crediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education and that participate in the statewide course numbering system shall be awarded credit by the receivin g institution for courses satisfactorily completed by the student at the previous institutions. Credit shall be awar ded if the courses are judged by the appropriate statewide course numbering system faculty committees representing sc hool districts, public post secondary educational institu- tions, and participating nonpublic postsecondary educational institutions to be academic ally equivalent to courses offered at the receiving institution, incl uding equivalency of faculty credentials, regardless of the public or nonpublic control of the previous institution. The Department of Educat ion shall ensure that credits to be accepted by a receiving institution are generated in courses for which the faculty po ssess credentials that are comparable to those required by the accrediting association of the receivin g institution. The award of credit may be limited to courses that are entered in the statewide course numbering system . Credits awarded pursuant to this subs ection shall satisfy institutional re- quirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students. Exceptions to the Genera l Rule for Equivalency Since the initial implementation of the SCNS, specific disc iplines or types of courses ha ve been excepted from the guarantee of transfer for equivalent courses. These include varying topics courses that mu st be evaluated individually, or applied courses in which the student must be evaluated fo r mastery of skill and techniqu e. The following courses are exceptions to the general rule for course equivalencies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution. A. Courses not offered by the receiving institution. B. For courses at non-regionally accredited institutions, cour ses offered prior to the establ ished transfer date of the course in question. C. Courses in the _900-999 series are not auto matically transferable, and must be evaluated individually. These include such courses as Special Topics, Intern ships, Apprenticeships, Practica, Study Abroad, Thesis and Dissertations. D. Applied academics for adult education courses. E. Graduate courses. F. Internships, apprenticeships, practica, clinical experiences and study abroad courses with numbers other than those ranging from 900-999. G. Applied courses in the performing arts (Art, Dance, Interior Design, Music, and Theatre) and skills courses in Criminal Justice (academy certificate courses) are not guaranteed as transferable . These courses need evidence of achievement (i.e., portfolio, audition, interview, etc.). Courses at Non-regionally Accredited Institutions The Statewide Course Numbering System makes available on its home page (http://scns.fldoe.org) a report entitled \"Courses at Non-regionally Accredited Institutions\" that co ntains a comprehensive listing of all nonpublic institution courses in the SCNS inventory, as well as each course's transf er level and transfer effective date. This report is updated monthly.
