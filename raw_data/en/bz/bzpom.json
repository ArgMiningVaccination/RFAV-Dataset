This formula is an excellent Yin Jing formula which cools down your body and listed ingredients provide deep Kidney Jing reserves according to theTCM materia medica. Since it is a cooling formula and might not be suitable for individuals who tends to feels cold unless they use it with some warming herbs have tried various supplements and hair/skin/nails formulas for years to help reduce hair fall - most of them do nothing or work for a little while and stop working.... i looked into chinese herbs and this product contains most of the favourite herbs to help hair - so i really wanted to give it a try. I've almost finished the bottle now and i really am impressed. my hair fall is just a few pieces each day in my brush. i hope with continued use it will thicken my hair also. thanks! I started using this product from a brand that I like - Vital Treasures - a few weeks ago and I already noticed a clear improvement in my nails and hair. The quality of this product is excellent because the ingredients are all natural without any harmful fillers. No after taste and good pill size, and its effects are visible quite quickly. I highly recommend it. It's a great product for hair health. It makes the hair softer and silker, as it also increases hair vitality. It is a good product, you can take for a couple of months, stop then repeat the intake. The supplement contains FoTi root, so it is best to take for shorter periods of time, pausing the intake and then repeating, as necessary. "}
