White blood cells are part of the immune system and NK cells are a type of white blood cell that are known to kill cancer cells. This clinical trial will enroll patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma of B-cell origin and is conducted in two phases. The primary objectives of Phase 1 are as follows: 1) to evaluate the safety of AB-101 given alone or in combination with rituximab (including the DLBCL specific cohort) or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab; 2) to evaluate the potential clinical activity of AB-101 when given in combination with rituximab or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (combination cohorts only); and 3) to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The primary objective of Phase 2 is to determine whether AB-101 in combination with rituximab or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab has anti-cancer activity in patients. Patients will be assigned to receive either AB-101 alone as monotherapy, in combination with rituximab (including DLBCL specific cohort) or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab. All patients will receive at least 1 treatment cycle of AB-101, followed by scheduled assessments of overall health and tumor response. Patients receiving AB-101 in combination with rituximab may receive up to 3 additional cycles of treatment. Patients receiving AB-101 in combination with bendamustine and rituximab may receive up to 5 additional cycles of treatment. Patients enrolled into the DLBCL specific cohort receiving AB-101 in combination with rituximab may receive up to 3 cycles of treatment.

Mutations, or changes, in ALK can make it very active and important for tumor cell growth and progression. Crizotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the ALK protein from working. Crizotinib may be an effective treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer and an ALK fusion mutation. La Jolla, California and other locations [Ibrutinib, Rituximab, Etoposide, Prednisone, Vincristine Sulfate, Cyclophosphamide, With HIV-Positive Stage II-IV Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT03220022) open to eligible people ages 18 years and up This phase I trial studies the side effect and best dose of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive stage II-IV diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ibrutinib and etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with HIV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. La Jolla, California and other locations [Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Treating Patients With HIV Associated Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma or Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT02408861) open to eligible people ages 18 years and up This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab when given with ipilimumab in treating patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory), or solid tumors that have spread from where it first started to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Ipilimumab is an antibody that acts against a molecule called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 controls a part of the immune system by shutting it down. Nivolumab is a type of antibody that is specific for human programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), a protein that is responsible for destruction of immune cells. Giving ipilimumab with nivolumab may work better in treating patients with HIV associated classical Hodgkin lymphoma or solid tumors compared to ipilimumab with nivolumab alone. La Jolla, California and other locations [Rituximab With or Without Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Minimal Residual Disease-Negative Mantle Cell Lymphoma in First Complete Remission](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT03267433) open to eligible people ages 18-70 This randomized phase III trial studies rituximab after stem cell transplant and to see how well it works compared with rituximab alone in treating patients with in minimal residual disease-negative mantle cell lymphoma in first complete remission. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving chemotherapy before a stem cell transplant helps kill any cancer cells that are in the body and helps make room in the patient's bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored. More chemotherapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy. Giving rituximab with or without stem cell transplant may work better in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma. La Jolla, California and other locations [Study of Tazemetostat Versus Placebo When Given in Combination With Lenalidomide and Rituximab in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Follicular Lymphoma](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT04224493) open to eligible people ages 18 years and up The participants of this study would have relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It is referred to as 'relapsed' when the disease has come back after treatment and 'refractory' when treatment no longer works. Stage 1 of this trial will study the safety and the level that adverse effects of each of the study drug combinations can be tolerated (known as tolerability). It is also designed to establish a recommended study drug dosage for stage 2 and 3. Stage 2 and 3 will evaluate and compare how long participants live without their disease getting worse when receiving the study drug in combination with other drug treatment versus the placebo (dummy drug) in combination with other drug treatment.

Monoclonal antibodies, such as ofatumumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Bortezomib may also stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether ofatumumab and bendamustine hydrochloride are more effective with bortezomib in treating patients with follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) will be treated in this study. Subjects will be assessed for their risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a potentially serious side effect associated with venetoclax and rituxan. TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can lead to kidney failure or abnormal heart rhythm. Depending on their TLS risk, patients will be assigned to one of two treatment arms. Patients who are at high risk for TLS at baseline will receive HDMP/Rituximab for 1 cycle before beginning venetoclax. Patients who are at low risk for TLS at baseline will not receive HDMP/Rituximab and will instead start directly with venetoclax. Once the proper dose of venetoclax is reached, both arms will continue venetoclax for up to 2 years and receive rituximab for 5 cycles. The purpose is to determine if HDMP/Rituximab prior to venetoclax is efficient at reducing tumor burden and lowering the risk of developing TLS. Although all of these drugs are approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with CLL or SLL, and although the combination of rituximab and venetoclax is approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with CLL or SLL, the combination and dosing schedule in this trial are considered experimental.

Genetic tests look at the unique genetic material (genes) of patients' tumor cells. Patients with genetic abnormalities (such as mutations, amplifications, or translocations) may benefit more from treatment which targets their tumor's particular genetic abnormality. Identifying these genetic abnormalities first may help doctors plan better treatment for patients with solid tumors, lymphomas, or multiple myeloma.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Giving atezolizumab, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and rituximab may work better in treating patients with transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
