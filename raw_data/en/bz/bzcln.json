In both CD and UC, the disease is characterized by bouts of inflammation (relapses or flares) and periods with remission. In CD, the intestinal histology shows inflammation, frequently transmural and often granulomatous, and the disease can involve the entire length of the gastro-intestinal tract in a discontinuous manner. UC on the other hand, only involves the colon where it causes a continuous mucosal inflammation, typically starting from the rectum and spreading proximally. In adult UC patients, the disease often present with inflammation limited to the rectum, while children with UC regularly present with more extensive and severe disease in the whole colon, or pancolitis.(1) During diagnostic endoscopy, approximately 5-15% of patients have a phenotype that bares similarities with both CD and UC.(2-4) These patients are then diagnosed as IBD-unclassified (IBD-U). After two years, 40% of these patients are reclassified as either CD or UC.(5) A recent systematic review of population-based studies reported the highest prevalence values of IBD in Europe with UC found in approximately 5 of 1000 individuals and CD in approximately 3 of 1000 individuals.(6) In 3-25% of the patients with IBD the disease develops during childhood or adolescence.(7-12) This wide variation may be caused by differences in definitions of pediatric IBD, with upper age limits varying from 15 to 20 years.(9) The pathogenesis of IBD is multifactorial, and generally believed to be the result of variations in four components; 1) the patient's genetic make-up, 2) the surrounding environment, 3) the composition of the gut microbiota, and 4) the reactivity of the intestinal immune response (see figure 1A).(13) As young children have been less exposed to environmental factors than adults, genetic factors and a dysregulated immune response might play a bigger role in the pathogenesis of early-onset IBD (see figure 1B). 11 1Figure 1. (A) The 4 components involved in IBD pathogenesis. (B) In paediatric-onset disease genetic factors and a dysregulated immune response probably contribute more to the disease pathogenesis than environmential factors and the microbiome. Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pediatric IBD Figure 2 shows the diagnosic proces of IBD. CD and UC typically manifest with symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fatigue and weight loss. Additional findings during physical examination include growth delay, abdominal tenderness or perianal disease (fistulae, anal skin tags, or fissures). Blood tests including thrombocytosis, anaemia or leukocytosis, and increased inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may further increase the probability of IBD. Stool tests with raised calprotectin concentration in the absence of colon pathogens will further raise suspicion for IBD.(14) The gold standard to diagnose IBD is endoscopic evaluation of the mucosal layer in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract with histopathological biopsies.(15) Endoscopy is an invasive and for the patient burdensome procedure, which is mostly performed under general anesthesia or deep sedation in children and teenagers. When endoscopy fails to provide a diagnosis or is incomplete, despite a high clinical suspicion of CD, evaluation of the small intestine is advised with intestinal 12 1ultrasound, magnetic resonance enterography or small bowel capsule endoscopy.(16) Figure 2. Diagnostic work-up IBD. Current treatment strategies When a diagnosis of IBD is confirmed, the patient is usually advised to start induction therapy as well as maintenance therapy with the aim to reach disease remission and reduce the number of flares, respectively. The ideal induction therapy has a rapid onset of action, and the maintenance therapy may have a slower onset of action and preferably has fewer side effects. Additional treatment goals in paediatric IBD compared to adult-onset IBD is to secure a normal growth and pubertal development. The conventional treatment strategy is based on the \"step-up\" principle.(17) Patients with active CD start remission-induction treatment with steroids and gradual dose tapering, or with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) for 6 weeks. Patients with active UC and IBD-U start remission-induction treatment with steroids and aminosalicylate dose escalation. Maintenance therapy in CD includes a thiopurine (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) or methotrexate, and in UC or IBD-U aminosalicylate monotherapy or combination therapy with a thiopurine. Step up to anti-TNF therapy is indicated after failure (nonresponse, loss of response or intolerance) of conventional therapy.13 1The need for risk-profiling at diagnosis When the first line of induction and maintenance therapy does not adequately control the underlying intestinal inflammation, it may take weeks or even months before a step-up to more potent medications is made. When active inflammation of the gut mucosa is not recognized and suppressed in a timely fashion, bowel damage will continue (see figure 3).(18) This may result in a complicated disease course defined by development of penetrating and/or stricturing Crohn's disease and an increased risk for bowel surgery. In UC patients, complicated disease is defined as the the need for colectomy.(19) Figure 3. Complicated disease course of a patient with ongoing active CD (18) Several trials have shown that early use of anti-TNF therapy is associated with improved outcomes and fewer complications in adult as well as in paediatric patients with CD.(20-26) Current paediatric guidelines do not advise the use of anti-TNFs for all patients with IBD, but specify a few exceptional conditions that warrant early and ongoing use of anti-TNF agents, including perianal fistulizing disease, growth failure, or extra-intestinal manifestations.(27) A considerable proportion of the patients with IBD have a relatively favorable disease course, with low risk of developing disease related complications. For those, treatment with anti-TNF therapy may be too agressive, with a higher risk of serious drug-related adverse events (e.g. infusion reactions, serious opportunistic infections and immune-mediated dermatological conditions such as vasculitis or drug-induced lupus) and higher 14 1costs.(28-30) Therefore, in patients with a low risk for a complicated disease course, it may be better to follow a conventional step-up treatment schedule. Identification of predictors for a complicated disease course at diagnosis and in the early phases of treatment may allow physicians to tailor the treatment and select patients at risk of complicated disease for an \"accelerated\" step-up to anti-TNF therapy and prevent overtreatment in others. Previous studies[REFs] have identified a few prognostic factors that may predict the need for early anti-TNF use (see table 1). Personalized medicine is defined by some as a medical model that separates people into different groups with medical decisions, practices, interventions and/or products being tailored to the individual patient based on their predicted response or risk of disease.(31) The identification of high and low risk patients may therefore be seen as an important part of personalized medicine. Monitoring response to treatment Once treatment has started, regular checks if the intervention is having the desired effect are warranted. Conventional monitoring in paediatric IBD used to be based on the control of symptoms, which means that a reduction in the severity of symptoms was already considered as a treatment success. The correlation between symptom scores and endoscopy-confirmed mucosal inflammation is poor.(37-39) Teenagers who claim to have no symptoms may still have macroscopic or microscopic intestinal inflammation. Such a smouldering disease activity may eventually lead to complications such as growth and pubertal delay.(20,22) Previous studies have shown that patients who achieve clinical as well as laboratory and endoscopic remission have better long- term outcomes than patients with only clinical remission.(40,41) In modern-day IBD care, the ultimate treatment goal is shifting from symptom control towards reaching and maintaining mucosal healing (MH).(42-46) MH is defined as the complete recovery of the intestinal mucosa, and physicians consider it as the most important therapeutic target when treating IBD patients.(44,45) MH is ideally evaluated with endoscopy and histological confirmation, but due to costs and its invasive nature, this method vis not practical when monitoring the response to treatment. 15 1Patient factors Very early onset disease Stunting (height-for-age below 2.5 standard deviations at diagnosis) Wasting (Weight-for-height below - 2.5 standard deviations at diagnosis) Disease factors Deep colonic ulcerations on endoscopy Extensive (pan-enteric) disease (pancolitis) Stricturing and penetrating disease (B2 and/or B3 disease behavior) at onset Severe perianal disease Acute Severe Colitis at diagnosis Low serum albumin (<3.5 g/dL) Extra-intestinal manifestations (joint, skin and ocular manifestations, and primary sclerosing cholangitis) Initial treatment response Lack of response on conventional induction therapy PUCAI score of 10 at 3 monthsTable 1. Predictors of complicated disease in children, defined as the need for early anti-TNF treatment or surgery. (27,32-36) 16 1The ideal monitoring test is non-invasive, simple to conduct, and easily interpretable. It should detect an imminent disease flare - often undetectable by symptom-based reporting alone - and makes provision for proactive treatment optimization.(47) Surrogate markers of intestinal inflammation, that might replace invasive procedures to determine the mucosal condition, have increasingly been studied in IBD. In Table 2, several frequently used markers of disease activity are compared and evaluated for their suitability as a monitoring test in IBD. Fecal calprotectin (FC) correlates well with colonic inflammation and is the most sensitive marker of active disease compared to other frequently used surrogate markers as CRP and symptom-based clinical scoring systems, including the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) , Harvey Bradshaw Index, Pediatric CDAI, Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index and the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI).(36,48-55) Imaging techniques like capsule endoscopy, MR enterography and intestinal ultrasound are mainly of value when the inflammation is located in the small bowel.(56-59) Calprotectin is a protein released by activated or damaged granulocytes which can be measured in the stool. Measurement is most commonly performed by testing sent-in stool samples with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at the hospital laboratory. For patients with IBD in remission, elevated FC has been identified as a predictor for relapse during follow-up. (60-68) The researchers of a recent systematic review concluded that repeated testing of FC is useful for early recognition of a disease flare and timely adjustment of therapy plans.(47) It seems reasonable that when rising FC levels can be used to detect intestinal inflammation, normalization of FC levels can be used to assess recovery of the mucosa and success of induction treatment. Multiple studies have used FC to evaluate the efficacy of new therapeutics in IBD, but the literature about the diagnostic accuracy of FC for monitoring response to treatment has not been systematically reviewed. Whether FC is used to monitor response to treatment, or to detect an imminent relapse, in both cases it is important to realize that the FC test results can be influenced by multiple sources of variation, including biological variation, pre-analytical variation and analyticial variation (see Figure 4). Biological variation refers to fluctuations within the same subject inlcudering severity of mucosal inflammation and contact time between stool and mucosa for saturation with calprotectin. Pre-analytical variation 17 1refers to differences in stool collection technique, stool transport and stool storage. Analytical variation refers to differences in precision and type of assay to measure calprotectin.(69) More information about these potential sources of variability is needed to create accurate handling procedures, to keep the variability as small as possible and to get reliable FC testing results.

Reversly, 50-80% of the patients who present with PSC have or will develop concurrent IBD.(71) IBD in PSC has specific clinical and endoscopical features and should probably be distinguished from UC and CD without PSC.(72) Patients with PSC-IBD typically have a right-sided colonic involvement, rectal sparing, and relatively mild inflammatory disease behaviour.(72,73) It has recently be suggested that PSC-IBD not only has a different phenotype than isolated UC and CD, but may also have a distinct genetic pattern.(74) In most patients, PSC presents between the age of 25 and 40 years, but it is also recognized as an important cause of chronic liver disease in children.(75-78) The disease causes inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts, which leads to complicated hepatobiliary disease, including cholangitis, hepatic cirrhosis, and liver failure and is potentially fatal.(77,79) Common symptoms include fatigue, pruritis, fever, chills, night sweats, and right upper quadrant pain. There is no curative therapy available for PSC and quality-of-life undermining complications may eventually justify a liver transplantation. In 20 to 25% of the transplanted patients the disease recurs within 10 years.(76) In patients who already have the diagnosis of IBD, recognition of the early stages of PSC is not easy. The symptoms are initially nonspecific and intestinal disease is frequently more prominent In IBD patients a transient rise of liver enzymes can be caused by the acute inflammation in the intestine or secondary to medication.(71) The most classical form of PSC is called large-duct PSC. Multifocal bile ducts or beading of the biliary tree is often detected by an abnormal cholangiogram. Small-duct PSC is diagnosed when the cholangiogram is normal, but liver histology shows characteristics strongly suggestive of PSC, like the presence bile (also called autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis, ASC) is diagnosed when signs of large or small duct PSC are combined with increased levels of transaminases, hypergammaglobulinaemia and autoantibodies, and when 21 1histologic findings of autoimmune hepatitis are detected. It is suggested by several studies that small-duct PSC and ASC are more common in childhood-onset PSC and that childhood- onset PSC tends to present with milder disease and have more favourable outcomes compared to adult-onset PSC.(78,82) The aetiology of PSC is likely to be multifactorial, with environmental factors triggering the occurrence of PSC in genetically susceptible hosts, a so called complex disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over thirthy risk loci (genetic locus associated with a certain trait) for PSC, but a large part of the estimated heritability remains unexplained. It has been speculated that rare variants with large effect size may play a role in the onset of complex disorders, but these variants are so rare in allele frequency (many private mutations) that their genetic signals are not detected in GWAS studies (see figure 5). Over 85% of known monogenic disease- causing mutations reside within gene coding regions.(83) Therefore, whole-exome sequencing (WES), in which the entire set of exons in the genome (the exome) is sequenced, has revolutionized our ability to identify rare variants in patients and assess their role in disease onset. Figure 5. \"Manhattan skyline\" plot. From a distance, you can only appreciate the buildings (genetic variants) over 200 meters height (the grey dotted line). The tiny white house (rare genetic variant) does not get noticed as it is overshadowed by the concrete jungle of skyscrapers.22 1Since young children have been less exposed to environmental factors than adults, monogenic variants play a bigger role in the pathogenesis of childhood-onset disease (see figure 6). Monogenic forms of other complex diseases have already been discovered, for instance in very-early-onset IBD, early-onset chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and early-onset diabetes.(84-87) In line with these findings, we suspect that this might also be the case for early-onset PSC but whether there are also monogenic forms of early-onset PSC, has not been investigated yet. Figure 6. Highest concentration of monogenic forms of diseases at youngest age. 23 1OUTLINE OF THIS THESIS This thesis will address three themes; 1. Personalizing treatment-strategies 2. Optimizing accuracy of fecal calprotectin measurements in disease monitoring 3. Profiling patients with childhood-onset sclerosing cholangitis Part I - Personalizing treatment-strategies Reaching and maintaining mucosal healing, is considered to be the most important therapeutic target when managing adult IBD patients, and stool calprotectin concentrations in the target range are now frequently used as surrogate for mucosal healing. In chapter 2 we perform a systematic review to determine if falling FC levels back to a predefined FC target range could predict success of induction treatment and healing of the intestinal lining. Early use of anti-TNF therapy is associated with improved outcomes and fewer complications in adult as well as in paediatric patients.(20-24) In the Netherlands the paediatric IBD treatment guidelines are still based on a step-up principle and accelarated step-up to anti-TNF agents is only recommended in a few exceptional conditions. Risk stratification is needed to select those patients with a high risk of a complicated disease course in need of more aggressive therapies and prevention of overtreatment in low-risk patients. In chapter 3 we prospectively follow newly diagnosed children with luminal CD or UC who are initially treated with conventional induction therapy and we evaluate whether time-to-reach target calprotectin levels can be another useful prognostic factor that justifies early treatment escalation to anti- TNF agents. Despite therapeutic advances over the last decades, the arsenal of treatment options in IBD has remained relatively limited. Therefore, optimizing existing treatment schedules and disease monitoring possibilities are of utmost importance to improve patient outcomes. Methotrexate (MTX) is an immunomodulating drug that can be used to maintain remission in patients with CD, 24 1but data on efficacy and tolerability in children and teenagers are scarce. Furthermore, unfamiliarity with MTX makes peadiatric gastroenterlogists frequently omit this drug and move on to anti- TNF agents. In chapter 4 we evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of MTX monotherapy in a retrospective multicentre cohort study and include patient data from 6 university and 4 general teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Part II - Optimizing accuracy of fecal calprotectin measurements in disease monitoring Fecal calprotectin is widely believed to be a stable stool marker. Accordingly, many hospitals facilitate patients by allowing them to send their stool samples at room temperature to the laboratory. However, actual evidence for stability at room temperature is scarce. In chapter 5 we test whether the calprotectin concentration remains stable in stool samples stored at room temperature and compare it to the calprotectin concentrations measured in stool samples stored at 4 and -20 degrees Celsius. Calprotectin-guided disease monitoring is most commonly done by periodically measuring calprotectin in sent-in stool samples with ELISA in the hospital laboratory. Several manufacturers recently introduced a lateral flow-based test and a software application that turns an ordinary smartphone camera into a reader for quantitative measurements at home. In chapter 6 we perform the first study that compares three home tests and their corresponding ELISA tests to assess which of the pairs has the best agreement. Part III - Profiling patients with childhood-onset sclerosing cholangitis It is suggested in several papers that childhood-onset PSC presents with milder disease and has a more favourable outcome compared to adult-onset PSC. In chapter 7 , to compare outcomes between paediatric- and adult onset PSC, we evaluate time-to- complication curves in two independent pediatric-onset cohorts from the same geographical area in the Netherlands. Following the recent discoveries of monogenic forms of other complex (auto-)immune diseases we hypothesize that the disease 25 1in a fraction of patients with early-onset PSC is caused by rare genetic variants, resembling a monogenic inheritance pattern. In chapter 8 we screen the exonic regions of all the genes in patients with childhood-onset PSC and their biological parents using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and perform patient-parents trio- analyses to identify possible monogenic forms of PSC. In chapter 9 , the implications for clinical practice and future studies will be discussed. 26 1REFERENCES 1. Van Limbergen J, Russell RK, Drummond HE, Aldhous Round NK, ER, et al.

Spectrum of mutations in monogenic diabetes genes identified from high-throughput DNA sequencing of CALPROTECTIN FOR MONITORING RESPONSE TO INDUCTION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH ACTIVE INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS Sjoukje-Marije Haisma 2Background : Fecal calprotectin (FC) is currently the most frequently used biomarker for intestinal inflammation. Whether repeated testing of FC is useful to assess the effect of induction therapy in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease has not been evaluated systematically. We aimed to determine if bringing FC levels back to a predefined target range corresponds with achieving endoscopic remission. Methods : Medline and Embase were searched from inception to August 2018. We included studies with FC measurements and endoscopy performed before and after induction therapy. Methodological assessment was based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist. For each study, the positive and negative likelihood ratio of FC were analyzed. Results : A total of 1516 papers were screened; 332 were retrieved for full text review. Four studies met our strict eligibility criteria for inclusion. A post-induction FC in the target range is 50 (16 to 160) times as likely to be seen in patients with endoscopic remission, as opposed to patients who failed to reach remission. Limitation : The authors of four potentially relevant papers were contacted but could not release the requested data. Conclusions : A FC shift into the target range during induction therapy suggests treatment success. A cutpoint of 250 \u00b5g/g is the most frequently reported upper threshold of the target range, but a prospective controlled trial in a clinical setting is necessary to confirm whether this is the most appropriate cutpoint in terms of patient outcome and resource use. ABSTRACT42 2Active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) damages the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and causes irreversible bowel damage if disease remission is not restored in a timely fashion.(1) The reference standard to determine therapeutic success in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is the resolution of ulceration at (ileo)colonoscopy, a state also known as mucosal healing (MH).(2) There is no evidence-based consensus of when best to reassess disease activity after a change in therapy,(3) but frequent endoscopic reevaluation is impractical and patient acceptance for repeated procedures may be low. There is a growing need to replace invasive diagnostics by surrogate non-invasive markers. Calprotectin is a protein released by activated or damaged neutrophils and concentrations measured in stool correlate well with neutrophil migration to the but fecal calprotectin (FC) is currently the most frequently used marker of gastrointestinal inflammation. Several studies have shown that fecal calprotectin (FC) correlates well with colonic inflammation.(8-10) Initial studies suggested that FC may be less sensitive in isolated small bowel disease, but a well-conducted meta-analysis demonstrated that the diagnostic yield of FC is also significant for detection of active disease in the small bowel. (11) Single measurements of FC have been shown to be useful in the initial diagnosis of IBD (12) and repeated measurements of FC facilitate early recognition of disease flares in asymptomatic patients.(13) Whether repeated testing of FC is also useful to monitor the effect of induction therapy has not been evaluated in a systematic review. Since calprotectin is a neutrophil-derived protein, it may not help to determine if the bowel is in the repair phase. The ultimate aim of induction therapy is to achieve MH, or to bring FC levels back to a predefined target range that corresponds with MH. In the current systematic review we aim to determine if bringing FC levels back to a predefined target range really corresponds with healing of the intestinal mucosa and treatment success.INTRODUCTION43 2Eligibility criteria Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies and case-control studies, that followed at least 10 patients with active IBD, started with induction therapy and had at least two consecutive FC measurements, including one at the start of induction therapy. We accepted FC test intervals up to 6 months. Studies that did not report the use of a FC target range or cut-point (either predefined or based on Receiver Operating Characteristic curves) were excluded from analysis. We only accepted endoscopy (with or without histopathological confirmation) as reference test. Success of induction therapy was defined as endoscopic remission after induction therapy. Information sources, identification and selection of studies We searched for studies published in Medline and Embase. The search strategy for Medline was ((\"Inflammatory Bowel Diseases\"[Mesh] inflammatory (('inflammatory OR period*:ab,ti)). Available studies were screened using Covidence\u00a9, an online screening tool for systematic reviews (www.covidence.org). We restricted our search to studies published in English. Duplicate articles were deleted by Covidence and also manually checked and deleted using RefWorks. For further relevant studies, we checked the reference lists of identified papers. The first selection of studies was carried out by one reviewer (SMH) on the basis of title and abstract. The full paper of each potentially eligible study was then obtained. Two authors (SMH and PvR) independently assessed full manuscripts against the predefined inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, and consensus was reached with the third author (AH). Data extraction The following characteristics were extracted from each selected study: first author, year of publication, country of origin, sample size, age group, type of induction therapy, type of IBD, proportion METHODS44 2of patients that achieved remission after induction therapy, index test with testing interval, and reference standard with testing interval. FC test characteristics per study included the used FC assay and upper limit of the FC target range with the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives. Authors were contacted in cases where information was missing to construct a two by two table. Data analysis We calculated positive likelihood ratio (LR+, i.e. FC in the target range) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-, i.e. FC out of target range) for each study and presented the data as forest plots, with 95% confidence intervals, and squares with area proportional to study weight. We used LRs instead of sensitivity and specificity because LR is less affected by the pretest probability. We calculated the mean likelihood ratio of LR+ and LR-. Computations were carried out with OpenMetaAnalyst.(14) Assessment of risk of bias The QUADAS-2 (QUality Assessment of studies of Diagnostic Accuracy included in Systematic reviews) checklist was used to assess study quality. RESULTS Study selection This review includes results of electronic searches up to 1 August 2018. A total of 1516 papers were screened, of which 332 were retrieved for full text review. Of these, 324 were excluded for not meeting the eligibility criteria. The reasons for exclusion are summarized in the flow diagram (Figure 1). The authors of four probably relevant papers (15-18) were contacted by email for additional information to construct two by two tables, but they could not release the requested data. Four papers were ultimately included in the final analysis. Study characteristics The most important study characteristics of the 8 potentially suitable studies are presented in Table 1. Four of these were eventually included in the analysis. All included studies were prospective cohort studies.(19-22) Sample size varied between 15 and 44 patients and all studies included adult participants only.45 2 In one study patients with CD were followed from the moment of initiating anti-TNF induction therapy.(22) In two other studies patients with UC were followed, from the moment of initiating anti- TNF induction therapy in one ,(19) and from the moment of any kind of induction therapy in the other.(20) In the fourth study a mixture of patients with CD and UC were followed from the introduction of any kind of induction therapy onwards.(21) In all four studies the response to treatment was verified by endoscopy. In two studies endoscopic remission was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of \u00b51.(19,20) In one study a Crohn's Disease Index of Severity (CDEIS) score < 3 was used(22) and in the fourth study a semi-quantitative four-grade scale was used (normal, mild, moderate and severe), with endoscopic remission defined as return of the endoscopic score to normal (21). The time interval between the consecutive FC measurements varied from 2 to 12 weeks. Figure 1.

All studies used a prospective study design and enrolled consecutive patients with both newly diagnosed or relapsing inflammatory bowel disease. All studies used a commercially available FC assay, and tested FC at baseline and periodically thereafter. In three studies it was unclear whether the endoscopists were blinded for the corresponding calprotectin test results.(20-22) Blinding of the laboratory personnel for the endoscopic or clinical activity outcomes was reported in only one study, but we considered the FC concentration to be a hard outcome measure which is less likely to be affected by prior clinical knowledge. Differences between studies related to FC assay type and predefined FC target range. Prognostic value All studies concluded that periodically measuring FC concentrations during induction treatment is a useful method to evaluate whether or not the therapeutic intervention is effective. Details of the FC test characteristics are presented in Table 3. The used FC target ranges varied from 58 to 250 \u00b5g/g. Figure 2 presents the forest plots of the positive likelihood ratios and negative likelihood ratios for the 4 studies. Reaching the FC target range during induction treatment corresponded well with endoscopic remission with a positive summary LR of 9 (95% CI Figure 2.

The left pane shows the positive LR of included studies (or the prognostic probability that a FC result in the target range corresponds with treatment success), the right pane shows the negative LR (or the prognostic probability that a FC result out of the target range corresponds with treatment success).

The likelihood of endoscopic remission when post-induction FC values are out of the target range is low with a negative summary LR of 0.17 (95% CI 0.07 - 0.42) and a post-test probability of 15% (13-17). In other words, a post-induction FC in the target range is 50 (16 to 160) times as likely to be seen in treatment success as opposed to treatment failure. Table 2.

In these studies data collection was done prospectively in a series of patients with active IBD. All included studies used a paired design where patients had repeated FC measurements and then endoscopy to evaluate the success of the induction therapy. A decrease of FC values into the target range corresponded well with endoscopic remission, while a failure to reach the FC target range reflected on-going intestinal inflammation. Patients whose FC values decreased into the target range during induction therapy were 50 (16-160) times as likely to have reached endoscopic remission compared to patients whose FC values decreased but did not actually reach the target. Comparison with previous studies To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that evaluated the usefulness of repeated FC measurements to monitor response to induction therapy. We are now confident that an FC-based monitoring strategy is valid throughout all phases of IBD monitoring (figure 3). Until recently the FC test was mainly used to decide whether a patient with gastrointestinal symptoms needed to undergo endoscopic evaluation for suspected IBD (phase 1), or to detect an imminent flare in asymptomatic patients (phase 3).(12,13) The use of FC to monitor response to induction therapy has recently gained interest. The majority of studies that were screened for the purpose of this meta-analysis did not use a target range, but interpreted any decrease in FC as a treatment success.(23-31) There is, however, no linear correlation between the level of FC and the severity and extent of the mucosal inflammation. A decrease of FC in phase 2, e.g. from 2000 to 800 \u00b5g/g, may seem a significant reduction, but the latter result is still indicating active disease. The difference between the measurements may be explained by an inadequate contact time between stool and inflamed tissue to sufficiently saturate the stool with calprotectin. We are of the opinion that interpreting a decrease of FC in the high range as a treatment success is misleading and leads to overinterpretation of effects in medication trials. We moved away from this potential source of bias by only including studies that used the concept of a target range.DISCUSSION55 2Treat-to-target strategies The recent gain of interest in calprotectin-based monitoring is synchronous with the introduction of the treat-to-target strategy in IBD. An expert panel (STRIDE) defined the treatment target in IBD as mucosal healing, but did not yet have a practical algorithm to achieve this goal.(2) The treat-to-target approach has been used in many areas of medicine, where treatment targets have been defined to improve quality of life and reduce the risk of end- organ damage (such as joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis and vascular complications in diabetes mellitus).(32,33) Our findings may help to further develop a treat-to-target strategy in IBD. Important steps are to decide on the upper limit of the target range and the test frequency, predefine the therapeutic algorithms, and to evaluate and confirm the cost-effectiveness of the strategy. Methodological limitations of the review Since not all studies used histopathological confirmation of disease remission, it is possible that some patients were misclassified because of absence of ulcers on endoscopy, whereas microscopic evaluation would still have shown abnormalities. Secondly, because of the limited number of studies included in this meta-analysis we were not able to identify the ideal upper limit of the target range. The target thresholds in the included studies varied from 58 to 250 \u00b5g/g. We assume that picking a low target threshold will lead to earlier treatment escalation and faster depletion of the limited arsenal of medicines. Clinical Implications The value of FC as a surrogate for treatment success was evaluated in four studies with adult patients with active IBD. The Fagan plot in figure S1 presents the prognostic values corresponding to this context. With a pre-test probability of treatment success of 50%, a post-induction FC test result in the target range provides a shift in post-test probability of treatment success to 90%, whereas a failure to reach the FC target range reduces the probability of treatment success to 15%. Although there is no consensus what FC value best demarcates the upper limit of the target range, the authors of this article use a downward trend crossing the 250 \u00b5g/g line as an indicator of treatment success. Interpreting any decrease of FC as evidence of effectiveness is probably misleading. It is more appropriate to categorize FC results into clinically meaningful ranges as 56 2endoscopic remission \u00b5g/g), active disease (>500 \u00b5g/g) and undecisive (250-500 \u00b5g/g), as shown in figure 3. Currently, there is no evidence-based consensus when best to reassess disease activity after a change in therapy. The recently published ECCO-ESGAR guideline for diagnostic assessment in IBD advises to re-evaluate disease activity approximately 12 to 26 weeks after treatment initiation. (3) Figure S1. Fagan's nomogram showing post-test probability of treatment success when FC is in the target range (blue line) or FC is still out of the target range (red line). This meta-analysis shows that a decrease of FC values into the target range corresponds with endoscopic remission, whereas a failure to reach the FC target range reflects on-going intestinal inflammation. A FC shift into the target range can be used as a surrogate marker for treatment success in clinical trials in IBD when endoscopy is impractical or poorly tolerated. The upper limit of the target range is yet to be discussed.CONCLUSION57 2 Figure 3. The phases of calprotectin-based IBD monitoring. In phase 1 (\"pretreatment\") the fecal calprotectin (FC) test is used to decide whether a patient with gastrointestinal symptoms should be exposed to endoscopy. In phase 2 (\"treat-to-target\"), induction therapy is introduced and the patient's response is periodically assessed. Phase 3 starts when induction therapy is successfully completed and FC values are in the target range (<250 \u00b5g/g). This phase involves a schedule of regular calprotectin measurements with a larger interval and a strategy what to do when a sequence of measurements suggests a drift away from the target range. Phase 2 and 3 alternate in the further course of the disease.

Manuscript accepted for publication64 365 3Objectives : Treatment targets in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) move away from controlling symptoms towards complete recovery of the intestinal mucosa. Currently, the most frequently used noninvasive surrogate marker of mucosal healing is a faecal calprotectin concentration in the target range. This study tested if there was a relation between time-to-reach target calprotectin and first relapse. Methods : We prospectively included all new-onset IBD patients aged 17 and younger in a cloud-based registry (FastForwardCare) and followed them for at least 52 weeks. They were treated according to Dutch national guidelines that advocate a step- up approach. Time-to-reach target was defined as the first calprotectin measurement below 250 \u00b5g/g after the start of induction therapy. Time-to-first relapse was defined as the time from the first calprotectin measurement below 250 \u00b5g/g until reintroduction of induction therapy. Time-to-first-flare was the time from the first calprotectin measurement below 250 \u00b5g/g until reappearance of symptoms with calprotectin values above 250 \u00b5g/g. Results : We included 76 patients (luminal Crohn's disease (CD) 43); ulcerative colitis (UC) 33). Median age at diagnosis was respectively 14.5 and 14.1 years. Median time-to-reach target calprotectin was 37 weeks in CD and 11 weeks in UC patients (Log-rank test, p=0.001). Once the calprotectin target was reached, time-to-first flare was significantly longer in CD than in UC patients (Log-rank test, p=0.001). CD patients with time-to-reach target calprotectin 12 weeks after conventional induction therapy (i.e. exclusive enteral nutrition or steroids) had a more favourable disease course in the first year than those with time-to-reach target calprotectin >12 weeks (Log-rank test, p=0.057). In UC patients time-to-reach target calprotectin 12 weeks is not associated with a favourable disease course in the first year. Conclusion : The findings of this prospective registry suggest that a quick response to conventional therapy predicts a favourable disease course in new-onset paediatric CD, but not in UC. The concept \"time-to-reach target calprotectin level\" rationalizes the indefinite term \"response to treatment\" and is well suited for studying CD treatment effectiveness in real-world practices.ABSTRACT66 3WHAT IS KNOWN Currently, the most frequently used surrogate for mucosal healing is a faecal calprotectin (FC) concentration in the target range. FC levels below 250 \u00b5g/g correlate well with mucosal healing. WHAT IS NEW A short time-to-reach the calprotectin target on conventional induction therapy, i.e. within 12 weeks, is predictive for favourable disease course in patients with new-onset Crohn's disease (CD), but not in patients with ulcerative colitis. Our findings suggest that CD patients who fail to reach target calprotectin levels within 12 weeks after exclusive enteral nutrition or steroid therapy may be entitled to step-up to anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor agents. 67 3Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), develop during childhood or adolescence in approximately 10% of patients.(1) Paediatric-onset IBD is associated with more extensive disease, higher disease activity, and a more complicated course than adult-onset IBD.(2,3) The focus of modern-day IBD management is moving away from controlling symptoms (or clinical remission) towards reaching and maintaining complete recovery of the intestinal mucosa, comprising both endoscopic and histologic healing (mucosal healing, MH).(4) MH is associated with better patient outcomes and is said to reduce the risk of end-organ damage.(5) MH is ideally evaluated by endoscopy with biopsies, but repeated endoscopic procedures are poorly tolerated. Currently, the most frequently used noninvasive surrogate marker of MH is faecal calprotectin (FC). FC levels below 250 \u00b5g/g correlate well with MH, FC levels rise quickly above this target threshold in case of disease flare and FC levels rapidly fall with successful treatment.(6) In the past decade the approach to treating children with luminal CD and UC has been classically described as \"step up\", while only few exceptional conditions at diagnosis warranted early and continuing use of anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) agents, including patients with perianal fistulizing disease, growth failure, or extra-intestinal manifestations.(7) Although we acknowledge the importance of recognizing patients who are most at risk of developing a complicated disease course at diagnosis, we argue that risk stratification should not stop there. The identification of high and low risk patients for complicated disease should probably continue after diagnosis and extend into the first year of treatment. For that purpose, we prospectively followed newly diagnosed children with luminal CD or UC who were initially treated with conventional induction therapy and evaluated whether there was a relation between time-to-reach target calprotectin and first relapse.INTRODUCTION68 3Study design & setting This was a noninterventional, observational study in which patient data were prospectively entered in an online registry, from diagnosis onwards. We used the cloud-based FastForwardCare (FFC) platform, which is especially designed to capture patients' records in an easy and comprehensive way (https://www. fastforwardcare.nl/). FFC is a health network in which care providers, researchers, patients and families learn together to improve the care for children with IBD. With effect from January 2015 the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) has started the collection of patient data. More IBD treatment centers will be invited to join this health network in the coming years. The FFC platform has options for writing medical summaries, creation of medical letters and building a research database without the drawback of double data entry. Care providers can trace back database information to their individual patients; other users only have access to anonymized data. Health checks and data collection were done at structured time points, but not at fixed intervals. We used phenotype- specific clinical composite scores (Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) (8) and the shortened Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (shPCDAI).(9,10) Stool samples were sent to the department of laboratory sciences of the UMCG and were analysed with fCAL ELISA (B\u00dcHLMANN Laboratories AG, Sch\u00f6nenbuch, Switzerland). The results of both the symptom score and the calprotectin stool test cumulated in a relapse risk stratification (Flarometer score) that has been described previously.(11,12) In brief, a patient who was in the low risk stratum (symptom score below 10 and calprotectin below 250 g/g) was reassured and advised to retest in 3 months. A symptomatic patient with a calprotectin concentration above 250 g/g was considered to have active disease and required immediate adjustment of therapy and retesting after 1 month. In the intermediate risk stratum a test interval of 1 month was advised before progressing to a treatment decision (figure 1). METHODS69 3Participants We used the clinical data of patients up to the age of 17 who were newly diagnosed with luminal CD or UC between January 2015 and July 2017. National treatment guidelines provided uniformity in treatment among physicians.(13) Patients with active luminal CD were treated with steroids (to a maximum of 40 mg/day) and gradual dose tapering, or with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) for 6 weeks. Patients with active UC were treated with steroids and aminosalicylate dose escalation. Maintenance therapy was started at the same time as induction therapy and in CD this included standardized doses of mercaptopurine (11.5 mg/kg/day), azathioprine (22.5 mg/kg/day) or methotrexate this included monotherapy (60-80 mg/kg/day) or combination therapy with azathioprine. Anti- Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) therapy was indicated after failure of conventional therapy. Data collection At diagnosis, patient demographics, disease characteristics, and detailed information on diagnostic work up (including baseline laboratory values, endoscopic examination, histological features, and small bowel imaging) were recorded online in the FFC registry. Stool specimen were collected at home and sent to the hospital laboratory prior to each face-to-face patient-doctor encounter, as previously described.(14) During health checks all of the following variables were entered in the FFC registry: current Figure 1. Flarometer.70 3treatment, clinical signs and symptoms, follow-up of laboratory values and faecal calprotectin, PUCAI or shPCDAI, a final conclusion (remission, clinical improvement, imminent relapse, relapse), and any treatment adjustments. Definitions and outcome measures IBD was diagnosed according to the Revised Porto criteria(15) and disease phenotype, location and behavior were described according to the Paris classification.(16) Faecal calprotectin concentrations below 250 \u00b5g/g were considered as a proxy for mucosal healing.(17-20) Time-to-reach target was defined as the first calprotectin measurement below 250 \u00b5g/g after the start of induction therapy (Figure 2). Time-to-first relapse, which was our primary outcome measure, was defined as the time from the first calprotectin measurement below 250 \u00b5g/g until reappearance of symptoms with calprotectin values above 250 \u00b5g/g (i.e. having a flarometer score in the high risk stratum). Growth delay was defined as height-for-age less than or equal to -2 SD. Statistical analyses This was an exploratory study, with no formal hypothesis testing nor sample size calculation. Data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23.0 for Apple Mac (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were evaluated using descriptive statistics, including median and interquartile ranges (IQR: 25th percentile, 75th percentile) for continuous variables. For discrete variables, we calculated the 95% confidence interval in OpenEpi, Version 3. Time-to-event data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Graphs were constructed with GraphPad Prism version 7 for MacBook (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA). Patients with fistulizing CD were excluded from the survival analysis. 71 3 Figure 2. Faecal calprotectin of an imaginary patient with Crohn's disease plotted over time. Time-to-reach target is defined as the first calprotectin measurement below 250 \u00b5g/g after the start of induction therapy (in this case 6 months). Time-to-first flare is defined as the time from the first calprotectin measurement below 250 \u00b5g/g until reappearance of symptoms with calprotectin values above 250 \u00b5g/g (in this case 6 months)72 3Patient demographics A total of 76 newly diagnosed children with IBD were identified between January 2015 to July 2017. Fifty-seven percent (43/76) had luminal CD and 43% (33/76) had UC. Table 1 shows the patient characteristics. Patients included in the FFC registry were diagnosed at a median age of 14.5 years (IQR 11.9-16.3) and 14.1 years (IQR 12-15.8), for CD and UC respectively. Fifty-three percent (23/43) of CD patients was female, compared to 49% (16/33) of UC patients. Growth delay at diagnosis was reported in 17% (7/41) of CD patients and in 6% (2/32) of UC patients. Median follow-up of patients was 67 weeks (IQR 54-86). Diagnostic work-up Abnormal laboratory tests at diagnosis Blood examination at diagnosis showed abnormal values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of patients in 45% (15/33) of UC patients. Forty-eight percent (21/43) of CD patients and 42% (14/33) of UC patients presented with anaemia. All but one patient had RESULTS Figure 3. Inflamed segments at diagnostic endoscopy.73 3faecal calprotectin levels out of the normal range (> 250 \u00b5g/g). One UC patient with continuous inflammation from rectum to sigmoid had a calprotectin level of 220 \u00b5g/g at diagnosis. This patient was excluded from Kaplan-Meier analysis for having reached the event of interest at baseline. Endoscopic and histological features at diagnosis Figure 3 gives a graphical representation of the distribution of endoscopically confirmed inflammation. Disease location and behavior are shown in table 1. Five patients, who were ultimately diagnosed with UC, had histologic features of focally enhanced gastritis.

Cut-offs were 7.1 g/L for boys and girls younger than 13 years, 8.1 g/L for boys 13 to 17 years, and 7.4 g/L for girls between 13 and 17 years.(29)75 3suggestive for CD were seen in 6 patients, while the remaining 4 patients with normal MRE findings were initially diagnosed as IBD-unclassified. Follow-up colonoscopies confirmed a diagnosis of CD in three patients and UC in one patient. Initial induction and maintenance therapy Figure 4 shows the flow of patients through the first year postdiagnosis. Fourty-nine percent (21/43) of patients diagnosed with luminal CD were initially treated with EEN to induce remission and 51% (22/43) with steroids. Seventy percent (30/43) of CD patients reached the treatment target during the observation period (whether or not after switch or step-up) and were included in the analysis of the primary outcome measure (time-to-first relapse). Eighty-four percent (27/32) of UC patients were induced with oral steroids in combination with aminosalicylates, while 13% (4/32) of patients, in particular those with ulcerative proctitis, were induced with topical aminosalicylates. One patient with UC was initially misdiagnosed as luminal CD and put on EEN. The final diagnosis was adjusted after colonoscopy was repeated. Ultimately 94% (30/32) of UC patients reached the treatment target during the observation period (whether or not after switch or step-up) and were included in the analysis of the primary outcome measure. First choice immunomodulator for CD patients was azathioprine in ninety-three percent (40/43) of cases. Eighty-four percent (27/32) of the UC patients were on oral aminosalicylate maintenance therapy, in 85% (23/27) of cases in combination with azathioprine. Disease course in the first year postdiagnosis Time-to-reach target calprotectin levels (< 250 \u00b5g/g) Figure 5 shows the time-to-reach target calprotectin levels (< 250 \u00b5g/g) in the study population in the first year postdiagnosis. Nineteen percent (8/43) of patients with luminal CD reached the target within 12 weeks after diagnosis. Another 42% (18/43) reached the target between 12 and 52 weeks postdiagnosis, for which 14 patients required a step-up to anti-TNFs. Forty percent (17/43) had not reached the treatment target after 52 weeks of follow-up. Another 4 patients with CD patients reached the calprotectin target concentration after 52 weeks of follow-up. Among patients with UC, 53% (17/32) reached the target within 12 weeks after diagnosis. Another 31% (10/32) reached the target between 12 and 52 weeks postdiagnosis, for which one patient 76 3 77 3 Figure 4. Flow of patients with (A) Crohn's disease and (B) ulcerative colitis in the first year postdiagnosis indicating how many reached the treatment target within 12 weeks, and how many at a later stage. 78 3needed a step-up to anti-TNFs. Thirteen percent (5/32) had not reached the treatment target at the end of 52 weeks follow- up. Another 3 UC patients reached the calprotectin target concentration after 52 weeks of follow-up. A significant larger proportion of patients with UC reached the calprotectin target in the first year compared to patients with CD, and also at a faster pace. The median time-to-reach target calprotectin levels was respectively 11 weeks and 37 weeks (Log- rank test, p=0.001). The slopes for UC and CD patients in figure 4 indicate that the difference in time-to-reach target calprotectin is in the first 12 weeks postdiagnosis. Thereafter both curves follow a parallel track. The patients that ultimately reached the calprotectin target served as the study population to evaluate time-to-first relapse. Figure 5. Kaplan-Meier plot demonstrating time-to-reach target calprotectin (< 250 \u00b5g/g) in the first year postdiagnosis. Patients with ulcerative colitis (solid line) and Crohn's disease (dotted line) were treated according to the Dutch step-up approach. 79 3Time-to-first relapse after reaching the calprotectin target Figure 6 shows the time-to-first relapse after reaching the calprotectin target. Patients with CD who had reached the treatment target remained in remission for a significantly longer time than patients with UC (Log-rank test, p=0.001). Figure 7 shows that new-onset CD patients who reached the target calprotectin level within 12 weeks were more likely to have a favourable disease course, than CD patients who reached the target calprotectin after 12 weeks (Log-rank test, p=0.057). In UC patients there was no association between the pace of reaching the target calprotectin and favourable disease course (Log-rank test, p=0.547). Figure 6.

Patients with ulcerative colitis (solid line) are compared with patients with Crohn's disease (dotted line).80 3 Figure 5. Kaplan-Meier plot demonstrating time-to-first relapse, defined as the time from the first calprotectin measurement below 250 \u00b5g/g until reintroduction of induction therapy (whether or not step-up) in 30 patients with Crohn's disease. Patients who reached the target calprotectin within 12 weeks (solid line) are compared with patients who reached the target calprotectin beyond 12 weeks (dotted line).In both CD and UC patients, one year outcomes including time- to-reach target calprotectin and time-to-first flare were similar regardless of initial choice of induction therapy, although our study was not powered to address this question (Supplementary table 1). Supplementary figure 1 gives an overview of changes in faecal calprotectin from baseline to the moment of reaching the target range (FC ) and from the last result in range to the first out-of-range result (FC ). Ninety-five of IBD in our cohort had FC concentrations over 500 \u00b5g/g at baseline. Eighty-eight percent (53/60) of patients had FC concentrations below 200 \u00b5g/g when the target range was reached. Similarly, in those who flared during the observation period, FC concentrations were below 200 \u00b5g/g shortly before the flare in 92% (23/25) of cases. The first out-of-range measurement was over 500 \u00b5g/g in 96% (24/25) of cases.81 3Key findings We quantified time-to-reach target calprotectin levels and its relation with first flare in patients with new-onset paediatric IBD. The data were drawn from the FastForwardCare Registry. We showed that patients with UC reached the treatment target (FC <250 \u00b5g/g) at a faster pace than patients with CD, but they also experienced a first flare sooner than patients with CD. Additionally, we observed that CD patients with time-to-reach target calprotectin 12 weeks after conventional induction therapy (i.e. exclusive enteral nutrition or steroids) had a more favourable disease course in the first year than those with time-to-reach target calprotectin >12 weeks. In UC patients time-to-reach target calprotectin 12 weeks was not associated with a favorable disease course in the first year. Comparison with existing literature Several research groups have identified factors at disease diagnosis that warranted early and ongoing use of anti-TNF agents, including perianal fistulizing disease, presence of strictures or penetrating disease in CD, and extensive disease (pancolitis) or extra-intestinal manifestations in UC.(21-26) In addition, we have now shown that the absence of response to conventional induction therapy (with EEN or steroids), rationalized in a failure to reach target calprotectin levels within 12 weeks from initiation, facilitates selection of patients with CD that may require an accelerated step-up therapy. A recently published Pan-European study among patients with newonset paediatric CD also stressed the prognostic power of calprotectin values at week 12 of induction therapy, and showed that response to induction therapy has more impact than baseline disease severity or inflammation.(27) Faecal calprotectin cut-point The discussion about the best calprotectin cut-point for mucosal healing is on-going, and the debate is blurred by the intended purpose of this stool test. In many papers the use of a single calprotectin measurement is compared with a reference test (such as endoscopy or MRE),(28) while we use calprotectin at every health check (i.e. periodically) and now adjust our therapy plans based on the trend in calprotectin results. By analogy with the most frequently used monitoring test in medicine -the DISCUSSION82 3measurement of blood pressure- the variability over time makes a single measurement a poor monitoring test. Fecal calprotectin becomes a good monitoring test when therapy adjustment is based on a series of measurements. Choosing a cut-point that is considerably lower than 250 g/g used in this project (e.g. 150 g/g) will definitely improve the specificity of the calprotectin test. At the same time this may be detrimental to the outcome of patients with calprotectin results between 150 and 250 g/g, who may need to undergo pointless changes of therapy that lead to quick exhaustion of the therapeutic arsenal. Evaluation of the best calprotectin cut- point should therefore not be limited to the reporting of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, as is done in many publications,(28) but must also include the monitoring strategy, definitions of action thresholds and the actions to be taken if any of the thresholds is reached. Limitations Although there is an imminent danger of over-interpretation of results in an observational study, our results offer insight into the short-term outcomes of new-onset paediatric IBD patients, where double-blind randomised controlled trials are unlikely to occur. The University Medical Center in Groningen was the first center to start capturing data in the FastForwardCare prospective registry. We realize that single center studies are unlikely to have sufficient power to draw reliable conclusions, especially when evaluating the effect of treatment choices on time-to-event analyses, and we therefore aim to encourage more paediatric IBD treatment centers to join the registry in the upcoming years. Implications for paediatric practice and further research Several trials have shown that early use of anti-TNF agents is associated with improved outcomes and fewer complications in adult as well as in paediatric patients with CD.(25,29-34) This does not necessarily mean that every new-onset IBD patient will profit from the early institution of anti-TNF induction treatment. A significant proportion of patients with IBD have a relatively favorable disease course, with long time-to-first relapse and low risk of complications. We are the first to have shown that a time- to-reach target calprotectin level within 12 weeks is predictive for a favourable disease course in the short run in patients with new- onset CD, but not in patients with UC. Given that calprotectin is a cytosolic protein particularly abundant 83 3CONCLUSION With the use of a prospective registry we have shown that reaching calprotectin levels <250 \u00b5g/g within 12 weeks of the initiation of induction therapy, facilitates recognition of new-onset CD patients with a favourable disease course, but this does not apply to new-onset UC patients. CD patients who fail to reach target calprotectin levels within 12 weeks after conventional induction therapy may be entitled to step-up to anti-TNF agents.in neutrophils, these results are not unexpected. Influx of neutrophils in the epithelium or in the intestinal lumen are known to increase the amount of calprotectin in the gut lumen.(35) ln UC the inflammation is confined to the mucosal layer, while in CD also the deeper layers may be affected. We postulate that time- to-elimination of neutrophils (in other words time-to-histologic healing) takes longer in CD, and this may be reflected in the longer time-to-reach target calprotectin levels. CD patients with a swift normalization of calprotectin values by induction therapy may have had a less deep type of inflammation, but we were unable to prove this in the current study, due to absence of follow- up biopsies. 84 31.

We evaluated the long-term efficacy and tolerability of MTX monotherapy after thiopurine therapy in pediatric CD patients. Methods : A multicentre cohort of pediatric MTX users who stopped thiopurines due to ineffectiveness or intolerance between 2002 and 2012 were included and followed for at least 12 months. Relapse-free use was defined as steroid and biologic-free clinical remission after the introduction of MTX, and included intentional discontinuation of successful therapy before the end of the observation period. Results : One hundred thirteen patients with CD in remission were followed while on MTX monotherapy, of which 75 (66%) had failed on thiopurines and 38 (34%) had stopped thiopurines due to side effects. Median age at the introduction of MTX was 14 years (range 7 to 17), and 93% used the subcutaneous route. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 52% of the study cohort was still in steroid and biologic-free remission after 12 months of MTX monotherapy, with a difference that did not reach significance between thiopurine intolerant and thiopurine failing patients (P=0.21, log-rank test). Conclusions : The findings of this cohort study suggest that MTX is an effective immunomodulator to maintain remission after stopping thiopurines. MTX maintenance should be considered before stepping up to anti-TNF-alpha therapy. It is probably somewhat more effective in patients who stopped thiopurines due to side effects than in those who failed on thiopurines. ABSTRACT94 4INTRODUCTION MATERIALS & METHODS Approximately 30% of patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) present before the age of 19 years.(1) Treatment is aimed at inducing and maintaining remission of disease activity to ensure normal growth and pubertal development, and improving the quality of life of patients. European guidelines recommend the use of exclusive enteral nutrition or steroids to induce remission in children with luminal CD.(2) Thiopurines (azathioprine or mercaptopurine) or methotrexate are recommended to maintain steroid free remission.(2) Methotrexate (MTX) appears to be similarly effective in maintaining clinical remission as thiopurines,(3-9) but side effects (including nausea, vomiting and elevated liver enzymes) have deterred its widespread use. Studies focusing on long-term benefits of MTX maintenance therapy in pediatric CD are lacking, and most published studies have lumped together children who stopped thiopurines due to intolerance (not true failures) and those who failed to respond to thiopurines(3,4,7-9) Unfamiliarity with MTX make pediatric gastroenterologists to frequently omit this drug and move on to infliximab, which has a limited duration of effect to maintain remission.(10,11) Increasingly tight healthcare budgets and concerns about the lymphoproliferative risk of long- term use of thiopurines have ignited a renewed interest among adult and pediatric gastroenterologists in MTX. We aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of MTX monotherapy in a cohort of Dutch children and teenagers with CD and distinguished patients who failed on thiopurines and those who discontinued due to side effects. Study design & setting In this retrospective multicentre cohort study we evaluated patient data from 6 university and 4 general teaching hospitals. The participating pediatric gastroenterologists are members of the Kids with Crohn's and Colitis (KiCC) working group for Collaborative Research in the Netherlands. Together they treat about two-thirds of the total pediatric CD population in the Netherlands. Data were entered on site in an electronic case report form that was specifically designed for this research project and included patient and disease characteristics (expressed 95 4according to the Paris classification(12)), previous therapies and disease course. We especially focused on the period of exposure to MTX, clinical efficacy (expressed as relapse-free use) and tolerability. Participants We identified children and teenagers (up to the age of 17) with CD who were treated with MTX after thiopurine ineffectiveness or intolerance between 2002 and 2012. For patients with several episodes of MTX exposure, we only analyzed the first episode. Those who used MTX primarily to treat a non-IBD indication (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) and those on anti-TNF-alpha co-treatment were excluded from analysis. Definitions & outcome measures Primary outcome measure was relapse-free MTX use, which was defined as either steroid or biologics-free clinical remission after the introduction of MTX, and included intentional discontinuation of successful MTX therapy before the end of the observation period. Among patients who discontinued successful MTX therapy we distinguished those who did so per provider recommendation and those who self-initiated discontinuation. Whenever available, endoscopic and pathohistologic reports were used to confirm relapse. As this is an uncommon strategy to determine relapse in pediatric CD, we based this diagnosis mainly on a Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score > 10 points in combination with the initiation of steroids, anti-TNF-alpha therapy or exclusive enteral nutrition. Secondary outcome measures included the occurrence of side effects, reasons for discontinuation, and identification of risk factors for relapse under MTX monotherapy. Early failure of MTX-treatment was defined as relapse within 6 months after initiation of MTX. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed with SPSS for Windows, version 20 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). All tests were two-sided and the level of significance used was P < 0.05. Time-to-event data were analyzed by Kaplan- Meier and log-rank test. Stepwise logistic regression with backward elimination was planned to determine predictors of early MTX failure. Candidate predictors with P < 0.10 in bivariate analysis were selected for use in the multivariate analysis. This level was chosen because of the limited number of patients in the analysis.96 4Female Median age at diagnosis (range in years) IBD-related comorbidity Joint inflammation Eye manifestations Skin manifestations Initial remission induction therapy Exclusive enteral nutrition Steroids Aminosalicylates Azathiopurine Initial maintenance Azathiopurine to MTX Median number of relapses prior to MTX (range) Disease behavior (according to Paris Classification(12)) B1 B2 p B1, p B2, p B2B3,p Growth delay (according to Paris Classification(12))Characteristics B1: modifier, B2B3: both penetrating and stricturing disease either at the same or different times.Table 1. Patient characteristics prior to the start of methotrexate not subject to \"Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act\", as it involved the study collection of data generated by routine medical care. The data were collected and recorded by the investigators in such a manner that subjects could not be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects. RESULTS Patient characteristics We identified 148 children and teenagers who started MTX therapy between 2002 and 2012. A total of 35 children were excluded from analysis for anti-TNF-alpha cotreatment (n=29), MTX use primarily for a non-IBD indication (n=3), or missing values (n=3). A total of 113 methotrexate users were ultimately included, of which 75 (66%) had failed on thiopurines and 38 (34%) discontinued thiopurines due to side effects. Two- thirds were initially treated with exclusive enteral nutrition to induce remission, and 88% received azathioprine as their first immunomodulator. The majority of cases had nonstricturing, nonpenetrating luminal CD (table 1). MTX was initiated at a median age of 14 years (range 7 to 17) and after a median disease duration of 2 years (range 1 month to 11 years) (table 2). Seventy-one percent of the patients who discontinued thiopurine monotherapy because of intolerance had drug-induced acute pancreatitis. Most patients received MTX subcutaneously (93%) at initiation, with a median dosage of 15 mg/wk (range 5 to 25), which is equivalent to 11 to 15 mg/m2 (body surface area). All patients in this study cohort received folate within 24 to 48 hours after the administration of MTX. Duration of methotrexate use Eighteen months after introduction over 50% of our cohort was still using MTX. At 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, the proportions of patients on continuous use of MTX were 94% (95% CI: 89 73) and 44% (95% CI: 35 to 54) respectively. A fifth of our cohort used MTX for more than 3 years. Among those who discontinued MTX, 45% did so because of ineffectiveness, while 47% had intolerance. The remainder stopped successful MTX therapy per provider recommendation (n=5) or on their own initiative (n=2). 99 4Reason for initiation of MTX Thiopurine ineffectiveness Thiopurine Other complaints MTX of administration Subcutaneous OralMedian age at initiation of MTX (range in years) Median disease duration at initiation of characteristics at initiation of methotrexate maintenance therapy (n=113) Efficacy of methotrexate Steroid and biologics-free MTX use is shown in figure 1. Nine patients were excluded from this time-to-event analysis as they did not reach remission while using MTX. Fifty-two percent of the total study cohort (95% CI: 42 to 62%) was still in steroid and biologic-free remission after 12 months of MTX monotherapy (line not shown), with a difference that did not reach significance between thiopurine intolerant and thiopurine failing patients (P=0.21, log-rank test). In the first group the percent of relapse- free children at 6, 12 and 24 months was respectively 85% (95% CI 72 to 97%), 62% (95% CI 79%) and 38% (95% CI 20 to 56%), while in the group who previously failed on thiopurines the percent of relapse-free children was respectively 67% (95% CI 66 to (95% CI and 25% (95% CI 14 to 37%) . We intended to construct a prognostic model for discontinuation of MTX-treatment. Stepwise logistic regression with backward elimination was planned, but in the bivariate model only one significant risk factor was identified. Multivariate analysis was therefore not executed. Ineffectiveness of thiopurine before intiation of MTX was a significant risk factor for subsequent early MTX failure (odds ratio 2.6 (95% CI 1.1 to 6.5), P= 0,036). 100 4Safety and prevention Sixty-eight of 113 patients reported side effects. The commonest complaint was nausea and/or vomiting around MTX administration (figure 2). This resulted in discontinuation of MTX therapy in 21 patients. Thirty patients received ondansetron. In the majority of cases (n=18) this premedication strategy was only started after the appearance of side effects. Six of 113 patients had transient elevation of transaminases, of which one developed regenerative nodular liver hyperplasia. In two cases transaminitis resolved after dose tapering or temporary discontinuation. In the remaining four MTX was permanently discontinued. Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier plot demonstrating the percent of methotrexate users who maintained remission. Children with Crohn's disease who failed on thiopurines (solid line) are compared with those who discontinued thiopurines due to side effects (dotted line). Event is defined as date of first relapse, necessitating steroids, exclusive enteral nutrition or anti-TNF-alpha therapy; censor is defined as discontinuation of methotrexate due to side effects or end of observation period. The numbers on the lowest two lines indicate the number of patients being represented at that point in time. 101 4Key results We studied the efficacy and tolerability of methotrexate monotherapy in children with CD who discontinued thiopurines. Twelve months after initiation of MTX 52% of the patients was still free from relapse. MTX efficacy in the group of patients who had thiopurine intolerance was not superior to MTX efficacy in the group of patients with thiopurine failure. Nausea and/or vomiting around MTX administration were the most common side effects prompting 19% of patients to stop MTX. Comparison with other studies To our knowledge this is the largest study that evaluated the efficacy of MTX after discontinuation of thiopurines and divided MTX users into those who failed on thiopurines and those who stopped due to side effects. Most papers that have been published to date (table 3) were case series describing the proportion of patients in remission at preset time points, and may have underestimated its real protective effect. In previously published studies the percentage of patients still in remission after 12 months ranged from 33 to 48%.(3-9,13,14) In order to evaluate the Figure 2. Percentage of patients reporting side effects (with 95% confidence intervals), n=113.

We used a strict case definition for clinical remission that was based on PCDAI- score < 10 (and where applicable fecal calprotectin levels in the normal range, i.e. < 250 g/g) without treatment escalation (i.e. adding steroids, exclusive enteral nutrition or anti-TNF-alpha).(16,17) Secondly, in contrast to previously published studies we classified patients who discontinued successful MTX use per provider recommendation or on their own initiative under relapse-free MTX use and not under treatment failure. Methodological limitations Relapse-free MTX use was our primary outcome, but due to the retrospective nature of this study discontinuation of the drug was not determined by protocol. Physicians with a pre- existing bias against MTX may have seen the appearance of side effects as a confirmation of the patient-unfriendly medicine and were perhaps easier in moving forward to anti-TNF therapy. Others may have put more effort in treating the side effects, e.g. with ondansetron.(18) Another possible restriction of this study related to the method of retrospective chart review, which may have affected the reliability of reporting of side effects and non-adherence. In addition the impact of MTX treatment on endoscopic disease activity (i.e. mucosal healing) was not assessed. Implications for pediatric practice Few pediatric gastroenterologists prescribe MTX in CD patients on a regular basis, in contrast to rheumatologists in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.(19) Skepticism about its effectiveness, concerns about adverse events and lack of experience with the drug are the main reasons to omit MTX as a second line immunomodulator and to prescribe more expensive anti-TNF-alpha antibodies following thiopurine ineffectiveness or intolerance. In the Netherlands annual drug costs to treat a 40 kg weighing child with CD is \u20ac1381 for weekly subcutaneous injections of methotrexate and \u20ac7656 for 8-weekly intravenous infliximab infusions.(20) In this calculation we did not take into account the additional costs for intravenous infusions during hospital day admissions. The findings of this cohort study suggest 105 4 Figure 3. Position of methotrexate in step-up treatment scheme for pediatric luminal CD used in this study cohort15 EEN, Exclusive enteral nutrition; MTX, once MTX montherapy is initiated that it is worthwhile to consider MTX to maintain remission, before stepping up to anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. Over 50% of the study cohort was relapse free a year after introducing MTX and a fifth of the cohort used it satisfactorily for more than 3 years. A recently published multi-center observational study from North- America showed that MTX is being prescribed with increasing frequency as first choice immunomodulator. Many pediatric gastroenterologists seem to become uncomfortable with thiopurines usage, particularly in conjunction with anti-TNF-alpha antibodies.(13) Nausea and/or vomiting were the most common side effects following MTX and an important reason to stop MTX, even if the treatment was successful in maintaining remission. Many children will develop anticipatory vomiting, which is vomiting 106 4prior to the administration of MTX. It is a learned response that is more likely to happen in children who have a history of motion sickness. Administration of ondansetron from the outset one hour prior to injection may reduce anticipatory nausea and could improve tolerance.(18) In our cohort ondansetron was only used in 30 patients and mostly after the appearance of complaints. We did not observe a statistically significant difference between preemptive and post hoc administration of ondansetron regarding MTX tolerance. Abnormal liver biochemistry was seen in 5% of our cohort. Dose reduction or a short MTX holiday could solve the transaminitis, but in the majority of cases the patient was advised to discontinue MTX permanently. In a recently published systematic review that included 457 pediatric CD cases treated with MTX, approximately 10% (95% CI 5 to 19%) had signs of transaminitis. (21 Patients in stable remission should have their alanine aminot) ransferase monitored periodically. Several authors recommend folate supplementation in order to decrease the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms and liver toxicity.(22-24) Whether MTX can be administered orally for maintaining remission has been largely debated in the literature. Bioavailability of oral MTX varies highly, in particular in CD patients with small- bowel disease. A recently published retrospective cohort study among children with CD treated with oral or subcutaneous MTX suggests that MTX should be commenced subcutaneously and could be switched to the oral route once complete remission is reached.(14) The majority of CD patients in our cohort (93%) were treated with subcutaneous MTX.(15) The mean weekly dose was 15 mg/m2 body surface area and was similar to the dosage used in other pediatric studies.(14) 107 4CONCLUSION This cohort study among pediatric CD patients who received MTX monotherapy following discontinuation of thiopurines showed that 52% was still relapse-free 12 months after initiation, decreasing to 29% after 24 months. Nausea and vomiting around administration was observed in half of the cohort, and was an important reason to discontinue MTX, despite steroids and biologics free clinical remission. Our findings suggest that it is worthwhile to consider MTX to maintain remission, especially in those who are thiopurine intolerant, before stepping up to anti- TNF-alpha antibodies. Preemptive treatment with an anti-emetic may improve MTX tolerance.108 41. Buller HA. Problems in diagnosis of IBD in children. Neth J Med 1997;50: S8-11. 2. Ruemmele FM, Veres KL, et al.

Methods : We stored aliquots of homogenized stool at room temperature and at 4\u00b0C, and measured the calprotectin concentration for 6 consecutive days with three different assays. In addition, we assessed calprotectin stability in assay-specific extraction buffers kept at room temperature. Results : After six days of storage at room temperature, mean percentage change from baseline calprotectin concentrations in stool and extraction buffer was 35 and 46%, respectively. The stability of calprotectin was significantly better preserved in samples stored at 4\u00b0C (p=0.0066 and 0.0011, respectively). Conclusions : Calprotectin is not stable at room temperature. Children with IBD and their caretakers may be falsely reassured by low calprotectin values. The best advisable standard for pre- analytical calprotectin handling is refrigeration of the stool sample until delivery at the hospital laboratory. ABSTRACT116 5INTRODUCTION METHODS Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are lifelong conditions that often begin in childhood. Disease monitoring is usually based on clinical symptoms with an emphasis on altered bowel habits and rectal bleeding. As relying on subjective symptoms alone could lead to management errors, the use of faecal calprotectin as an objective and noninvasive measure of disease activity has gained a lot of interest in both paediatric practice and trials settings. (1,2) Calprotectin is widely believed to be a stable marker, hence many physicians and researchers allow patients to send a stool sample to the laboratory by surface mail at ambient temperatures. However, evidence for stability at room temperature is scarce and all quotes can be traced back to one of the earliest scientific publications on stool calprotectin.(3) We assessed calprotectin stability in stool samples stored at room temperature and at 4\u00b0C. In addition, we assessed calprotectin stability in extraction buffers. We collected 19 stool samples from patients with IBD and ensured that the whole range of potential calprotectin values was covered. Within 2 hours of collection spot samples were homogenized and split into 12 aliquots, 6 of which were kept at room temperature and 6 at 4\u00b0C for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 days, respectively. Each stool sample was also extracted and split into 6 aliquots of extraction fluid and likewise kept at room temperature. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent calprotectin results per pre-analytical condition. To minimize any batch-to-batch variation, all aliquots were analyzed in the same analytical batch. A repeated measures analysis of variance was performed and results were plotted over time and expressed as percentage change from baseline calprotectin with 95% confidence interval (CI). 117 5RESULTS Baseline calprotectin concentration in the stool samples varied from 14 to 3270 \u00b5g/g. In aliquots kept at room temperature the mean change from baseline values on day 1, 3 and 6 was 18% (95%CI 11-25), 28% (22-34) and 35% (26-44), respectively. This decline was irrespective of the calprotectin concentration at baseline. In extraction fluids kept at room temperature the mean change from baseline values was 23% (9-37), 36% 4\u00b0C calprotectin values remained stable during the observation period (see figure 1). Calprotectin stability over time was significantly diminished in stool and extraction fluids kept at room temperature compared to storage at 4\u00b0C (p=0.0066 and 0.0011, respectively). Figure 1. Calprotectin stability over time. DISCUSSION Our results indicate a steady decline in calprotectin concentration in the first 6 days after stool collection in samples kept at room temperature. A similar slope was seen in stool extracts kept at room temperature, while the stability of calprotectin was preserved in samples stored in a refrigerator at 4\u00b0C. We did not test the superiority of one ELISA kit over another. For that, we would have needed to perform a multitude of tests. The decline 118 5in calprotectin concentration over time was observed regardless of the ELISA kit used, which makes inadvertently smoothening of the curve unlikely. Literature on calprotectin stability under various preservation conditions is scarce. A Swedish group observed a decline in calprotectin when stool samples were stored at room temperature for 7 days but claimed that the concentration remained unchanged in the first three days after collection.(4) A Spanish group claimed that calprotectin remained stable in stool extracts stored at room temperature for 4 days,(5) as opposed to our finding that extraction does not prevent a decline. Calprotectin instability in stool samples sent by surface mail at ambient temperatures may lead to management errors in treat- to-target strategies, in which physicians aim for calprotectin concentrations below 250 \u00b5g/g.(6) Although there is no consensus on the optimal frequency of calprotectin retesting and cutoffs for treatment intensification, the authors of this article use the following monitoring strategy: IBD patients with calprotectin values below 250 g/g are reassured and advised to retest in 3 months; IBD patients with calprotectin values above 500 g/g are considered to have active disease, require treatment intensification and retesting in 1 month; and IBD patients with calprotectin in the intermediate range are advised to retest in 1 month before progressing to a decision. In such a strategy, patients whose calprotectin values show a drift from the target range into the indecisive range may be falsely reassured, leading to a delay in treatment intensification (figure 2). The intermediate range is exactly where precision is of utmost importance and small deviations lead to misclassification of disease activity and wrong treatment decisions. Test results at the high and extreme low end of the calprotectin spectrum will not lead to management errors. Currently, the best advisable standard for pre-analytical calprotectin handling is refrigeration of the filled stool container until delivery at the hospital laboratory. Several manufacturers recently introduced a lateral flow-based test and a software application that turns an ordinary smartphone camera into a reader for quantitative calprotectin measurements.(7) Although this innovation has great opportunities to take transport of stool samples out of the equation, home tests are not yet commonplace in monitoring disease activity in IBD. In the meantime, for those 119 5who continue shipping unrefrigerated stool samples to the laboratory, we emphasize the importance of documenting the time to arrival at the laboratory. Unrefrigerated stool samples that arrive with a delay exceeding 24 hours with a calprotectin concentration between 250 and 500 \u00b5g/g need confirmation. We currently advise our patients to store the confirmation sample in the freezing compartment of the fridge until the face-to-face encounter with the physician and then deliver the confirmation sample to the laboratory by hand. Figure 2. Stool calprotectin values of an imaginary patient with Crohn's disease plotted over time. Black dots represent true calprotectin values, white dots represent underestimated calprotectin values caused by protein degradation in the pre-analytical phase. In month 12, the patient's true calprotectin measurement would have resulted in treatment intensification, while calprotectin degradation during transport may cause false reassurance and significant treatment delay. 120 51.

Many hospital laboratories measure calprotectin levels in sent- in stool samples with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

To minimize wrongful interpretation of calprotectin changes over time it is essential to always use the home test and companion ELISA of one and the same manufacturer. Manufacturers should explicitly evaluate and report the suitability of commonly used smartphones for quantitative calprotectin readings.127 6METHODS Study design and pre-analytical sample handling This method comparison study was performed at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG, the Netherlands). Between March and May 2018 IBD patients treated at the Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology volunteered in donating stool samples for this study. They defecated onto a stool collection sheet held above the toilet water at home, and transferred a sample of stool into a classical screw top container with a spatula. They described the stool consistency by completing the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS),(6] and send both the screw top container and BSFS in a resealable biomaterial envelope to the Department of Laboratory Medicine. For the purpose of this study the patients themselves were not involved in the measurement of stool calprotectin. Upon arrival at the laboratory, the stool sample was homogenized and then aliquoted for analysis with two separate methods. Both aliquots were stored at -20\u00b0C until analysis. Measurement of stool calprotectin with home test Three third year medical students without any specific laboratory training carried out the home tests of three manufacturers (Table 1). Each manufacturer-specific test cassette was read with four different smartphones: two iOS (iPhone 6 and 7) and 2 Android devices (Samsung Galaxy S6 and Motorola Moto G5 Plus) (Fig 1). The sequence of use of smartphone type and home test was randomized to prevent bias. An hour before the testing session the students defrosted one of two aliquots. They all dipped the assay-specific sampling pin in the sample and transferred the fecal material into the assay-specific tube with extraction buffer. After observing the advised extract processing time, they then applied a drop of extraction fluid in the measurement window of the test cassette as per manufacturer's instructions. After the appropriate incubation time the cassette was read with the smartphone by placing the camera above the cassette. The image was automatically analyzed by the smartphone application and the quantitative calprotectin result was directly shown on the smartphone screen. 128 6 Figure 1. Study flow. We used 40 stool samples that covered the whole range of potential calprotectin values and performed 1440 smartphone readings and 120 ELISA measurements. Measurement of stool calprotectin with ELISA Experienced laboratory technicians, who were blinded for the smartphone readings, thawed the second aliquot and carried out batch ELISA testing with three assays that corresponded with the home tests (see table 1). The samples were manually weighted and the measurements were done on a Dynex DS2 automated ELISA system (Alpha Labs, Easleigh, UK). 129 6HOME TEST App name Extract processing time Incubation time test cassette Test analysis time Measuring range (\u00b5g/g) Suitability of smartphone for single-snapshot reading of cassette iPhone 6 iPhone 7 Motorola Moto G5 plus Samsung Galaxy S6 ELISA no yes B\u00dcHLMANN fCAL 30-1800 \u00b5g/g Cal Not specified 15 minutes yes yes yes yes IDK Calprotectin 25,5-2100 Not specified 15 minutes yes yes yes Calprotectin (ALP) 25-2500 \u00b5g/g 4.8-13%Table 1. Summary of characteristics of calprotectin home tests and companion ELISAs (derived from the manufacturer's statements in the instruction for use). Outcome measures The agreement between the home test and the companion ELISA measurement was considered as the primary outcome measurement, and was analyzed with a Bland-Altman plot. As described previously (7), we reasoned that disagreement in the lower range of the tests (i.e., below 500 \u00b5g/g) could lead more easily to misclassification of disease activity than disagreement in the higher range (>500 \u00b5g/g). We therefore used predefined 130 6acceptable limits of difference, which were arbitrary set at \u00b1100 ug/g for the lower range, and \u00b1200 \u00b5g/g for the higher range. Secondly, concordance of home test and companion ELISA test were determined in each of 3 calprotectin ranges commonly used in our clinical practice (i.e., <250 \u00b5g/g for target range, 250- 500 \u00b5g/g for undecisive range, and >500 \u00b5g/g for active disease). (7) Other outcome measures included the reading error rate (RER) per smartphone type, with reading error defined as an image of the test cassette not leading to quantitative result, and evaluation of the usability of the home test and the smartphone application on the first, seventh and last day of the home test experiments. For that purpose, the students completed the system usability scale (SUS).(8) The SUS is a simple, ten item scale giving a global view of subjective assessments of usability and learnability of a system. Scores have a range of 0 to 100, and should be considered as grade scales rather than percentages. Sample size calculation The primary outcome was taken as the overall percentage of agreement between the calprotectin home test and the corresponding ELISA test per manufacturer. We wished to detect a difference in agreement of at least 15% by a two-sided test. With the level of significance set at 5% and a study power of 80%, we aimed to include at least 110 paired measurements per manufacturer. Statistical analysis In Bland-Altman analysis, a scatter plot is constructed in which the difference between the paired measurements is plotted on the vertical axis and the average of the measures of two methods on the horizontal axis. The mean difference in values obtained with the two methods is called the bias and is represented by a central horizontal line on the plot. The standard deviation (SD) of differences between paired measurements is used to construct horizontal lines above and below the line to represent 95% limits of agreement (LOA). The plot enables the reader to visually assess the bias, data scatter and the relationship between magnitude of difference and size of measurement. ELISA measurements out of the measurable range of the home test were rounded to the upper limit of the home test range. In addition, we provide a distribution histogram of the differences between the paired measurements in the low range calprotectin concentrations. Concordance of home test 131 6and companion ELISA readings in each of the three calprotectin ranges are presented in a scatterplot. RERs per home test and smartphone type are reported as percentages with confidence intervals. Data were recorded electronically by using SPSS version 23.0 for Apple Mac (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). Graphs were constructed with GraphPad Prism version 7 for MacBook (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA). P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Ethical consideration The Medical Ethics Review Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen waived consent requirement for this specific study, as no human subjects as meant in the Dutch Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) were involved. Nonetheless legal guardians from all participants, as well as the children aged 12 and above, gave informed consent to use their voluntary stool samples for research. This study was conducted in compliance with the Clinical Trial Agreement, the study protocol, designated Standard Operating Procedures and the international standard for studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices. (ISO 22870: 2016 Point-of-care testing (POCT) - Requirements for quality and competence). All authors had access to the study data and reviewed and approved the final manuscript. RESULTS Between March and May 2018, we selected 40 stool samples, of which 23 (58%) were in the low calprotectin range (<500 g/g) and 17 (42%) in the (<500 \u00b5g/g). Per homogenized stool sample 36 smartphone readings and 3 ELISA measurements were done. Bland-Altman analysis In table 2 we show the agreement between home test and corresponding ELISA per manufacturer using the Bland-Altman plot analysis. IBDoc underestimated the fCAL ELISA results over the whole range of potential calprotectin values with a mean bias of 105 \u00b5g/g (agreement interval 942 \u00b5g/g). QuantOn Cal overestimated IDK-Calprotectin ELISA results with a mean 137 \u00b5g/g (agreement interval 1574 \u00b5g/g).

Fig 2 shows that in all comparisons the paired measurements were more clustered and closer to the zero-difference line in the low calprotectin range and more scattered in the high range. Low calprotectin range ( 500 \u00b5g/g) In the low calprotectin range the percentage of paired measurements within acceptable limits of difference for IBDoc, QuantOn Cal 76% (235/310), respectively. 3 shows that the difference scores for IBDoc, QuantOn Cal and CalproSmart were distributed in an approximately normal pattern around the bias of -19 \u00b5g/g (agreement interval 560 \u00b5g/g), -4 \u00b5g/g (agreement interval 455 \u00b5g/g) and 72 \u00b5g/g (agreement interval 458 \u00b5g/g), respectively. The agreement interval of all three comparisons exceeded the acceptable limits of difference in the low range (i.e. 200 \u00b5g/g).

Concordance Fig 4 shows the concordance between home tests and corresponding ELISA tests in each of three ranges (i.e., <250, 250-500 and >500 \u00b5g/g) that we use in our clinical practice. Of the IBDoc-fCAL pairs 358 of 471 (82%) were concordant. Discordance between the IBDoc-fCAL pairs leading serious misclassification of disease activity (i.e., calprotectin >500 \u00b5g/g with one method and <250 \u00b5g/g with the other) were observed in 24 of 471 stool samples (5%). QuantOn Cal and IDK-Calprotectin had 361 of 457 (79%) concordant test pairs, and 35 of 457 (8%) discordant test pairs leading to serious misclassification of disease activity. CalproSmart and Calprotectin-ALP had 330 of 452 (73%) concordant test pairs, and 11 of 452 (2%) seriously discordant test pairs. 135 6 Figure 2.

Forty-three percent of the total amount of reading errors was with the Motorola device, in particular in combination with the QuantOn Cal application (Fig 5). Common reason for reading errors was an out of focus image. System Usability Scale Fig 6 shows that mean SUS scores per home test were lowest on the first day of testing. On the last day of testing IBDoc was awarded the highest grade (B) of all home tests, mainly because the smartphone application was error-friendly and therefore less cumbersome to use. Figure 5.

We have shown that the majority of measurements performed with a lateral flow immunoassay and smartphone reader agreed sufficiently with the ELISA-based quantification of the same manufacturer, provided that calprotectin levels are below 500 \u00b5g/g. In the high calprotectin range a substantial proportion of measurement pairs exceeded the predefined limits of difference (\u00b1200 \u00b5g/g). QuantOn Cal performed significantly poorer in the high range than IBDoc and CalproSmart. IBDoc had significantly fewer reading errors than the other two applications. The Motorola device turned out to be less suitable for calprotectin readings than the other smartphone types. A complete summary of the test performance per manufacturer is shown in S1 Table. IBDoc QuantOn Cal CalproSmartPrimary outcome Secondary outcome Agreement (low range)Agreement (high range)Concor- danceRER SUS meh meh mehFROWN The possibility to measure calprotectin with a smartphone at home is a novelty in IBD-care. We identified three recently published studies on the IBDoc home test,(7, 9, 10) and one on the CalproSmart home test.(11) All studies showed acceptable agreement between home test and companion ELISA in the low range and lack of agreement in the high range. These studies differ from ours in several important ways. First, in three of the aforementioned studies, home tests were performed before shipping the unrefrigerated stool samples to the laboratory.(7, S1 Table. Summary of performance of calprotectin home tests.140 610, 11) The possible decline in calprotectin during transport may have affected the agreement with the ELISA results, while in our experiment the transport of stool samples was taken out of the equation. Second, none of the studies performed a subgroup analysis per smartphone type, while we compared several iOS and Android devices. By doing so, we were able to show that not all smartphone cameras were suitable for calprotectin readings. Third, in this study we report an a priori decision of acceptable limits of difference for adequate interpretation of the Bland-Altman plot, a feature that was absent in three of the aforementioned studies.(9-11) Precision is of utmost importance in the low ranges of calprotectin values, where small deviations can lead to misclassification of disease activity and wrong treatment decisions. In our practice, however, imprecision in the high range is less of an issue, since we consider each calprotectin result >500 \u00b5g/g to reflect active disease, irrespective of the absolute concentration. A twofold increase in calprotectin, e.g. from 1000 to 2000 \u00b5g/g, does not necessarily mean that the inflamed surface area of the gastrointestinal tract doubled, neither that the intensity of the inflammation increased. Any shift of calprotectin values out of the target range, and into the action range ( 500 g/g) is a trigger for us to change the treatment plan. In order to appreciate the true value of the home tests in the high range, we also evaluated the concordance with companion ELISAs. We observed that 119 of 125 IBDoc readings 500 g/g were concordant with fCAL results (95%), 49% for the QuantOnCal--IDK-Calprotectin and CalproSmart-- Calprotectin-ALP pairs. There are some limitations in our study that need to be addressed. First, the home tests were not performed by real IBD patients. Instead, we had three 3rd year medical students (AG, SA, JAAB) without any specific laboratory training to fill the lateral flow cassettes and execute the smartphone readings. They only had access to the instructions for use and video tutorials on the internet. We acknowledge that their level of education is higher than the \"average IBD patient\". Second, although we aimed to collect stool samples that covered the whole range of potential consistencies, we missed the liquid samples. For that reason we were unable to evaluate the effect of stool consistency on the precision of the lateral flow-based method. The evidence base for calprotectin-guided treatment escalation and de-escalation is accumulating.(1, 2, 12) Simultaneously, the 141 6number of telemonitoring initiatives for IBD care is rising.(13-16) Telemonitoring with calprotectin home testing can make the service to IBD patients more efficient, as the technology allows to select and target patients that benefit from a face-to-face encounter with their IBD-team at short notice. We evaluated by how much the home tests differed from the trusted ELISA method, and found that in the lower ranges the difference was small enough not to cause problems in interpretation. We conclude that the flow-based home-test and the companion ELISA method can be used interchangeably. To minimize wrongful interpretation of calprotectin changes over time it is essential to always use the home test and companion ELISA of one and the same manufacturer. This advice was already in force for the use of ELISA tests.(17-20) Ultimately, patients and health care providers would both benefit from better co- calibration of stool calprotectin assays.

It is believed to run a milder course in children than in adults. To test this assumption, we evaluated time-to-complication curves in two independent pediatric-onset cohorts from the same geographical area. Methods : Short-term disease outcomes were evaluated with an online clinical registry that was filled with data on children with SC diagnosed between 2000 and 2017 and who were followed bi-annually thereafter. Long-term disease outcomes were evaluated in a pediatric-onset subcohort derived from a previously published population-based study from the Netherlands. Time- to-complication in the first cohort was defined as the time from diagnosis until portal hypertension, biliary obstructions and infections, development of malignancy, or liver transplantation, whichever came first. In the second cohort time-to-complication was defined as the time until liver transplantation or PSC-related death. Results : Median age at diagnosis in the first cohort (n=86) was 12.3 years. In the first 5 years post-diagnosis 23% of patients developed complications. The patients in the population-based study (n=683) were stratified into those diagnosed before the age of 18 years (\"pediatric-onset\" subcohort, n=43) and those diagnosed after the age of 18 years (\"adult-onset\" subcohort, n=640). Median age at diagnosis was 14.6 and 40.2 years, respectively. Median time-to- complication in the pediatric-onset and adult-onset subcohorts were not statistically different. Conclusion : Pediatric and adult-onset SC run a similar long-term disease course. Pediatricians who treat children with SC should monitor them closely to recognize early complications and control long-term sequelae. ABSTRACT150 7INTRODUCTIONKEY POINTS BOX Sclerosing cholangitis (SC) is characterized by fibrosis of the intra- and/or extrahepatic bile ducts and is strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The disease presents in most patients between the age of 25 and 40 years1, 2, though it is recognized as an important cause of chronic liver disease in children. Patients with SC carry an ongoing and disproportionate high clinical need because of the association with poor clinical outcomes including end-stage biliary cirrhosis and hepatopancreatobiliary and colorectal malignancies.3, 4 In the early stages bile duct disease may be easily overlooked, as symptoms are initially nonspecific and intestinal disease is frequently more prominent in patients with concomitant IBD.5 It is suggested by several authors that pediatric-onset SC runs a milder course and has a more favourable outcome compared to adult-onset PSC.6, 7 The time horizon in these papers could have been restricted by transfer of patients to adult-oriented care. To test the assumption of a relatively benign disease course in pediatric-onset SC, we evaluated time-to-complication curves in two independent Dutch cohorts. The first cohort contained data of children with SC who were followed bi-annually until transfer to adult-oriented care, the second cohort consisted of adults with pediatric-onset SC derived from a previously published population-based study from the Netherlands. It is thought that pediatric-onset SC has a milder phenotype and therefore a more favourable outcome compared to adult-onset SC, but the time horizon of earlier studies was restricted due to transfer to adult-oriented care. We evaluated time-to-complication curves in two independent Dutch cohorts. A total of 23% pediatric-onset patients developed biliary and portal hypertensive complications in the first five years after SC diagnosis. No differences were seen between pediatric-onset SC and adult-onset SC with regard to long-term liver-related outcomes and survival. 151 7METHODS Objectives Our objectives were to (1) describe short-term outcomes, for which we created an online registry filled with closely followed data on pediatric-onset SC patients in the Netherlands during the first five years after diagnosis, and (2) compare long-term disease outcomes between pediatric- and adulthood-onset SC patients, for which we used data from a second, independent, previously published population-based study from the Netherlands. (2) Short-term disease outcomes (cohort 1) Setting We used longitudinal data on pediatric-onset SC patients who were diagnosed between 2000 and 2017 at five tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands, including one referral pediatric liver transplant center. The data were derived from local clinical databases and International Classification of Diseases code searches. We assessed clinical, biochemical, radiological and histological parameters at SC diagnosis, and followed the patients at least bi- annually until transfer to adult-oriented care. We created an online clinical registry using Castor Electronic Data Capture (Amsterdam, The Netherlands8), which was filled with retrospective data for this specific research project. After this project, the registry will be maintained and regularly updated to serve as a prospective registry. The ethical committee of the Erasmus MC in Rotterdam reviewed the study protocol and waived the need for informed consent due to the anonymous and non-interventional fashion of the study (MEC-2016-736). Secondary approval was obtained from all other participating centers. Participants Pediatric-onset SC is classified as primary SC (PSC) or autoimmune SC (ASC). The latter is also known as PSC- autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) overlap syndrome, due to concurrence of increased levels of transaminases, hypergammaglobulinaemia and autoantibodies. We included patients diagnosed with SC before the age of 18 years. Patients with cholangiopathies secondary to surgical complications or other liver diseases were excluded. We reviewed immunological, radiological and/or histological features to determine if patients were appropriately assigned a diagnosis of PSC, ASC or AIH (Figure 152 7S1). The diagnosis of SC was based on a cholestatic biochemical profile (raised conjugated bilirubin levels (ERC) or (MRC), and/or ductular reactions on liver histology. SC patients with at least one of the appropriate auto- antibodies in their serum (anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA); anti- smooth muscle antibodies (anti-SMA); anti-liver kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM-1); or antibody to liver cytosol (anti-LC-1)) were classified as ASC. SC patients with negative auto-antibodies were classified as PSC.9, 10 Patients were excluded from further analysis when they had isolated AIH,11, 12 or when both cholangiography (ERC or MRC) and liver biopsy were missing in the diagnostic work-up (Figure S1). Variables Baseline data included patient demographics, associated immune disorders and presence and type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), signs, symptoms and age at SC diagnosis; and detailed information on diagnostic work up. We used age- and sex- adjusted cut points for elevated ALP. Cut-offs were 424 U/L for boys and girls younger than 13 years, 454 U/L for boys 13 to 17 years, and 254 U/L for girls between 13 and 17 years.13 Hepatomegaly was defined as a liver length measured in the midclavicular line exceeding the upper limit of normal for height and age.14 Splenomegaly was defined as a splenic length measured in coronal section (passing through the splenic hilum) exceeding the upper limit of normal for age and gender.14 Follow-up data included the clinical endpoints (1) portal hypertensive complications, (2) biliary complications, (3) hepatobiliary malignancy, (4) liver transplantation, or (5) death from liver disease. Portal hypertensive complications included thrombocytopenia (<150 \u00d7 109/l), bleeding (TIPS). Biliary complications included duct obstruction, whether or not requiring endoscopic intervention. The composite outcome short-term disease progression was defined as occurrence of at least one of five clinical endpoints within the first five years following diagnosis of SC. 153 7 Figure S1. Diagnostic decision matrix. Immunological, radiological and/or histological features were reviewed to determine if patients were appropriately assigned a diagnosis of PSC, ASC or AIH. Patients were excluded from further analysis when they had isolated AIH, or when both cholangiography and liver biopsy were missing in the diagnostic work-up. Predictors of short-term disease progression To construct a prognostic model for short-term disease progression we carried out a backward stepwise elimination. Candidate predictors with p<0.10 in bivariate analysis were selected for use in the multivariate analysis. This level was chosen 154 7because of the limited number of patients in the analysis. For patients with an incomplete follow-up (i.e. less than five years postdiagnosis) we calculated the Follow-Up Index (FUI), which is defined as the ratio between the actual observed follow-up period and the minimally preferred follow-up period.14 The FUI ranges from near 1.0 (almost 5 years follow-up) to near 0 (diagnosed just before the study closing date). The FUI is a simple measure to critically appraise the credibility of the prognostic model. Patients with isolated AIH were excluded from the survival and logistic regression analysis. Long-term disease outcomes (cohort 2) To obtain insight in long-term disease course of pediatric- onset SC patients after transition to adult care, we used a large comprehensive SC cohort that has been described before, and which came from the same geographical area of the Netherlands as cohort 1.2 Between January 2008 and December 2011, the researchers in this study identified all adult PSC patients in 44 hospitals in the Netherlands, that were diagnosed from 2000 onward. Data collection included patient demographics, disease characteristics at diagnosis and follow-up of clinical endpoints, as liver transplantation and SC-related death. For our study, we performed an additional analyses of this cohort and stratified for age at diagnosis before 18 years (\"pediatric- onset\" cohort, n=43) or after 18 years (\"adult-onset\" cohort, n=640). We compared frequencies of liver transplantations, median time- to-complication, and SC-related death. Detailed information on the study design, participants, data collection and variables can be found in the original publication.2 Statistical methods Data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23 Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were evaluated for both SC registries using descriptive statistics. We summarized continuous variables as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR: 25th percentile, 75th percentile). For discrete variables, we calculated the 95% confidence interval in OpenEpi, Version 3, using the Wilson method for calculating confidence intervals for proportions. Differences in groups were compared by the Mann Whitney U test for continuous variables; for categorical outcomes the Chi square test and Fisher's exact test were used. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. In cohort 1, we estimated the cumulative incidence of any of the 155 7above-mentioned clinical endpoints, by performing Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Time was defined as the moment of SC diagnosis until appearance of the first sign of early hepatic deterioration or until five years after SC diagnosis. Patients who did not have a complete follow-up of 5 years and did not develop signs of disease progression were censored. In cohort 2, a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with Log rank test was performed to compare long-term disease outcomes between pediatric-onset and adult-onset SC patients. Event was defined as liver transplantation or death from liver disease. Time was defined as the moment of SC diagnosis until appearance of the event. Patients who were lost to follow-up without experiencing an event were censored. RESULTS Short-term disease outcomes in pediatric-onset SC Patient demographics and characteristics We identified 160 patients who were diagnosed between 2000 and 2017. A total of 17 children were excluded because of an incomplete diagnostic work-up, and 57 for isolated AIH. Thirty- two patients were classified as PSC and 54 as ASC (Table 1). Patients were diagnosed at a median age of 12.4 years (IQR 9.1- 14.8) and the gender distribution was predominantly male (PSC 75% and ASC 61%). PSC patient had an associated autoimmune disease (celiac disease). Both PSC and ASC were strongly associated with IBD (respectively in 84% and 76% of cases). UC was the predominant type of IBD in both PSC and ASC with a high pancolitis (PSC, 70%; ASC, 83%). Characterization of SC at diagnosis Among the 54 patients with ASC, 25 were positive for ANA alone, 9 for both SMA and ANA, 19 for SMA alone and 1 for LKM1 alone. Diagnostic liver ultrasonography was performed in 65 of the 86 patients (76%). Splenomegaly was present at ultrasonography in 19 patients (26%) and hepatomegaly in 31 patients (43%). MRC or ERC was performed in 73 patients (85%) and liver biopsy in 75 patients (87%). All received (UDCA); 94% 156 7of ASC patients received UDCA. Steroid tapering dose was given to 59% of PSC patients (n=19) and 85% of ASC patients (n=46), in the majority of cases (80%) as induction therapy for concomitant IBD. Thiopurines were used by 59% of PSC patients (n=19), which 89% had the ASC patients (n=41) used thiopurines. Short-term disease progression Individual patients were followed for a median of 5.1 years (IQR 2.6-7.8) after SC diagnosis (Table 2). Figure 1 shows that the interval to hepatic deterioration was similar for patients with PSC and ASC (p=0.752, log-rank test, Figure 1). Portal hypertensive developed 16% of PSC patients (n=5) and of of ASC Four ASC patients (7%) developed both portal hypertensive as well as biliary complications. Liver transplantation was performed in three patients after a mean disease duration of 9.3 years (range 5.9-9.8). Two patients died; one patient with ASC and end-stage liver disease from massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and one patient with PSC died in a traffic accident. No patients developed cancer within the follow- up period. Predictors of short-term disease progression Twenty patients (23%) developed disease progression in the first 5 years after diagnosis. Fifty-eight of 86 patients (67%) had a complete 5-year follow-up. The remaining 28 patients with an incomplete follow-up had a mean (SD) FUI of 0.41 (0.21). We measured candidate factors to construct a prognostic model for short-term disease progression. Table 3 shows the results of the bivariate logistic regression analysis and the multivariate model, selected with the maximum likelihood approach. Treatment with thiopurines, steroids or UDCA did not influence disease course. Elevated ALP, fibrosis in liver biopsy, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly on ultrasonography had a P-value <0.10 and were selected for use in the multivariate analysis. In the multivariate model elevated ALP (odds ratio [OR] 5, 2-47) remained significant predictors short-term disease progression. The logistic regression coefficients ( ) in the multivariate model allowed to construct a forecast for short-term disease progression in children at diagnosis of SC.

As an example of the use of this equation, consider a teenager with the SC phenotype, with elevated ALP and hepatomegaly. The total risk score of this patient amounts to 0.3, which corresponds to a probability of short-term disease progression of 57%, compared to a pre-test probability of 23%. Long-term disease outcomes in pediatric-onset versus adult- onset SC The large SC cohort by Boonstra et al. included a total of 697 SC patients. Fourteen patients were excluded from the analyses because the date of diagnosis was missing (Table 4). Mean age of liver disease diagnosis was 14.6 years in the pediatric-onset cohort Figure 1.

Adolescents with PSC (solid line) are compared with adolescents with ASC (dotted line).

Time is defined as the moment of SC diagnosis until the first complication, or five years postdiagnosis.

There were no baseline differences in sex, presence of AIH overlap, small duct disease, or concomitant diagnosis with IBD between the pediatric-onset and adult-onset SC patients. Median follow up was 10 years (IQR 7-17) for the pediatric-onset cohort and 8 years (IQR 4-13.8) for the adult-onset cohort. During follow-up patients 59 adult-onset SC patients (9%) died. Median transplant-free survival was 21 and 23 years in pediatric- onset and adult-onset SC patients, respectively. Frequencies of liver transplantations (23% vs 17%) and mean disease duration until liver transplantation (11 years vs 9.3 years) were not statistically different between the pediatric-onset and adult-onset cohort, respectively. Figure 2 shows that there is no difference in time- to-liver transplantation or SC-related death between both sub cohorts (p=0.58, Log-rank test). Figure 2.

In cohort 1, which was ideal for studying short-term disease progression, twenty-three percent of patients developed portal hypertension, biliary complications, or progressed to liver transplantation within 5 years after SC diagnosis. In cohort 2, which allowed us to study long-term disease outcomes beyond the age of transfer to adult-oriented care, we observed that pediatric and adult-onset SC run a similar disease course regarding time-to-transplantation and SC related death. Our findings contradict the current view that pediatric- onset SC runs a relatively benign disease course as compared to adult-onset SC. Comparison with other studies Disease progression We identified ten observational studies from MEDLINE and EMBASE that described pediatric cohorts with SC.6, 7, 15-18 A recently published multicenter, international cohort study of children with SC (n=781) reported portal hypertensive and biliary complications in 30% of cases in the first five years postdiagnosis, and 12% of patients required a liver transplantation within 5 years after SC diagnosis.6 Similarly, 11% of children included in a single center cohort of pediatric PSC patients from the United States (n=120) was transplanted in the first five years postdiagnosis.7 Our data from cohort 1 demonstrates that 23% of patients develop short-term disease progression within 5 years after SC diagnosis. This is possibly an underestimation as indicated by the low FUI. Taken together, our data and earlier published information show that a quarter to a third of pediatric-onset SC patients have a progressively worsening liver condition before transfer to adult-oriented care. Recently, a more favorable outcome of SC in children is described in an Italian pediatric-onset SC cohort (n=45), with approximately 15% (n=7) of patients developing liver- related disease complications after a mean follow-up of 8.7\u00b15.6 years. 20 This is likely explained by the fact that most children in the Italian cohort had asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes at disease diagnosis, as in Italy healthy children are often screened for liver function, illustrating that published series about pediatric SC indeed depend on the center and country where the study is performed.165 7Prognostic biomarkers Low platelet count, prolonged pro-thrombin time and higher values of bilirubin and GGT have previously been identified as markers for progressive liver disease in children with SC.6, 15, 16 In our multivariate model that was based on cohort 1 these laboratory markers had no prognostic value. Instead we identified hepatomegaly on ultrasonography and elevated ALP at diagnosis as significant and independent predictors of short-term disease progression. Elevated ALP has not been identified as a prognostic marker in previous pediatric research, but is consistently associated with poor prognosis in adult SC literature.19-23 Some may argue that GGT is a more accurate diagnostic marker of SC in children than ALP, as ALP is also dependent on bone growth.15, 16 However, in our patient cohort GGT was already elevated in 94% cases at diagnosis, which explains its poor specificity to use it as an indicator for future disease progression. Phenotype of pediatric- versus adult-onset SC Some groups have suggested that pediatric-onset SC has a milder phenotype and therefore a more favourable outcome compared to adult-onset SC.6, 7 The international collaboration group that recently published the results of a large cohort of children with SC (n=781) reported a transplantation-free survival of 88% and 70% at 5 and 10 years respectively.6 In a large international cohort of adult patients with SC (n=7121) transplantation-free survival was 80%, 63% and 48% after 5, 10 and 15 years postdiagnosis.24 Variation in geographical backgrounds of these two large cohorts may have hampered a reliable comparison of transplantation-free survival. As far as we know this is the first time that long-term outcomes of pediatric-onset and adult-onset SC patients coming from the same geographical area were compared.2 The time- to-complication analysis showed that there was no difference between pediatric- and adult-onset SC. We therefore argue that pediatric-onset SC follows the same disease course as adult-onset SC. Implications for pediatric practice Despite the lack of current therapies that cure or halt disease progression, targeting and selecting children with a likelihood of short-term disease progression has several benefits, including appropriate counselling of the patient and family, close monitoring for potential severe complications (including hepatobiliary and colorectal malignancies) and timely referral to a 166 7liver transplantation center. The prognostic biomarkers described in cohort 1 (hepatomegaly on ultrasonography and elevated ALP) may allow physicians involved in the care of children to more accurately predict disease progression in the early stages of SC. The robustness of these biomarkers needs to be evaluated in a validation cohort of patients with pediatric-onset SC. Our findings provide an evidence base that the time-to- complication in pediatric-onset SC is not different from the adult- onset type. We call for a more rigorous follow-up of children with SC, including monitoring for symptoms from dominant strictures such as cholangitis, jaundice, pruritus, right upper quadrant pain or worsening cholestatic biochemical profile. Additionally, in those without concurrent IBD annual fecal calprotectin screening is warranted. A detailed handover letter including a clear timeline of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures should be written by the pediatric team prior to the transfer to adult-oriented care. Strengths and limitations The diagnostic criteria for pediatric-onset SC are not univocal. There is a need to develop an evidence-based guideline that brings more uniformity in the diagnostic criteria for SC in children. One of the strengths of this study was the confirmation of the diagnosis of PSC or ASC with a detailed record review and diagnostic decision matrix with strict definitions for PSC and ASC (Figure S1), instead of merely relying on the administration of the treating doctor or on coding data. This strategy reduced the risk of misclassification and misdiagnosis, and consequently type I errors. A limitation was that not all patients in cohort 1 had a complete 5-year follow-up. Although our study provides important insight regarding disease progression in pediatric-onset SC, potential drawbacks of this study relate to the retrospective nature of the study and the limited sample size. 167 7In conclusion, our data provide new insights into the course of disease in pediatric-onset SC. The results strongly suggest that pediatric- and adult-onset SC run a similar short- and long-term disease course. Both pediatricians as well as adult-oriented specialists who treat patients with pediatric-onset SC should monitor them closely to recognize early complications and control long-term sequelae. Finally, our methodology in which we used two independent cohorts from the same geographical area for the evaluation of short-term and long-term disease outcome is valid and useful for the follow-up of young patients with rare diseases, whose disease course is blurred by transition to adult- oriented care.

Patient Age, Sex, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Phenotype Associate With Course of Primary SEQUENCING PRIMARY CHOLANGITIS Haisma rare bile duct disease strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While several rare mutations are known to contribute to very early onset IBD, similar variants have not been identified for early-onset PSC. We therefore performed whole- exome sequencing (WES) in patients diagnosed with PSC before the age of 13 to investigate. Methods : In this multicenter study, WES was performed on 95 DNA samples from 29 index patients with early-onset PSC and their biological parents and eight single early-onset PSC patients. 81% of patients had IBD at the time of PSC diagnosis. We performed patient-parent trio analyses and selected rare (minor allele frequency <0.1%) coding and splice-site variants that matched recessive (homozygous and compound heterozygous variants) and dominant (de novo) inheritance in the index patients. Variant pathogenicity was predicted by an in-house developed algorithm (GAVIN), and PSC-relevant variants were selected using gene expression data and gene function, amongst other factors. Results : In two separate trios we identified compound heterozygous variants in the genes ABCB6, DACT1 and JMJDC1. In eight other trios we identified 10 de novo variants in 10 genes with predicted pathogenic effects on protein function. The genes identified have roles in bile salt homeostasis, adaptive and innate immunity, and epithelial barrier function. Conclusion : For 10 out of 29 families, we identified rare protein- altering genetic variants in 13 genes that may explain a substantial part of the etiology of PSC. The functional consequences of these newly discovered variants, and the associated susceptibility to PSC, will require further verification using replication studies and functional testing.ABSTRACT174 8INTRODUCTION Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare chronic cholestatic disease characterized by progressive inflammation and obliterative fibrosis of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts.(1) There is a strong relation between PSC and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients who initially present with isolated PSC may go on to develop IBD years later.(2,3) In adult-onset disease, approximately two-thirds of patients with PSC have concurrent IBD.(1) The co-occurrence of PSC and IBD is higher in children than in adults, varying from 76% to 97%.(4-7) Disease progression is inevitable in the majority of PSC patients, with the development of biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension requiring repeated endoscopic procedures. Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment option, but the disease recurs in 20-25% of transplanted patients.(4,6) Cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal cancer are feared complications in PSC and the most common causes of death.(8) The pathogenesis of PSC is largely unknown. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) in adult-onset PSC carried out by the International PSC Study Group recently identified 31 risk loci, but the associated genetic variants so far explain <10% of disease susceptibility.(9) It has been speculated that rare variants with large effect size may play a role in the onset of complex disorders, but these variants are so rare in allele frequency (many of them private mutations) that their genetic signals are not detected by GWAS. In contrast, whole exome sequencing (WES) in patients with extreme phenotypes, such as young age of disease onset, has led to the identification of potentially causative genetic variants in IBD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes type 1.(10-13) Likewise, in a subset of patients with early-onset PSC, we expect to find rare genetic variants resembling a monogenic or oligogenic inheritance pattern. We therefore performed WES in a Dutch cohort of patients with early-onset PSC and their parents. 175 8METHODS Study design, participants and setting In this multicenter parent-offspring study we collected DNA from PSC patients with disease-onset prior to their 13th birthday and from their biological parents. PSC diagnosis was confirmed by cholangiography (presence of multifocal strictures, focal dilatation, or beading of biliary cholestasis), or both. Patients with sclerosing cholangitis due to secondary causes such as surgery, trauma, cancer or infection were excluded from participation. Patients were recruited in five tertiary care hospitals in the Netherlands - University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG, a referral pediatric liver transplant center), Erasmus University Medical Center-Sophia Children's Hospital, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam University Medical Center-Emma Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht-Wilhelmina Children's Hospital - and one large general teaching hospital, the Isala Hospital. Eligible patients were those regularly attending the (pediatric) gastroenterology and hepatology clinics as part of standard care. After informed consent was given, the following information was obtained from the local patient records and entered in an online clinical registry using Castor Electronic Data Capture (Amsterdam, the Netherlands): age at PSC diagnosis, findings on cholangiography and/or histology, and follow-up data on medication use and appearance of biliary cirrhosis, portal hypertension or malignancies. If applicable, age at IBD diagnosis, IBD type and location based on the Paris Classification(14) were also entered. Between January 2017 and July 2017 blood was collected from patients and volunteering parents for genomic DNA extraction according to standard protocols. Ethical considerations The Medical Ethical Committee of the UMCG approved the study protocol (METC 2016/289), and secondary approval was obtained from all participating centers. All participating parents and teenagers 12-19 years old gave informed consent prior study inclusion. 176 8Whole-exome sequencing Libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera prep kit and hybrid capture (Illumina Rapid Capture Enrichment - 37 Mb target), and sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. All raw data underwent quality control steps (https://hub.docker.com/r/ broadinstitute/gatk/) without any noticeable negative features to achieve 86.06 million high quality reads per sample with 98.85% of reads aligned, on average, resulting in a coverage of 81% of the target region with a read depth of >30X. Sequence reads were aligned to the human reference genome using Novoalign (http://www.novocraft.com). Next, the Genome Analysis Toolkit of the Broad Institute (15) was used for calling single-nucleotide polymorphism and insertions/deletions. Variant annotation Variants were annotated with (16), using publicly available data from Ensembl and Refseq, and with GAVIN, an annotation tool with an algorithm that scores the likely pathogenicity of the variants.(17) Additional annotations at the variant-, exon- and gene-level were obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project (http:// www.1000genomes.org); National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project Exome Variant (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org). Variant filtering We used variants with a sequence coverage of five or greater. We used a Genomics Data Management System (Alissa Interpret - Agilent technologies) to create a filtering tree specifically designed for this study (see figure 1). We performed patient-parent trio analyses. On the variant- level, we selected variants matching recessive (homozygous and compound heterozygous variants) and dominant (de novo) inheritance in the children. HLA-variants were excluded from this analysis. We filtered for variants with a minor allele frequency <0.1% in data from (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS) and ExAC (http://exac.broadinstitute.org). Variants were then selected based upon whether they were (1) deemed to be coding (missense- and nonsense mutations, frameshift insertions and deletions) or to have an effect on splicing and (2) predicted to be 177 8(likely) pathogenic according to GAVIN (17). Further variant prioritization was based on evidence from the literature for the relevance of the gene to the disease recovered from multiple databases including Genecards (www.genecards. com), Inheritance in Man; www.omim.org). Genes were selected when they were expressed on the mRNA-level in the liver, gallbladder or intestines. We then selected genes based on one of the following criteria: 1. the gene function was already known to be associated with the PSC phenotype or a similar phenotype (including immunological, inflammatory or bile salt pathways), 2. the gene was not (or rarely) reported in the literature and therefore cannot be excluded from having a potential role in the disease pathogenesis, 3. the gene function is well known but not directly associated to the disease phenotype (i.e. gene function in DNA replication) and can therefore also not be excluded from having a potential role in disease pathogenesis. Genes were excluded when there was substantial literature evidence that the gene codes for a function not related to the PSC-phenotype (i.e. olfactory receptor genes (TAARs), motile cilia function genes (CCDC40), or keratin associated protein genes (KRTAP5-6)). Variant verification and validation De novo variants were manually checked for quality in the BAM files. If there was doubt about the validity of the variant, confirmatory Sanger sequencing was performed. To find further supporting evidence for new candidate genes, the exomes of the patients whose parental DNA was not obtained (D1-D8) were checked for possible disease-causing variants within the candidate genes from the trio-analyses.178 8RESULTS A total of 37 patients with early-onset PSC were enrolled in this study (see figure 1). WES was performed on all 95 DNA samples (29 patient-parent trios and 8 single patients). Table 1 shows the patient characteristics. Patients were diagnosed with PSC at a median age of 10.3 years (range: 2.5-12.8) and were predominantly male (70%). 81% of patients (n=30) had concurrent IBD, with ulcerative colitis significantly more prevalent than Crohn's disease (73% vs. 27%). Other (n=1) and vitiligo (n=1). None of the parents had liver disease, but three had IBD.

Patient characteristics The median time between PSC diagnosis and inclusion in this study was 5.0 years. Biliary complications including cholangitis or bile duct obstruction had occurred in three patients (8%), and cirrhosis had occurred in eight (22%). Two patients (5%) underwent a liver transplantation after a disease duration of 10 and 11 years, respectively, and two other patients were on the waiting list for liver transplantation. One of the cirrhotic patients had experienced bleeding of esophageal varices and required a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure. Thirty-four patients (92%) were prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid. 179 8 Figure 1.

We identified 13 candidate genes matching a recessive or dominant inheritance pattern that are also known to be expressed on the mRNA-level in the liver, gallbladder or intestines and predicted to be deleterious by at least one pathogenicity prediction tool (see Table 2). We identified compound heterozygous variants in the ABCB6 gene in trio 3 and compound heterozygous variants in the DACT1 and JMJDC1 gene in trio 21. These variants disrupt highly conserved regions of the proteins and were therefore considered to be protein-altering variants. In eight other trios, we identified 10 de novo protein- altering variants. Figure 2 provides an overview of the possible pathogenic mechanisms of our findings. The genes MARCH1 and PTX4 encode for proteins that have roles associated with the immune system. The genes TRDN , SLC9B1 and ABCB6 are related to the 'Transport of glucose and other sugars, bile salts and organic acids, metal ions and amine compounds' pathway (www.reactome.org). We identified one de novo intronic variant positioned exactly at a splice-donor consensus sequence site in CDHR2 , disrupting splicing of the transcript. De novo nonsynonymous variants were found in the genes WISP1, CHST11, PLXDC1, CALCRL and SMCHD1 , but we could not directly link the known gene functions to the disease. We also sequenced the DNA of eight early-onset PSC patients whose parental DNA was not obtained. We checked the WES data of these eight patients for possible disease-causing variants in the 13 candidate genes from our trio-analyses and identified a nonsynonymous variant in gene managementDisturbed bile homeostasis Disturbed Immunological and Inflammatory pathways barrier defectUnknown mechanisms Figure 2.

The trio-analysis approach revealed 13 candidate disease-causing variants with large effects on protein function in several genes, many of them involved in immunological or bile salt pathways. Our findings strengthen the hypothesis that rare variants can contribute to the development of PSC in patients with extreme PSC phenotypes such as early-onset disease. Interpretation Previous studies aiming to identify rare variants in PSC Low-frequency and rare genetic variants often have larger effect- sizes on protein function than common variants.(44,45) Previous studies have shown that these rare variants may also contribute to the development of complex disorders.(10,11,46) Proper analyses of these variants, revealed by WES, requires massive numbers of cases and controls. Therefore, in 2013, the BROAD Institute partnered with researchers worldwide to develop a collaborative exome sequencing network in IBD, and this initiative is currently ongoing. A similar project is now up and running in PSC with the aim to meta-analyze the exomes of more than 1000 patients of European ancestry. An alternate method for studying low-frequency and rare variants is to focus on extreme PSC-phenotypes because they are more likely to be caused by rare variants.(45) We therefore decided to select only patients with early-onset disease in this study. WES of all protein-coding genes results in many variants of uncertain clinical significance. A trio-analysis design, i.e. the inclusion of patients and parents in the analysis of rare genetic variants, helps to immediately ascertain whether a variant is inherited or de novo. Population stratification is a major concern with rare variants because they tend to be more geographically clustered than common variants. However, in contrast to case-control studies, trio association studies are less sensitive to population stratification. 187 8Potential role of the identified new risk genes in PSC pathogenesis Previous studies on the genetics of PSC have confirmed the auto- immune origins of the disease, with the predominant genetic findings localized within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex on chromosome 6 and most non-HLA loci associated with other immune-mediated or auto-immune pathways.(1,9) Furthermore, liver biopsies from patients with PSC showed mainly T cells and, to a lesser degree, macrophages and neutrophils in the infiltrates.(1) In our search for potential disease-causing variants, we therefore prioritized genes that related to immunological or inflammatory pathways. Based on previous studies, the gene MARCH1 perfectly segregates with an auto-immune phenotype. A de novo stop-gain variant located at the very beginning of this gene (transcript position 4) was found in a boy of 8 years of age with PSC-autoimmune hepatitis overlap syndrome, also called autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis. Functional studies of MARCH1 have confirmed that this gene mediates the immunosuppressive effect of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL10) on antigen presentation in monocytes via ubiquitination and degradation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II molecules.(22,23) Knockdown of MARCH1 strongly inhibited IL-10-dependent down- regulation of cell surface HLA-DR.(22) The exact contribution of the MARCH1 gene regulation to immunopathology remains to be explored. Some of the previously identified PSC susceptibility loci harbor genes that are potentially involved in bile acid homeostasis.(1) In our cohort, we identified multiple variants in genes related to the 'Transport of glucose and other sugars, bile salts and organic acids, metal ions and amine compounds' pathway (www. reactome.org). A girl with disease-onset of both PSC and IBD at age 7, had compound heterozygous ABCB6 variants. The gene encodes a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily and is known to bind heme and porphyrins and function in their ATP-dependent uptake in the mitochondria.(21,47) Both variants were predicted to be damaging and to disrupt the highly conserved ABC transport and ABC transmembrane regions of the protein, respectively. Interestingly, mutation of another ABC-transporter gene ( ABCB4 ) leads to type 3, a Mendelian cholestatic syndrome with many similarities to PSC. Although we can link several of the new candidate genes we found with the known pathogenesis of PSC, this is more difficult for other candidate genes as their protein function remains unknown. Rare variants with large coding effects in genes of unknown function were therefore also included in our list of new candidate genes. Strengths & limitations This is the first family-based WES study performed in a relatively large subgroup of PSC patients with an extreme phenotype, namely young age of disease-onset. Previous studies have used this method to identify disease-causing rare variants in isolated cases, and then performed targeted-sequencing in patients with similar phenotypes.(46,48) Our findings suggest that, within this young subgroup of PSC patients with a severe phenotype, rare variants largely affect the onset of their disease, resembling a more monogenic or oligogenic inheritance pattern. We have not yet performed functional tests to confirm this presumption, and this paper should therefore be seen as hypothesis-generating, providing a starting point for further studies. Uncovering the functional consequences of the newly discovered genetic variants and the mechanisms involved in the onset of PSC will require detailed functional experiments involving different functional read-outs, given the broad nature of the identified genes, and further verification of our findings in independent cohorts. Implications for clinical practice The lack of understanding of PSC pathogenesis hampers the development of effective therapies. Investigating the genetic basis of a disease can help reveal mechanisms of disease pathology and guide the selection of new targets for drug discovery. Each genetic risk locus can be seen as a potential drug target and the starting point of new treatment opportunities. This has successfully been demonstrated in the field of IBD, in which small-molecule inhibitors were used to recapitulate the anti-inflammatory function of CARD9 variants associated with protection from IBD.(49) Scientists now recognize that genes with evidence for causality in disease are more promising for identification of new drug targets, and this has led to an increased interest in disease-associated genes with variants that reduce gene function, such as nonsense, 189 8frameshift or essential splice-site variants.(50) With our study we have shown that combining a trio design with WES can reveal loss-of-function variants. Uncovering genetic variants that provide causal evidence will provide valuable insights into disease biology, but this will also, most importantly, help to design new targeted therapies. Conclusion We identified 13 rare protein-altering genetic variants in 10 out of 29 patient-parent trios, including variants in genes involved in immunological, epithelial barrier and bile salt pathways. The functional consequences of these variants and the associated susceptibility to PSC will require further verification, but we have shown the trio-design to be a successful method for discovering candidate disease-causing genes in rare diseases.

Evaluating potential drug targets through human loss-of- function genetic variation. bioRxiv preprint first posted online Jan 28, 2019; 8AddendumCHAPTER 9GENERAL DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES200 9The various studies in this thesis focused around one of three major themes, including; 1. Personalizing treatment-strategies What did we learn from recently published studies on calprotectin monitoring in patients on induction therapy? Can we predict what type of patients should be treated with anti-TNF agents early in the course of their disease? What is the \"Dutch experience\" with Methotrexate maintenance therapy in children with Crohn's disease? 2. Optimizing accuracy of fecal calprotectin measurements in disease monitoring Is the use of sent-in stool samples really the way to go? Should we advise all patients with IBD to analyze their own stool at home? 3. Profiling patients with childhood-onset sclerosing cholangitis What did we learn from comparing a cohort of patients with childhood-onset primary sclersoing cholangitis with a cohort with adult-onset primary sclerosing cholangitis? Can the identification of disease-causing rare genetic variants in patients with early-onset primary sclerosing cholangitis lead to patient- specific therapies? In the following chapter the main results are summarized, and clinical implications of the findings are discussed. Furthermore, a sketch of tomorrow's IBD care is drawn.201 9In chapter 2, we systematically searched the literature on the value of calprotectin monitoring in IBD patients on induction therapy. We identified four studies, including only adult patients, that qualified for inclusion in the meta-analysis. This limited number of suitable trials is indicative of the relatively new application of stool calprotectin to monitor disease activity. Based on the results of our meta-analysis we concluded that performing measurements at the start of induction therapy and at the end is useful to determine if the patient is responding adequately to the treatment or whether further treatment intensification is warranted. We suggest that, rather than merely a decline in stool calprotectin concentration, a pre-specified calprotectin target range needs to be reached which corresponds with disease in endoscopic remission, or mucosal healing, to be able to say that the treatment was truly successful. In chapter 3, we evaluated whether calprotectin-based disease monitoring is helpful in determining the response to treatment in paediatric practice. We prospectively followed a cohort of children with newly-onset IBD during their first year after diagnosis and tested whether time-to-reach target calprotectin predicted sustained remission. We observed that a larger proportion of children with ulcerative colitis (UC) compared to Crohn's disease (CD) reached the calprotectin target range, and at an earlier time point after starting induction therapy. The state of remission in UC patients lasted shorter than in CD patients. Reaching the target within 12 weeks predicted sustained remission in CD, but not in UC. This finding suggests that a quick response to conventional induction therapy, based on calprotectin values in the target range, allows to identify those with a favourable disease course. Patients who do not have a quick response may need accelerated step-up to anti-TNF agents. In chapter 4 we reported about the efficacy and tolerability of methotrexate (MTX) immunomodulation after thiopurine failure or intolerance. We showed that MTX is a good alternative for maintenance treatment in paediatric CD patients, especially for those who are thiopurine intolerant, before deciding to step up to anti-TNF therapy.PART I - PERSONALIZING TREATMENT-STRATEGIES202 9Clinical Implications Over the last decade, we have seen advances in biological therapies - new drugs intervening with inflammatory responses, such as vedolizumab and ustekinumab - and small molecule therapies (tofacitinib) that target specific steps in the inflammatory pathways.(1-4) However, none of these drugs can be considered as precision drugs that take into account individual variability in genes, environment and lifestyle for each person. Although current therapeutics aim at countering the immune response, they are rather unrefined and therefore impact adversely on the rest of the body and increase the risk for infections and malignancy.(5,6) Both researchers and clinicians therefore aim to expose only those patients that are really in need of these new drugs, balancing the risk of ongoing inflammation leading to irreversible bowel damage and the need of surgery versus the risk of adverse events. The initiative described in chapter 3, to identify at an early stage those patients that require an accelerated step-up to anti-TNF is, in fact, nothing more than treating bad diseases at diagnosis in a more aggressive manner. Many of the new drugs have shown to induce mucosal healing (MH), a state that describes the absence of both endoscopic and histologic inflammation, which has recently become the main treatment target in IBD. Reaching and maintaining MH is thought to stop disease progression in the long term. Increasingly researchers and clinicians put confidence in the motto \"the first blow is half the battle\" and promote the early institution of biologic therapy.(7-12) The short-term results of early intensive treatment are promising. Nevertheless, it is difficult to fully justify the start of such a new treatment strategy. Proper monitoring of the effects in a research setting is therefore crucial to keep moving forward. With the treat-to-target strategy, the response to treatment should be closely followed by using objective clinical and biological outcome measures. If there is a lack of response, initial treatment should be escalated. The CALM study published in 2017, investigated the effectiveness and safety of two treatment algorithms (clinical symptoms combined with biomarkers versus clinical symptoms alone) in achieving MH in CD patients.(13) This was the first treat-to-target trial in IBD, that also tested faecal calprotectin (FC) as a treatment target, with levels below 250 g/g considered to indicate a satisfactory therapeutic response to treatment and treatment escalation with anti-TNF therapy when FC was 250 g/g. The FC-based 203 9strategy appeared to result in better clinical and endoscopic outcomes than symptom-driven decisions alone. The CALM study also indicated that choosing an appropriate FC target level was a critical element of FC-based monitoring. Choosing a target which is too low (e.g. 100 \u00b5g/g), may lead to a smaller percentage of false negative cases and will prevent undertreatment. However, this might also cause physicians to switch the treatment faster and therefore use the available arsenal of therapeutics at an increased rate. There is no consensus about the optimal FC target range yet and the question remains whether it is appropriate to pursue one action threshold for all patients or if a patient should have a personal action threshold.(14-18) This is because the calprotectin-concentration is not only dependent on the extent and severity of the inflammation, but also on the contact time between stool and inflamed tissue. The location of the inflamed area in the gastrointestinal tract and the intestinal transit rate are therefore important factors which (co-)influence the calprotectin concentration. Since we are just at the start of the treat-to-target strategy, we do not yet know its long-term effects. Does this strategy really prevent disease progression and irreversible intestinal fibrosis? Do fewer patients need to undergo surgical interventions? During the 2019 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) congress in Copenhagen it was reported that the early CD patients, of the previously mentioned CALM study, who achieved endoscopic or deep remission after 1 year of intensive treatment were less likely to have disease progression over a median of 3 years.(19) These first long(er)-term results of the treat-to-target strategy are expected to be published this year. In 1971, thiopurine therapy was introduced as a useful treatment option for CD and the long-term effects were unknown as well.(20) For a long time the thiopurines have been used as the immunomodulators of choice for moderate to severe UC and CD. The increased use of anti-TNF agents in IBD led to a reappraisal of the role of immunomodulators in the treatment, since combination therapy of thiopurines and anti-TNF medication has been shown to be more effective and to reduce the risk of development of anti-drug antibodies.(20-22) However, some studies have reported an association between the use of thiopurines and an increased risk of developing lymphomas.(23) This is why, in paediatric practice, thiopurines are nowadays prescribed with 204 9reservation. This has also resulted in a renewed interest in the use of methotrexate (MTX) immunomodulation.(24-31) In chapter 4 we showed that it is worthwhile to consider MTX as a second- line immunomodulator, especially in those who are thiopurine intolerant, before stepping up to anti-TNF therapy. More studies are needed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of MTX in the treatment of CD patients to determine whether MTX might be used as primary immunomodulator instead of thiopurine. In IBD, there is only one study available discussing the use of MTX in combination with anti-TNF therapy, concluding that the combination of infliximab and methotrexate, although safe, was no more effective than infliximab alone in patients with CD receiving treatment with prednisone.(32) However, it is unclear whether the study had been confounded by the enrollment of patients with low disease activity and/or the concomitant use of corticosteroids in each treatment group. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there is more experience and published literature available about the efficacy and safety of MTX - anti- TNF combination therapy.(33-35) The authors of a recently published meta-analysis suggest that the combination of MTX and anti-TNF therapy better reduce disease activity and obtain remission than anti-TNF monotherapy.(36) With the increased use of anti-TNF treatment in IBD, it seems very justifiable to further explore the potential role of the MTX combination therapy, not only in CD patients, but also in UC patients. PART II - OPTIMIZING THE ACCURACY AND PRACTICALITY OF CALPROTECTIN MEASUREMENTS IN DISEASE MONITORING FC is increasingly used for monitoring response to treatment or early recognition of flares in patients with IBD. Many clinicians allow patients to send a stool sample to the laboratory by surface mail at ambient temperatures.(37,38) Since the stability of the calprotectin protein at room temperature has remained rather unclear, we performed a FC stability study (chapter 5). We observed that stool calprotectin at room temperature is rather unstable, with a steady decline in calprotectin concentration in the first 6 days after stool collection. In clinical practice this does not mean that all FC test results from sent-in stool samples underestimate the actual disease activity, but this discovery does 205 9warn us that when the FC result is in the uncertain range (250 - 500 \u00b5g/g) we should be more careful with our interpretation. Enabling patients to perform the FC test at home directly after defecation could overcome the issue of FC instability and may provide a more reliable manner of monitoring disease activity. In Chapter 6 we compared three of these FC home tests and evaluated by how much the test results differed from the established ELISA method. The three lateral flow-based home tests have shown acceptable agreement with the ELISA reference test results within the low range values ( 500 \u00b5g/g). However, further test improvements should focus on better agreement in the high range values. Furthermore, the home test procedures need to be simplified for patients before they are implemented on a larger scale. Clinical implications FC is a valuable laboratory test in all phases of IBD care; from allowing differentiation between irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory processes in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, to monitoring response to treatment and predict short-term relapse.(39-58) It can therefore be a great help for clinicians in diagnosing and monitoring IBD, and can be used as a guidance for treatment adaptation. FC is commonly used, because of the practicality of the stool test. It is non-invasive and the samples are relatively easy to obtain. Although data indicate that FC is currently the best marker available (chapter 1), it is certainly not the ideal marker. One of the reasons why FC is not ideal is that there is no linear relationship between the extent and severity of the disease and the level of FC. This is why we advise to use a two-threshold strategy when interpreting FC for monitoring disease activity (see figure 1). Based on previous literature, FC values above 500 \u00b5g/g best correspond with active disease and is therefore chosen as the upper threshold.(59-61) In the action range (red zone), adjusting the treatment is advised to attempt to get the patient back into remission again. Despite the fact there is no consensus on the upper limit of the FC target range for remission (green zone), we use a value of 250 \u00b5g/g since multiple studies have shown that FC values below 250 \u00b5g/g correspond well with disease in remission.(13,46,56,61-64)206 9The ideal biomarker should be easily accessible, non-invasive, low in costs and reflect the degree of tissue damage and repair. Table 1. provides an overview of possible other biomarkers that can be found in different biological specimens including, blood, faeces, urine and saliva. Other blood inflammatory markers that have been suggested, include the non-protein amino acid citrullin, which is synthesized by the enterocytes of the small intestine and the intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), which is an endogenous cytosolic enterocyte protein released by dying mature enterocytes and therefore a possible marker of enterocyte loss in the small intestine.(65-68) The downside of using blood markers is the required invasiveness to obtain the sample. Non-invasive biomarkers like FC are certainly less invasive, although sampling feces may not be considered convenient by patients. Different faecal markers have been evaluated, but only FC and lactoferrin are used in clinical practice. This is because most other faecal biomarkers that have been investigated, like calgranulin C and polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase (PMN-e), deal with the same advantages and disadvantages as faecal calprotectin, since they also are neutrophil-derived proteins. (69,70) While a faecal biomarker may seem to be the obvious choice in an intestinal disease, we should not overlook the usefulness of other non-invasive biomarkers. Perhaps the measurement of Figure 1. The two-threshold strategy with three calprotectin ranges. (i.e., <250 \u00b5g/g for target range, 250-500 \u00b5g/g for uncertain range, and >500 \u00b5g/g for active disease) 207 9urinary claudin-3, which is a protein that indicates tight junction breakdown that is an early event in the development of intestinal damage, can be used in IBD patients.(71)or the measurement of cytokines like IL-1 , TNF- in the saliva.(72,73) In the meantime, FC remains the best known and most studied biomarker of inflammation currently available in IBD.(37,62,74-76) Our present data indicate that stool calprotectin is not stable at room temperature (chapter 5 and 6). Although we only tested a limited amount of samples, our message got picked up incredibly fast, expressing the urgent need for more literature on this topic. Within half a year not only the FC handling instruction in our own hospital has been adapted, but the issue is now also being addressed in the national paediatric IBD treatment guidelines. (77) This finding could be seen as a setback for the previously cherished practicallity of the FC test, however manufacturers have now realized that there is considerable profit in further improving the lateral flow-based technique to measure calprotectin with a smartphone at home.(78-81) The home tests have now been investigated under ideal circumstances in the hospital laboratory as well as by the patients themselfes at home, but only in a research setting, not as part of regular care. The next step will involve incorporating the FC home test in routine clinical practice, to determine whether patients who use this telemonitoring possiblity fare better than those who do not. Furthermore, future studies will focus on connecting each FC home test result, in a series of repeated FC measurements during follow-up, immediately to an automatically generated treatment advise. This advise is based on the possible rise of calprotectin out of the target range in the early stage of an upcoming relapse what could allow the assess of early intervention. The future will tell us whether preemptive treatment optimization is a feasible strategy, resulting in a decrease of the number of relapses and prevention of progressive bowel damage in the long-term, both in adults as well as in children.208 9Potential biomarkers What it measures Blood Citrullin binding protein (I-FABP) TNF- of enterocyte mass Enterocyte loss in the small intestine Protein that indicates intestinal tight junction loss Salivary concentrations of cytokines, including; interleukin 1 (IL-1 ), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor factor (TNF-), transforming growth factor- 1 (TGF- 1), nitric oxide (NO). Protein released by activated or damaged granulocytes Protein released by activated or damaged granulocytes Protein released by activated or damaged granulocytes Protein released by activated or damaged granulocytes Enzymes which recruit granulocytes and other inflammatory cells into inflamed tissues Protein released by activated or damaged granulocytes Protein released by activated or damaged granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells Metabolite released by activated T lymphocytes and macrophagesTable 1. Possible other biomarkers of intestinal inflammation 209 9PSC is a relatively rare (8-10%), but serious complication of IBD. It is suggested that childhood-onset PSC presents with milder disease and has a more favourable outcome compared to adult- onset PSC. To compare outcomes between paediatric- and adult onset PSC we evaluated time-to-complication curves in two independent Dutch PSC cohorts (chapter 7). We found that a quarter of the childhood-onset PSC patients developed biliary and portal hypertensive complications or progressed to liver transplantation in the first five years postdiagnosis. Furthermore, we showed that paediatric- and adult-onset PSC run a similar progressive disease course with no differences seen between both cohorts with regard to frequencies of liver transplantations or the mean disease duration until liver transplantation. Our findings suggest that both the paediatricians as well as the adult-oriented specialists need to be aware of serious complications that might accompany childhood-onset PSC possibly already early during the course of disease. In analogy with recently published family-based studies on monogenic forms of other complex (auto-)immune diseases (98-100), we hypothesized that in a fraction of patients with early- onset PSC, the disease is caused by rare genetic variants as well. In chapter 8 we therefore performed a family-based study, in which we examined the DNA of patients with early-onset PSC and their biological parents. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of all protein-coding genes results in many variants of uncertain clinical significance. A trio-analysis design, i.e. the inclusion of patients and parents in the analysis of rare genetic variants, helped to immediately ascertain whether a variant is inherited or has arisen de novo, i.e. as a new mutation in the child during foetal development. This appeared to be a successful approach that revealed multiple candidate disease-causing variants with possibly large effects on protein function in several genes. Our findings suggest that PSC can also present in a rare, monogenic or oligogenic fashion, but this suggestion would be supported if functional experiments provide mechanistic insights in how this could possibly increase the risk of PSC. PART III - PROFILING PATIENTS WITH CHILDHOOD-ONSET PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS210 9Clinical Implications For years there have hardly been any studies focusing on the paediatric PSC populations. Accordingly, paediatricians had almost completely to relie on information available from adult PSC registries.(101-105) Recently the topic has gained interest, and new studies of paediatric PSC cohorts are being published.(106-110) However, most of the currently available studies are retrospective, single-centre designs and the rarity of the disease hampers the studies on providing information about clinical course and prognosis. Different perspectives exist concerning childhood- onset PSC and the long-term consequences. It has been assumed that children with PSC generally have an earlier stage of the same disease as adult PSC patients, tend to present with milder disease, and finally, have more favourable outcomes.(107,108) However, there are also doubts about these assumptions since there are remarkable differences between adult-onset and childhood-onset disease, including higher incidence of the autoimmune-overlap syndrome and higher incidence of concomitant IBD in the latter. (111,112) These differences may indicate that childhood-onset PSC is not merely an early stage of the same disease, but might rather involve a (partially) different immune-mediating pathophysiology. (113) Based on the findings shown in chapter 7, we argue that childhood-onset PSC follows at least the same progressive disease course as adult-onset disease. We can not even exclude that nearly all childhood-onset patients will need a liver transplantation at some point during their lives, although current registries do not have a sufficiently long time follow up to test this hypothesis. The prognostic factors we identified now in combination with those identified in previous studies, can be used to target and select those patients with a high risk of early hepatic deterioration. Eventhough the therapeutic options to modify the disease course are presently very limited, prognostic factors can be used for early recognition and prevention of complications, selecting patients for clinical trials, and promote timely listing for liver transplantation. The aetiology of PSC will hopefully become more clear in the upcoming years. Important developments will occur in the field of genetics and immunology. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of disease susceptibility genes, showing a strong overlap with the genetic architecture of IBD and other autoimmune diseases in general.(114-121) The 211 9expectations were high that these risk genes would quickly lead to new drug targets for PSC, but so far this is not the case. How to convert the increasing list of genetic risk loci into tailored management for the individual patient, remains unclear.(122) Furthermore the contribution of these already identified risk genes to overall PSC burden is only about 5%.(120,123) Actual cure requires insight into causation of the disease. In chapter 8 we have shown a method to identify candidate disease causing genes in early-onset PSC patients and concluded that there may be monogenic or oligogenic forms of PSC as well. The family-based strategy permitted efficient discovery of de novo mutations and compound heterozygous genotypes in our cohort. Furthermore, we used multiple pathogenicity tools to predict if our variants are deleterious based on whether the site of the variant displays evolutionary conservation (124), or is predicted to be damaging according to known gene function. We do recognize that this is not sufficient to implicate a variant as playing a causal role in disease, since even healthy individuals carry many rare protein-disrupting variants.(125,126) Assessment of evidence for variant implication in a certain disease is challenging and requires a step-wise approach (see Tabel 2), as suggested by a working group of experts in genomic research, analysis and clinical diagnostic sequencing convened by the US National Human Genome Research Institute.(126) For our WHELP- study, the next step will involve experimental validation of our findings to determine a poptential pathophysiologoical impact of one or more of our candidate variants. If we can demonstrate that a gene product is functionally disrupted by one (or more) of the present candidate mutations, this discovery may serve as an important clue that could lead to understanding of the individual underlying pathogenic mechanism. Although monogenic or oligogenic variants may only explain disease-onset in a small proportion of the total PSC population, understanding how the loss of the involved protein functions results in the monogenic PSC-like phenotype can also be very informative for complex PSC. Uncovering genetic variants that provide causal evidence will provide valuable insights in terms of both biological understanding, but most important, it might help to take our main goal, to design new targeted therapies and personalize the medicine, to the next level.212 9Genetic evidence 1. Determine and report the formal statistical evidence for segregation or association of each variant, and its frequency in large control populations matched as closely as possible to patients in terms of ancestry. Informative evidence 2. Predict variant deleteriousness based on evolutionary conservation; the site of the variant displays evolutionary conservation consistent with deleterious effects of sequence changes at that location, and/or; Predict that a variant is damaging in terms of biological function; the variant is found at the location within the protein predicted to cause functional disruption (for example, enzyme active site, protein-binding region). Experimental evidence 3. Validate experimentally the predicted damaging impact of candidate variants using assays of patient-derived tissue or well- established cell or animal models of gene function. 4. Avoid assuming that implicated variants are fully penetrant, or completely explanatory in any specific disease case.Table 2. Assessment of evidence for candidate pathogenic variants (after MacArthur DG et al. Nature 2014 (126))213 9CONCLUSION In this thesis we aimed to contribute to the further development of personalized medicine in paediatric IBD. Most of the studies that have been published so far, including our present work, use prognostic factors to identify subgroups of patients and are not tailored to the individual patient. Personalized medicine in the way we conducted it now may therefore better be called 'stratified medicine'. Our results of the WHELP-study might give a glimpse of what we can expect in the near future. Knowledge of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms in each individual patient at diagnosis may allow early adaptation of therapeutic pathways with the aim to enhance treatment efficacy while minimizing or even avoiding drug-toxicity complications.
