Dr Kathleen Janel, ND Dr Rebecca Lang, ND Established in 2005. My introduction to Natural Medicine occurred when preparing for conventional medical school. At this time I was having severe abdominal pain that seemed to have few conventional treatment options. With dietary changes and supplements I was able to have permanent relief from these symptoms. I was so impressed by this that I applied to Naturopathic Medical School at Bastyr University in 1994. Following graduation, I served as a resident and then associate doctor in a family/obstetrics/pediatric clinic in New England for 6 years with Dr. Mary Bove ND. In 2005 I moved to Mukilteo to practice Family Medicine with specialties in Digestive Medicine, Pain Management and Skin Care. My passion is to bridge the gap between natural and conventional medicine so that you may have optimal health.", "sitename": "Yelp", "date": "2015-04-18", "cleaned_text": "Specialty Natural Medicine [(11 reviews)](#reviews) [Naturopathic/Holistic](/search?find_desc=Naturopathic%2FHolistic&find_loc=Mukilteo%2C+WA), [Acupuncture](/search?find_desc=Acupuncture&find_loc=Mukilteo%2C+WA) Photos & videos Services Offered Virtual Consultations You Might Also Consider [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=NhjSpWy4Q89-uGXV2HHA0A&campaign_id=JJhQvW9yw68eKgHRyHtWEQ&click_origin=read_more&placement=above_biz_review&placement_slot=0&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Froosevelt-chiropractic-seattle-2%3Fhrid%3DaY_VHsFl3SXZ5yHbrqlt-A&request_id=59ed565ed56e4516&signature=297fc0f1122d90c85baaa73f2438ba6e6fbbba6fd26727cb208e3e90a1050361&slot=0) in Chiropractors [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=v-ODExPPKQ_MADGXQQBHIQ&campaign_id=y_w_rBLvmefgwkR5FFB1_g&click_origin=read_more&placement=above_biz_review&placement_slot=0&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fnewport-academy-kirkland-2%3Fhrid%3D94ZikU85PPr9k9Zma4iiAA&request_id=59ed565ed56e4516&signature=0bf588acd7cbbc9553eb60d2dfaa010cd83fda69bcc4aa2cde713a5ce5b0cb49&slot=1) in Rehabilitation Center, Addiction Medicine, Counseling & Mental Health [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=8tqnXVspEhcl120S8Y5JtQ&campaign_id=oLJLw9_OF2lnUNWJW-gdzw&click_origin=read_more&placement=above_biz_review&placement_slot=0&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fcommunity-health-acupuncture-and-wellness-center-lynnwood%3Fhrid%3DxXPQ8XS1dLYdRPRZ9sctNQ&request_id=59ed565ed56e4516&signature=3762a621f01c94ef387c7c02f5256f9eeaefbe087962d7bacf3da5cd8b8c5bb8&slot=2) in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture, Nutritionists About the Business Business owner information Kathleen J.

Recommended Reviews [Learn more about reviews.](https://www.yelp.com/reviews-trust-link-tree?l=en_US) Overall rating 5 stars 4 stars 3 stars 2 stars 1 star - Apr 18, 2015 I stumbled upon this place because it is the only naturopath that my toddler's insurance covers that is close to home. We were nervous about the first visit since I couldn't find many reviews about the place. But we were happily surprised: we absolutely love it. The naturopath doesn't hate western medicine, but encourages the alternative: diet changes (in our case for asthma, eczema and allergies) and homeopathic remedies. We are overly joyous with our experiences here and would recommend it to anyone in the area (or even out of the area- trust me it's worth it even if it's a long drive from home!) Thank you Dr Kathleen Janel! Oh and the receptionist and other workers there are lovely :) We love them! - Mar 21, 2018 I was excited to visit Dr. Lang based on a referral. I received new insurance and was asked to get a new patient physical. I made a general appointment and took in the paperwork my insurance company sent me to be completed. During our appointment, allergies came up in conversation and I ended up getting a blood test. When I left I made my next appointment for a preventative pap smear when I left. I was happy with both visits ... until I received my EOB from my health insurance company. It stated I was responsible for over $500 for both visits and I was shocked! Although both visits were preventative because we discussed my allergies, it negated my insurance coverage. At no time did anyone say anything to me! After many rounds with Michael in the finance department (who was rude and combative) they finally agreed to re-code the second visit as preventative. Even my insurance company called and tried to advocate for me and they refused to re-code my first visit. I feel I was taken advantage of and when I tried to speak directly to the Dr. I was denied. I refuse to patronize an office that is not going to advocate for me or a Dr. that I cannot communicate openly with. I will NEVER go back! * Update after yet another rude response posted below. At no time was I ever trying to be fraudulent - that's not even in my nature. I am a very honest person, which is why I don't appreciate being taken advantage of and being treated like a criminal. To reiterate I booked the appointment for a physical and brought in the paperwork from my insurance company that you guys saw, completed and submitted. I still have no clue of what lingo I needed to use or not used because it was never a conversation ... how would I know?? You guys can clearly afford to lose clients because your customer service is severely lacking. You don't have to worry I will absolutely be seeking care elsewhere. Business owner information Kathleen J. Mar 21, 2018 We will not be a party to insurance fraud so a patient can try and avoid paying their deductible. We bill accurately based on the visit and diagnosis made during the visit. If a patient requests a preventive visit when they make their appointment, or if they specify it in their intake forms then we will honor that request including providing guidance in that direction during the office visit. Likewise, it a patient discusses an acute concern during the phone call when they book their visit, in their intake documents and in the office visit with their physician without ever requesting it be a preventive visit, then we bill an E&M office visit. If a patient does not request a preventive visit or otherwise state they wish to avoid deductible visit costs, and discusses and receives treatment or consultation for acute concerns then we are legally and ethically obligated to bill an E&M office visit. We will not provide false or fraudulent information to insurance due to patient ignorance regarding the benefits of their health plan. When there is a billing issue or complaint, we do extensive research to determine the options for the patient. This includes working with insurance to determine options for payment. In many cases, this means hours of coordination to explore all possible options for the ethical and legal resolution of cases in support of our patients. If a patient requests changes for how an appointment was billed, our physicians directly review the chart notes and billing codes and changes can be made as legally and ethically appropriate. We will not, however, violate any laws or our own strong personal ethics when a patient is attempting to coerce us into breaking the law to avoid paying fees required by their insurance company. We are proud to be a female owned business that works in an ethical manner and treats our patients with respect and honesty, all while providing an exception level of medical care with no double booking or overbooking. We recommend patients who expect us to provide false information and commit fraud on their behalf to seek care elsewhere. EDIT: A patient asking us to provide false information to insurance is indeed a request to commit fraud. When someone has insurance rules and regulations explained in detail. And our clinic discusses the situation with insurance on their behalf and asks for an exception and is denied by insurance. And the insurance company representative confirms that billing a preventive billing code for an E&M service is inappropriate and a violation of contracted agreements. And the insurance company representative reaches out to the patient to explain that the clinic is following their legal and contractual obligations. If the patient still demands that the billing be done against insurance rules and regulations with unambiguous information from insurance and the clinic, they are indeed requesting a Doctor and clinic to commit fraud on their behalf. Particularly when valid fees are waived in good faith, despite the clinic providing excellent medical care and detailed accurate advice on the rules and regulations of insurance billing. We are happy that our large, excellent patient base behaves in an ethical, honest and responsible manner. We welcome additional patients who share our vision of truly partnering with their Doctor with 30-60 minute appointment times with no overbooking or double-booking. We always work on behalf of our patients, as long as we are not requested to break ethical or legal boundaries. - Jul 18, 2019 I made an account to write this review. Dr. Janel and the team are top-notch and a huge reason I moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to the Seattle area. I had discovered Specialty Natural Medicine after my naturopathic doctor in San Francisco recommended I try low-dose allergen (LDA) therapy for my chronic GI issues. I was already paying roughly $500 out of pocket per visit with that doctor and the one clinic in the San Francisco Bay Area (San Francisco Preventive Medicine Clinic) who does LDA was upwards of that in total cost, as neither of the clinics participated with insurance. After making a phone call and speaking with Ana, not only had I found a naturopathic doctor which does LDA but amazingly enough was also a primary care provider and was able to participate with major insurance plans. I called my insurance company (UMR) to confirm in-network status and confirmed my primary care benefits and that Dr. Janel would be processed under my specialist benefit because of her added expertise. I knew that this would literally save me thousands, if not tens of thousands of dollars and was very hopeful this would me my long term care solution for chronic health needs. I flew from San Francisco to Seattle in April for my first appointment and hung out with Michael before my appointment, who to my understanding works behind the scenes on insurance-contracts and the awesome technology capabilities of the practice (i.e. video visits, care coordination portal, great website, etc.). It was easy to converse with the medical staff before Dr. Janel came to the room. She has a warm and calm demeanor and leads the practice on their expert listening skills; this practice far and away has the best bed-side manner and communication skills than anything I've seen in my years as a \"professional patient\". Usually, when I talk about my stomach condition and my fungal-infection theory I'm able to get one or two things by a provider, but Dr. Janel was up to-date on all the current research. Her recommendations made sense and used the minimal amount of supplements and dietary changes. I like that the goal is to be able to tolerate normal food and to do normal things; I have been with providers that expected full auto-immune paleo diets for life and I didn't realize until years later how miserable I was even though I was doing all the \"right\" things. The testing she's ordered has been far more affordable than many other clinics I've been to. She's confident in my healing and because of that I'm confident. In the past few months, I've moved permanently to Seattle and we've uncovered food allergies that were irritating my gut, begun LDA therapy to make me less sensitive to allergies, and used a hormone pellet which has helped with my muscle pain. I love the cutting-edge procedures that the practice is able to do and their recognition of the \"gap\" between natural and conventional medicine. I'm really look forward to continuing my care right now while I'm feeling sick and also in the future for maintenance. I feel like I've found the doctor I was looking for after several years of illness. As someone who works in healthcare and also experiences chronic illness, with any new doctor, it's extremely important to understand your primary care and specialist benefits such as deductibles you may need to meet before a benefit is obtained. It's also important to confirm in-network status with your insurance company before seeing any new provider. Always get a confirmation number for the call, reps first name and last initial and the time and date of the call. It's well worth the process because it is so rare to find a naturopathic doctor who accepts insurance, at least coming from California. I wish I had discovered this option years ago but happy to be able to share what I wish I had known then. I feel like I'll be able to live what I'd consider to be a normal life thanks to Dr. Janel and the team! - Oct 22, 2015 Caring, knowledgeable staff, & beautiful clinic! Dr Janel is very perceptive & after a thorough examination, was able to diagnose my issues & had very helpful alternative treatment recommendations. I am so thankful for relief from my symptoms! Kaela at the front desk was both friendly & accommodating, answering any questions I had readily & intelligently. They were very up-front about billing and cost, so I was able to feel confident about how much the care would be. Must also mention that the office is beautiful! Very relaxing environment. Definitely feel like I am in good hands at Specialty Natural Medicine. Thank you for your wonderful care and expertise! - Mar 6, 2017 The staff here are great, very welcoming. I see Dr. Lang who really takes the time to listen to what I am saying. I feel like a patient, not a number. Very clean as well. Tonya C. - Feb 3, 2017 I so value the LDA treatments and other advice I receive from Dr. Janel, I drive from California every two months to see her. In between personal visits, I get phone consults. She is so much better than the ND I saw for years in Santa Barbara who charges about twice as much! I recommend Dr. Janel and her staff highly ... Only wish she was closer to where I live :-). - Sep 23, 2013 I had been getting allergy shots (immunotherapy) from another Naturopath who, unfortunately, passed away. I was a little panicked because finding another doctor to continue the treatment she'd started was proving very difficult and I thought that I was going to completely lose any benefit from the twice a week shots I'd been getting for nearly a year. I finally came across Specialty Natural Medicine and Dr Kathleen Janel's information online while searching for more doctors who do allergy desensitization. They are surprisingly few and far between (I have/had pretty bad allergies to grasses/trees/weeds and would be all but knocked out & completely zapped of energy for about two to three months every year, at the start of Spring. I am also allergic to dust mites & cats.) I am THRILLED to have found Specialty Natural Medicine and Dr Kathleen Janel. She does not do the old form of allergy shots that I was getting (TWICE A WEEK, for over a year... not fun). She uses a new method that I won't try to explain because I forget the specifics - but it comes down to getting a shot (a bundled shot of all the inhalants - dust, pollen, cats, etc) and then a couple of boosters around the start of allergy season or when needed. That's a far cry from the twice a week shots I was getting - totally manageable and convenient. AND permanent. I have not gone through Spring allergy season since getting my first shot with her yet (I got it around Summer) - but I've noticed a HUGE difference, so far, in my reactions to dust. My throat gets a little itchy, but I'm not wiped out and a sneezing mess. Also, we just got a cat - I've gotten another shot as a booster, because I'm still having a slight reaction to the cat and the dust that he's collecting on his tail, but it's NOTHING like the allergic reactions I've had my entire life. I'm still in awe of the fact that soon, I will be having no reaction at all and will be free of these allergies. Previously, if I were to be in a house with a cat (a cat covered in DUST from crawling through every nook and cranny of the house), holding the cat and letting it sit in my lap, my eyes would be nearly swollen shut, I'd sneeze so much I could barely catch my breathe, and I'd be stuck laying in bed because I'd be so thoroughly exhausted. Now, all I have is a headache, feel a little sluggish, and have sneezed a few times. I don't feel great, but it's completely manageable thus far. (And if I remember correctly, she is one of only a handful of doctors, in this country, who do this type of allergy desensitization. Always look for the Bastyr graduates!!) I first saw Dr Janel for the first shot, then a follow up appointment to see how I reacted to that shot. She left a great first impression on me - she came off as extremely knowledgeable and up to date on all the latest health news, her office is very modern. I've pretty much decided that, even though she's further away (in Mukilteo), I plan on using her as my primary doctor and going to her for everything. - May 1, 2015 I had a very upsetting experience here. I am so thankful that I am no longer a patient there after this experience. I followed a ND who had been working there to her new practice in January 2015. Then 4 months later I get a phone call from a collections agency saying I owed several hundred dollars to Specialty Natural Medicine. I had only received one statement from SNM, and no follow up letter or phone calls were ever made to me. Half of the $400 collections amount was from an office visit that NEVER was sent to my insurance company! Again, no phone calls or any courtesy letters. Just sent to collections for an office visit that the Director of Operations, Michael told me my insurance had \"denied\". When I contacted my insurance, the representative I was working with told me that they had never received a claim for that visit. She was a great advocate and called Michael to ask what they deal was. He then sent me an email and unapologetically stated that their third party biller must have missed it. REALLY?!? If a patient that you know has insurance has a claim that you believe has been denied, you decide to just send it to collections with no phone call?!?! Heaven forbid you put a little energy into investigating why the claim was denied....but it wasn't denied, it was just never submitted! Long story short, most smaller Naturopathic Clinics don't have any sort of Director of Operations, let alone that plus a receptionist in top of the providers AND a third party biller. So to be treated the way I was from him, plus for the $200 to still be in collections without any forgiveness from him since their biller CLEARLY AND ADMITTEDLY did not communicate with me about ANY outstanding balance, I feel very mistreated. I am a responsible person with a long history of making payment plans with medical providers if I cannot pay my balance in full- so to be sent to collections for negligence on their part was an awful experience. I cannot speak for the current physicians there as I followed mine when she left that clinic- but their administration and billing operations seem very unprofessional and opportunistic. PS- last week there was another negative review from a former employee with statements alleging unprofessionalism and greedy practices- and interestingly it has been taken down. Hmmm. Business owner information Kathleen J. Aug 28, 2015 Good day Jordan, Apologies for any issues you had with the clinic. As you stated in your correspondence dated April 20, 2015 you had been aware of a balance due for several months. Statements were mailed to the address we have on file for you on September 30th 2014, October 24th 2014, November 26, 2014, January 20th 2015, February 20th 2015 and March 17th 2015. The statement on March 17th 2015 included the text - \"We have not heard from you regarding your balance. The balance is currently overdue. We have attempted several times to resolve the problem of your past due account. Since our repeated attempts to collect the balance due on your account have been ignored your account will be moved to an outside collection agency. In order to prevent your account from further action, please make payment within 15 days from the date of this letter. If your payment is already on its way, we thank you and ask that you please disregard this notice. If not, we would appreciate receipt of your payment as soon as possible.\" We did assign your account to Collections after that time. It did include a claim that was denied by the Primary Insurance listed on your intake documents. Our biller did make a mistake in not properly submitting to your secondary insurance. As soon as we were made aware of the error, we promptly rectified the problem and submitted the claim to Regence and removed that part of the balance from your collections balance. We have updated our procedures to include at least two courtesy calls before any collection proceedings. We like to work with patients to resolve any billing issues in a courteous manner. We do believe it is reasonable for patients who are aware that they have a long outstanding balance to contact us to make payment arrangements and/or let us know if they believe there is an error in billing. We have successfully set up payment plans with many patients as long as they communicate with us. Indeed, we have never sent a patient to collections if they contact us to inform is that they need time or flexibility to meet their obligations. As we stated in our email to you on April 20, 2015, \"As you noted, it is not in the best interest of the business or patients to have patients end up in Collections. Our billers generally do a very good job in contacting patients and resolving any issues. My apologies that you did not have a better experience.\" Again, our apologies for the errors on our end. We strive to provide the highest level of service and we have made process improvements to keep the billing errors you saw from occurring again in the future. Kindest Regards. - Oct 14, 2011First to Review We had a terrible experience with Dr. Janel, who not only made my daughter sick with an herbal supplment not recommended for kids, she denied its effect initially. Then, she admitted that the reaction was rare. When my daughter's symptoms got worse, Dr. Janel told her receptionist to tell me to take my daughter to the E.R. She didn't even have the nerve to call me herself. Furthermore, her social and communication skills are terrible! - Jul 22, 2013 My son was constantly sick nothing he ate seemed to stay down, I was at my wits end with his pediatrician telling me to give him more prune juice..... my boy should have been purple from all the prune juice. After visiting Dr.Janel she tested my boy for food sensitivity and within two weeks of changing his diet he was already better.
