Because federal funding levels are almost exhausted, new applications from people hoping to benefit from the sub\u00ad sidies will not be accepted after September 30. Moreover, the entire program will expire on December 31, leaving thousands of people in California without a means to pay for the life-prolonging drug. The cost of using AZT, which is manufactured by the pharmaceutical giant Burroughs-Wellcome, can be as high as $9,000-10,000 a year. It is the only treatment for AIDSthat has been sanctioned and has had some beneficial effects in mitigating the impact of the AIDS virus. People who meet the stringent eligibility guidelines established by MediCal have the cost of AZT paid for by the state. But with in\u00ad surance companies clamping down on reimbursements for AZT and with countless thousands more uninsured, the federal subsidy program was the payer of last resort.

The \" victory,\" however, was more a mixed bag for lesbian and gay hospital employees, some of whom have ARC and AIDS. The workers won t-term paid sick leave and their demand that the hospitals pay for all employee health care. They lost demands for a nondiscrimination clause for the physically disabled and an ex\u00ad tension of bereavement leave to those with domestic partners. The new con\u00ad tract makes it more difficult for employees to fight against discrimina\u00ad tion by management. Local 250 had 1,700 of its members on strike against seven of the major hospitals that are united under the Af\u00ad filiated label. They voted (93%) to return to work, but will not do so until the 2,000 striking members of the California Nurses Association (CNA) also sign a contract. The hospitals af\u00ad fected are Children's, Marshall Hale, Mount Zion, St. Francis, Pacific Presbyterian and St. Mary's in San Francisco and Seton Medical Center in Daly City. John Mehring, gay activist and Local 250 negotiator, said, \" We can go back with our self-respect and dignity intact. We had a major win that is significant. I feel good about what we got in the sick leave provisions. It is a victory for gay men who work in the hospitals. Ade\u00ad quate sick leave was the most important issue and the most difficult to achieve. There are those of us who needs days to renew our strength. We need thattime.\" Mehring praised Mayor Art Agnos, who was active in the final days, \" for playing a major role in the settle\u00ad ment.\" _ _There were 120 issues at the start of the long negotiating process, which were narrowed to 30 as the mayor entered the controversy. The major gay and AIDS-related issues were sick leave, discrimination and bereavement pay. Sick Leave. Mehring believes the big victory is that employees will continue to get immediate paid days off when they are ill without having to be sick for five days before getting sick leave pay. A plan had been implemented by the hospitals in May that combined vaca\u00ad tion, holiday and sick pay, but required workers to draw from their holiday and vacation pay if an employee needed less than five days off for b ^ g sick. Sick leave began only after an employee was off five days. The hospitals agreed to drop this plan. TTie hospitals dropped their attempt to limit the use of employee ac\u00ad cumulated sick leave time. The hospitals also lost their plan to require that employees partially pay for their health care plans with an unlimited escalating cost. \" In some ways,\" Mehring said, \" this may be as impor\u00ad tant as our sick leave.\" Bereavement Leave. The union de\u00ad mand was that the three days bereave\u00ad ment leave now given to the employees whose relatives die be extended to in-clude domestic partners. This never reached the mayor's desk as it was taken off the table earlier. \"The real issue for management,\" union trustee Mark Splain stressed, \" was not bereavement leave for domestic partners. It was viewed as a major economic issue, because it could lead to expanded health care for domestic partners. Management could not agree to that.\" Mehring said the at\u00ad tempt to get health benefits for domestic partners failed in 1982 so he had hoped that the union could \"open the door\" this time with paid bereavement leave. D iscrim ination. When Agnos entered the labor/management discus\u00ad sions, the nondiscrimination clause for the physically disabled was still on the table. After several days of talk, how- ever, the matters considered crucial re\u00ad mained. The demand was dropped. Deputy Mayor Claude Everhart was in the final negotiations in the mayor's office. He told theSentinel, \" This was not a big issue. It was discussed, but there were many issues on the table and we had to get it down to the main ones.\" The hospitals added \" sexual orienta\u00ad tion\" to their nondiscrimination cate\u00ad gories in 1982, but in the new contract, employees must now use either the union grievance procedure or a govern\u00ad ment agency if they charge discrimina\u00ad tion. Previously, employees could use either or both processes at the same time. Mehring said he has never heard of a case being filed by an employee charg\u00ad ing discrimination based on sexual orientation. Mark Splain stressed, \" We have many issues before us, and we had to fight against what the hospitals had put in place when they claimed we were at an impasse four months ago. We had 1,700 people on strike with their jobs in jeopardy. We are already four months into the two-year contract, and we will be soon starting negotiations again for the next contract. All of these issues that we lost on will be on the table again.\" Hope Springs Eternal The Gay GOP Puts Its Faith in Bush by Lou Chibbaro Jr. NEW ORLEANS \u2014 About 75 gay Republicans, most expressing a desire not to be identified publicly, turned out for a reception Monday at a New Orleans gay bar to show their support for Vice-President George Bush. The reception was sponsored by United Republicans for Equality and Privacy (UREP), a group that repre\u00ad sents 1 1 gay Republican clubs around the country. One UREP board member from White Plains, New York, who iden\u00ad tified himself with the pseudonym Barry Adams, said UREP officials believe Republican presidential nominee George Bush will support gay civil rights and will strengthen the nation's fight against AIDS. Another UREP board member, who asked not to be identified, predictedlicans in New Orleans this week when he said gays will have to take Bush's sup\u00ad port for the gay community as an \" act of faith.\" The Texas board member urged those attending the reception to remain active in the Republican Party, even though some Republicans on the ex\u00ad treme right continue to attack the com\u00ad munity as enemies of the party. \" The vice-president has to be cautious on issues important to us,\" the Texas board member said, \" because he needs the far right to win.\" He said that once Bush is in office, \" he knows what needs to be done on our issues, and I'm convinced he'll do it.\" Ironically, New Jersey Republican governor Tom Kean, in his keynote ad\u00ad dress to the Republican Convention Tuesday night, criticized the campaign of Democratic Party nominee Michael Dukakis of doing much the same thing. Kean said the Dukakis campaign in\u00ad structed gays and others to \" shut up\" during the campaign \" so we can win.\" Then, Kean said, the Dukakis camp promised gays, \" you will get everything you want.\" ''The vice-president has to be cautious on issues important to us because he needs the fa r right to win. \" \u2014 UREP board member flatly that Bush would champion policies for civil rights, including gay rights, in the same manner another Republican president, Richard Nixon, championed foreign policy initiatives that opened the door to the People's Republic of China.

They both have to go hand in hand.\" Myers said he is convinced Bush will handle foreign policy better than Dukakis. \" We gay Republicans tend to be entrepreneurs and homeowners,\" said openly gay attorney John Rawls, who operates a private law practice in New Orleans. Rawls said he knows of many gay Republicans in heavily Democratic New Orleans, but he said almost none of the city's gay activists are Repub\u00ad licans. Robert Thompson, a member of the board of the World Congress of Les\u00ad bian and Gay Jewish Organizations and lifelong New Orleans resident, said he knows a number of gays who work at various levels within the Republican Party. While these gays are not \" public\" about their sexual orienta\u00ad tion, Thompson said, they are known to their superiors and accepted as equals by the party. Thompson added that he does not consider Bush to be \" another Jesse Helms or another typical right-winger. \"I predict he will be very supportive All of those attending Monday's reception and who identified themselves as Republicans were men, and many wore credentials issued by the Repub\u00ad lican Party for persons attending the convention in one capacity or another. Jeff Myers, a law student from Los Angeles, said he was concerned that Bush had not been more forceful in sup\u00ad porting gay rights and AIDS issues butof our issues,\" said Thompson. Adams said he did not think the fact that no openly gay Republican dele\u00ad gates or alternates attended the conven\u00ad tion this year will hinder UREP from organizing gay Republicans. In con\u00ad trast, there were three openly gay alter\u00ad nates to the 1984 Republican Nationalas the \" closet\" problem hurt UREP's predecessor. Concerned Americans for Individual Rights (CAIR), which folded two years ago. As a former councilman in a town in New York, Adams said he was using a pseudonym because he is not ready to declare his homosexuality publicly. \"Yes, AIDS is an important issue. The Soviet Union is an even more im portant issue. They both have to go hand in hand. \" \u2014 Jeff Myers Convention. According to Adams, new gay Re\u00ad publican groups are forming in Tampa, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; and Madison, Wisconsin. Representatives of existing groups who hold posts on the UREP board are from Laguna Beach, San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco in Califor\u00ad nia; and in Chicago; New York City; Washington. DC; Denver; Seattle; and Dallas. Adams conceded that the unwilling\u00ad ness of most gay Republicans to come out of the closet could hurt UREP, justalthough he plans to do so in the near future. The Human Rights Campaign Fund, the gay political action committee and lobbying group, had scheduled a private reception for Republican members of Congress, but HRCF can\u00ad celed the reception because none of the Republican members who are co\u00ad sponsors of the congressional gay rights bill could attend the event because of scheduling. \u00a9 1988 The Washington Blade.

Similar demonatnitions greeted Democratic delegates last month in Atlanta. It's a Gay Old Protest When ACT UP Meets the GOP by Lou Chibbaro Jr. NEW ORLEANS \u2014 A contingent of about 40 members of the New York group, AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), dominated the protest scene at the Republican National Convention in New Orleans this week, where they seemed to startle and anger Republican delegates at every turn. The group's most dramatic showing occurred during a rally Tuesday where thousands of cheering supporters of Vice-President George Bush turned out to greet the candidate as he arrived in the city on a giant paddle-wheeled boat along the Mississippi River. As Bush began addressing the crowd from a stage set up on a pier, the ACT UP members raised large \" AIDS- GATE\" signs bearing ghoulish-looking drawings of President Reagan. The drawings, which depicted Reagan with green skin and glaring red eyes, angered many of the spectators, prompting NewOrleans police officers to surround the ACT UP members for their own protec\u00ad tion. Police escorted the ACT UP members out of the rally area after several spectators, wearing \" Bush '88\" caps, attempted to destroy the signs. A few of the ACT UP members were punched by spectators, but police end\u00ad ed up arresting one ACT UP member on a disorderly conduct charge. Bush \u00abvwrtnMfvt spealdng during the protest, although he turned to look at the ACT UP members as scores of photographers trained their cameras onmembers were escorted away from the rally that Bush announced he had selected Senator Dan Quayle (R-IN) as his vice-presidential running mate. The ACT U P members staged at least five other protests, including a \" zap\" at a rally last Sunday where President Reagan spoke. Police ar\u00ad rested five demonstrators at the Reagan rally, despite pleas by memben that spectators at the rally assaulted them and destroyed some of their signs. The arrested demonstrators were charged with disorderly conduct. \" It was scary. It was like an angry mob,\" said National Gay and Lesbian Task Force staffer Urvashi Vaid of the crowd at the rally. The largest of the week's protests took place Sunday, August 14, when som 300 people attended a candlelight ceremony in a city park to com\u00ad memorate persons who died of AIDS. The event featured the placing of 412 floating candles in a lagoon to sym\u00ad bolize what organizers said were the people who would be diagnosed with AIDS during the four-day Republican National CouveatioB, August lS-18. The cindldiBht oeremony was spon\u00ad sored by AfcNew O i l ^ s chapter of the Louisiana Gay Political Action C ontinued on next pageContinued from previous page Caucus (LAGPAC). Among the speakers at the ceremony were New Orleans mayor Sydney Bar\u00ad th\u00e9l\u00e9my, Rep. Lindy Boggs (D-LA) and National Organization for Women president Molly Yard. Other protests staged by ACT UP in\u00ad cluded a kiss-in in front of the Marriott Hotel, where the Bush for President headquarters was located, and a \" zap\" of Archbishop Philip Hannan, pastor of the St. Louis Cathedral, located in the New Orleans French Quarter. ACT UP members said Hannan led the op\u00ad position to a local gay rights ordinance, which was defeated two years ago by the New Orleans City Council. The activists surrounded Hannon as he emerged from a Sunday mass, shout\u00ad ing \" shame, shame\" in reference to his opposition to gay rights. Harmon told the demonstrators he led the city's ef\u00ad forts in establishing an AIDS hospice, but they replied that Hannon was in\u00ad terested in helping gays die rather than live free from discrimination. The group also staged protests out\u00ad side the Louisiana State Supreme Court building to condemn the state's sodomy law and in front of an office building which houses the Imreg Pharmaceutical Corporation to raise concerns that Imreg is delaying human trials of a potentially helphil AIDS drug called IMREG-1, which reportedly strength\u00ad ens the body's immune system. The California group. Mobilization Against AIDS, held a \" die-in\" in front of the New Orleans City Hall on Mon\u00ad day, similar to the die-in held a month ago by the group in Atlanta during the week of the Democratic National Con\u00ad vention. Members of the group, in\u00ad cluding San Francisco's Paul Boneberg and Morris Kight of Los Angeles, drew chalk outlines of bodies on a plaza in front of City Hall. Participants then wrote names of persons who had died of AIDS inside the drawings. Immediately following the die-in, a group called Mothers Against AIDS led the contingent at City Hall to the site of the Superdome, where they attempted to present a letter to President Reagan protesting the president's handling of the AIDS epidemic. The contingent was led by Sue Caves and Barbara Cleaver, both Republicans from California, who said they had sons who died of AIDS. Both women were refused access to the Superdome because they lacked convention creden\u00ad tials. In a statement to the press, the women called on the president to show \" compassion\" for the thousands who are afflicted with AIDS by increasing funding for programs to develop AIDS drugs. Hard Line on A ID S Adopted in Republican Platform by Lou Chibbaro Jr. NEW ORLEANS \u2014 Predictions by gay Republicans that Vice- President George Bush would embrace a more moderate image during the fall presidential campaign were undercut this week by last-minute changes in the Republican Party platform plank on AIDS and by some of the floor speeches during the convention. Late last week, the Republican Plat\u00ad form Committee added a provision to its AIDS plank that calls for the tracing of sexual contacts of persons who test positive for the AIDS antibody similar to the contact tracing programs used by public health officials for \" other com\u00ad municable diseases.\" AIDS activists said the wording of the contact tracing provision is identical to proposals by Representative William Dannemeyer (R-CA) and other New Right leaders. \" It's a clear signal that the party is catering to the far right and not the moderates,\" said Eric Rosenthal, an official with the Human Rights Cam\u00ad paign Fund. Officials with the gay Republican group United Republicans for Equality and Privacy (UREP) had expressed guarded support for an earlier versionsurprised some observers by being the first to mention the word \" gay\" at the convention \u2014 but in a negative fashion. Kean noted an unnamed \" Dukakis Democrat\" who told Congressional Quarterly magazine that he advised special interest groups, including gays, women and environmentalists, to \" shut up\" until after the election, when \" you will get everything you want.\" Kean quoted the Democrat as saying, \" In the meantime, just shut up so we can win.\" Kean then described \" Dukakis Dem oaats\" as people who \" talk like Dirty Harry\" but who \" act like Pee Wee Herman.\" While not mentioning gays directly, the Reverend Pat Robertson made references to \" disease carriers\" and \" special interest minorities\" to slam the Democrats and the Dukakis-Benlsen ticket. '[The Republican platform ] is a clear signal that the party is catering to the fa r right and not the m oderates.\" ~ Eric Rosenthal of the AIDS plank. The earlier version, while not endorsing the Presidential AIDS Cormnission report calling for antidiscrimination legislation to protect persons with AIDS, did call for com\u00ad passion for people with AIDS, con\u00ad tinued research on the AIDS virus and expedited efforts on the part of the Food and Drug Administration to make experimental drugs available to people with AIDS. None of the speakers during the con\u00ad vention's first two days, meanwhile, ex\u00ad pressed support for nondiscrimination legislation for people with AIDS. Perhaps more disconcerting to gay Republicans was the keynote address delivered by New Jersey governor Tom Keait before a prime-time television au\u00ad dience, also on Tuesday night.

Because arrangements had already been made to relocate tomorrow's Harvey Milk Q ub Women's Day Blood Drive to Irwin headquarters, an hourly shuttle service will leave from the Most Holy Redeemer Church at IIS Diamond Street. According to Lenore Chinn, coordinator of the Women's Blood Drive, yesterday's story in the Bay Area Reporter stating that the Ir- XIMARKE^ TRTETwin blood supply is unsafe \" could be detrimental\" to the Milk drive. \" People might think, 'Oh my God, what if Lorraine Day is right?' \" said Chinn, who was also interviewed by BAR. \" He Ithe reporterl was really looking for an eye-catcher, angling for a sensational point.

Agnos is backing supervisors Harry Britt, Carol Ruth Silver and Willie Kennedy in their bids for reelection. He is also shining the mayoral mantle on nonincumbent candidates Angela Alioto and Terence Hallinan. \" Those five are all he's made for the time being,\" said Eileen Maloney, Agnos' press secretary. \" Whether there will be more endorsements, the mayor will decide as the campaign unfolds.\" Agnos' endorsement of Willie Ken\u00ad nedy, who last spring cheered loudly for the pro-Olympics measure PropositionAgnos is either forgetful of his friends or so green in the job that he doesn't understand what a mayor's endorsement means.\" Notably, Agnos has not yet thrown his considerable political weight behind Pat Norman, a progressive lesbian can\u00ad didate making her third bid for the board. Norman was an ardent Agnos supporter months before his underdog mayoral candidacy gave frontrunner Jack Molinari probable cause for early retirement. But loyalty alone is not buy\u00ad ing a mayoral endorsement, according to Scott Shafer, Agnos deputy press secretary.

I'm sure that Art won't ask anyone in our community to vote for her.\" The endorsement of Kennedy also ruffled some feathers in City Hall, where one source, who asked not to be identified, noted that Kennedy and Agnos were also going head to head over homeporting the USS Missouri. According to this source, \" Willie Ken\u00ad nedy is such a moron that she wants both Art's endorsement and to run against him on the Missouri. Artman would turn on how viable a cam\u00ad paign she runs. \" There's no question that Pat can run a viable campaign and is a viable candidate,\" responded David Binder, an independent pollster based in San Francisco. \" At this stage, the election favors candidates with name recogni\u00ad tion. Those who have run before, like Pat Norman, have a leg u p .\" The big question mark on Harry Britt's candidacy is whether he can at\u00ad tract enough votes to win the board presidency. While Britt lacks critical votes from the city's conservative west side. Binder does not rule out a Brittpresidency. \"Normally, 1 would say that his chances are not good. The presidency generally goes to a political moderate. But in this case, it is possible he could win because he's running with such a weak field.\" Binder argued that neither of the other two Agnos-backed incumbents, Carol Ruth Silver or Willie Kennedy, has a strong enough base to be the top vote-getter. Pelosi's Proposals Added to Waxman's AIDS BiU Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi last week got approval from the Rules Com\u00ad mittee to offer two major features of her AIDS Health Care Financing Act as amendments to Congressman Wax- man's AIDS Federal Policy Act. The provisions call for the creation of \" HIV Monitoring and Treatment Centers\" and for funding to provide counseling and mental health treatment to \" indi\u00ad viduals who experience serious psycho\u00ad logical reactions following a positive test for infection with the AIDS virus.\" \" We were pleased to get the top two amendments agreed to,\" said Pelosi aide Steve Morin, adding that the four other proposed amendments \" were not germane to the [Waxman] bill because they had to do with services.\" According to Craig Middleton, Pelosi's press secretary, \" Nancy's bill had not been going anywhere\" on its own. Riding on Waxman's AIDS bill, the legislation now moves to the House floor for a vote in early September. \" We understand there will be signifi\u00ad cant opposition from Mr. Dannemeyer and other Republicans,\" said Morin. * * It Dishonorably Discharged Gay Vets Get Benefits The Alexander Hamilton Post 448 of the American Legion in San Francisco announced belatedly last week that the government is extending benefits to veterans who were dishonorably dis\u00ad charged before December 31,1979, for engaging in homosexual acts while on active duty. The announcement came neatly three months after the new rule was proclaimed by the Veterans Ad\u00ad ministration (VA) last May. Adopted as an amendment to previously issued rules which extended benefits to gay veterans discharged after January I, 1980, the new rule gives health, loan and education benefits to veterans discharged before December 31, 1979. According to Paul D. Hardman, public relations officer for Post 448, top VA officials failed to notify the local veterans association or local congres- sional offices of the newly available benefits. Weeks of inquiry passedbefore Congresswoman Pelosi's office was able to confirm the announcement. \" Nobody knows about this yet!\" said Hardman, eager to get the word out to the hundreds of Bay Area gay and lesbian veterans who - can now qualify for health care and loan pro\u00ad grams. Concerned bv the possibility that \" some bureaucrat deliberately withheld the facts\" from the local VA, Hardman admits he doesn't know if the news blackout was \" cold indifference or routine incompetence.\" Hardman said he spent weeks trying to confirm a story he read in the June .Vavy Times about the new rule. He called the congressional offices of Senator Pete Wilson. Senator Alan Cranston and Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi asking for assistance. \" 1 gave each politician a chance to help gay veterans, and Pelosi was the only one who came up with anything. The others haven't even returned my phone calls,\" said Hardman. After weeks of chasing VA legislative officials in Washington without success, Pelosi district aide Kathleen Kilcline finally cornered the editor of theA^ovy Times, Rick Maze, who referred her to the official announcement published May 27 in the Federal Register, a government publication of new regula\u00ad tions. As to why the local VA was never informed of the new benefits, Kilcline laid the blame on a bureaucratic time lag. \" I didn't get the sense that anyone was deliberately withholding informa\u00ad tion, it was more a matter of unraveling the bureaucracy,\" she said. The Alexander Hamilton Post has begun a special outreach program to help lesbian and gay veterans claim their benefits and upgrade discharges. Interested oarties chould caU Paul Hardman at 474-8404. Big Dance a Bust Care to Dance, a fancy, heavily adver\u00ad tised AIDS fundraiser produced by the New York-based Designing Men pro\u00ad duction company, was aborted hours before its Saturday evening showtime due to poor ticket sales. The sudden cancellation left its producers deep in the red, the NAMES Project short an ex\u00ad pected $30,000 donation and the hun\u00ad dred people lined up outside the Gift- center bereft of their evening plans. After selling only 60 of the 3,000 tickets available through Headlines by Saturday morning, the parmers of Designing Men made good on their promise to performers such as Angela Bofill that they would cancel the show if they didn't fill at least half the house. \" We want the public to know why it happened,\" said Joseph Ewanish of Designing Men. \" 1 guess people just aren't ready for a big party yet,\" added his parmer, Jeff Continued on next pege Exciting all-day rafting adventures benefiting San Francisco AIDS Foundation.

But the whole idea of Care to Dance was to celebrate the living and remember the dead. Apparently, the community just didn't go for this.

They also suspect that the event needed more advance advertising, though the show was touted heavily m the gay press and on KFOG and \" Peo\u00ad ple Are Talking.\" The production would have been their first San Fran\u00ad cisco show. In addition to donating three months' unrecovered salary, the part\u00ad ners lost over $16,000 on the fund\u00ad raiser.

Gay Fathers Honor Noted Author Don G ark, author of Loving Someone Gay, was the recent proud recipient of Gay Fathers' Pappi\u00e9 Award. \" It's ^ven to a person we feel has made a substantial contribution to gay and les\u00ad bian parents,\" explained Richard Reidy, Gay Fatheis outreach coor\u00ad dinator. \" Don Clark has written a number of books having to do with gay life and specific parenting issues. He served as an advisor to Gay Fathers/r/o bono. His work has been very infor\u00ad mative to gay men who've come out to former wives as well as their children.\" Clark, now a grandfather, has fathered a 23-year-old daughter and a 22-year-old son. \" I have been a gay ac\u00ad tivist for as long as there have been any in contemporary times,\" said G ark, who came out in the late '60s as one of the first fully credentialed, openly gay therapists. His 1975 publication of Lov\u00ad ing Someone Gay propelled him onto the media circuit where he \" was on a collision course with Anita Bryant.\" Gark said he chose to tell his small children and former wife about his gay feelings early on. \" I decided that any\u00ad thing I knew, my wife and kids should know, too. Thank God! That was a smart decision. They never had any wayNew Residence for A ID S/A R C Homeless Mayor Agnos was on hand Tuesday for the official opening of the Peter Claver Community, a Catholic Charities of San Francisco (CCSF) residence for 32 homeless men and women with AIDS or ARC. Named after a 17th-century Jesuit priest, the new center will house the Residential Project of the AIDS/ARC Services of CCSF, which has been operating for the last 16 months out of inadequate Folsom Street Hotel facilities. Locateiat 1340 Golden Gate Avenue between Fillmore and Steiner, Peter Gaver Community is the largest facility on the West Coast to house people with AIDS/ARC and the only residence of its kind with on-site social services to treat the underlying causes of homelessness. As the social service arm of the Catholic Church, Catholic Charities receives no money and little ec\u00ad clesiastical direction from church hierarchy. \" We don't care how some\u00ad one contracts AIDS or any other dis\u00ad ease,\" said Kevin Gogin, director of the Residential P rogram . \" C atholic Charities' motto is to serve whatever unmet needs there are ___Our clients don't have to worry about having a roof over their heads or being kicked out of a Tenderloin hotel every 28 days.\" Gogin said the Claver Residence already has a waiting list of about a dozen PWAs. \" We're very aware this isonly 32 rooms,\" he said. The Catholic Charities Residential Project at the Folsom Street Hotel was beset with difficulties, including a hostile hotel management and exorbitant rents. At one point the manager locked one of the bathrooms, claiming he was afiaid the tenants would contaminate his fami\u00ad ly with AIDS. Catholic Charities filed a complaint with the Human Rights Com\u00ad mission and then began to seek a means to acquire its own facility. In late 1987 Catholic Charities purchased the Golden Gate building with the help of a Hong Kong stockbroker. Costs for the services and staff of the Residential Project are funded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. With donations from com\u00ad munity groups and individuals, CCSF was able to foot the $1.5-million biU to remodel the building. \u2014 Karen EverettPeter Gaver house will provide bousing for people with AIDS. to have a conflict about it,\" said Clark of his children.

According to Sally DeHaven at Mission Station, a man sitting on a park bench at 11:15 pm was propositioned and then robbed at knifepoint by an assailant who is still at large. Schell is warning people walking around the park to exercise caution and carry whistles. Anyone who is vic- t i m i ^ should report the incident to CUAV at 864-3112, even if they do not wish to file a police complaint.

California 9 4 114 100 Attend Toronto Conference Lesbians and Gays o f Color Find Common Ground by Dave Frechette Nearly 100 blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Native Canadians and people of mixed racial heritage, some from as far away as Mexico and New Zealand, attended the Fifth International Lesbian and Gay People of Color Conference in Toronto, Canada, from July 28-31. \" Grass Roots,\" this years's theme, was elaborated upon in conference literature: \" Usually taken to mean the source of origin or a way or organizing, we take it to also define our particular history and movements as lesbians and gays of color. It voices how we work for social change, make new connections and the need to continue in our joined s tru ^ e to remain strong.\" Working for social change and mak\u00ad ing new connections were very much in evidence during the four-day event. Despite a rocky start fit almost col\u00ad lapsed in the spring due to burnout and lack of funds), the enthusiasm at the conference was so high that not even Toronto's stilling heat wave could diminish it. The conference began with a cultural evening staged, as were most of the events, at the Church Street (Gay) Com\u00ad munity Center. A Toronto-based women's music group, led by Annette Russell and Barbara Lee, performed. At one point Russell, accompanied musically by various band members, read from Movement in Black by the Bay Area's black godmother of lesbian poetry, Pat Parker. Poets from India and the United States read from their works, and two Indian men skillfully ex\u00adecuted traditional Southeast Asian dances. The opening plenary echoed Jesse Jackson' s Democratic Convention ad\u00ad dress in its theme of \" Finding a Com\u00ad mon Ground.'' The keynote moderator was Alan Lee, a physician at Toronto's Community Health Center and an ac\u00ad tive member of Gay Asians of Toronto. Merle Woo, a Chinese-American writer, feminist, educator and member of the Freedom Socialist Party, spoke on the need to challenge existing political structures and of her fight for reinstatement at the University of California at Berkeley. Rex Perenara, former Maori national coordinator with the New Zealand AIDS Foundation, spoke on the need for unification of peo\u00ad ple of color and homosexual law reform in his country.

Alejandro Reza, speaking through an interpreter, told of his work with a les\u00ad bian and gay socialist organization, Calamo, in Mexico City. Angela Bowen, black lesbian/feminist cochair of the National Coalition of Black Les-room. \" Away from Machismo'' proved one of the more interesting workshops. When the panelists failed to show up, the participants took over and came up with several significant observations. One socialist/feminist male asserted that machismo, because of its connections to the sexist oppression of women, was as harmful as racism. Another attendee, of Caribbean descent, stated that because of machismo, it's usually twice as hard for West Indians and Latins to come out to their communities and their families Toronto was host city to an international conference addressing the issues confronting lesbians and gays men of color. bians and Gays, talked about sexism in gay groups and the need to shed our respective isms to accomplish our col\u00ad lective goals. She concluded her remarks by reciting the words to James Weldon Johnson's black national anthem, \" Lift Every Voice and Sing.\" \" Working Together\" was also the ti\u00ad tle of one of the 15 workshops pre\u00ad sented. It dealt with the issues that affect us when we try to work across cultural lines. According to Juanita Ramos, a New York City-based, Puerto Rican- born activist and writer, \" Alliances have to be worked through and not be taken for granted.\" This statement echoed many of the sentiments in theas it is for North Americans. Machismo was also mentioned as an impediment to black gays relating to one another. According to reports, the workshop \" Styles of Loving ^ o r Women Only)\" really needed an entire 24 hours. A lot of issues were raised, including the reaf\u00ad firmation of women's sensuality, diver\u00ad sity and the recognition of the various ways in which women connect. \" Styles of Loving (For Men Only)\" got somewhat sidetracked on personal issues, but the difference AIDS has made in everyone's life was a major topic. Celibacy and abstinence, phone sex, black men's j.o. groups, monogamy and open relationships were also dignilv Catholic G ay Men, Lesbians, o u r Friends a n d Families in W o rs h ip in S e rv ic e in C o m m u n ity & S o n g S u n d a y E u c h a ris t, 5 -3 0 p .m ., St. B o n ifa c e C h u rc h 133 G o ld e n G a te (n r.

In \" Cross Lines/Class Lines.\" a number of people preferred more con\u00ad crete discussions about the correlation between class and educational privilege in our communities than was offered. There were discussions of working-class consciousness and the contradiction of claiming to be working class while aspir\u00ad ing to the most negative of middle-class values. \" The Politics of Parenting and Coparenting\" attracted about a dozen gay and lesbian participants, most of whom were into one or more alternative forms of parenting. The workshop em\u00ad phasized that children need positive male and female role models, which they can find in an extended family which should include gay and lesbian friends. People talked about adopting children either as a single or a couple and the possibility of artificial insemina\u00ad tion for women. A number of healthy nonsexist and nontraditional methods of raising children were also discussed. More a stimulating rap group than an actual workshop, \" Generations\" was highly satisfying. Three women and one man offered their views on pedo\u00ad philia, age differences in relationships and attitudes on aging in the lesbian and gay communities. A conference highlight was an inter\u00ad national lunch that reflected the spirit of the conference: bean burritos, com meal tamales, vegetarian samosas, rice, tabouleh, meegoreng (Chinese stir-fried noodles) and curried chicken. At the luncheon. Ana Rivera Lassen, a black Puerto Rican feminist lawyer, gave a speech through an interpreter on \"The Term, 'People of Color.' \" Conference memben recessed for several hours to participate in Carabana, Toronto's annual Carib\u00ad bean celebration which duplicates Trinidad's carnival on a smaller scale. A lively \" Grass Roots\" dance, featur\u00ad ing everything from rap music to Motown, kept everyone boogieing down. The closing plenary, a cash brunch and an international fashion show were all held at the Rose Cafe on Parliament 'Street. It was decided at the closing plenary that the Sixth International Lesbian and Gay People of Color conference will be held in 1990 in London. There were strong feelings of fulfillment and bond\u00ad ing between this year's conference par\u00ad ticipants and an equally strong com\u00ad mitment to making working together and finding a common ground more than mere rhetoric. he peace of mind that comes w ith know ing that your wishes for a simple cremation will be honored can be yours.

The announcement in the Illinois Alumni News begins: \" Married: Paul Ochman '82, M.S. '87, and John Graham. October 10, Washington DC, at the National March for Lesbian and Gay Rights.\" When Ochman sent his original announcement last November, Nancy Gilmore, editor of the newspaper, wrote him that she was \" in the process of investigating whether or not such a mar\u00ad riage is recognized as legal ___If it is not,\" she wrote, \" we are not obliged to print this information.\" Several months later, after more ex\u00ad change of letters, Gilmore returned Ochman's letter of inquiry as to the status of his announcement. Scrawled on the bottom was \" We will not be using your announcement.\" Ochman replied that \" Should you continue to refuse to publish this alumni announcement, I can only assume that I am being explicitly, capriciously and homophobically discriminated against. I need not remind you that is in violation of university policy.\" In April, escalating his tactics, he sent Gilmore carbon copies of his letters to the American Civil Liberties Union, Na\u00ad tional Gay Rights Advocates, Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund and Couples Inc. The announcement finally appeared on May 1. Ochman says, however, that his discussions with the University of Il\u00ad linois are not over. \" 1 just got a form to renew my membership in the alumni organization,\" he said, \" and I noticed that it's $15 for a single person, but $20 forcouples.

Bernheim had the Bronx Democratic Party endorsement and was favored to beat in\u00ad cumbent district attorney Paul Gentile as well as contender Paul Foglia. Both deny having started the rumors that appeared in the New York Post after an anonymous caller phoned the tabloid. Reports have it that Bernheim has lived with the same woman for the last 25 yeais.

Tlie officers reportedly warned that they would be arrested and charged with committing a PDA \u2014 a public display of affection \u2014 which the officers said was i l l ^ in Massachusetts when committed by gays. No such law, in fact, exists.

The survey of 44 recovering alcoholics from Min\u00ad neapolis and Dallas with more than five years of sobriety was conducted by a founder of the Lambda Sobriety Center of Minneapolis and interpreted by an an\u00ad thropologist at the University of Min\u00ad nesota. Results of the survey show female respondents sobering up at a younger age than male respondents \u2014 35.6 as op\u00ad posed to 41 for the men. The women started out their recovery with treatment almost twice as often as the men; on the other hand, the men average 305 Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in their first year of sobriety as compared to 195 for the women. Among the men, 95 per\u00ad cent said they continue to go to AA meetings after five years of sobriety; only 78 percent of the women still did. But les\u00ad bians visited professional psychothera\u00ad pists who were not specially chemical dependency focused almost twice as fre\u00ad quently as the gay men. \u2014 GLC Voice (Minneapolis) Captain Condom 'Offends Public' H A M PT O N BEA CH , NH - Authorities in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire, recently ordered two mer\u00ad chants to refrain from displaying T-shirts with sexuaDy explicit messages for con- doms and s^e sex. Police told the owners of Shirts R Us and Dave's Camera, who sell T-shirts especially to tourists, that the shirts were offenave to the public and would be con\u00ad fiscated if they were not pulled fromdisplay racks in front of the shops. Both owners have moved the T-shirts to the back of their shops. Two of the shirts in question feature a cartoon superhero. One says, \" Captain Condom Says Wrap That Rascal,\" and the other states, \"Captain Condom Says Enclose It, Don't Expose It.\" A third features a penis with a face and the say\u00ad ing \"Cover Me, I'm Going In.\" \u2014 Philadelphia Gay News Coloradans to Vote on Antidiscrimination Measure FORT COLUNS, CO - The Fort Col lins City Council voted 5 to 2 on August 2 to place a gay rights ordinance before the public in November. If approved by Fort Collins voters, sexual orientation would be added to the antidiscrimination chapter of the city code regarding hous\u00ad ing, employment and public accom\u00ad modations. The law already prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, national origin, marital status and disability. When the council held a public hear\u00ad ing in June on the proposed measure, the majority of those in attendance urged the council to approve it. Since the hearing, though, the council has reportedly received hundreds of letters from fun\u00ad damentalists opposed to the measure. In a vote on a resolution of support for the initiative, the council members defeated the resolution 4 to 3. \u2014 Washington Blade700 Say No to North SEATTLE, WA - When OUver North appeared at the Seattle Center Coliseum July 20, he was greeted by some 700 pro\u00ad testers organized by the \" Just Say No to N orth\" coalition. Demonstrators debated politics with attendees, who'd paid up to $50 a ticket to see their hero and with those peddling bumper stickers proclaiming, \"God, Guts and Guns Made America and OUie North.\" They were also confronted by a tactical riot police squad of some 20 on-foot officers and 20 mounted police, who shoved the crowd back. North's appearance in Seattle was sponsored by the Washington Policy Council (organized by former Rep. Glenn Dobbs and Republican Party figure Jim Summers) and by Freedom Inc. Both groups include Pat Robertson forces and other antigay and antifeminist organizers. Dobbs is familiar to the Seat\u00ad tle gay community as the 1988 sponsor of H B 1 %9 and its predecessor Initiative 490, which would have repealed any state fair housing and employment laws. Both measures failed. Dobbs was quoted recently as saying of North, \"This guy is a legitimate 20th- century, 24-karat-gold war hero.. .with a strong sense of d u ty ...|a n d ] morality.\" WPC had expected to sell out the 12,000 seat coliseum, but only about 2,500 showed up to hear North speak on commitment, trust and family and to lash out against abortion, w e l^ , com\u00ad munism and America's \" lossofwill.\" \u2014 Seattle Gay News THE 4 0 5 7 1 8 th S tre e t (o ff C astro) A D ULT BOOKS OBJECT'S O F ART OPEN 11 AM to 11 PM, SUNDAY-THURSDAY 11 AM to 12 AM, FRIDAY-SATURDAY K X P I :R IK lN eK O U R S 1^ 1 .K I > i s c o v c r o u r m a j i i c _ _ \u2014 w h y s o i ii a i i y o f o u r m ie .sls r e t u r n v e a r ;irie r ye a r.

He meant to say facts are stubborn things, but the same president who once declared that trees are the principal source of air pollution may have been more heartfelt in his address than either he or his media consultants in\u00ad tended. Facts are stubborn things, and the closure of the Republican National Convention offers us a chance to contemplate the shameful legacy Reagan leaves behind. During his 7 Vi years in office, 70,000 people \u2014 gay people, straight people, men and women of all colors \u2014 have been diagnosed with AIDS. Of these, 40,000 have died. And Reagan was silent. More Americans have died of AIDS while Reagan was president than have died as a result of all of the wars Americans fought in this century. Reagan presided over this epidemic, but it took him seven years before he made his first public utterance using the word \" AIDS.\" There were billions of dollars for defense spending, but only crumbs for AIDS research and treatment. An admin\u00adistration that swept into Washington promising to elimi\u00ad nate government red tape for business could not muster the time or energy to eliminate red tape for drug testing trials for promising AIDS therapies. Adopting antidiscrimination legislation for people with AIDS was the centerpiece of a report issued by his hand\u00ad picked AIDS Commission, a body chaired by a Navy ad\u00ad miral and encompassing some of the most conservative people on the American political scene. But the Reagan administration handled the report as though it were an in\u00ad fectious document and walked away from its principal recommendations. Not once during his eight years in office has Reagan met with Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to discuss the epidemic, listening instead to the reactionary ravings of William Bennett and Patrick Buchanan. During that time, Reagan was silent. And it is not as though our president is unfamiliar with the toll of the epidemic. Reagan cronies like Roy Cohn have died of AIDS. Terry Dolan, the mastermind behind the right-wing National Conservative Political Action Committee and brother of a presidential speechwriter, died of AIDS. Republican representative Stewart McKinney died of AIDS. So did Hollywood buddy Rock Hudson. And Reagan was silent. Reagan's legacy is deeply rooted in his earlier career as an actor, his frame of reference tied to a movielike reality where the good guys win the war and get the girl. In real- life America, people are dying, and because it isn't in the script, Reagan has no lines to read. He is silent. ACT UP has graphically captured the dimensions of this epidemic with their statement, \"Silence = Death.\" Looking at the Reagan legacy, silence isn't our only enemy.

LETTERSMISE EN SC\u00c8NE by Anne Hamersky Our Common Enemy To the Editor: I enjoyed Cathy Cockrell's coherent article, \"Screaming Into the Wind.\" {^eniinel. 8/12) which highlighted the courageous work of black AIDS ac\u00ad tivist Lirry Saxxon. Not only did I appreciate learning of Saxxon's efforts at AIDS education within minority communities, but I was also encouraged to hear yet another voice identify' oppression as our com- moirenemyrThe cisual, uncaring, highly irresponsible manner in which our government has responded to the seriousness of the AIDS epidemic \u2014 which p.imarily impacts minorities in\u00ad cluding gays, blacks, Hispanics and IV drug users ^ painfully reminds us of that fact. For many years we have heard from lesbian/gay leaders such as Pat Nor\u00ad man and Harry Britt, who have tried to explain the need to build coalitions with other minority communities. Each passing day makes that need ever more apparent. Let's keep that in mind when we vote in local elections this November, and voice that concern in any organizations in which we are ac\u00ad tive. Robert Hass Laying the Groundwork To the Editor: Your article and editorial on the Women's Building's fundraising cam\u00ad paign {Sentinel, 7/22) were great boosts. As you know, the next 18 months are going to be extremely challenging as we ask for support to meet the balloon payment, renovate the building and maintain our ongoing work. By exposing the community toour plans and the building's impor tance to a wide variety of organiza\u00ad tions. you've helped lay the ground\u00ad work for the campaign's success. In fact, since the article and editorial came out, we've received several offers of help and a $2,0(X) check! Holly Eineke Fundraising Coordinator K.T. Cute, Too? The following is in response to A . T . Taylor's letter \"Who's Afraid of Eileen Hansen?\" in last week's Sentinel. Dear K.T. Taylor; Your kind words of political sup\u00ad port in the 8/12 Sentinel are much appreciated. While I did not say everything exactly as I would have liked in my April 1 Sentinel interview, I appreciate t)ie fact that some people took the issues I raised seriously enough to spark community discus\u00ad sion. But what I really want to know is this: Is K.T. Taylor (he? she?) cute, too?! Eileeii Hansen Editor's note: We're delighted K. T. Taylor and Eileen Hansen have become pen pals, but if you want to continue to correspond, may we sug\u00ad gest the Sentinel Classifieds (which offer personal ads fo r women). Big Brother Bill To the Editor: On August 4, the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives passed HR 4333, the Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, by a vote of 380 to 25. While the bill covered largely technical or minor revi\u00ad sions to the Social Security Act. it also included a provision which has dangerous possibilities. HR 4333 would authorize bloodT ^ c e ^ s \u2014 donor facilities to require donors to furnish Social Security numbers, and require the Social Security Administra\u00ad tion to establish a Blood Donor Locator Service that would furnish in\u00ad formation about donors infected with the AIDS virus to certain blood facilities and stales. This smacks of Big Brother and the McCarthy era. Can plans for quar\u00ad antine be far behind? I suggest that we all write our senators to urge that the bill not be approved with the \" blood donor\" provision. I think we should also make an effort to find out which members of the House voted for passage of this bill. We've put a lot of effort into fighting dangerous AIDS-specificlegislation (e.g., LaRouche, Dan- nemeyer). However, it seems that equally dangerous legislation is being \"slipped\" virtually unnoticed into otherwise innocuous bills. Let's not let \" them\" get away with it! M. Janet Aden Gay Inclusion The following letter was sent to Coretta Scott King. Dear Mrs. King: I am writing today to ask your sup\u00ad port for the inclusion of bisexuals, lesbians and gays in the national civil rights march in Washington on August 27. 1988. Since the Stonewall Rebellion in New York in l% 9, lesbians and gaysof all colors have been inspired by the black civil rights movement. We are struggling for an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation and an extension of civil rights protections to all Americans. As you know, people of color have been profoundly affected by the AIDS epidemic. The Third World AIDS Advisory Task Force was organized to give people of color a forum as San Francisco and the nation respond to AIDS. We monitor the availability of AIDS-related resources to com munities of color and advocate to in crease the involvement of people of color in AIDS/ARC/HIV-f policy development, planning and decision making. Continued on page 12AIDS Memorial Garden Artist Responds The Time Is Now I feel that it is important to address the issues that Keith Griffith (Point of Yiw, Sentinel. 8/12) raised in opposition to the proposed AIDS memorial garden.RUDY LEMCKE support, enthusiasm and encourage ment from the street was enough incen\u00ad tive to pursue the project. After this canvassing process I ap\u00ad proached individuals from the Lesbian and Gay Freedom Day Celebration Committee, the NAMES Project, the Gay Games. Shanti volunteers, health care workers. AIDS activists and people with AIDS, asking their opinion andmation by the city of our community's loss and response to the epidemic. After almost two years of political activism, the project has been approved by MUNI and the Arts Commission. Griffith may disagree with the pro\u00ad cess used in developing the project and securing its approval, but 1 have never been out of touch with the gay com munity for one day of this two years nor have I ever felt that I have misread or misrepresented anyone. Concerning issue #2. The fact of the matter is that there are monies in the public, corporate and private sectors His first objection is that, traditional\u00ad ly. memorials are erected after a war or historic event by a community that is moved by its survivors to commemorate the lives lost or the heroic efforts of that community \u2014 and that because we are in the midst of our battle with AIDS \u2014 that it is not time for a memorial. Se\u00ad cond. Griffith believes that monies spent on this project would be better spent on AIDS research, treatment and support. Third, he states that, to the best of his knowledge, there was no \"significant\" community input at the conceptual, design or political level in this project. Concerning issue #3. The concept of a memorial is not a new idea for this community that has surfaced with this project. The NAMES Project is a na\u00ad tional AIDS memorial which has cer-lainly received tremendous support. There have been several other memorial projects that have been developed in the community. Some have succeeded: the poppy project. Some have been aban\u00ad doned: designating a field in Golden Gate Park as a memorial. The concept for this particular pro\u00ad ject was introduced to the community in the 5/4/? in the summer of '86. There were no objections. After this article ap\u00ad peared I spent two weeks canvassing the upper Market Street and Castro areas, personally introducing the project to hundreds of people. I stood in the MUNI station and showed pictures of the design to commuters. There were certainly questions about cost and the logistics of getting such a potentially controversial sculpture through the city bureaucracy, but the overwhelmingThe garden will create a comforting place to express grief a m editative place to experience hope, and a permanent place to celebrate our identitv. advice. Again, there was support and encouragement. Only after all of this were the offices of supervisors John Molinari and Harry Britt contacted and asked for help. To further gain support for the project, in\u00ad dividuals from the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Public Works, the Department of City Planning, the Health Department and MUNI were apprised of the project. It was of critical importance that this memorial be a statement that represent\u00ad ed the feelings of the entire city and that its location in the Harvey Milk Plaza would be an acknowledgment and affir-that arc not intended for health care. If public and corporate contributions for this project are not directed toward the realization of the memorial, it is incor\u00ad rect to assume that these funds are go\u00ad ing to be directed toward AIDS re\u00ad search and treatment. Whether or not this is in conflict with a particular political ideology, it is a reality. There are monies in the fiscal pie of public trusts that are intended Tor urban development, city beautification, the arts and humanities. If the funding available from these sources is not directed toward a project such as this, it will certainly be directed toward otherurban beautification projects. How can I justify asking for private contributions to the garden? As a gay man living in San Francisco for ten years. I certainly am in agreement that health care is the priority issue. But psychological health, spiritual health and political health are also very real needs that must be acknowledged. The garden will help care for these needs. It will create a comforting place to express grief, a meditative place to experience hope, and a permanent place to cele- bmte our identity. The education of society by the affir\u00ad mation of our community and city's response to the epidemic is one role that the memorial will play. The garden will represent San Francisco's response to AIDS as a \"whole care\" that is in\u00ad clusive of the immediate needs of PWAs, that acknowledges the process of grief as a real health care issue and that ensures the rights of the living and the dignity of the dead. Many think that artistic effort cannot affect social change or consciousness. Many of us feel that it can and that art has a valuable place in our community and culture. On a very realistic, political level, I hope that everyone can appreciate that major city agencies have agreed to designate a prime location on Market Street as a place that will honor the lives of the people whom we have lost and that this will give hope to those who are living. Conceniing issue #1. I obviously disagree. The time for an AIDS memo\u00ad rial is now. C m S B N S E TIM TAYLOR M omentum Builds in Support o f Dannemeyer To everybody who slept through the June primary election confident that the LaRouche II initiative would go down the tubes, it is time to wake up and get moving. A recent statewide poll conducted by Field Research indicates that a not very well informed electorate is prepared to pass the Dannemeyer/Gann initiative by a margin of 3-1. The question asked of 809 registered voters during the last week of July was whether they would vote in favor of an initiative that would require the report\u00ad ing of the names of people who doctors or blood banks \" feel might have AIDS or who might test positive for the dis\u00ad ease/^ That's right, people who they feel might test positive. In response to the question, 72% of the respondents culled from a list of ptopk likely to vote in the general elec\u00ad tion said they would vote in favor. Twenty-two percent said no, and six percent had no opinion. Steve Morin, an AIDS expert who works for Representative Nancy Pelosiand who also advises state lawmakers on the issue, notes that the Daime- meyer/Gann initiative \u2014 Prop. 102 on the November ballot \u2014 is a compen\u00ad dium of every bad bill progressive legislators have been able to fend off in Sacramento. Passing the initiative and incorporating its ideas in the state con- stitution, Morin says, would be a disaster of the first order. For those who need more motiva\u00ad tion, the list of Dannemeyer/Gann hor\u00ad rors include; reporting the names of people suspected of HFV infection to IomI health authorities; mandatory tracing of the sexual contacts of people who test positive; giving health insurers and employers access to the results of HIV tests; establishing criminal penalties for people who violate any provision of the initiative. The previous AIDS initiatives were tarnished in the eyes of the public because of their association with Lyn\u00ad don LaRouche. But the involvement of a US representative \u2014 William Danne\u00ad meyer \u2014 and tax-cut crusader Paul Gann has given Prop. 102 a veneer of respectability. Turning the tables and building public opposition to Dannemeyer will require organizing and fundraising, both of which are lagging. A sense of panic might be helpful, too. To join the campaign to stop Danne\u00ad meyer, call 621-4450. A donation can be mailed to the No on Prop. 102 Corn-community. Dukakis can make up for lost ground and build some bridges he has thus far been loath to construct by speaking out on the Dannemeyer/Gann initiative. That position would not be all that bold a step. He would be in the com\u00ad pany of the California Medical Associa\u00ad tion, the California Nurses Association and nearly every other informed health care provider in the country. How about it, Mike? L e t George Be George Texas state treasurer Ann Richards noted that George Bush was bom with a \" silver foot in his mouth,\" and Bush proves the veracity of the remark with nearly every utterance. At this rate, George Bush may defeat himself in November. Mr. Sensitivity showed his atten\u00ad tiveness to minority sensibilities when he introduced a couple of his grand\u00ad children, who are half Mexican, to the president. \" The little brown ones,\" he called them. Meanwhile, kudos to SF Chronicle minee, 10 United Nations Plaza, Suite 410, San Francisco 94102. Make checks ! payable to \" Californians Against Prop. 102.\" Waiting for Dukakis The outcome of the AIDS plank in the Republican Party platform (see page 5 for Lou Chibbaro's story) presents Democrat Dukakis with a win\u00ad dow of opportunity to reach out to ourtelevision reporter John Carman for his incisive assessment of Veep pick Dan Quayle who has been compared in looks to actor Robert Redford. Said Carman, \" Even if Quayle does look like Robert Redford \u2014 which he doesn't \u2014 isn't that a little bit like say\u00ad ing snake meat tastes like chicken?\" Baby-boomer Quayle, who talks tough on defense spending, was a no- show during the Vietnam W ar, hidingout in the Indiana National Guard. In\u00ad vestigations are underway to determine if there was family influence used to get him out of the service. It's another ex\u00ad ample of the \" do as I say, not as I do\" syndrome. Agnos and City Appointments Citisense has been keeping a running tally on lesbian and gay appointments to powerful city positions and has faulted Mayor Agnos for some per\u00ad ceived shortcomings. So, there's some good news now to report. The 23-member Citizens Committee on Community Development was recently announced by Agnos, and it includes four lesbian and gay ap\u00ad pointees, the largest minority block on the board, according to mayoral aides. Nancy Shaw will continue to hold the position of chair. Shaw is active in the Women's AIDS Network. New appointments to the board are Fred Dunnett and David Neely, both of the Milk Qub, and Clint Hockenbcriy ot the AIDS Legal Keterral Panel. The Citizens Committee will advise the mayor and the Office of Communi\u00ad ty Development on the distribution of what is expected to be $15-16 million in federal money funneled through the city. Groups that have benefited from the grants in the past include the Women's Building and Lyon-Martin Health Clinic. Featuring THE BROWN BOMBER and DIVA TOUCHE b y P r o f I . B . G i t t e n d o w n e AT THE COURTHOUSE The Case o f the Missing Underwear Wearing only his birthday suit, the 20-year-old man flagged a taxi shortly after midnight. The cab took him to a friend's house where he was able to get clothing. Then he called the police to tell them that he was a victim of a sexual assault and had been forced naked onto the street. Earlier that evening our reportee had been at a bar where he met another in\u00ad dividual. They agreed to go to this man's apartment for a massage. But once they arrived and undressed, the would-be masseur jumped on top of his guest and told him, \" I want you to suck me off and lick my asshole.\" When this request was refused, the reportee was hit in the face. Fearing bodily harm, he told the police, he com\u00ad plied with the man's requests. He said that he was forced to orally copulate the man's penis and anus numerous times. After the man ejaculated into his mouth, he was forced to swallow the semen. The suspect then allegedly forced the complainant to leave the apartment and go downstairs to the basement. There he was ordered to take off his underwearand leave the building without any clothes at all. When the report was being given to the police, the suspect entered the garage where the report was being made. The suspect was arrested and then gave his own version of the night's events. He told the police that he had in\u00ad deed met the other man at a bar and in\u00ad vited him home for the purpose of hav\u00ad ing sex. Once in the apartment, the guest told him that he suffered from ARC. At this point, the host lost interest in having sex with him and asked him to leave. The guest refused so he was thrown out of the apartment. The police were given permission to enter the apartment to retrieve the com\u00ad plaining witness's belongings. Nowhere in the apartment were the police able to find his underwear. They went to theKEN CADY basement of the building to search for the missing underwear but to no avail. The suspect went to jail, the witness went home, and the case came to the district attorney's office. Had a crime been committed? Was there enough evi\u00ad dence to prove it? Who was telling the truth? These questions are difficult to answer no matter how you react to the above scenario. We're all thankful that sexual activity between consenting adults is legal, but when that activity is forced upon someone, it can be a very traumatic event. For a prosecutor, the difficult task isperson's story or particular consistency in another's. Sometimes the existence (or nonexistence) of similar complaints makes a difference. Motive or lack of one can be a factor. It's often a very difficult decision. If in fact the complaining witness is telling the truth, a crime has been committed and the culprit should be held account\u00ad able. The protection of others is a primary concern. Yet if the suspect is, in fact, innocent, then justice requires that determination to be made as early in the proceedings as possible. Charges of rape and other sexual assaults mark a person forever. They carry very severe penalties because they are very serious crimes. When there are inconsistencies in a complainant's story, the jury finds it very difficult to convict the suspect without corroborating evidence. Why For a prosecutor, the difficult task is determining whether force can be proven from the facts o f a given case. determining whether force can be prov\u00ad en from the facts of a given case. Sexual assaults are rarely committed in front of witnesses, so the police must look for \"coiToborating\" evidence. Those are the factors which tip the scales towards the credibility of one side or the other. Often it is a matter of physical injuries, blood or semen, contradictions in oneshould they believe one witness over another? When there are outright con\u00ad tradictions, conviction becomes even more difficult, even though sometimes the contradictions do not amount to lies. It's a simple fact that two people hearing and seeing the same event will recall it differently. Their memories willnot always be accurate. A fact forgotten at one time may be remembered at an\u00ad other. And let's not forget that a victim of a crime as violent as rape does not always take the time to note the details that will become important in a court proceeding. The facts of the above case were recently reviewed in the district at\u00ad torney's office. Two gay men were both cooperating with the police about what might have been a very serious incident. Their stories are in complete conflict. Why would the complainant say this if it were not true? Why did he go to the trouble, including being taken for an ex\u00ad am at the sexual assault clinic? One wonders how the complainant ended up naked in a taxi. On the other hand, if the suspect was guilty, why did he show up r i^ t away when the police were being called? Why did he let them into the crime scene without a warrant? Where were the in\u00ad juries if the victim was struck in the face? Where was the missing underwear? It finally came down to the question of where was the victim. After giving his report and going home, the police were unable to locate him when the sexual assault inspectors were ready to take his statement and investigate the case fur\u00ad ther. The decision became very easy. You can't prosecute a case without a witness, so the suspect was freed and the charges dropped. Should he have been in jail in the first place? We'll never know.

Imagine if every les\u00adbian and gay in the United States were completely out and open to their families, friends, coworkers and com\u00ad munity. You'd see people you never thought to be p y or lesbian! Imagine the political advancements that would be made if everyone \"came out.\" Lesbians and p y s would not have to fear losing their jobs, houses, children, families, lovers or rights. Straight society would see that we (py people) are not a small minority and that lesbians and p y s are a productive and creative part of society. Imagine what the lesbian and p y youth of this country would see if everyone came out of the closet. Teachers, parents, athletes, doctors, judges, janitors, carpenters, all lesbian and p y , and all having productive careers in role-model positions. They'd see that lesbian and p y s are of every religion, every race, every ethnic background and every nationality. Most important of all, if every per\u00adson came out of the closet, imagine all the pain and loneliness that our p y children could avoid, knowing that they were not the only p y or lesbian person in the world or knowing that they were not some freak that deserved to be miserable. Imagine what it would be like if we didn't have to hide, pretend or lie to people about who we are and what we feel. If we didn't have to watch our every action or thought. The only way we are every going to make being lesbian or p y a nonissue and move on to more important mat\u00ad ters is by burning down our closets, coming out in full force, and saying, \" Yes, we are lesbian and p y , and yes, we are open about who we are.\" I encourap anyone who is not open or out to their families, friends, relatives, coworkers or community to take the steps of struggle and risk rejec\u00ad tion for the reward of knowing yourself and giving other people the same \u00bb4 9*WILL^M ^ Everyone needs to have a will.

Mtchad Nulty Stopping the Buck To the Editor: California currently prohibits the use of HIV antibody test results in making health insurance eligibility decisions. This landmark legislation, authored by then-assemblyman Art Agnos, has prevented private insurers from drop\u00ad ping certain \" high-risk\" individuals and has helped ensure that private in\u00ad surers bear some of the burden in pay\u00ad ing for the health care costs of persons with HIV infection. The insurance industry wants to abandon the A pos protections. They believe that HIV infection should not be treated any differently from other diseases and that they should be able to use HIV antibody test results in making health insurance eligibility deci\u00ad sions. Assemblyman Patrick Johnston has authored a bill, AB 2900, which gives the insurance industry what they want. The State Senate Health Committee did nut agree tlial tlic cuiifideiitiality protections should be dropped and recently sent AB 2900 to interim study, which means the bill is dead for this legislative session. This is an important victory for rational AIDS policy. If in\u00adsurers have access to HTV antibody test results, there is no guarantee that they would not dump infected individuals, thereby overburdening the state MediCal system and potentially deny\u00ad ing individuals their right to affordable health care. I believe that all people with HIV infection should have access to afford\u00ad able health care and that the cost of this health care should be shared by both private insurers and the state. Legislation such as AB 29(X) does not meet this standard. Rather, it raises the possibility of mass denials of insurance coverage. This is unacceptable, and I will continue to do all I can to oppose measures such as AB 2900 and Pro\u00ad position 102 (the Dannemeyer), which forget that the primary focus of AIDS policy is treatment and education, not passing the buck or creating hysteria.

EXIT (707) 6 4 2 -7 3 5 0POTLUCK KATE BRANDT Sassy Dykes Dialogue Here's how I feel about kids: I can sit for half an hour at a time and watch, spellbound, as my 1 '/z-year-old niece \"eats\" a container of yogurt by smearing its contents across her face, hands, hair and the tabletop. Then I call her mother (my sister) to come and clean up the mess. All right, so I wouldn't make a great mother. But that doesn't mean I hate kids. In fact, I regard my decision to be neither a mother nor a coparent as a sign of my high regard for children. And so, because I care about the up- and<oming generation, I was upset to read a recent survey reporting (among other things) that one in every seven teenagers has attempted suicide. (And twice as many girls as boys have tried to kill themselves. Haven't we feminists bequeathed a limitless future for these girls to anticipate happily? Or have we instead provided a frightening panoply of options without any accompanying guidance in making choices?) The survey also reported that 80% of the kids are drinkers (one-third having had \" five or more drinks on one occa\u00ad sion\" ) and that 1 in IS teens has tried cocaine. Now that's a shocker: You mean those your-brain-is-a-fried-egg commercials don' t scare the little w hippersnappers in to chem ical abstinence? And Nancy (\" Mommy\" ) Reagan promised it would work! Then there are the AIDS questions. I have to be concerned about this subject \u2014 considering that 1 am a card- carrying homosexual, and you know that AIDS is the only subject we careing in foul vapors from the muck. Secondly, this sort of self-righteous, hypocritical bigotry sounds like a prime example of what we might call The Last Temptation o f Christ syndrome, other\u00ad wise known as the \" do as I say, not as I do\" school of moral guidance. Swaggart, Bakker, Robertson \u2014 these exemplars of the two-sided mouth are old news. But explain to me the mouth-foaming types whose major ob\u00ad jection to the Scorcese film is the scene in which Jesus imagines that he marries, mates and makes babies. This is blas\u00ad phemy?! I thought this setup was the right-wing Christian dream come true! Or do the fundamentalists all have their children by latter-day virgin births? And, I'd like to know, if these self- anointed arbiters of public morality truly feel that it's their place to decide what movies belong on the nation's silver screens, then where in hell (sic) are they when buckets of money are be\u00ad ing made by \"slasher\" films wherein teenagers (usually girls) are raped, slashed, mutilated, etc., ad nauseam? * * it As I write this, the Republican Con\u00ad vention hasn't yet started. I anticipate renting a lot of videos for the week or getting into \" Quincy\" reruns. One / would have p a id cash money to be there when M iss Stein virgin eyeballs took a gander a t O n O ur Backs. about. Anyway, oddly enough, the newspaper account I read didn't men\u00ad tion whether the teens were polled on their attitudes vis-a-vis gays and AIDS \u2014 or gays and anything else, for that matter. What the survey d/tf uncover was de\u00ad pressing enough: \" 51% of [teenagers) mistakenly believe that washing after sex reduces the chance of infection with the AIDS virus.\" Well, good. Ivory Soap's stock will go up, and sexually active (aka \" bad\" ) kids who lose in the sexual-partner lottery won't know what hit them. These kids also believe that one can contract the AIDS virus by receiving a blood transfusion (thus indicating to us exactly how current Current Events classes are) or by donating blood! Cheering news for the Arm in Arm AIDS blood drive, which three weeks ago experienced a decrease in donors after an SF General surgeon decides that a Castro blood drive would provide a pool of high-risk donors \u2014 high-risk to themselves, no doubt. Well, the news isn't all bad. Our Future Leaders may be ignorant and vulnerable now, but our Present Leaders (aka the California legislature) are taking steps to rectify that situation. The Senate passed, and the Assembly will soon vote on, a bill to require public school sex ed classes \"to stress that pupils should abstain from sexual intercourse 'until ready for marriage' and teach honor and respect for 'monogamous, heterosexual' m ar\u00ad riages\" Iphronicle, August 11). Do tell. First of all, unless I missed something in my high school civics class, our esteemed reps have at the very least dangerously m uddied the separation-of-church-and-state waters. And the stench of LaRouche/Danne- meyer/Schlafly-type thinking (sic) is ris-thing I do want to hear more about, though, is the odyssey of Sue Caves and Barbara Cleaver, two Southern Califor\u00ad nia Republicans who will be at the con\u00ad vention in New Orleans \u2014 but not to rah-rah for George Bush. Caves and Geaver are mothere whose sons died from AIDS. And sothey will be in New Orleans to participate in a candlelight vigil to ask for an AIDS platform plank and to request a meeting with Ronald Reagan. a couple of weeks ago. Las Madres: The Mothers qfPlaza de Mayo, about the mothers of the disappeared in Argentina who congregated on city streets to protest their government's ac-tions \u2014 and inaction. What would hap\u00ad pen if all the mothers of Americans who died from AIDS marched in front of the White House, in front of the Capitol, in front of their state capitols, in front of their city halls, in front of their hospitals? Could the govemment(s) still pretend that AIDS is something that happens to \" someone else\"? 'But, Mr. Theiriot, I Don't Know Nuthin' 'Bout No Lesbians!' (Part II) Well, the mail is running 1-1 in response to my August 5 item about the Chronicle's Ruthe Stein and her public musings on her lack of knowledge about lesbians. It seems that On Our Backs' Maryhope Tobin also phoned Miss Stein and offered to interview her for her column (Sextracts); she, too, was asked to send a copy of her magazine and writing samples to Miss Stein, but she received no response. Writes Ms. Tobin: \" Maybe it was all just too much for her ___First the dis\u00ad covery that lesbians exist in the Bay Area, then finding out they have news\u00ad papers, magazines and \u2014 yes, sex.' \u2014 was just too much for her 'sophis\u00ad ticated, big-city' mind.\" All 1 can say is 1 would have paid cash money to be there when Miss Stein's virgin eyeballs took a gander at On Our Backs. There could not have been enough smelling salts in the whole of San Francisco to undo the damage, I reckon. But, whoops, there I go again, being \" snotty.\" At least that was the opinion stated in the \" poison pen\" contingent of fan mail from an \u2014 oh \u2014 let's just call her Ms. P.C. Oakland. Ms. Oakland sent a personal letter to Miss Stein, giving her explanation of relationships between women and thanking Miss Stein for a \" fine essay\" that \"will open some doors and foster some dialogue.\" For this, she received a thank-you letter from the Chronicle columnist. Well, a column, a letter and a thank- you note may or may not constitute \" dialogue.\" Ms. Tobin and I offered the sort of dialogue wherein ideas are exchanged, philosophies are discussed and honest differences of opinion are aired. Miss Stein, apparently on the basis of reading sample copies of the Sentinel and On Our Sacks, refused the oppor\u00ad tunity for such a dialogue. If \"the 'courage' with which |I| mouth off fis| directly proportionate to |my] distance from home,\" as Ms. O ^ a n d claims (\" home\" meaning New York, and I have no idea what that meant!), then how much courage did Miss Stein diqrlay in putting her hand out publiclySQUAT THEATRE by Kris Kovick and then withdrawing it when some friendly arm wrestling was offered, ac\u00ad cepting only kisses on her literary ring?

If it ends in Decembei. that won't be possi\u00ad ble.\" To date, San Francisco has spent about $700,000 under the program out of an allocation of $2.7 million from a one-time special federal appropriation. By December, the DPH will still hold about $1.7 million, or enough for another 17 months of payments at the current rate. Werdegar hoped to use that money to maintain the program during lobbying and negotiations towards a new program. The AZT payments resulted from congressional action last year by Congressman Ted Weiss (D-NY) and Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA). The federal government distributed theHIV infeaion. Dr. Tom Peters. Werdegar's second in command at the DPH. described the program as flourishing. We added 48 new people to it in July. There is an in\u00ad creasing sense in the medical communi\u00ad ty that more people should be getting onto it. People could know with some sense of security that at least this por\u00ad tion of their treatment was covered. Do we tell people now that this is helpful to them and we are going to take it away?\" At this point the situation with respect to AZT funding is frirther con\u00ad fused because neither the state health department nor the State AIDS Office has returned calls from the DPH asking for confirmation and clarification of last week's press reports. Werdegar told the Health Commission on Tuesday that he would now try to get a re ^ n s e in writing. A spokesman for the State AIDS Office on Wednesday told the Sentinel that the report published in last Friday's Chronicle was correct and contained no inaccuracies or omissions. The DPH is especially concerned 'Do we tell people now that this is helpful to them and we are going to take it away?'' \u2014 Dr. Tom Peters funds to the states on a per case basis, and at least in California, the state in turn redistributed to the counties on a per case basis. The payments in San Francisco go to people with incomes above the MediCal limits and less than $40,000 per year. If the state's decision stands and people are cut off from AZT, Werdegar told the Health Commission, \" We could have a lot of concerned and anx\u00ad ious people in the city.\" AZT, though not a cure for AIDS, appears to im\u00ad prove quality of life and to avert for a year or longer the onset of some of the more debilitating and life-threatening opportunistic infections associated withabout the possibility that the state, con\u00ad trary to earlier indications, will take back funds which were set aside to pro\u00ad vide for a \" roll-over period\" during which new funds would be sought. The Chronicle quoted State AIDS Office director Thema Fraziear as saying, \" If one county is sitting with a big pot of money left and another has no money, I may shift some of the funds around.\" Pending clarification, Peters de\u00ad scribed the state's handling of the ques\u00ad tions as \" a classic pattern of setting health departments against each other. We're accused of hogging funds. We're not hogging anything. San Francisco is still the epicenter of the epidemic.\" Ac-Federal drug policies that Umit access to treatments have been protested all over the country . cording to Peters, the contracts with the state contain no requirement that the money be spent by the end of the year. Asked what people in the program will do if the state cuts off the payments, Peters dismissed the possibility of stop\u00ad ping their AZT therapy as \" ethically and medically indefensible. But they may have to spend down until they become eligible for MediCal.\" In other words, they may have to impoverish themselves and get rid of their assets to the point that the state will pick them up again under a different program. AIDS activists took a wait-and-see attitude when they learned of the news. Terry Beswick of ACT UP said, \" Peo\u00ad ple will be out demonstrating if some\u00ad thing isn't done. All this money goes to Burroughs-Wellcome. They have a monopoly on AZT. It was given to them by the federal government. They set the price to recover their costs and make a profit within one year because other drugs would come along andmake AZT obsolete. That hasn't hap\u00ad pened. FDA regulations have dis\u00ad couraged other drug trials. Perhaps [Congress] will look at that and regulate the pharmaceuticals industry and make Burroughs-Wellcome open their books. The whole system needs to be over\u00ad hauled.\" Health Commissioner Jim Foster also raised the issue of the Burroughs- Wellcome monopoly before the Health Commission on Tuesday. Noting that the expected obsolescence of AZT has not yet happened, he concluded that \" the need for AZT will become greater.\" In a mocking characterization of the attitude of the state towards the emerging crisis, Foster said, \" So what if it sav\u00ab lives? That's not as important as saving money.\" Foster also told the commission that threats by the state of New York to sub-poena Burroughs-Wellcome's records to establish the company's costs and profits from the drug led the company to drop the price significantly. So far, Burroughs-Wellcome has successhilly frustrated all efforts to force public dis\u00ad closure of financial records on the AZT monopoly.

O P R C E S m' Recovering from AIDS: Gaining Weight and Strength Immune system deterioration resulting from HIV infection is usually accompanied by a rapid loss of stamina and weight. The virus disrupts the digestive and metabolic processes, thereby inducing the wasting syndrome of ARC and AIDS. To survive this physical deterioration, one must arrest its progression and rebuild lost strength. Find someone who is knowledgeable about the holistic approach to AIDS to guide you in creating a supplement pro\u00ad gram. You will need assistance in revers\u00ad ing a lifetime of poor nutritional habits. The vast majority of Americans are in a state of subtle malnourishment. There is too much sugar and fat in the American diet, and it is devoid of vitamins and minerals.i f L I V E & W ELL D E N I S E B U Z B U Z I A N The first step is to stop or slow down the erosion of immune fiinction and in\u00ad hibit the reproduction of the virus. The best way to begin this task is to eliminate all deleterious foods and substances from your lifestyle. Give up sugar, high-fat foods, foods with artificial additives, recreational drugs and alcohol. Avoid any substances which do not strengthen the body. Find a treatment to suppress the virus' reproduction. If you can slow the rate atspecialized holistic therapies. There is a wealth of immune-enhancing formulas on the market today. Crystal Star, Jar- row and a number of other companies have supplements to jump-start a slug\u00ad gish immune system. Many people find such therapies as shiatsu massage, acupuncture and other forms of body\u00ad work very helpful in increasing stamina. When you get your health stabilized and find your strength returning, you may want to work on gaining some weight. The subject of weight gain and loss in PWAs is a controversial issue for allopathic and holistic healers. There is a sharp divergence of opinion on this issue between these two schools of healing. It is often frightening how little physi\u00ad cians and clinical dietitians understand about diet and physiology. Davies Medical Center distributes a dietary guide called AIDS and Nutrition. The Davies guide suggests that PWAs eat a lot of high-fat and sugary foods such as puddings. TV dinners, butter and mayonnaise. This diet gives a real fVhat is the point o f gaining weight if you are weakening the body fo r the possibility o f opportunistic infection? You will want to cover the standard roster of vitamins and minerals, and you will want to check into special supple\u00ad ments such as germanium, chlorella. which the virus infects new cells, you can gain some ground. Research the pros and cons of such remedies as AL 721, herbs, bodywork, AZT, dextran sulfate and BHT. Researchers in Boston found that reda~ macrobiotic diet inhibited the decline of T-cells. The idea is to eat a very clean diet which does not burden the system with toxins. This frees more energy for rebuilding the system. Another way to slow immune break\u00ad down is to reduce stress. There are numerous approaches to stress reduction and relaxation. Some PWAs find that they need to quit their jobs or reduce their study load in school. You can seek out tranquil spots in which to spend your free time; parks and beaches ate par\u00ad ticularly calming. You can practice meditation and biofeedback. There ate also a number of tapes that can guide you through relaxation techniques. Use your imagination to take the pressure off. Once you have put the brakes on the progressive breakdown of the immune system, you can begin to nourish the body and rebuild strength. You will need to improve the health of your intestines, the organs which nourish the body, as a first step in healing. The health of the in\u00ad testines depends on the number of helpful bacteria in the bowels. You will want to create a strong culture of beneficial bacteria by taking acidophilus supplements. You may need to follow a Candida control program to dear the in\u00ad testines of yeast growth.garlic, propolis and wheat grass juice. You may requite large doses of certain nutrients until the body is fortified and can assimilate them efficiently. Once you have built up some strength, you will want to get involved in moreprescription for intestinal distress by recommending fruit topped with yogurt or sour cream. Obviously, what is the point of gaining weight if you are weakening the body for the possibility of opportunistic infection? It is not healthy to gain tissue which clogs and burdens the system. Such a dietary approach does not stabilize the patient. This approach is a last-ditch effort to fatten up the patient for lack of any other effective therapy. This high-fat and refined-foods diet is the exact opposite of what an immune- compromised person needs. To build healthy tissue and gain weight, one should eat a diet based on complex carbohydrates and high-quality protein. Complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, beans and vegetables pro\u00ad vide the body with clean-burning energy. They are low in fat and cholesterol free. High-fat foods cause the blood quality to deteriorate and inhibit the oxygenation of cells. To build and repair tissue, one must have an adequate supply of quality pro\u00ad tein.

In From Reverence to Rape, Molly Haskell writes of Marilyn Monroe and her death: \" Our feelings about Marilyn Monroe have been so colored by her death and not simply, as the uncharitable would have us think, because she is no longer an irritation and a threat, but because her suicide, as suicides do, casts a retrospective light on her life. Her 'ending' gives her a beginning and a middle, turns her into a work of art with a message and a meaning.\" S o, to o , d o es B ritish p lay \u00ad w rig h t Jo e O rto n 's d e a th \u2014 O rto n w as b lu d g eo n ed b y his lover, w ho sub seq u en tly c o m \u00ad m itted suicide \u2014 co lo r th e w ay in w hich we lo o k at his life a n d his w o rk .

For F urther R eference A brief annotated bibliography of George Bataille's work available in English follows. An asterisk means highly recommended. Novels; Blue o f Noon, translated by Harry Mat\u00adthews (Urizen Books, 1978). Takes place dur\u00ad ing Spanish Civil War. Narrator is a bottom to two girlfriends. Excellent poetic translation. L ' Abbe C, translated by Philip Facey (Marion Boyers, 1983). Two brothers \u2014 one a priest, one a debauchee \u2014 vie for one another's souls. Guess who wins. Bataille's most homoerotic work. *Story o f the Eye, translated by Joachim Neugroschel (City Lights, 1987). Most famous and perhaps brilliant of Bataille's novels. A boy and girl seduce a friend, drive her insane at an orgy and then go off to seduce and kill a priest. The story is advanced not bv plot but by a shifting rearrangement of image clusters: eye, egg, testicle, sun, etc. Other Work: * Literature and Evil, translated by Alastair Hamilton (Urizen Books, 1973). Bataille ex\u00ad plicates Emily inter\u00ad pretation of Genet. Bataille's thesis is that literature is a return to childhood but is not in\u00ad nocent. Rather, \"a rigorous morality results from complicity in the knowledge of Evil, which is the basis of intense communication. ' ' Visions o f Excess: Essays \u00a1927-39, trans\u00ad lated by Allan Stoekl (University of Minne\u00ad sota Press, 1985). Bataille's essays on Dali and Van Gogh, Nietzsche, politics, etc. Eroticism: Death and Sensuality, trans\u00ad lated by Mary Dalwood (City Lights, 1986). A seminal work for anyone interested in theories of sexuality. The College o f Sociology, 1937-39, edited by Denis Hollier (University of Minnesota Press, 1988). Primarily of interest because it shows how Bataille's work grew out of a di\u00ad alogue with other thinkers and writers: Roger Caillois, Michel Leiris and Pierre Klossowski were some of the main figures to give lectures besides Bataille. Letters amongst members are included in an appendix. Inner Experience, translated by Leslie Anne Boldt (State University of New York Press, 1988). An unfortunately wooden, aca\u00ad demic translation of Bataille's most impor\u00ad tant work. Guilty, translated by Bruce Boone (Lapis Press, 1988). Bataille's dark night of the soul, one of his most lyric and penetrating works.Wyeth at the de Young Helga Schmelga You'd never know it by looking at her, but Andrew Wyeth's Helga is one hell of a tease. She's a glorious media creation that taunts and attracts with the weight of Madison Avenue, yet she's as mild and ma\u00ad tronly as a mouse. She promises much, but her show at the de Young builds to a climax that never delivers. Someone's not putting out. Is it the woman or the artist who created her? It's hard to tell in this game of titilla\u00ad tion because ''Andrew Wyeth: The Helga Pictures\" is not about art; it's about teasing, or in more contem\u00ad porary terms, shrewd marketing.

Fundamentalist preachers Donald Wildmon and R.L. Hymers became the de facto heads of publicity for Universal Pictures, masterfully solving the studio's problem of selling what is essentially an art film to the general public. Ted Koppel, chief interrogator for ABC News, suddenly became a film critic, chiding director Scorsese on \" Nightline\" for taking out the \"poetry\" Koppel found in the Nikos Kazantzakis novel on which the film was based. And a bunch of right-wingers whose religion is supposedly founded on love and acceptance showed the l ^ d of malice and intolerance that can be unleashed in the name of their Lord.

SHANTI VOLUNTEER AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE PROJECT CALL 777-CARE D E N N Berkeley Shakespeare's 'Timon of Athens' Idiotic Innocence There are great works that use greed as a starting path to explore deeper, underlying faults of human desire. But an Aesop fable or a fortune cookie is space enough to reiterate the dog-eared truth that money can't buy love, etc. Shakespeare's seldom-performed Tim\u00f3n o f Athens, currently at Berkeley Shakespeare, is a parable of material greed and ingratitude that can be reduced to just such matchbook-sized dimensions.

Now that I'm over the shock of learning that I'm actually doing OK, I was really scared at first, until I found a medical group that specializes in the management of HIV infection. Don't get me wrong\u2014 I still wake up each morning wondering if every ache and pain is related to AIDS. But having my immune system periodically monitored helps put my mind at ease. That way if I need it, I can make sure to get special treatment that could save my life. I feel like I have so much more control over my future now, and I'm doing everything I can to stay healthy. It's nice to know that if I experience some change in my condition, my medical group will be there to help. It's great to have a place to go to get answers to all the questions I have. I.wish you would visit San Francisco to talk to the people at ViRx too. Besides, I miss you. d eViRr is a healthcare organization, committed to mxiking a decisive contr'ibuticm to the fight against AIDS.

Dallas on Their Minds Three Teams Advance to World Series by Tom Vindeed Overcast skies could not dampen the spirits of the Rainbow Roos, Amelia's or the Endup as each won the right to represent San Francisco in the upcoming Gay Softball World Series in Dallas, Texas. Amelia's had to fight tooth and nail to claim their first title in two years. Patty Flynn's single to left Field in the ninth allowed Amelia's to claim victory by a 3-2 score. Superstar Video can be proud of the battle they put up; every\u00ad one thought they would be swamped by the fired-up Aviators. Amelia's coachCynthia Elliott stated, \" No one can say we didn't earn it, they [Superstar Video] gave us our best game of the year.\" Afterwards at Amelia's, sponsor Rikki Streicher led the hoopla by turn\u00ad ing up the music, while the usually sedate Claire Monfort climbed onto the bar and did her soon-to-be-famous stripact. It was a great unplanned party by our hardworking executive board. Prior to the Amelia's bash. Uncle Bert's Place hosted the Rainbow Roos and the Endup. The Roos had to win two straight over a determined Mint squad if they were to head to the great Southwest. The first game saw Bob Smith limit Gary Broga's team to eight hits en route to a surprisingly easy 9-2 win. In the championship fray it was a see\u00ad saw battle all the way, but some timely coaching by third base coach Rick Mariani produced the winning run for the Roos in the top of the seventh inning for a heart-thumping 7-6 win. Broga's team can hold their heads high consider\u00ad ing they got off to an awful 0-6 start. A nice blend of rookies and veterans such as Bob Blakman, Skip Schaffer, Nick, Rob Daoud, Tom and the world's old\u00ad est softball player, 67-year-old Lou Gilmore, gave the Mint something to be proud of. Neil Christie's defending champion Endup team had to overcome charges of being too old, too slow and too fat to beat a solid Pendulum squad for their second title in two years. Immediately after the game, Christie announced his retirement. Following that not-so- shocking statement. Clay Maxwell an\u00ad nounced that he will take a majority of the current Endup team and move to Uncle Bert's Place. Can Tommy Lee and Bert F\u00e4rber afford two teams? We'll find out in about five months \u2014 if not sooner. On the field it was all business as the Endup scored two straight wins over the Pirates. The first game saw the Endup get off to an early 3-zip lead before the big bats of the Pendulum came alive.Terry Brooks was the winning pitcher for the Endup. However, the Endup held on for a 4-3 win with Terry Brooks the winning pitcher. The second game was the reverse of the first as the Pendulum Jumped all over Brooks for a 3-0 lead, only to seesingle after single propel the soon-to-be champs in front to stay. The final score. 6-3, made this the lowest scoring cham\u00ad pionship in the 11 -year history of the Gay Softball League. Pendulum pitcher Mark Braverman gave up only 23 hits in two games, not many considering the likes of this Endup team. Now how about Uncle Bert's team! As predicted here three weeks ago, this group turned out to be the almost- Cinderella story. They dumped the Kokpit and the Pilsner on their way to a lofty third-place finish. Also, those Cafe Cruisers surprised everyone but them\u00ad selves with a fifth-place finish. With another season at an end, we wish all three teams good luck in Dallas (in the 110-degree heat, they will need it). Next week we will carry the first two days of World Series action in this col\u00ad umn. Where ebe could you gel same- week coverage? P ool Predictions by Rick Mariani In Division One there is no doubt that the Deluxe Ducks, last year's champions and one of the top teams in the history of the San Francisco Pool Association (SFPA), will end up in first by a wide margin. This team places a heavy emphasis on winning every game of every match. They use practically all of their allotted time-outs and take forever to shoot, but it cuts down on errors. (They don't make many.) The Ducks are anchored by Elliott Zalta and Lisa Duncan, two of the league's finest players. The latest Duck migrated from the White Swallow team, form er city cham pions. W alterMoreira's presence should make the Ducks even stronger. Their only prob\u00ad lem that 1 can detect will be how to \" quack, quack\" in Spanish. Continued on next page N A T H L E T I C S T R E E T F A I R B E I M E F I T T I I M G 3 A I D S C H A R I T I E S * F O O D D R IIM K N O O IM R D /W : A U GT O S I X P .IV IContinued from previous page The second-place team will be Maud's Makeshifts, a team with a col\u00ad lection of the league's top women players. Marquita Booth, a terror on the table as well as on the softball field, is complemented by Fran Herman. Torri Connelly, Karen Brandman, Bob\u00ad bie Kenny and Anne Senter. This very tough competitive team will surprise many in the interdivisional matches in the second half of the season. Third place will be a dog fight between the Bear Handed, the Detour Deforce and the Overpassers, with the edge going to the Bear by one game. Division Two will be the toughest of the four. Look for the individual records of the players to be lower than expected; they will be facing excellent teams each week. The first-place team will be the Palace Four Hits and a Ms. captained by Toni Macante. Toni was the West Coast Challenge first-place woman and just last Saturday went undefeated at the Captains Tournament to capture top spot. She is joined by another old-timer. Luby Pelletier, Jack Dunbar. Archie Ravena (rumor) and a newcomer to the league, Dave Piona. Dave plays profes\u00ad sionally. which will make it a bit more challenging for those facing him. Second place should be the White Swallow Wave, the second-place team in the city last season and city cham\u00ad pions the previous two. They play a looser game during the season, letting their players shoot without calling time\u00ad outs. The Wave has confidence that they will make the play-offs \u2014 where they usually are difficult to beat. The addi\u00ad tion of Lynn Westhoven has given them a top player for their fourth spot. Third place is up for grabs, but the Bear Thugs and the Deluxe Mysticks will probably battle it out. The Bear team, with D .J., Shirley Wentworth. Ron Chevrette and machine gun Joe Ankenbrant, will be a spoiler all season. Division Three will have the Cinch Saddletramps end up in first. Mike Macri has put together a collection of \" personalities,\" all of whom can shoot up a storm. Newcomer Ken Williams appears to be a good bet for the top 16. My crystal ball is a bit fuzzy, but I see the Special Effects, the Pendulum Pirates and the Castro Station Cruisers in the race for second and third. The fight for first place in Division Four will be tight. Here we have two evenly matched teams with the Cinch Killer Beeez and the Eagle Creek Chaos.The Eagle Creek will squeeze out a win on the last night of plus to edge the Killer Beeez into second place. The Chaos is the same team that destroyed the White Swallow on the last night of play this past season, only to run out of gas in the play-offs. Their hotshot is LeoEmanon. who makes the impossible happen with his cue. The Cinch's Rod Cohan, an excellent shotmaker. will have another good season and end up in the top ten. Third place is a toss-up be\u00ad tween the remaining teams, but the nod goes to the Castro Station Express.

Having your worst fears confirmed may not sound like good news but maybe it really is. Why? Because many physicians who have worked with the A DD S virus now believe that early detection and treatment to prevent the deterioration of the immime system (T-4 Helper CeUs) is the best course of action to slow or stop the progression to AIDS or ARC. Research indicates that left untreated, over 70% of those infected with the HiV virus wiD eventuaUy develop AIDS or ARC. The sooner you know if you are HIV Positive the sooner you can start taking positive action that could save yoiu* life. G E T T E ST E D Tfesting is now widely available. The San Francisco Depart\u00ad ment of Public Health has several neighborhood sites that offer confidential, free, anonymous, testing and counseling. For information and appointment schedules telephone 415-621-4858.If your test shows that you are not infected be sure to get retested periodically. Sometimes the HIV antibody doesn' t show up for three years after infection. It' s important to keep checking so that if you do contract the HfV virus you can combat the infection in its early stages. G ET TREATED If you do test positive there are many resources available to help you with the medical and the psychological impact of HIV infection. For example, the community group. Pro\u00ad ject Inform, offers a free hotline service which can help provide you with the information you need to plan a course of action. Call 558-9051 in S.F or use the toll free lines 1-800-822-7422 (National) or 1-800-334-7422 in California Positive Action Healthcare, the nation' s largest clinic deal- -tng with HIV immune disorders, is one ofthe resources you should consider.The Positive Action Healthcare clinic is now serving hundreds of HfV Positive patients with a program of preventive medicine devoted to maintaining the health of their immune systems at a level that may be sufficient to ward off the onset of infections associated with AIDS and ARC. Each patient' s individualized program is developed with his Positive Action Healthcare physician based on the initial examination and is reevaluated on a regular basis.Potential new therapies are closely monitored by Positive Action Healthcare and as they show evidence of effective\u00ad ness they will be added to the treatment depending upon each patient' s needs. The Positive Action Healthcare treatment is not a cure for AIDS. This treatment is intended primarily foi\u00bbpatients who are HIV Positive and who have not yet developed ser\u00ad ious symptoms of AIDS or ARC. The Positive Action Healthcare medical group is headed by Alan S. Levin. M.D.. assisted by a staff of scientists and physicians who are specialists in the treatment of prob\u00ad lems of the immune system and have published numerous medical and scientific documents in this field. Dr. Levin has served as Adjunct Associate Professor of Immunology at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center. In private practice in San Francisco since 1981, he established Positive Action Healthcare in 1987 to deal spe\u00ad cifically with immune disorders related to the HIV virus. ion ealthCnre/nc A Medical Group specializing in Allergy, Immunology and Environmental Medicine 450 Sutter Street, Suite 1138 San Francisco, CA 94108 4 1 5 -7 8 8 -7 5 4 5 "}
