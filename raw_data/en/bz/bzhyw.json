Donna Eden is one of those rare healers.\" --Gloria Steinem Energy Medicine for Women was awarded the prestigious 2009 Nautilus Gold Award in the Health, Healing & Energy Medicine category. A women's guide to using energy medicine to promote and maintain optimal physical and mental well-being. For more than three decades, Donna Eden has been teaching people to understand the body as an energy system, to recognize their aches and pains as signals of energy imbalance, and to reclaim their natural healing capabilities. In this long-awaited new book, Eden speaks directly to women, showing them how they can work with energy to tackle the specific health challenges they face. Hormonal health is essential to a woman's well-being, and in this groundbreaking book Eden reveals that a woman can manage her hormones by managing her energies. In fact, energy medicine is effective in treating a host of health issues. From PMS to menopause, from high blood pressure to depression, it offers solutions to women's health issues that traditional medicine often fails to provide. In Energy Medicine for Women, Eden shows women how they can work with energy to strengthen their immune, circulatory, lymphatic, and respiratory systems to promote health, vitality, and inner peace. Blending a compassionate voice with a profound grasp of how the female body functions as an energy system, Eden presents what is sure to become a classic book on the subject of women's health. Donna Eden, a pioneer in the field of holistic healing, is among the world's most sought after, most joyous, and most authoritative spokespersons for energy medicine. Her abilities as a healer are legendary and her invigorating presentations are rich with audience participation and stunning demonstrations. Since childhood, Eden has been able to see the flow of the body's energies, and from this clairvoyant ability, she developed a system for teaching others to productively work with their own body's energies. Eden has taught some 50,000 people worldwide how to methodically and precisely direct energy for health and happiness, using methods akin to acupressure, therapeutic touch, and qigong. Eden is author (with her husband, David Feinstein) of the best-selling book, Energy Medicine, which has been translated into 12 languages, and is a classic in its field. According to Carolyn Myss, \"The contribution Donna Eden has made with Energy Medicine will stand as one of the backbone studies as we lay a sound foundation for the field of holistic medicine.\" This definitely deserves a permanent spot on my bookshelf. As I read this mammoth of a textbook, what worked for me is to simply start with the Daily Energy Routine and little by little tweak it and add more. This is something I will be studying and practicing for the rest of my life. I had a moment, during this reading, of high emotion with an employer, I felt like I was going to cry and I immediately remembered to put my fingers on the neurolymphatic points: I felt instantly pulled together and calmed enough to continue what I was saying. I also feel different if I start my day without my Daily Energy Routine- I feel tired and fatigued without it. It makes a difference every day and I am still learning more exercises. It is a continuing adventure! Thank you, Donna Eden! In January 2021, cancer in our precious Spirit cat urged me to open \"The Energy Medicine Kit\". I had it since he was born, to try someday. There was no time to learn but it helped us. Marigold had end stage kidney disease that June. She lived 2 years with blood levels vets could not believe. We needed more than a summary: we needed Donna Eden's whole book. What heartbreak to reach the page with key information too late! In illness, we maintain three companion meridians, not only the main organ. McCartney suddenly ascended in March 2022. He benefitted most, although racing to save a life is not the way to learn. My Mom would have loved these techniques. They would have lived, had I advanced earlier with this information. In honour of them, I warn everyone to read \"Energy Medicine\", followed by this. Doctors view health one part at a time. If a pill, surgery, or food (as they measure it) do not work; symptoms are soothed until death. Some diseases are just called fatal. That is unacceptable. We are more than solid and liquid. Our electromagnetic hands can trace acupressure \"meridians\". Everyone can hold lifesaving \"neurovascular points\" and do exercises Donna devised, who sees energy. Her mere introduction of \"Energy Medicine for Women: Aligning Your Body's Energies To Boost Your Health And Vitality\" 2008, is impactful. Obviously used to questions, Donna rattles off the answers first thing! Why don't doctors know energy medicine and urgently promote it? Drug companies finance the testing that goes into medical journals. If tests do not yield positive results, they are terminated, unreported. We should refuse the side effects that are deemed acceptable. Why don't doctors prescribe natural cures: herbs, oils, energy healing? Nature can't be patented to make money. I researched ways to help our cats. \"Hormone therapy\" was promoted as if menopause were a sickness! Nothing generates hormones and immunity like balancing our energy. Unlike drugs, it is an intelligence that keeps apace with our personal moods and environmental changes. I wondered if this book contained anything new. This is a new set of powerful techniques! We can test everything in her family's books & videos on the spot. See for yourself. Our doctor friend was a lifesaving surgery pioneer who stayed open-minded. Active in things he loved, he also did similar eastern health routines. He ascended recently at age 96! Donna has done it again! I feel blessed that I'm aware of her transforming work and able to utilize the practices in my own life to the betterment of my own health. I've had her Energy book for quite some time and have attended a weekend seminar that she gave several years back, so I've been using her basic techniques for quite a while now. What drew me to this book is that it's especially for women, and for women as we transition through life. I glanced through the first part and found it was what I was familiar with and headed straight to a later chapter on menopause. Ah Yes! This is the information I am seeking. Now to study it a bit more and put it into practice. If you're a woman and haven't yet read Donna's work, this is a good starting point. Everything from early menstruation to childbirth to pms and beyond is covered. This book has some excellent exercises that increases your energy and vitality. It also deals with many of the issues that women struggle with--PMS, pregnancy, fertility issues, and menopause and has suggestions for energy work to deal with all these issues effectively. I love this book and the whole idea of energy medicine. I recommend it highly. A superb book, one which is both informative and empowering. Through sharing stories and insights from her vast experience of working with subtle energies, Donna Eden ably demonstrates why she is perfectly (perhaps uniquely) qualified to write this particular book. The authors offer a wide selection of tools for shifting the body's energies in order to naturally and safely enhance health, wellbeing, and vitality. All of the techniques have been developed so that anyone can apply them, even if they don't feel or see subtle energy themselves. The text includes detailed instructions interspersed with plenty of photographic illustrations. There are tools for helping with period pain, issues during pregnancy, infertility, menopause, and weight management, and a helpful chapter offering guidance on energy testing. Because Donna has experienced severe difficulties with her own cycles and hormones, she knows PMS 'inside out', too! Hence there are a number of techniques included here for relieving stress, as well as for balancing specific meridians which might be keeping the energy system (and hence body, mind, and spirit) in a state of stress and ill health. As a Reiki Master, and someone familiar with EFT/tapping, acupressure, qi gong, and pranic healing, Donna's words - and the tools she shares here - make sense to me, and resonate at a very deep, intuitive level. The book is a practical guide, so of course an improvement in a reader's energetic balance and wellbeing could only occur if the tools are used regularly. But like Reiki and EFT, they cost nothing but time and a little effort to implement, and are available 24/7, so for me it's definitely worth the investment. This review has been updated following my second reading of the book in April 2016. Warning: Do not watch the video first! :) This author is rather \"interesting\" and in reading the book it is easier to be objective and accept/reject things you don't need. I have it on good authority that watching the companion video first may leave you with the desire to run quickly in the other direction. Thank goodness the video wasn't available when I got the book, because I really like the idea of energy medicine and despite the style of the author I loved most of what she teaches. At some point I will get the video so I can see her demonstrate techniques that are harder to master from written descriptions in the book. Until then, I am enjoying the benefits of a very accessible alternative health technique without spending a penny on an expensive provider. I was a little unsure about this, thinking it would rehash a lot of what Eden teaches in Energy Medicine, but this was not the case at all. The first couple of chapters breeze through a review of what she discusses in great depth in her first book and then really focuses on specific energy moves that women can do based on various stages and issues we experience. I love her writing and wisdom, and again, recommend this for people interested in more natural solutions to healing. C'est un livre sur la tout les jours maintenant! A++ for this book. It is one I go to often and have read cover to cover three times just to take it all in. A must have for women of any age, as well as a must have tool for energy medicine practitioners! \"Energy Medicine for Women: Aligning Your Body's Energies to Boost Your Health and Vitality\" (Eden, 2008) is the perfect guide for women of all ages. Energy Medicine is a concept Donna Eden developed inspired by how she sees the alignment and flow of energies in people. She learned how to correct these energies by working with clients, and also inspired by kinesiology, acupressure and other eastern medicine practices. It is a hands-on book where the reader gets the chance to implement the practices in their daily life. If you liked Donna Eden's 1999 classic book \"Energy Medicine\", you will love this one. The book still has the essentials from the classic, but is expanded to include the feminine aspect of energy medicine. It is a great tool if you are going through life transitions such as puberty, pregnancy, menopause or if you are facing health challenges. For men who wants to understand their daughters, wives or mothers better this is also a great help. I recommend using it more like a guide or a reference, rather than a book that you read from beginning to end. Unfortunately, the index list is not optimal as it does not always refer you to the correct page. The book also lacks an extensive reference list/bibliography which would be useful when wanting to go deeper into a specific topic. I am hoping that they will come out with an updated version where they correct this problem. As an alternative, I use the content list to guide my way to the right pages. That way I will also bump into interesting topics that I normally would not have looked up. When skimming through the book it is easy to get captivated as most sections have photos or drawings of the different exercises. That makes it easy to implement practical energy medicine routines in your daily life even if you are not an experienced practitioner. All in all, this is a great book to have at home so that it is available in those times when you may benefit a little extra from it. S\u00e5 boken, som \u00e4r skriven med, 1998 - so what a surprise.

I wanted to read this book after I attended a class on energy healing at my gym. Very interesting method of using your own body's energy to heal yourself. I was particularly interested to read the section about a woman's role after menopause. She explains the idea of \"the crone,\" a term that Donna explains in such a positive way that it represents a whole new phase of a woman's life. Instead of turning into a dried up old woman, Donna encourages you to embrace your life and your wisdom and offer it to the community now that you don't have children to care for. -diverse Energie\u00fcbungen f\u00fcr Ausf\u00fchrer von dadurch oft zu viel Energie in Triple Warmer. Nimmt Energy von Spleen Meridian, dieser oft schwach I enjoyed learning about energy medicine and it has me intrigued to try something new in my own and families health before jumping into something unnecessary. I did listen to the book so it made it hard to understand the exact movements to use and that's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. It is very informative, but not necessarily a huge page turner for me personally. I loved what i learned though and would recommend if you enjoy alternative health and lifestyles I checked this out from the library but I'm thinking it would be a useful reference to have at home. There's lots of energy information here, some tidbits that resonate with me and others not so much; some things I was already aware of and others that were brand new concept; I found it all interesting in any case. It's alright. Not exactly what I thought it was going to be. Lots of talk about the meridians. Which since I listened to the audiobook version, was a little annoying to follow. There's great techniques, Donna is experienced and knowledgeable. I just didn't vibe with it at this time. Mat come back to in the future but I kinda doubt it. From my knee-jerk reaction (this author is a fruit-cake) to my incessant eye-rolling at the authorial interjections this book was bound to be a mixed bag of provocation for me. Upon closer inspection I believe this book has some validity. For one thing it is relentlessly positive in its message that women can take on the tough issues and create change in areas that the medical world has abandoned with a \"get used to it\" attitude. For this very reason I would like to keep this on my patient-friendly shelf. Ms. Eden has a lot to say about menopause and she does it nicely. I like her insistence on a \"woman's second prime.\" While I dislike her discussion of HRT--I think there's a bit too much emphasis on fiddling with hormones, which reads like a middle-aged woman's justification for self-medicating--I dig her commitment to looking at hormone changes as an opportunity for growth rather than a disease to eradicate. - Hormone changes as opportunity for growth rather than as disease. Deserves to be repeated. In the middle of the book there's a brief and easy to understand section on women's hormones. (I suspect her husband contributed heavily to this section. She doesn't strike me as someone who concerns with those kind of details.) There's a good section on weight management. Ms. Eden has very positive things to say about altering your basic concept about your body and your weight. She includes a suspiciously illustrative anecdote about a woman who went from 300 to 125 pounds (in the course of a few sentences) no dieting involved, and who remains at that same weight sixteen years later. I used the word \"suspicious\" because studies in advertising indicate the sound of a woman making approving sounds will sell anything to men and the sight of numbers of pounds trending downwards will sell any book to women. I will say this and try to be nice in the saying: this woman is a scavenger of techniques and knowledge from every and all venerable medicine systems. (\"Scavenger\" doesn't sound so bad, but my kung fu teacher used to sneer at what he called 7-11 martial artists: students who went from system to system scrounging what they could without ever developing profundity of knowledge.) Yes, Ms. Eden is tireless in her, er, gathering. What she does to Chinese medicine is nearly criminal (i.e. the \"fourteen meridians\"? Her claims about the triple warmer? Hilarious, ridiculous, and part of the reason \"The Economist\" lumps acupuncturists in the same bucket as crystal gazers.) Thank goodness she only suggests movement and self-massage. If she talked about Chinese medicinal herbs I would do something desperate. I found this a fascinating read. Of course, hubby the surgeon scoffed at it :p In some ways there's nothing new in what is said, because most of the book is all about tapping/activating/strengthening/sedating the energy meridians used in acupuncture (and the related fields of acupressure, shiatsu, etc). At the same time, however, what is different is she provides practical applications/knowledge of said \"energy medicine\" that can be used to address physical problems: an angle I strongly believe in and approve of. I just wish I could *feel* the energy, y'know? :p When reading about \"energy testing\" I too kinda scoffed, then I watched a demonstration that Ms Eden had done on a morning tv talk show and was amazed: it involved \"scattering\" energy by smushing the nose of the person being tested. Tried it on my hubby, but didn't get the same result, so either his energy for that particular meridian was okay, or I need to figure out how to actually do this test thing, LoL! The main takeaway from the book is that there is a huge selection of simple exercises that can be done on a daily (or multiple times daily) basis that should help put anyone into a better-balanced state. My homework for the next few weeks is to do this for 5mins at least once a day, and see if I feel/see any difference. I didn't quite finish the book because I had to return it to the library, but it is organized like a reference book so it would be better to buy then to try to use it within a few weeks. All the exercises are well explained and there are pictures to make sure you do them correctly. Again, these exercises are things you are supposed to do consistently over time so I would say to buy this book and have it on hand. Some of the exercises I could feel a difference, but others I could not (but I haven't done them every day over a long period of time). At the very least they were relaxing. I got the book because my sister is taking classes from Donna Eden. She has practiced on me and both times it was great! I was curious to know more and this book does explain a lot. Interesting concepts. There is a lot to get out of this book. It takes a lot of studying, etc., as anything new to one does. This along with EFT does work. It takes a lot of practice and just \"go with it\" approach. My question is, if conventional stuff isn't working, then why wouldn't you try it? If Dr. Oz, Mercola, etc. basically work toward saying that health issues can be attributed to energy and how it's balanced, displaced, etc., and I agree with it by firsthand knowledge, then just go with it and TRY. And it's right up there with how Kundalini yoga works. I have far to go with this book. there is SOOOO much to learn and understand and do! I have picked this up and put it down a number of times. I'm still not done the book as a whole, but I have read the parts that I feel are more relevant to me currently and will go back and read other parts at a later date I'm sure. Overall it is a very interesting concept and something that fits with certain beliefs that I already have. Contains more information specific to women than Energy Medicine: Use Your Body's Energies, so I suggest owning them both. Wish I'd had it years ago!! An essential book for every woman's bookshelf, and for the men who love them. An amazing book full of amazing information about dealing with women issues by tapping and doing exercises that deal with our meridians in our bodies. There was so much information, I felt like my head was swimming. I rented this from the library but feel like it would be more beneficial to own to be able to reference more. Had to return this book to the library a few months ago and am on the lookout for my own copy, because it is the kind of book that is good to have around. Donna Eden is a no-nonsense kind of person, and unless you are the type that thinks that energy work is nonsense in itself, this book will give you an abundance of good idea to elevate your own. "}
