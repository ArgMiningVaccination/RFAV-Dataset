What Comirnaty is and what it is used for Comirnaty is a vaccine used for preventing COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2. Comirnaty 3micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is given to infants and children from 6months to 4 years of age. The vaccine causes the immune system (the bo dy's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID -19. As Comirnaty does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give your child COVID -19. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 2. What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty Comirnaty should not be given if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (liste d in section 6) Warnings and precautions Talk to your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child: has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after havin g been given Comirnaty in the past. is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle injection. has a severe illness or infection with high fever.
