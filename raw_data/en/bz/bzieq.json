Recovery centers constantly look for adjunct therapies to incorporate into their treatment programs. In recent years, addiction treatment centers have looked to holistic treatments to give their clients the best chance of successful recovery from drugs and alcohol. Acupuncture has been one of the most popular choices in complementing traditional addiction treatments. Acupuncture has been used since the early 1970s to help [treat addiction](https://musetreatment.com/california/los-angeles/inpatient-drug-rehab/) and withdrawal symptoms. Most places in the U.S. are beginning to use acupuncture more and more in the past few years, but California has long accepted the practice for various health issues. So what should you know if you are looking for acupuncture for addiction treatment in Los Angeles? Acupuncture is one part of Traditional Chinese Medicine that involves inserting very thin (the thickness of a hair) sterile needles through your skin at strategic points in your body. Traditional Chinese medicine explains acupuncture as a technique used to balance the flow of energy, Qi (pronounced chee), which is believed to flow through pathways (meridians) in your body. Western medical practitioners view acupuncture points as places to stimulate muscles, connective tissue, and nerves, which may stimulate the body's natural painkillers. It is believed that inserting the needles around the body can help stimulate nerves that signal the brain to release biochemicals and hormones that reduce pain, inflammation, and stress. They can also improve circulation and signal the body to increase blood flow to a specific area to help speed up healing. These actions can also balance hormones and boost brain chemicals such as serotonin. Acupuncture is mainly used to relieve the symptoms and discomfort associated with a variety of conditions, including: - Chronic pain - Muscle aches - Insomnia - Arthritis - Labor pain - Headaches and migraines - Stress and mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression - Menstrual cramps - Digestive issues - Respiratory disorders, such as seasonal allergies - Drug and alcohol withdrawal [Click here to call Muse Addiction Center today.

Acupuncture is a safe, all-natural medicine, which, when combined with other forms of treatment, like group counseling, psychotherapy, and support groups, can benefit those suffering from substance abuse. There are many ways acupuncture can support addiction treatment, but the most significant benefits are reducing stress and relieving pain. It is highly recommended that anyone getting clean off drugs or alcohol after heavy use or prolonged use enter a medically supervised detox to ensure their safety and comfort during the withdrawal process. Withdrawal symptoms can be very intense with muscle aches, insomnia, depression, anxiety, cravings, fatigue, irritability, and nausea. During this time, medical staff can monitor the person's vitals and administer any necessary medications. Getting acupuncture during this time can also help reduce many withdrawal symptoms and support the medical detox. Acupuncture can also help detox the body through a protocol called NADA or AcuDetox. Developed by the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association, AcuDetox is an effective treatment for addiction to prevent relapse and compliments traditional treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy. After drug and alcohol detox, acupuncture can help those in recovery programs reduce their stress and even help heal trauma. It is also beneficial to help co-occurring disorders such as anxiety and depression, which may be the root cause of addiction. Another benefit is that it is an excellent alternative to painkillers which may not be an option for those recovering from opiates or other painkillers. Some of these issues may have been the cause of a prescription addiction and are still present. Acupuncture can also be beneficial to help maintain sobriety after the addiction treatment program is over. Helping to reduce stress, depression, and anxiety can remove some of the triggers that may lead to a relapse. Some people also suffer from mild withdrawal symptoms even months after they stopped using drugs or alcohol, such as insomnia and nervousness, which acupuncture can also help treat. If you know someone who has experienced a release, here are some tips on how to deal with the situation: [https://musetreatment.com/blog/how-to-deal-with-a-relapse-of-a-recovering-alcoholic/](https://musetreatment.com/blog/how-to-deal-with-a-relapse-of-a-recovering-alcoholic/) What to Expect at Your First Acupuncture Treatment Not every person will experience the same during their first acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture focuses on individualized treatment and rarely has the same treatment for every person. With individual treatments, you may be asked questions about your health history and current symptoms, followed by the acupuncturist feeling your pulse and looking at your tongue to help with their Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis. Based on this diagnosis, the acupuncturist will choose various points throughout your body, mainly the legs and arms, to insert the acupuncture needles. Once needles are in, you will lay with them for about 30 to 40 minutes. You may feel a slight pinch as they are inserted but should not feel anything after that and may feel very relaxed and even fall asleep. Once they are removed, you can go about your day usually. Some recovery centers will have group acupuncture sessions, usually using the NADA protocol. NADA's standardized treatment includes inserting tiny needles at five points in each ear, which can help with the heightened nervous system, stress, detoxing, and even trauma. The treatment usually lasts about 30 minutes, and the person should also feel very relaxed. Groups can sit together quietly or may even participate in a guided meditation during this time. 7 Los Angeles Acupuncturists Here are seven acupuncturists in Los Angeles to help you experience the holistic treatment: 1.
