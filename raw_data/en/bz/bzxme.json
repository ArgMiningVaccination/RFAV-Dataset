The Future of Louisiana Higher Education ELEVATE LOUISIANA: The New Reality for Higher Education Aligned to the Elevate Louisiana mission, the Board of Regents approved a series of initiatives which address the projected fiscal realities for Louisiana higher education.

Access to graduate education must be re -evaluated from a narrower state- wide perspective. Resources must be provided for essential cutting - edge research at selected sites. Postsecondary resources must be targeted to respond to local/regional workforce needs.
