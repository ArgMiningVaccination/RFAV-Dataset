Outcomes of traditional pharmaceutical care are management of a medical condition, elimination or reduction of patient symptomatology, arresting or slowing disease progression, or preventing illness. In spaceflight, pharmaceuticals and medications are used for a variety of purposes including prevention of illness, medical treatment, and countermeasures. The unique environment leads to a host of factors that must be considered when choosing treatment options. Spaceflight factors, pharmaceutical shelf life, and time to resupply could lead to ineffective medications or even the potential for toxic byproducts. Physiological changes related to spaceflight as well as alterations of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may lead to differing outcomes from pharmaceutical intervention compared to those known terrestrially. These factors, along with vehicle environment, may result in the in - mission medical capabilities and interventions to have outcomes that differ from what would be expected on Earth.NASA -STD-3001 Technical Brief OCHMO -TB-006Pharmaceutical Care NASA Office of the Chief Health & Medical Officer (OCHMO) This Technical Brief is derived from NASA -STD-3001 and is for reference only.

Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Other Factors One ofthe challenges toproviding pharmaceutical care inspaceflight isthe lack ofdata regarding how medications work inspace compared tohow they work terrestrially .Many factors arebeing studied and considered toassess how space travel affects medications andhow those medications affect thehuman body . Pharmacokinetics (PK) refers to how the body reacts to a drug, including how medications are absorbed into the body, transported throughout, and degraded or eliminated. Pharmacodynamics (PD) refers to how a drug interacts with tissues, cells, and organs as well as if the drug formulation (i.e., tablet capsule, liquid, or aerosol) produces the desired effects. The extent of absorption can depend on route of administration and physical and chemical properties.Background 02/21/2023 Rev A3 Space Exposure: even in low Earth orbit, spaceflight introduces several factors that may affect how well medications last in space (stability) and how well they work (therapeutic value). These factors include: Physiological changes in the human body Fluid shifts -altered volume distribution. Intracellular fluid alteration -altered metabolism; altered drug uptake and clearance. Altered plasma protein concentration -altered free drug concentration; altered renal/hepatic clearance. Cell membrane permeability -altered drug distribution metabolism altered hepatic enzyme expression. Gut motility and absorption -altered gastric emptying from space motion sickness (SMS) or medications to address SMS; faster and more variable intestinal transit rate. Environmental changes CO2changes Pressure changes Gravity changes Radiation exposure Other atmospheric considerations (humidity, temperature, pressure, etc.) Immunology: There is evidence that pathogens may be altered or that medications may be unsuccessful in managing pathogens during spaceflight. Prior studies have explored increased antibiotic resistance of spaceflight cultured bacteria.NASA -STD-3001 Technical Brief OCHMO -TB-006Pharmaceutical Care NASA Office of the Chief Health & Medical Officer (OCHMO) This Technical Brief is derived from NASA -STD-3001 and is for reference only. It does not supersede or waive existing Agency, Program, or Contract requirements. Research Related to Pharmaceuticals Spaceflight may affect the stability of certain medications by altering the concentration of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). NASA has not identified a definite mechanism for this phenomenon, but more research is being conducted. An example of this is shown by the graph to the right (Du et al., 2011) where the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of Trimethoprim decreased with longer stowage duration. Another study however , with returned samples from the ISS did not show much (if any) decline in effectiveness of the API past their expiration date. Wotring, 2014Background 02/21/2023 Rev A4 Medication Usage Sleep aids are the leading medications for acute use in -mission Congestion/allergy medications are the leading medications for prolonged use in - mission Wotring, 2015 In-Mission Medication Effectiveness Even though underreporting limited the Dose Tracker 2017 study dataset, a very small percentage of medications were found to be ineffective in-mission. Most medications led to at least some amount relief of symptoms. It was difficult to determine if medication recall data could have been altered by crew taking medications for an \"inaccurate diagnosis\".

Background 02/21/2023 Rev A5How to choose medications to fly As with everything in spaceflight, onboard medications must be chosen with utmost care due to extreme weight and volume constraints, inability to resupply, distance from Earth and shelf -life considerations. Onboard pharmacies are chosen based on many factors, including: Medications known to be safe, effective, and well tolerated, with a wide therapeutic range. Avoid on -board medications that have known intolerable side effects and prefer to use those not requiring refrigeration or other special storage requirements. Prefer to use medications known to be safe and effective for the journey duration. Given longer duration missions like Mars, may need to be flexible with this recommendation. As spaceflight has evolved, so have medication kits. During the Mercury Program, the initial pharmacy kit contained 4 medications to be used for emergency only, later ISS kits contain more than 70 medications. As we plan future flights, especially long duration space flights that have extreme mass and volume constraints, we will use information gathered from historical data, data from risk assessment tools (see page 6), and flight surgeon expertise, to best inform our medication kits. Historical information with the following considerations is used when planning a medical kit: Early space medicine did not include a specific reporting system for medication use. Most historical reporting has been ad hoc and anecdotal, with substantial recall and reporting bias. A 2020 study was implemented that required dose reporting of all medications and demonstrated that there was a substantial loss of medication use data when relying on ad hoc reporting methods. Study data suggests mandatory reporting with user friendly interfaces, may provide data to improve our understanding of pharmacy use and effectiveness. Dose Tracker Study Historically, we had poor capture of medication usage data (which medications, time of use, efficacy, side effects, etc.). Shuttle expeditions 21 -40 had a more standardized medication usage reporting process (improvement from Expeditions 1 - 20). The dose -tracker project data shows a 20-60x increase in reported data points. All data presented are AVERAGE reports per crewmember. Dose tracker trial reporting translated to 3.5 to 4.0 medications used per crew/week and a total of 453 doses of medication.

It does not supersede or waive existing Agency, Program, or Contract requirements. Background 02/21/2023 Rev A6Medication storage and packaging In addition to determining what medications are best to include, NASA must consider other logistical factors when packing medication kits: Considerations for medical kit content Volume Mass Waste (excess packaging) Stability and sterility Storage conditions Pharmaceutical issues -PK/PD toxic metabolites Drug delivery systems ability in space Drug availability -shortages Consider costs associated with mass/storage Astronaut personal medications Vehicle and Suit environmental impacts Onboard personal medical kit Crew is allowed to bring a personal supply of medications or medical supplies. These are referred to as ISS Medical Accessory Kits (IMAKs). The medical team needs to consider this content ahead of time to evaluate any potential medication interactions. Medical kits in -flight factors Shelf life is a driver of medication as expiration is alimiting factor when flying medications. We can only legally pack medications that have manufacturer expiration data. Need to consider time it takes to pack and transport to launch site when considering expiration date. T oxicology considers all medications for active and inactive ingredients as possible toxic exposure. Shipping happens during prelaunch timeframe, need to ensure storage chain requirements are followed. Predict any side effects and interactions, including personal medications. Provide education regarding all medications. Consider administration, absorption, metabolism, elimination, clinical response, toxicity, and effectiveness. Consider any physiological change that can cause medications to work differently. International medications -may need additional information such as education and storage if not familiar . Inventory management \u2014ensure medications are packed to be accessible and designed to best manage expiration parameters. May have multiple medication packs depending on mission design.

It does not supersede or waive existing Agency, Program, or Contract requirements. Background 02/21/2023 Rev A7Drug expiration and shelf Life Medication Expiration poses a big challenge to providers of health care for long duration space flight. Many medications expire within 1 -5 years and without resupply, medication availability and usability is in question. Expiration date The date at which the manufacturer can still guarantee the full potency and safety of the drug when stored under proper conditions. Shelf -life Date determined by drug manufacturers expressed as an expiration date after which time themanufacturer cannot guarantee the stability of potency of the medication. Neither shelf life or expiration date state that medications are harmful if used beyond identified date, and currently there is very little information regarding this topic. One medication, Tetracycline , is associated, but not strongly proven, with potential harm of increased risk of kidney damage (Fanconi syndrome) when used beyond expiration. (see Wegienka et al., 1964 ). History of Expiration Dating In 1979 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration passed the law \" Current Good Manufacturing practice for finished pharmaceuticals, Expiration dating\" 32to ensure people would only use medications that were safe and guaranteed to work as intended under proper storage conditions. This protection also caused some difficulty, The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which stockpiles certain medications in case of emergency, or in the interest of National health, found that they were needing to replace stockpiles of unused medications at significant expense based on expiration dates. Drug name Average extension time Months Morphine Sulfate injectable89(35 -119) Shelf -Life Extension Program (SLEP) Developed by Department of Defense in conjunction with FDA to defer cost of drug waste by studying if drugs can be used beyond expiration. Lyon et al. (2006). The study demonstrated that many medications, when maintained in original and unbroken packaging, may last significantly longer than labeled expiration dates. Testing showed 88% of medication lots have been extended beyond their stated expiration. Stability is unknown and varied between samples of the same drug, manufacturer, and lot. As a result, some government stockpiled medications can be stored beyond there original expirations for emergency use only. A similar study occurred in the UK with the electronic Medicines Compendium ( eMC ), which contained drug information from UK pharmacy companies. Many eMC medication shelf lives were changed by manufactures and extended up to 3 -6 years ( practice is not yet adopted by FDA). Other concerns Some medications may be more susceptible to bacterial growth or loss of stability including nitroglycerin, eye drops, liquid antibiotics, and insulin, and are less likely to qualify for extended shelf life.Source Lyon et al 2006NASA -STD-3001 Technical Brief OCHMO -TB-006Pharmaceutical Care NASA Office of the Chief Health & Medical Officer (OCHMO) This Technical Brief is derived from NASA -STD-3001 and is for reference only.

Background 02/21/2023 Rev A8Radiation effect on medications One of the challenges to long duration spaceflight is the uncertainty of the effect, radiation exposure will have on humans, including how radiation exposure will affect pharmaceuticals in space. During spaceflight, radiation can potentially cause direct or indirect damage to biological cells, so we question if it similarly may damage pharmaceutical chemical and structural composition. Concerns include: will radiation degrade pharmaceuticals reducing the therapeutic effect, or cause release of toxic substances, and will radiation affect the human, so the pharmaceuticals no longer achieve desired results? Example studies Studies of pharmaceuticals exposed to simulated space radiation were found, in some circumstances, to have altered physical structure, alterations of active pharmaceutical ingredient concentration, and similar changes of unclear clinical significance. Some medications were found to have alterations of active pharmaceutical ingredient or physical characteristics, particularly after prolonged spaceflight exposure. Data may be confounded by the fact that pharmaceuticals returned to Earth and data analysis in many cases, occurred after expiration of the medications. See summary graphic below from Blue et al., 2019.

Background 02/21/2023 Rev A9Analog and spaceflight to study medication use Bedrest: bone, cardiac, muscle atrophy Human bedrest studies have been performed to simulate spaceflight conditions on body fluid shifts due tomicrogravity using head down positioning. Bedrest studies introduce elements experienced in spaceflight but do not replicate other conditions including stress or physical demands experienced, they are also limited by small numbers and variable conditions. Medication studies have been used to determine alterations of drug metabolism due to postural changes. Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA): software tracking what medications were used and why. Artificial gravity: induce motion sickness to test efficacy/dose etc. and learn -to-learn protocol. Variable results confirm more data is needed to determine effects spaceflight has on medication efficacy.

Background 02/21/2023 Rev A11Pharmacogenomics The study of how a person's genes affect their response to medications. Medication effectiveness can vary among patients, some will attain the desired effects with no problems while others may have an adverse drug reaction or receive no benefit from taking the medication. One cause of medication reaction variability is the fact that patients can have differences in enzymes which help to metabolize medications into usable products. Patients with enzymes which are more active have increased metabolism and may break down the medication too quickly to be able to work in the manner designed. If the patient enzymes are less active, medication is not broken down quickly enough and patient may be exposed to unexpected chemicals for longer periods of time which can cause adverse or toxic effects. Studies have also found particularly strong variances among specific cultural populations. Pharmacogenomics and Spaceflight Pharmacogenomics information is being studied as it could be helpful when choosing the optimal effective medications to include in each mission medication kit. Pharmacogenomics Study Stengl et al (2014) study explored 78 drugs permanently available on the ISS to determine how much variability the elimination of the medications occurs among crewmembers and would this require individual dose changes in order to prevent therapy failure or exposure to toxic adverse effects. Results: 24 drugs showed metabolism is affected by polymorphic metabolizing enzymes, but not enough evidence was present on how polymorphisms affects drug exposure to predict therapeutic recommendations or dose adjustments to make genetic testing a requirement at this time. Pharmacogenomics Examples Although we do not have enough information at present to base medical kit formula choices on pharmacogenomics, we can still be aware of possible impacts. For example, enzyme CYP2D6 has been studied and found to have significant variability with patients ranging from poor metabolizers, through ultrarapid metabolizers. CYP2D6 is involved in the metabolism of 11 medications currently on the ISS medical formulary including metoprolol, a heart medication, which when taken by poor metabolizers (PM) can lead to symptoms of bradycardia and by ultrarapid metabolizers cause twofold higher clearances, not treating patient's symptoms or disease properly. Pharmacogenomics is new in its use and not standard practice in spaceflight crews at this time but is something being studied for effectiveness for future long -distance spaceflight.

Application 02/21/2023 Rev A12Medication Challenges In-Suit Medication Use Historically, a crewmember would plan to spend no more than 6 hours in a pressurized spacesuit for an EVA and would not need to take medications while in -suit. In future missions, situations may arise that require crewmembers to stay suited for longer periods and take medications while suited. For example: Long duration missions have longer transit times (i.e., return from the Moon can take 144 hours or more). Crewmembers must have the capability to stay suited for long periods of time in the event of unplanned cabin depressurization and ability to take medication if needed. Crewmembers may have much longer EVA capacity or be traveling in an unpressurized rover, requiring them to be suited for long periods of time and need the capability to access medications.[V2 11027] Suited Medication Administration The system shall provide a means for administration of medication to a suited, pressurized crewmember for pressurized suited exposures greater than 12 hours. From: NASA -STD-3001 Vol 2 Medication Delivery Options NASA is studying many options to find the best way to be able to provide medications to suited crewmembers. Providing medication in suits is difficult, for example, injections and oral medications are both options being considered but each have their own unique set of challenges.(below) Toxic Off gassing Another challenge to using medications in space is to ensure that medications, while being stored, used, or broken -down, do not introduce off gassing or toxicity that may be damaging to the crew or vehicle. [V2 6047] Toxic Hazard Level Three The system shall use only chemicals that are Toxic Hazard Level Three or below, as defined in JSC -26895, Guidelines for Assessing the Toxic Hazard of Spacecraft Chemicals and Test Materials, in the habitable volume of the spacecraft. NASA -STD-3001 Vol 2 Injectable Medication Challenges The ability to physically use the medical delivery device at the desired location while the astronaut is gloved and possibly seated is challenging. Not all medications are available as injectables so this method can decrease treatment options. Behavior of the fluid in a off nominal pressure/ temperature environment can make injections difficult, for example, when giving an injectable medication the bubble within a syringe will expand as pressure decreases. Require additional suit opening that can disrupt suit integrity, posing safety risks. Oral Medication Challenges The capability to provide an easily accessible, and administrable delivery of oral medication compatible with a pressurized suit is challenging. Programs are currently considering using hand -held tools to assist with oral pill port type medication delivery which can pose a challenge when the astronaut has a gloved hand. The oral delivery device may be limited in what sizes of pills/capsules it can use limiting medication options. Oral medication can potentially introduce residue contamination. The Air Force U -2 suits had port for food and pills in the hard shell. [V2 11125] Pharmaceuticals, topical treatments and cleaning materials shall be compatible with suit materials (internally and externally).NASA -STD-3001 Technical Brief OCHMO -TB-006Pharmaceutical Care NASA Office of the Chief Health & Medical Officer (OCHMO) This Technical Brief is derived from NASA -STD-3001 and is for reference only.

The suit needed to address additional risks imposed by the longer duration including if a contingency situation required the crew to remain in pressurized suits, they would have to be able to administer an injection while suited in the event of illness or injury. The Apollo Program identified a requirement (see below) for the Apollo EMU to have a biomedical injection patch to facilitate the injection while in a pressurized suit. This patch is no longer in use, however in suit medication administration options are currently being studied. X-ray image of David Clark Apollo A-IC suit.
