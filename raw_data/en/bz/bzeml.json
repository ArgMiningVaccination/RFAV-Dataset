Page 5 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoLanding unexpectedly, we were surprised to find ourselves in Australia; surprised at the grandeur of the coast, the great forests, the hills and flowers; marveling at the stunning birds, at the animals born with a duck's bill and the habit of laying eggs, at the pouched kangaroos everywhere and at the lovable Koalabears that weep real tears when scolded. Most of all, however, we were surprised to remember that way back in a 1911 world wide competition a Chicago architect named Walter Burley Griffin had won a prize of approximately $10,000. The prize was given for the best plan of the projected federal capital for this great fifth continent, to be located far from its coast, from its established metropolitan cities, in what is called the Australian bush. Disembarking at Melbourne for the purpose of seeing that unique national capital, we found, once more to our surprise that, in spite of advertising proclaiming that the town \"is built to the artist's plan\" nobody seemed to know Mr. Griffin, know what he had done or where he was; nor did the citizens other than vaguely know where Canberra was or how to get there, though its precincts are said to contain more than 900 square miles. Page - 2 Motor to City - Finding the railroad journey made awkward by several changes, we finally decided to motor up, seeing the inland country more intimately on our way to this, \"the world's newest, fairest city\" unique in that it had been entirely planned years in advance of building. When after two days of picturesque lonely driving, we approached Canberra, which is the district's aboriginal name appropriately meaning \"meeting place\", we could scarcely see the city for the great amphitheatre of hills in which it sits; and because - in spite of the age of the project - the world war made the cost impracticable and only comparatively few of the projected buildings have been built; but mainly [Note: ==== Beginning of page 2a (table of contents) ====] LUCKNOW UNIVERSITY LIBRARY . FINAL DESIGN . WHERE HE WAS [Note: Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 3 ====] because some joyous benefactor to the entire human race had lined miles of the approaching boulevards and the polygonal intermediate streets of the residential districts with flowering peach, plum, cherry, lilac and mimosa trees. When once the flowering roadways, parks and sports reserves were behind us we found the federal buildings - of temporary materials and construction - good looking and roomily spaced. The Museum of Anatomy, using only a few conventionalized frogs for decorative accents, was the best building infunctional line that I saw in Australia. Page 6 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoReaching Sydney at last by way of a picturesque old gold-mining camp - where somebody once swindled a Chinese into buying a rundown hotel built of bricks made from local mud, from which the artful oriental recovered ten times its cost from the gold dust in its bricks - through the Blue Mountains(truly blue) and the spectacular Jenolan caves, boasting their own geologically indigenous architecture, we learned that Walter Burley Griffin was still in Sydney; that he had acquired a huge tract of rocky virgin land covering three high points along the magnificent harbor, and that he was building Castlecrag - a model suburb. We motored out to Castlecrag but on location only three or four buildings were even partly visible. Ambling along a beautifully shrubbed asphalt road, we found the Griffins' unique concrete home and studio concealed from the road by flowers and foliage, but with magnificent views over shore and harbor from the studio and terrace on the opposite side. Plan Includes Everything - Besides the delightful home studio, the Griffins have their city office in one of the most modern commercial buildings in Sydney, where I found them busy collaborating with aRussian engineer in doing - another surprise - incinerators. Knowing Griffin I was sure there was still another surprise catch somewhere. For this architect, fashioning incinerator containers [Note: ==== Beginning of page 4 (typescript) ====] really means designing tasteful architectural monuments to \"health\", \"sanitation\", \"beauty\", in which are installed great steel machines that dispose of civic garbage without noise, odor, smoke or gas. Havingdesigned the Nation's capital city, designed some of its best theatres, colleges and business structures, created its only truly swank suburb, and completed the circle by furnishing beauty to its most humble civic responsibility, have kept Mr. Griffin very busy and I doubt his being aware that he is probably the only man in the world who has had the opportunity of designing a continent.

What the Gods have given us we are under obligation to share with humanity, with the world. It is for us to free humanity for wealone are free human beings. Only individuals can do this, for the Christ broke up all peoples and races giving the individual spirit, the Ego, the Light, to every man in the world. Democracy is as important as the smashing of the atom. Unless democracy is applied to humanity as a whole the power released in the atom will become demonic and destroy humanity. Only in America has it been experienced. In democracy the Spirit of the human is released as in Atom smashing the Spirit of Matter is released. In this physical experiment the 20th century has fulfilled its basic task with the dual law - that of up and down, inside and outside, force and form - where you can't have one without the other. The reality ofmatter is form and nothing else. The smashing of the atom releases forces, no substances are to be found when form is smashed. The smashing of the atomic form frees the spiritual forces of matter. They are not things that can be weighed and measured except in terms of force. Thus do the Orient and the Occident meet, through America. The reason why America won the war and will win the peace is because the strength and power of the individual is recognized and given full play. The first step was to escape from the rest of the world - the ancient eastern world, Eur-Asia - to establish a community organization in which no individual nor group had power over another, a community whose basic principle is Equity. There are many lovely and wonderful people else- [Note: ==== Beginning of page 6 ====] where in the world but they are helpless. Migration to America frees their spiritual forces. That is the magic of the United States. The founders of the CONGRESSIONAL system smashed the political atom which holds the rest of humanity in bondage. The immediate task of Americans is to go out individually to every part of the world - emigrate instead Page 8 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoof immigrate the watchword - and break down the bondage of individuals everywhere. It is a difficult but not impossible task. It is the task of path-finders. The following is the story of one such American. He found individuals wherever he went who leaped to help him blaze the way in this battle against thePowers. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 7 (table of contents) ====] ELECTRICITY GATE .

Again the busy cram-ful years seemed like leisure days in the light of this driving year into which was crowded a life's experience and a life's work. Few indeed are the architects who have put forth such an amount, such a range, of work with such a richness and variety of design as fruited in this one year. Then a few hours of excruciating agony as an internal organ gave way due to that fall, fighting fire at midnight on the rocks of Castlecrag to which he so willingly sacrificed himself. An operation, a few days of his body's fight for recovery from the wounds inflicted in a brave attempt to overcome the difficulty, with no thought but of recovery in either of our minds, and then the slowing heart, the coma when I poured into his ear the wonder of the life I had had with him; and then he was a free man indeedgoing on to his next task into which one knew he would throw himself with the same ardor with which he had tackled every opportunity of this incarnation, every opportunity to solve the problems for a present civilization. And one knew that he would not ask for easier tasks in his next incarnation but would rejoice in new faculties developed in readiness for tackling harder tasks still on his return. At five in the morning I left the hospital and walked the five miles home, much of it along the river bank, in the cool fresh quiet. As I turned into the gate our Indian gardener came to meet me with questioning eyes. I lifted my hands, for like my mother I always talk with my hands, and said \"He is gone.\" With a startled look he turned and fled. He too had felt the sweetness of the segnor [Note: senor?, i.e., Walter Burley Griffin]. He would not have had the blow fall on him. But a short time before his pretty, gentle little wife had been ill, was possessed as they say. They lived in the service quarters onthe place. Our neighbor in the other half of our palace told us what they were doing. The chanting voice of their physician could be Page 9 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 8 ====] heard all through the night; praying that she should not be taken, that she should not die, that the demon they were exorcising should take someone else, there were so many in the household. The next day she was better. In a few days she was well and Mr. Griffin was gone. One does not say these things do nothappen but one can know that by whatever means the crossing of the boundary came about it was brought about because Mr. Griffin himself had decided that that step should be taken. He will return when he is ready for the next task. The message had come to a busy office asking Griffin to go to India. In asking him for sketches for a library for the Lucknow University, they had suggested that he send them alternative sketches one withthe Indian feeling - the other completely modern. That was not Griffin's way. When the office saw his sketches it was unanimously agreed that in the one design he had met both requirements of his client for the building was thoroughly in harmony with Indian architecture and yet was completely modern. They accepted his design and asked him to come to India. We all agreed that it was high time that Griffin, who never took holidays, should go on a vacation. His young partner, Mr. Nicholls, had come to maturity inall ways and could carry on in the interim in Sydney. Preparations for departure were rushed through and again he ran away from his wife on this new adventure beyond the boundaries. 8 October, 1935 - Castlecrag, New South Wales - Genie darling. Things have been moving swiftly lately, so I'll tell you recent history backward....Today Walt sails for India. Or rather his boat sailed on Saturday, three days ago, and he goes by train to Adelaide to pick it up there. As he says, these havebeen his three days of grace, and ours for we had his help to carry us through the Festival of which more later. [Note: \"Genie\" in the letter of October, 1935, is probably MMG's younger sister, Georgine.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 9 ====]For several months now, there has been a lively correspondence by air mail and cable between Walt and Mr. Alagappan [Note: Alagappan Mudalir], an Indian contractor, who has been doing important work in India for some time and who has now asked Walt to act an architect, consultant, in a building company he has formed. The connection was made through Mrs. [Note: Ula] Maddocks who is tremendously interested in Walt's architecture, and a great barracker for it, and Mr. [Note: Ronald] Craig, her friend and ours, a young man who went to India about three years ago, who has married an Indian girl and has a fine son, a remarkable looking baby. Mr. Craig has raised a beard since he went over there which gives him quite an Oriental look. He is a journalist and an enterprising man. The first outcome of the connection was that Mr. Alagappan consulted Walt re the foundations of a huge Buddhist temple they are building. They are not in sympathy with the Europeanizing of the architecturethere and Walt agrees with them that Indian architecture is a living thing which can't be said of architecture elsewhere in the world except, we think, in Walt's hands. Page 10 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoNext Mr. Alagappan, who has done some building for the Lucknow University, asked him to make sketch plans for a library for the University suggesting two, one Indian, one European. Instead he sent one which looks and feels quite Indian and yet is the last word in modernism. Mr. and Mrs. Nichollsboth worked on the drawings and it was a beautiful set. They were submitted to the Chancellor, a meeting was called and a cable came - \"Plans accepted, come on first boat\" and off he has gone. [Note: \"Barracker\" can mean someone who cheers enthusiastically, especially at a sporting event.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 10b (table of contents) ====] ORIGINAL SKETCH . LUCKNOW UNIVERSITY LIBRARY . FRONT ELEVATION [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on page 10 in the typescript. Placement of theillustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 10 ====] When someone asked him if he was going to follow the Indian style he laughed and said - \"I am going to lead it.\" You don't often get that sort of a remark from Walt but as I said to Mrs. Maddocks, - who bythe way has bought a house here, she and her husband, a musician, and their baby, bouncing 18 months old Deirdre being very pleasant neighbors - he went at that problem as if the future of all India hung on its proper solution. But of course that is the way he tackles all problems. ORIGINAL SKETCH - LUCKNOW LIBRARY [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] We are all tremendously interested in his trip, individually, architecturally and Anthroposophically. It is seldom that a European goes into India at the invitation of an Indian, not just as a social guest but to assist in solving their present problems. Dr. Steiner says it is extremely important that the East, especially India, and the West should come together on terms of mutual understanding and sympathy.No one could be better than Walt from this angle. Miss [Note: Ruth Janet (Lute)] Drummond, who is now the General Secretary of the Anthroposophic Society in Australia, is all excitement over it though we hardly know how we can get along without him here in our new undertakings. It was Walt who in the necessarily united professions of Architecture and Town Planning carried on the work of Louis Sullivan in raising architecture in America and the world to professional standards increative design and in really solving problems. Through such seed the break-away from the bondage to tradition has become an established thing in America and bit by bit we see signs of his work in Town Planning coming to fruition in practice there, the standard for which was set in the Canberra design in 1912 which laid the foundation for community planning. Recently Walt said to me that he had as yet seen nothing done in Town Planning that was not laid down in the Canberra plan, and he was constantlyon the lookout. You will perhaps remember his first words when he received Page 11 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 11b (table of contents) ====] ORIGINAL SKETCH .

These fundamentals are so simple yet almost never put into practice - the simultaneous attack of the problems of distribution and occupation, the one requiring radial thoroughfares wide enough for all kinds of traffic, and the other requiring the complete elimination of acute angles by bringing in the distributive narrower streets at right angles to the thoroughfares. The third requirement is the bringing of the country into the city by making all residential blocks large enough in area to enclose open parks andplaygrounds in their interior thus taking up no street frontage and so being no extravagance. For lack of this our children are degenerating physically, mentally and morally, bringing delinquency and crime. SKETCH - LIBRARY - END ELEVATION [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] Several years ago when prizes were offered for the best solution of the minimum cost house, probably the most difficult architectural problem, all four of the prizes were given to practically exact replicas of a house he had erected while still in Chicago and which was widely published. None of them were quite so perfect as his own. I myself had seen that problem struggled over in various offices of good architects, unsuccessfully, and when I went into his office it was with astonishment that I watchedsolutions drop from his pencil one after another each a perfect little classic and each totally different from the others like the children of different parents. My thrills were similar in Australia. I wish you could see that epoch-making structure - the Municipal Incinerator of Sydney. Lute Drummond and I stood breathless when we first went over to see it. We both saw the angel forces playing around it as if it were a living thing. She stood beside me anddescribed what she saw and it corresponded with what I was seeing. After a 20 year fight here his influence has taken root. Sydney has been spurred by Walt's Melbourne work and really modern buildings are [Note: ==== Beginning of page 12 ====] Page 12 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoappearing, both residential and municipal, even monumental. The time was ripe for him to enter new fields to do the pioneering work the difficulties of which he has the courage and the endurance to face and we see now why he was held here instead of being called back to the United States. The seeds heplants grow, Oceans of love, Marion. 26 September, 1935 - (A letter from Mr. Craig) The peak event of this week was a cable from Mr. Griffin that came yesterday and announced his arrival early in November. Lucknow is the most satisfactory commercial center in India. It is a decent city too in many other respects than its commercial conveniences - personally interesting Indians, fine samples of Moghul architecture, and a municipalitythat is doing more toward a hygenic environment than most of such bodies here. 9 October, 1935, Castlecrag, New South Wales - Dear Walt, Am doubtful of this reaching you at Adelaide so will just drop a line. I can't go in early today as Mr. Nicholls is bringing out that man this afternoon and I promised him a cup of tea. I did not find the Bhagavad-Gita I thought I had, but another, not in poetry, which Mrs. Maddocks must have left here. Am sending it to Perth. The best of alltranslations is that of Dhan Gopal Mukerji. Am also sending the prints in the Home Magazine of our open air production in the valley of \"Iphigeneia.\" I couldn't bear to spoil your happy departure by speaking of the catastrophe of Anna Ickes' death. Aside from the grief at the loss of a very dear friend I feel that an important connection with affairs over there has been broken and that's a great misfortune. But since we can no longer hold the completely unscientific concept of things happening by chance Ifeel that perhaps it was more important that she should be back here toward the close of the century than that she should remain here now. I slept sound last night and I am sure you did. A great stillness seems to have fallen on Australia. Hope this reaches you in [Note: Anna Ickes (1873-1935), social reformer and Illinois legislator, was the daughter of Mary J. Wilmarth (1837-1919), a reformer and suffragist, and the wife of Harold L.

(Hedidn't.) Was there any later train by which you could have reached your boat? Inconceivable! Had a pleasant evening at Anthro with Mr. McDowall in charge. Was sorry you had to start off with the sad news of Anna Ickes' death. I think you should write to Mr. Ickes. Enclosed is my note to him. Miss Drummond and the girls are planning to be out here Sunday afternoon to get started on the Nativity Play in the valley. No sooner through with one than we are on with another. She wants toenrich the play with angel and archangel tableaux and song and instrumental music. I think I have won that thing called a quiet soul. Marion. Enclosed - Dear Mr. Ickes, One's heart stands still with such a shock as that of the news of Anna's death. One turns this way and that to keep from being filled with pessimism at such a catastrophe. We feel we must have some basis for understanding. We are told that this is a critically important century and I find myself saying that important as Anna'swork was here there must be urgent necessity for her to assist in the more critical times toward the end of the century and she has been hurried away so that she may be back for that work. It does not satisfy the heart but it helps us to understand that there is no such thing as chance and that Anna's own will as well as that of the Hierarchies stood ready to make the necessary sacrifices, and we school ourselves to do the same. With love to you and the young folk, Marion. Still carrying on his perpetual fight with Bureaucracy the whole weight of which is always against anything in the nature of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 14 ====] solution of problems or progress, Griffin's first note back was to carry on the struggle to establish a municipality which would safeguard instead of destroying the unique natural beauty of Sydney's foreshores. 12 October, 1935 Perth, West Australia. Dear Alderman Parker, Mr. Palmer Moffat wanted me to give you the enclosed note some time ago but I found no chance to do so at an opportune time when our affairs were under Council's consideration and particularly in the rush of leaving for this sudden professional call to Lucknow. I wanted to talk over thoroughly and answer any of your questions concerning our long relationship to the Willoughby Council with whom we have tried our best tocooperate through considered land planning methods to save for future ages the last remnant of Sydney's once unparalleled harbour in the face of puzzling lack of sympathy and support officially. The vital difficulty is that our plans for preserving the landscape and dedicating the foreshores for public benefit is constantly jeopardized by pressure for cash where there is no cash to squeeze out during a period when there has been no income nor any business, nor hope of disposing of a foot of land fornearly seven years on end. None of our creditors has any intention whatever of carrying on with our plans involving the sacrifice of lookouts, the water frontage and other most valuable parts from which they could most readily realize cash when the demand returns; nor of saving the forests which they have Page 14 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoalready been clearing away in the cases where they have already come into possession. Our acquisition of such parts as \"Castlecrag Cape Estate\" was at great cost and undertaken solely because of the need to save thousands of feet of water front whose subdivision into lots the District Court had, after muchlitigation, compelled the Council to accept with no reservation whatever for public access to the water. The destructive operations were being rushed when I finally intervened paying as much as ten pounds per foot to recover water front lots [Note: ==== Beginning of page 15 ====] already sold, in order that continuous access could be granted. And this reservation was then incorporated in our project submitted to Council. Unfortunately the Valuer General mistook thisdefensive measure as a basis for increased valuation with resultant rates that have accrued at a greater rate than I could in my practice earn money to keep up with, whilst not a foot of the land has been marketable at any price whatever. By merely accepting, in lieu of cash, frontage to the water as valued by the Valuer General, at the present lowest known period, the Council will have benefited by the rates so out of proportion that theycannot be otherwise met except through abandonment and loss of the prospective continuous foreshore reservation for the whole of Willoughby as provided for in the plans of our development. I was able to show Council in 1928 how easily the complete project could be realized with our help when conditions were less propitious generally than they are now or ever can be again. Whatever more I can do in this direction I hope there will be opportunity for me to offer when I return in three months. Yoursfaithfully, Walter B. Griffin. Enclosure - Alderman Parker. The bearer, Mr. Griffin, is a personal friend of mine and his position has been fully ventilated to various aldermen who have promised to see him through. Will you personally interest yourself with Lamb, Thompson and your confreres in adjusting the matter to the mutual benefit of all. I will esteem it a personal favour. L.D. Moffat, 22,1,1935. 14 October, 1935, Castlecrag. Dear Walt, This morning I climbed the gum tree and sawed off the parts that were contacting the four telephone wires. They were growing so beautifully it seemed a shame but the tree doesn't look bad now and the widespreading branches will soon put things entirely to rights I am sure. It seemed like old times to be climbing trees. I was famous for that in my childhood, climbing trees the boys couldn't climb.

What a shame you didn't see Mr. James Alexander Smith. Last night a group of the girls and Miss Drummond as well as Miss Birch and Miss Leeson and afriend from Tasmania came to tea, a sort of party to talk over our triumphs so to speak. Brought me a huge bunch of flannel flowers and I dressed up in my Chinese gown which tickled them all. The Chinese table cover is a constant joy. The children, my baby artists, painted a picture of it Saturday. It'll be a long time before you get this scrawl but such is life when you take to the briny deep. Tonight I go to the Castlecrag Dais. Mr. Stoker has the evening - two plays and a lecture. Miss Crabb was pleasedwith our beloved Pholiota [Note: house] plan. A one room house should suit her as well as it did us in those good old days. Love Marion. 15 October, 1935, Dear Gene, All kinds of things have piled up in connection with Walt's departure and the aftermath of the Festival so will just send on these things. Walt has a three month round ticket but that gives him only one month in India so we are assuming he will extend his visit to stay six monthsanyway. Nicholls' last words to him were \"If there is anything to stay for, why stay.\" and mine were the same. His acting as consultant for a busy organization will not interfere with his practicing privately any more than his work with the Federal Capital did. There is no telling what may develop. Tell Clarmyra the finger paints arrived all right. Many thanks.

Of this latter Isobel Grey wrote as follows:- \"Mr. and Mrs. Burley Griffin have established at Castlecrag, Middle Harbour, the most beautiful little theatre conceivable. Adventure is the keynote of the evening and you experience aquickening thrill of excitement as you take the winding road in Castlecrag that leads down to the Haven Scenic Theatre - and the Past. It is a dark, narrow road out into the deadly stillness, and menaced on Page 16 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoeither side by overlapping ti-scrub. You feel apprehensively that the road might lead anywhere - that anything might happen in this strange place with only the stars for witness. But the mood is gone when you turn a bend and come upon other cars parked and groups of people making their way to the seats,with subdued laughter. Flares are lit here and there behind the tall trees so, from where we are, only the sparks that every now and then fly out into the darkness are visible. Gracious gums with the stars caught in their hair watch calmly and serenely, so wise in their ancient knowledge that has grown into leaves and branches, from seed to seed, forever nourished by the winds blowing in from across the sea. Now everything is hushed as from the Temple steals a strain of music, wild and sweet and haunting,that seems to hold in the rise and fall of every drawn-out note a sad lament for things that are no more.\" Where a path down the East slope of the valley forks to the South and North is the Prometheus Rock where that mighty Being poured out his defiance of the Gods and his message to man giving him the gift of anger, the fire through which he could learn to reenter the realms of spirit; up from the moonlit water below, the dragon bearing Oceanus wound its way to the middle terrace above Prometheus, andfrom above, the Oceanides swept down in splendid formation. Always the choruses were handled not in fixed forms as in the architectural settings of the usual outdoor or Greek theatres, but liquid, or sweeping like a breeze across the valley to form, with the principals, ever new [Note: ==== Beginning of page 18 ====] superb mural decorations in composition with the exquisite texture of tree and rock and shrub, inconceivably beautiful. Sometimes all silver and green as the Oceanides who swept down to share the fate of Prometheus to be sunk, with him and the rock to which he was bound, into the depths. Sometimes the all gold and blue of the angelic hosts. Sometimes all colors - lavender and blue, gold and scarlet, green and rose and purple, floating iridescence, with beauty such as we find in the works of Botticelli and Giotto before which we stand still and breathless. For it was not the beauty of our modern spectacles but the shining of the souland spirit through the exquisite form and movement of our young people who had at last found a means of expressing their true natures, supported by all the elemental beings whose recognition by humans was at last freeing them from their bondage. 21 October, 1935. Castlecrag. - The little Chinese rug is a constant joy and I love to tell everybody that it was your parting shot. Am having a great thrill feasting off our own loquats. Every morning I gather adozen big ones. So far my eating expenses are nil. The girls bring out so much Sundays when they come to rehearsals that I live on it the rest of the week. Went to the dentist yesterday. Though I haven't been for over a year he didn't find anything to do except clean them. With an air of resignation he said they were strong teeth and would last me my lifetime. I fancy he may not have counted on that decision of ours to live for a hundred and fifty years - only way to get through what we have undertaken. This afternoon I went to Ivor's party - 4 years old. Fourteen infants from 2 to 6 years of age and as many grown ups. The little long table was brilliant with all sorts of colored dainties and the children thrilled to bits. Stewart, the two year old, was not allowed to have lemonade. After the banquet hall was vacated he was found sitting at the head of the table with Page 17 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 19 ====] a tumbler fairly well filled held in both hands and with every look of an inebriate saying:- \"Drink it up, drink it up, drink it up.\" Marion to Walter Burley 25 October, 1935 - S.S. Mongolia - Dearest Marion, Your letter to the boat in Adelaide was forwarded and reached me at Perth. When I read your letter I marveled at your restraint at the parting, realizing your deep affection for Anna. So far as my connection with Government is concerned we have had enough to realize that the less we have of it the better for our welfare and usefulness. Our Karma is in the opposite camp surely. I enclose my letter to Mr. Ickes which I hope he will take in the right spirit. The wild flower season was on in Perth so I walked from the interesting University buildings back to Perththrough the open forest, largely banksias. The main impression was that given by the scarlet Kangaroo Paws in patches of acres in extent. The species of bush flowers are different but chiefly of the same genera as at Castlecrag but on the whole the bush was no more floriferous and far less attractive in the formation and freedom from disheveled and weedy growths than is Castlecrag. From the Leschnaultia biloba in the shops I realized that there were sky blue heaths to be seen in other directions on the sandhills but I did not have time to seek them out. Though approaching the size of Adelaide, Perth is by no means so dignified and gives the impression of rawness and newness which will disappear sometime when the advantage of a waterfront site, much like Canberra with the lakes, is realized. Mr. Davidson, the State Town Planner on whom I called, is fully aware of the similarity and the possibilities and is using his strong influence toward directing the officialarchitectural development onto the Perth Water Terraces where formal reclamation parkways are being formed all across the city area. I was glad to get confirmation, from his experience, of my objectives for New South Wales Town Planning Legislation especially empowering [Note: ==== Beginning of page 20 ====] private owner groups to become Responsible Town Planning Authorities independent of and as a protection against demoralizing Municipal Councils and other political units. If it fits in with my convenience on the return visit to Perth, Mr. Davidson wants to bring the Premier to Fremantle to give me an official welcome which might work out to the ultimate advantage of both of us as Town Planners.He is the one who got me to send him an exhibition of our architectural work in 1930 which he displayed in spite of the determined opposition of the Perth architects whom also he has sized up fairly well. The Mongolia was due to leave Fremantle at 8 P.M. but when I got on board then there was a telephone call from a newspaper reporter who had a consignment from his editor to interview me. Since the ship did not actually leave until 9 P.M. he came out by car 12 miles and discussed various andsundry matters while I ate my dinner. Don't apprehend any more of these garrulous effusions once I get ashore. Lovingly your worser half. Walter Burley Griffin 22 October, 1935 - S.S. Mongolia - Dear Mr. [Note: Harold L.] Ickes, The news of Mrs. Ickes death Page 18 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoreached Australia only just as I left on this voyage of extension of my architectural fields to India. Only in thinking of what my own wife means to me, the Marion Mahony of whom Anna Wilmarth had been such a friend and benefactor, can I appreciate how tragic is this loss to you. Religion hardly softens sucha blow because faith has so little validity any more. As a compensation however we are beginning to meet evidence of wide-awake contact with life forces themselves so that human understanding can be and is being extended for the making of an actual science out of those mysteries that must always baffle physical science but whose existence need not on that account be denied. Oriental life has always been actuated by a sublime spiritual consciousness that Occidentals are weaned away from, but the formerhave consequently a more realistic acceptance of death which only a future understanding can restore to us;- the comprehension of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 21 (table of contents) ====] THE CHUTTER MANZIL [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript.

In such a light I am satisfied that Mrs. Ickes' important life may be seen continuing along with preparation for even greater future activity, Sincerely, Walter Burley Griffin THE CHUTTER MANZIL - LUCKNOW [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] caption 27 October, 1935 - Colombo, Ceylon - The artificial lake is the outstanding feature of the last RoyalCapital as is the case with the center of most of the ancient Capitals whose plans were magnificent conceptions taking every advantage of every natural feature. 30 October, 1935 - Perfect weather has continued in Ceylon. On landing Wednesday I made first for the native city where I got my ice-cream suit, etc. and thereafter landed in Fremjee House, a guest house on the fringes of the Cinnamon Gardens district which is a very beautiful suburb 3 miles out. The house isan old Parsi mansion facing the ocean. It is run by two English women one of whom, Miss Sheppard, started it in opposition to the two huge hotels 15 years ago. Room, private bath and meals but $3.00 a day. I have done the Cingalese and Mohammedan sections and skimmed the Botanical Gardens. With exclusively local government in the City and virtual local control in the State Government, with only a casting vote of the British Governor General in the nativelegislature, all the administration is manned and managed by the Cingalese who are more apt than the Europeans in learning in the schools and who have qualified themselves in English Universities for all Page 19 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe professional positions. Of course that does not make the government better (only the separation of the three functions can do that) than they were before any more than woman suffrage in Australia did but it must, of course, make the governing less objectionable. This island is astounding with 7,000,000 inhabitants (equal to the total population of Australia) on 60,000 square miles, and about 7,000 altogether of European derivation. It is far more adequately [Note: ==== Beginning of page 22 ====] equipped with sumptuous public buildings of all sorts than is any Australian State, also with public services, hospitals and welfare institutions of all kinds including incineration. The wages so far as I can judge amount to $0.50 a day where they get any, but expenses for them are almost proportionally low,and need of shelter and clothes almost negligible. Except for a few red brick essays of the time of Victoria it seems impossible for the builders, native or English, ever to have done so badly in any class of buildings as the British have perpetrated in the Colonies of America or on the Pacific Ocean in every class of building. As I had suspected, the prototype of those neo-classic houses in Melbourne that attracted me so much is here also - of that back-block type of Australia's oldest house, that of McArthurat Paramatta. Nothing therefore in Architecture originated in Australia! The walled suburban lanes of residential places with truly tropical verdure are as attractive as any suburbs I have ever seen anywhere but the houses of the Europeans are apt to be out of key. The roads are everywhere consistently good and the aesthetic standard as to electric wiring is distinctly superior to that allowed by the Sydney Municipal Council. Mr. Craig is coming to Bombay to meet me which will make things very pleasantand easy. 29 October, 1935 - Castlecrag - Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin - Mrs. Maddocks is apparently seeing to it that I do my wifely duty in writing to you for she has just rung to say she is bringing a note of hers up the hill to enclose in mine. She hasn't had the long training I have had re long distance calls, etc. so is assuming that wives' letters are worth the air mail shilling even if there is nonews to forward. Miss Drummond is sending out notices of three lectures on the Four Ethers to be given by me Wednesdays in November, and Mrs. Lemaitre was so overwhelming in her enthusiasm about the diagrams I am using for my talks at the Michaelmas Festival that I wouldn't dare appear without diagrams so I am doing those of Wasmuth's first volume [Note: Ernst Wasmuth's \"Ausgefuhrte Bauten und Entwurfe\" of Frank Lloyd Wright]. It will make the talks easier. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 23 ====] Here comes Kaaren. Since she has been barred out of kindergarten because of chickenpox, she usually makes four or five calls on me daily. Her mother has just about gotten used to it by now. She is busily wiping her feet on the mat. Such proprieties you never did see in a three year old. The first Gita eveningwas very interesting. Miss Beale gave a lovely story of the birth of Krishna from Schure's \"Great Initiate\" and last Sunday's Anthroposophic evening here was very interesting too. Birch and Leeson again brought their New Zealand friend who brought me a box of chocolates, and the Hunts bringing Mrs. Badham, the Williams \"pear\", Bim and Roma and young Mrs. Hilder and Sheppard. They all Page 20 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoseemed much interested. Bim certainly does make understanding remarks. Mr. Tierney turned up with a wife and is contemplating building a house down on their lot. Kaaren now knows the whole process of a letter going by mail to India. I am going to your old Culture Society thisevening. Such a nuisance. I shan't know anybody I ought to know. Kaaren who is still perched at the drafting board beside me says I'd better not send her love to Mr. Griffin as her mother might be wanting it. Saturday evening Mr. Morton at the Neighborhood Group gave an interesting talk on the romance of Ritual. Saw Bergner in \"Escape Me Never.\" She is a great actress though she hasn't the voice of a Bernhardt. Are these same pictures running in India? It's worth seeing though you wouldn't get the samekind of satisfaction out of it that I did. It's the story of a genius and his gypsy wife!!! The Morton's lost out on getting the Cheong house [Note: for the Rev. Cheong Cheok Hong] and they deserved to with their silly dickering. Friends of the Johnston's have taken it. Mr. Morton said he is doing good business with the Anthro books and will have to be getting more of them. The bush party at the Willis's (The Castle on Castlecove) for charity to which the Deans took me in their car was a great success. Streams of people, lovely day, everybody pleased and satisfied, hundreds of people and in the end some 50 people turned back without coming down when they saw the long line ahead of them and the slow movement.

There was a large crowd down to meet the Australian cricketers. I was a one man team to meet a one man team and our greeting was considerably the more extensive in time and intensity. Before midnight we were sitting in chairs to review the present situation of theuniverse, - Steiner or Krishnaji? We got away from them both. It was Walter Burley Griffin and an aggressive delighted listener. A moment later the deck hands were making a preliminary survey for their mop work. On the nearest clock tower that moment proved to be five hours. I went to my hotel near the wharf and turned in an hour before sunrise. Three hours later I went down to the boat again. We got through the customs and walked along to my hotel. Here we resumed our discussion which theabsurdity of sleep had interrupted. But after a couple of hours a conscience clutched me. A builder of cities was sitting under an indoor punkha when the jabberwocky panorama of Bombay was futilely beckoning to him. So we got up and went to Cooks on my bashful initiative. During the stroll around Page 21 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothere Bombay had its chance but it never looked a winner. The things on which India's second largest municipality prides itself were accepted as the bread and butter of architectural diet. The sweets of the meal were castigated as unwholesome and nasty. But the genius of the pont was still shameless as wewalked into the tourist bureau. Behind the counter was a clerk in charge of railway bookings. For a minute we sat and feigned interest in his time-table researches. Then some decorative posters suggested how Muslim monotheism had tortured the fecundity of Hindu poly-cum-monotheism. It was a great cultural opportunity for the clerk too but he spent the next one and a half hours in a comfortable [Note: \"Steiner\" refers to Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), the founder of the Anthroposophical Society; \"Krishnaji\" is a name commonly used to refer to Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895-1986), who was for a time associated with Annie Besant (1847-1933) and the Theosophical Society.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 25 ====] reverie on the pretext that Cooks paid him to give clients their head. Meanwhile I plucked the strings of the harp with clumsy conversational fingers while the unmanageable instrument nevertheless yielded a smooth and steady melody of thought. (My prompt notes were from \"One and Many\" to be found in\"Do What You Will\" whose author, Aldous Huxley, was anathema to the harp. So does the violin chafe against the bow.) Bombay lay all uninspected, choked up with cheap pride, as we hurried back to be last for lunch at the hotel. The waiter served us with everything on a sufficiently extensive menu. We told him we were vegetarians but he must have thought we would never be fanatical about such matters as I recall dallyingwith fish and chicken bones. I am not sure now what was digesting within us as we went to the lift for upstairs and our bedrooms, connected by a common bathroom. We veered into one of these rooms and I was the little artisan helping the masterbuilder to erect ever more permanent theses when a waiter tried to thrust us in twain with an afternoon tea-tray. We pacified this irritant intruder in the easiest way by consuming what he had brought. This kept the body going for another listening bout of a quarter of a tinof cigarettes' duration. An unseen Bombay was growing dark. We were establishing our next thesis in a bus bound for Malabar Hill and the master builder took his eye off the work to make some unmalicious but wholly unappreciative comments on the environment sliding by. From the foot we walked to the top of Malabar Hill and looked down on the lights of the city. What had been ignored or had produced indifference nowreceived a verbal caress or so which it should have valued had it known the real authority of the one who gave them. But the talk turned to the peculiarities of clients and the necessity of chastening their unaesthetic ambitions and giving them what they really wanted without their knowing it. We were, not unnaturally, the last to commence dinner after we had found a bus to carry a continuing conversation back to [Note: ==== Beginning of page 26 ====] its hotel site. Page 22 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoNext morning we made a mock inspection of Victoria Gardens. But while the masterbuilder had seemed blandly unaware of buildings without meaning, about 'birds and beasts and flowers' - particularly the last - he was singularly perspicacious and I tried to learn a pack of relative facts concerning the flora ofthe land I had loitered in unobservantly for over a couple of years. On this Sunday afternoon we took a boat across the harbour to the island that has the Elephants caves on whose walls are Hindu sculpturing. Bombay's Harbour won golden opinions and the city should have blushed a little at praise it had been unable to earn the previous day. In the caves I found the richest aesthetic satisfaction I have found in India. To my instructor they were not this but something that contained many of the rudiments of goodarchitecture. I remember that his camera shutter clicked a lot and that has since proved a sure sign of his favouring appraisal. I could have written this letter about those sculpture pieces but my reader (assuming that she has borne with me to this point) must be told more of Walter Burley Griffin's response to India. Dear Vishnu! but Walter Burley Griffin has seen things! We have had phenomenally good luck. In five or six days there has been a feast that I believe would exhaust the digestive powers, nay, shatter thegravity, of any living architect that I can imagine other than him. If I had his perception of the whole architectural significance I should be suffering from high blood pressure in the region of the mind. But he is sitting at the same table, filling my pad with a pen, and within coo-ee of an unexamined New Delhi which will presently be submitted to the closest and most balanced scrutiny that will have occurred in its life. What has happened between Delhi and Bombay I can't describe now. If it had been less eventful Iwould have had a shot at it, but as it is I can only enumerate. We left on Sunday last from Victoria station in Bombay with the [Note: \"Coo-ee,\" a call, shout, or greeting (sometimes implying a sense of distance), can mean \"in easy reach of\" or \"very near to.\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 27 (table of contents) ====] THE TAJ MAHAL .

Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 27 (typescript) ====] idea of going to Agra. On Monday night at Khansi we marked that the next stop would be Gwalior. Mr. Griffin looked edgy and infinitely acquisitive about the name. I remembered that Malati Patwharden's sister, a school friend of Komalam's, is the wife of the principal of a college there for princes. I had a chat with the station master and as a result of his information we broke our journeying and camped in the waiting room for the short balance of the night. In the early morning I rang the Fort and got on to Pierce, the school principal. He was the best host we could possibly have had. He is keenly interested inarchitectural values, knew the worth of what he was living amidst and steered us well. When he saw us off at night he was under the spell of Walter Burley Griffin. His wife, Ansuya, was the Page 23 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofirst specimen of unsophisticated but effortlessly cultured Indian womanhood that Walter Burley Griffin had met and it was a good meeting. There was also a young Bengal artist whose work I drank in very hungrily, and who won more terse valuable appreciation from my senior companion also. The glories ofGwalior are not for this letter but I believe that they will stand out in anything that he is writing. The next piece of architecture that we inhabited was the second class waiting room at the Agra Cantonment station. We were in it for a sleeping night and Walter Burley Griffin approved its structure with slight occasional snores, while I smoked and thought. THE TAJ MAHAL . photographed by EWING GALLOWAY [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] TAJ - I looked inquiringly at him after the first long glance. \"It is not to be criticized,\" he said. But I could write a letter on what he did say. I now felt that I could discuss the Taj with more pith borrowed from him than anyone I am likely to meet for some time yet. But you must take it as read without myeven suggesting it here. The Agra Fort again proved to be a collection of marvels. But I was at the side of sane, deliberate, cautious approval. From Agra on Wednesday we went to Akhbar's abandoned capital, Fatephur Sikri, and again used a station waiting room as a hotel. But before we slept [Note: ==== Beginning of page 28 ====] the khansame made us some food and waited up for our return as we circulated parts of the city in the moonlight. There were jackals amongst the ruins which were very little decayed - only empty.Everything in it brought the swiftest pleasure to Walter Burley Griffin who found it an intelligently planned city of beautiful ingredients. On our return he seemed to sleep very well on what he had seen. We spent the bulk of the morrow's daylight in the city. He was tireless and brought the total of camera exposures up to 80 since landing. After five hours of inspection in an only moderately lenient sun, I sped for retreat to a refreshment house. We had had tea and biscuits and nothing since. He said:- \"Withage it is the eyes that hamper one (He was looking at a guide-book plan of the city) but with youth it is the tummy.\" I parried with - \"But my hindrance can be remedied.\" And so it was. But he was dreaming of town-planning for Akhbar while he drank his tea. And we got up to spend three more hours seeing what has been done in that way. I enjoyed them all, but in him it touched a conscious depth that I cannot unclose. We got back to Agra at night (last night) under a three quarter moon. The spell was on us foran hour and a half and then we walked forcibly out of it. Where to? A cinema show. The Begum's tomb floated behind the screen. Why indeed is Bing Crosby? During the day we had seen a city charged with art in every quarter. And here was a man singing a babyish squall as though it too had a faint savour of art. The pretense was too thin, but the egregious Bing went right on full of an asinine sincerity that is bred only a long way to the West. There was a girl in the film supposed to be a princess but she wasreally a mannequin without knowing it, a mannequin's soul, body, clothes and acting art. I smoked the program through in I hope not too sullen a contempt. I believe there is no art with such infinite possibilities as the cinema, but at present it is a slobbering babe.

Ronald Craig to Ula Maddocks THE GLORIES OF LUCKNOW - TOMBS & DILKUSHA [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustrations found on the preceding page were intended to be placed here.] 8 November, 1935 Delhi. - from Walter Burley Griffin - Marion dearest. The Vice-Chancellor of Lucknow University had suggested to Mr. Craig that I might see things on my way so we have only this morning reached our last way-station here. The journey has been just one succession of thrills. Bombay, the most enterprising of Indian Cities, did not excite much sight-seeing on my part after having sat up yarning with Mr. Craig on the Chitral until 4:30 A.M. Saturday. So we did not do much but use our tram and bus excursions around town for continuing our conversations. Sunday however we spenton a boat excursion to the ancient rock temples of Elephanta which are on an island in the wonderfully beautiful Bay of Bombay which is of the character and equal in charm to anything we saw in the South Pacific tropics, and wholly unspoilt. The old Hindu sculpture is stately and the architectural ensemble grandly impressive and refined as well. These smaller caves were so satisfactory that I left for some other time the greater ones at Ellora (Architecture) and Agunta [Note: Ajunta] (Painting) which wouldhave required lengthy side trips taking several days. Routed via Agra and Delhi we made our first stop-over after a night and a day on the train passing through rich and varied country both jungle and cultivated, the latter with black soil and endless cornfields (maize) verily like Illinois. That stop-over was a tremendous sensation, the vast Hindu fortress and palace of Gwalior, deserted except for the school of an Englishman married to a Brahminwho were known to Mr. Craig, the only other Englishman similarly married and with offspring. The Pearces took us into their modified Indian home life on this citadel, and the perfect day was all too short for the several temples and vast palaces of the lofty battlemented plateau. Besides these there were innumerable carvings in the pink sandstone cliffs (just like those of Castlecrag) and these were [Note: ==== Beginning of page 30 ====] Page 25 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoof the ancient Jain culture and quite distinct from Hindu sculpture, free-standing human figures of a form and severity like Egyptian and ranging from diminutive to colossal, 40 feet at a guess. The next sensation, after another night on the train and in station waiting-rooms with the most successful rubber bed, was the Taj Mahal in the morning sun-light. To me this was no less breath-taking than to any devotee who has ever sung its praises, and quite independent of the fact that, architecturally, I could see many things that should have been altogether different. The pure fresh sparkling crystalline Italian marble, like white Angaston, South Australia, or Georgia, U.S.A., with the delicious graded shadows of its vast rounded concave and convex niches and domes present a perennially youthful spiritto the soul. A day later - Last night after a stroll of an hour and a half on the terraces, daises, lawns, parterres and water gardens; and amongst the luxurious and heavily scented trees, and in the moonlight, we found some particular points of view that met every requirement of the architectural imagination even. One of these was from the inner side of the base of a corner minaret putting the multiple arches between themassive pylons and eliminating the neck-like drum of the dome. Another was from the trees at one side of the vast Persian Garden where the general proportions of the monument were masked and the imagination allowed to form a vast Arabian concept. Another was looking across the central marble platform of the garden with the eye exactly level therewith so that a long marble stylobate was added to the foreshortened Mahal together with its four minarets. Unfortunately none of these aspects could everbe photographed even in the daylight. But they served to show how no merely architectural considerations of static balance of forces could apply to the \"most beautiful building in the world.\" The vast castle palace of Agra where the Hindu architecture of [Note: A \"stylobate\" is the platform on which columns rest, the 'floor' of a temple.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 31 ====] Gwalior had been translated into Islamic terms contemporaneously was a whole tour of India in itself but Wednesday had also other things for us. We had afternoon \"tiffin\", Indian fashion, in the home of one of the patriots who has spent altogether ten years in jail with lesser terms for all his family as well as another of the martyrs who was present. Then we went by train to the Fatephur Sikri [Note: Fatehpur Sikri] and after an hour's ride were able to explore in the moonlight and suddenly come upon the vast pyramid of steps leading to the mighty arch portal of the Jami Mashid behind which for miles extendedthe virtually intact palatial section of the completed Moghul Capital City of the Emperor Akbar in the 16th Century. Though the only inhabitants at that time of day were jackals whom we both heard and saw, we were soon followed in by two would-be guides from the Fatephur village lying in front of and below the city. We left before midnight because of their warnings that the jackals would thereafter be in packs, but the impression of splendor and vastness of the red sandstone city thus gained was onlyenhanced by the explorations during the whole of the following day through agoras, caravansaries, fortifications, waterworks, innumerable vaulted and elaborately decorated baths, stepped terraces, five storied pavilions, successive enclosed colonnaded and arcade courts, walls, water gardens, mosques, minarets, galleries, balconies, passageways, and the public and private quarters of the Mogul, his Queens, Courtiers, Nobles and followers elaborately carved, inlaid and screened with delicately filigreed Page 26 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagostone panels. Equally elaborate were enormous stables for their horses, and still more extensive the housing of camels and elephants, throughout with floors and roofs as well as walls of dressed red sandstone. How altogether pusillanimous, puny was the effort of the Civilization of Australia toward a Continental Capital compared with this perfectly conceived and as perfectly completed monumentally, and then [Note: ==== Beginning of page 32 ====] replaced with another in a fraction of the time consumed by merely talking about Canberra. But those were the energetic times of Elizabeth whose ambassador was at Fatepur-Sikri [Note: Fatehpur Sikri]. I am taking advantage of 24 hours delay in the Air Mail to get this interim impression across to youwithout benefit of the carbon copy the tablet for which is just now buried in the inaccessible recesses of the bag in the cloak room as a result of reshifts to facilitate our side excursions. Lovingly your minus half. Walter. 12 November, 1935 - Lucknow. - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin - It would be quite impossible to keep minutes on my carbon pad of a fraction of the impressions I have gained thus far inIndia. They would be abstracted to the degree of platitudes. However I think most of them are deep enough to keep until I get home. Though my contacts are quite superficial and the difference of language sets up an effective barrier yet I believe I already feel more at home with these people than I was for many years in Australia, and the soldiers seem to be the only antipathetic ingredient. We arrived here Monday morning after three days in Delhi of the same perfect conditions that have obtained throughout the trip, and were met by Mr. Alagappan at the station. This hotel which I hope to leave today for a more economical boarding house, is only less luxurious than the Swiss Hotel where we stopped one day or so at Delhi. The private rooms are arranged around U shaped garden court yards and consist of two stories of arcaded verandas with lounge bed room in front and dressing room and modern bath room at the back. In Delhi there were four rooms in each suite and the luggage wasdelivered into the dressing room at the back. The modern sections of all these cities are parklike areas of magnificent distances, tree-vaulted avenues, walled or balustraded gardens acres in area, with stepped balustraded flat roofs on massive plastered walls with rich arched and linteled decorative openings and grills usually tinted a delightful ecru with white trim. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 33 ====] \"New Delhi\", which might better be called X Delhi for it is the tenth new Capital City of India in this same locality in as many centuries, two Hindu, six Muslim, two British, is the newest of the cities such as I have described, with more uniform and Roman character of buildings, and with roadways with great lawn parkways and handsome avenue trees of selected types of considerable variety, mostlyunfamiliar to me. It is almost perfectly flat but planned with many monumental terminal vistas and has already attained completeness and finished elegance though there is of course much construction work going on in the business and residential sections. Page 27 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe long wide walk with reflecting canals and many fountains and the governmental terrace with vast stone buildings and several domes and extensive colonnades effectively massed is essentially Roman even to the togas of the statues of the Viceroys despite the efforts to supply local color in all the details.Except for the luxuriant verdure of the avenues however the pre-European capitals, the ruins of which extend continuously for some thirteen miles in each direction, must have been even more magnificent and certainly more imaginative and romantic, and the more ancient they are the more architecturally satisfying. The landscape is studded with domes of ancient temples and tombs amongst the terraces and castle walls in all stages of decrepitude. Much of the latest and most refined Mohammedan architecture is in and around Delhi, still well preserved. The rather small walled city is overcrowded, perhaps specially so because of the intensive building activity of the late years at Delhi, and its bazaars or narrow streets are squalid. Lucknow on the other hand is largely a modern city with amply wide streets and more substantial stuccoed buildings throughout. The older part along the river dating from the eighteenthcentury is now, after the Sepoy Rebellion [Note: Indian Rebellion of 1857], marked only by elaborate mosques and palaces whose style compared with earlier [Note: ==== Beginning of page 34b (table of contents) ====] NUCLEUS PLAN OF LUCKNOW UNIVERSITY [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript. Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 34 ====] Moghul is like Rococo compared with Renaissance. The University is on the site of one of these rulers' palaces with some remnants preserved as historic monuments. Wide open and parklike spaces mark the sites of the old bazaars or commercial areas. The present city extends for miles to the southward andcontains some recent ambitious but uninteresting buildings such as the Legislative Assembly, the Post Office and some Cinemas by our acquaintance of the visit to London, Mr. Lanchester. One of the large hostels of the University is also by him but undistinguishable from the other buildings which are identical in character with Channing College as illustrated in [Note: James] Fergusson's \"Indian Architecture\" or \"Modern completely without interest. Graceful bulbous domes are everywhere throughout the University proper and the more elaborate Medical Department some miles down the river. In fact domes and minarets play the same part in the landscape around here that \"eggs and darts\" play in Renaissance buildings. I struck a couple of holidays on arrival so have not yet got down to tin tacks on the library but at the moment I am studying the whole problem of the future of the University for the purpose of a general plan to see if I cannot meet theobjections to the original site which are grounded on fear that the space will be needed for future extension of the Laboratories of the science buildings. I am installed with table in the Physics Building and quite probably may have to make a change in the design for our building since the first one is quite unsuitable for the alternative site.

Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin. Have planted the cypress in front of the shop. The ground is well soaked now and if the rains continue frequent for a while it ought to do well. [Note: Henry] Pynor (one of the Australian youths who early joined our office now back from America and Russia) turned up at the office yesterday with his wife and two year old daughter. He is planning to go to Melbourne in a few days. Nicholls thinks the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 35 ====] pseudo-boom of six months has dwindled to practically nothing. There has been no let-up in the destructive forces of government so I don't see how there could be any real turn for the better. However Pynor hopes to get started through his father's clientele and of course slum building continues. He landed in Perth just after you had passed through. Said there was quite a bit of comment in the papers about what you had said. Nicholls in telling it said evidently you had stirred up quite a hornets' nest. My lecture on the evolution of the earth from the condition of Warmth to Solidity went well last night. I actually didn't leave out all the interesting points. At least half the people there were unknown to me. Mrs. Walker said it was an inspiring evening. Mrs. Lightband, who is inclined to be antagonistic toward her husband's interest in Anthroposophy, was there and Miss Drummond told me she said she began to realize there was something she could learn there, etc. I am to give two more, next Wednesday and theone following. Thursday evening there was a Castlecrag prenuptial welcome party at Johnston's to Mr. Stoker and his fiancee Phyllis. Everybody has been saying \"What a jolly party it was,\" the Johnstons themselves, I think, being quite amazed that it could be so without booze. I supplied the ice-cream. Mrs. Maddocks came up shortly after your letter from Delhi arrived and we read it together and thought it most wonderful. With a guide like Mr. Craig your opportunities are exceptional. Moonlight! You'llremember that's the way I first saw Rome and Venice with Gerald [Note: MMG's brother]. This helps me to picture what you are experiencing. A dreadful thing has happened at Castlecrag. Little six year old Charles Morton died yesterday. Taken sick Thursday evening, he was taken to Dr. Rivett's hospital at midnight. Not sure of his diagnosis Dr. Rivett called in another doctor. They operated and found the bowel had pushed through a rupture and would not function, poisons had accumulated and weakenedthe Heart and he did not recover. I had a curious dream Thursday [Note: ==== Beginning of page 36 ====] night which I mulled over for some time because it seemed as if it must have some significance. After I learned what had happened I felt sure it must have been in the nature of seeing into the future which aswe know does not break down the fact of free will. I saw a great burden of blackness fall on a group of human beings and they went down under it like ninepins. And then a cry went up over the death of children as if that was more than could be endured, perhaps the heaviest burden one could have to bear. Page 29 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoMiss Drummond had a letter from the West Australia Anthros. On her advice the twelve members have resigned from the St. John group of Sydney and have formed a West Australia Group under the leadership of Mr. Gianoni. They were very disappointed not to see you en route and want to be surelynotified when you are returning, but you'll be coming back by the way of Java won't you? I think it would be silly of you not to and for goodness sake don't be silly. Thursday Bim Hilder and Roma Hopkins are to be married in a little chapel in the Scout's reserve no one but the parents attending. I am invited to the reception at Roma's mother's in the evening. They are a lovely couple. Bim will be building a home in Castlecrag next door to Tilly's. He is using your Jones two level plan. Am glad you are thechampion adventurer. Marion 20 November, 1935 - Lucknow. - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin - The librarian who is also Professor of Physics, Dr. Wali Mohammed, introduced the only practicing architect in Lucknow, a young Muslim who was so promising as material that Lanchester got him to go to England where he obtained his degree at Glasgow University with honors in Town Planning. He lectures two hours eachday in his father's Engineering School here and carries on a practice of several hours a day more or less, all around these United Provinces. All his conventions are of Indian and Muslim forms and, though, from the work he showed me, he is obviously a capable and imaginative planner, he makes little effort to put any [Note: ==== Beginning of page 36b (table of contents) ====] DWELLING .

Sometimes he makes full plans and specifications but for the most part he makes what we would call sketch plans and leaves the client to his own devices to get them built. That is how he accomplishes his immense turnover. His progenitors have been engineers and builders and his whole family have earned distinction of one sort or another in these lines, following his father who was chief engineer for one of the Indian railways before he retired to his School for Overseers of Construction.

Sand comes from a distance and so does stone, hence brickwork in cement mortar is laid and reinforced in the same way as concrete even to two-way reinforcing of slabs. Brickwork in ordinaryhouses is laid in mud. Plastering of walls and roofs has been done for ages of hydraulic lime burned to a pinkish yellow and applied holus bolus. Houses cost 4 rupees per square foot or less, and this young architect's estimate for our Library was 7 rupees for both floors together! Bricks are 8 rupees per thousand delivered. Altogether building costs are not more than one third Australian costs for equivalent work. The Treasurer of Benares University wants me to plan some cheap housing for some of theirlands.

Apart from soldiers very few of the latter are in evidence and a smattering of the language of the people is almost indispensable for even the servants do not understand English. I have seen no European facesat the University amongst faculty nor the 2000 students.

Where will he find again such a mother perfected in every way, also such playmates, and such guidance as yours? I can only think from the impression he has left with me that he may have been so far advanced that he needed only a brief experience for some purposeof karma. His parents still have another remarkable individuality in Ivor who will be the recompense for their sacrifice no doubt but to have to forego, all at once, the joy and association with Charles cannot but be terrible for them just now. It is grievous enough for those of us who had little more than the privilege of seeing him about. Your letter received on Sunday morning the 24th was a welcome birthday greeting. Saturday afternoon I attended the annual convocation of Isabella Thoburn College started by her 50years ago with four students, young women, in a room under American Methodist auspices and now occupying [Note: ==== Beginning of page 39 ====] the highest place among the institutions of Northern India, for the higher education of women. It is affiliated with the University which affords some of its laboratory facilities to Science students and confers the degrees. According to the annual report there are 172 students in residence in the palatialquadrangle which must enclose an area of 15 acres at least. The most interesting feature of the program however was the presentation of Sophocles' Antigone from a platform of the arcaded quadrangle to an audience under a tent marque or pavilion. The chorus was clothed in robes of steel blue and white and the only Caucasian (American) was the leading female character Antigone. Compared with your production of the same play in the valley theatre themanipulation of the groups was clumsy but the stage afforded scant opportunity and there had been drastic curtailment of rehearsals, the original master mind and producer having left the college for a position elsewhere, and this was the first time anything of this sort had been attempted. The choruses however chanted their lines to beautiful and appropriate music, written in America, but accompanied by a concealed piano which should have been a harp. The leading characters weresuccessfully rendered though the young lady who was the King had taken the role in an emergency only eight days before. I thought the performance of Antigone extremely beautiful and the lines given to that character are certainly inspiring. Most of what I have told of the circumstances of this production I learned on the occasion of my visit to the college the following Tuesday when I talked on Anthroposophy for 45 minutes from 1 P.M. to a group studying comparative religions. I shall not soonforget the scene when I turned into the southern cloister with the girls passing to and fro from their class rooms in their fresh tinted saris in the morning sunlight, such a scene as could be imagined only of ancient Greece. One of the Science Doctors with whom I share \"tiffin\" (lunch) Page 32 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 40 ====] each day in the tower of the Chemistry Building, when I enquired about Indian plays as you requested said that there are as yet none of the Indian plays done properly into English except Tagore of which (1)Sacrifice, (2) Waterfall and (3) The Dark Chamber are favorable examples. Probably these are already available in Sydney. Another of the Chemistry lecturers gave two public lectures on \"Alchemy\" this week the first of which dealt, superficially of course, with the ancient art in India and Europe. The second however was a very able and lucid exposition of the accomplishments in England, Germany, France, Italy and America through which, by electrical disintegration of the nucleus, 41 of the elementshave now been transmuted and astonishingly (astonishing to those not familiar with Anthroposophy) radio-active forces produced with far greater energy development than the millions of volts required for the operation. A radio-active sodium has been achieved with properties equal to radium at comparativelyinsignificant cost by Lawrence of California. Thus are the Anthroposophic statements being confirmed. Today is the official visit, once in five years, of the Viceroy. Lord Willingdon's term is up. Thousands of pounds are invested in temporary street arches and illuminations by the politicians and the Raja landlords. I find that two thirds of the gross earnings of this people goes to the Government which furnishes conditions under which the average yearly earning is one pound sterling per person! Still theredoes not seem to be sufficient social intelligence to find the way out any more than elsewhere in the benighted world. Dr. Steiner's Threefold Commonwealth idea might get a better hearing here than in theWest as this community is as yet less mechanized. The Building Committee have been too busy individually to settle the question of the Library site but the dominant element is veering just now my way in the direction of the original site. I have two or three houses for professors in hand for revision of plans. Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin [Note: ==== Beginning of page 41b (table of contents) ====] No. 3.

I greatly enjoyed the rendering you posted me. I like your reports of the activities of the St. John Group after the Sydney exodus. It may eventuate that that event was the first necessity. Forming a new group of the West Australians is another of Miss Drummond's master strokes. Give myfelicitations and congratulations to Bim on his conquest of Roma. I have been rereading some of your newsy letters before I could part with them for Gene's benefit. It is hard to realize that so much of vital interest and importance can have happened in and about Castlecrag in so short a time. Wherever you are however that is the case. We are still unsettled as to the site of the Library though I think the committee is gradually getting committed to my revised plan for the original site undoubtedly the better site and a much improved plan. There will be a grand rush with the working drawings and specifications for which I shall have the help of a draftsman for we are still planning to complete them and then travel to Benares, Calcutta, Madras and various points south before the Moldavia leaves Colombo. I have made a new discovery solving the sightseeing problem of Lucknow. I can rent a bicycle for three pice - 5 cents - per hour. The site is level and the roads are hard and the exercise is less than that required to drive a motor car, so I get about whenever I find time by day or by moonlight. The only disagreeable feature is the dust which is less than by any other conveyance or even in staying home and that is about the same as in Illinois in Summer. It should be much worse considering that for nine months it never rains, but by some dispensation of Providence in this favored peninsula it is not.Sunday with the landlady's son and another boarder from Calcutta we did the North West corner of the City which from the point of view of the Jani Mahid (Mosque) is a perfect Arabian [Note: ==== Beginning of page 42 ====] Night's dream of white domes and minarets. (Site of the All India Exposition of which more later.) This evening I saw the Martiniere College, the building erected by the French soldier who became a British General after the French had been defeated and who was offered $5,000,000 for this magnificentcreation by the reigning Nawab at the beginning of the 19th Century. It is in no sense Indian but is a grander conception than the French palaces of those days of magnificence of Versailles and Fontainebleau. It is more impressive in composition and is rich with multitudinous exterior sculptured groups and figures. His endowment had provided the leading school for Europeans in India, in the institutions at Lucknow and Calcutta, also an institution of similar scale at his home town of Lyons. Theother endowed schools or privately supported institutions I have come across are those of the Americans for the Indians themselves. The Isabella Thoburn College previously mentioned is one of the three institutions of higher learning that united to form Lucknow University, the remaining two being of Indian origin supported by Government. Please ask Mr. Nicholls to post by Air Mail Mittler's fuel stove catalogue from which I selected Winter's cook stove, also particulars of Winter's service water heater from Fox. The wasteful and smoky way of cooking on open coke and wood fires is seriously affecting the planning of otherwise well appointed houses in India. Walter P.S.

The most interesting features of the illuminations were the curtain of vertical strung lamps in one of the archways opened up for the passage of the motor car, thelighting of the foliage of the avenue trees by concealed lights within amongst the branches and by colored balls on the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 43 (table of contents) ====] TAJ MAHAL .

This ancient practice makes the hard electric bulbs appear very mechanical and quite unsuitablefor combination with the suffused flickering glow which gives the illusion of liquid stones to the walls. For the rest the illuminations were as garish as the Columbia Fair [Note: World's Columbian Exposition (1893, Chicago)] except for one stately flood-lit building the arcade of which was internally reflected red.

Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin. Sorry to hear that Pynor is not fully recovered in health but surely Australia will be better for his trouble than Europe. As to my next incarnation I cannot think of anything better in this poor old world than thejob I am now on though I fear the fixed star of my entelechy did not indicate that. My physical appearance does not suggest much of the Indian but I have a hunch that much of my architectural predilections must have come from Indian experience. This does not mean that the environment here provides satisfaction so much as that it provides stimulus and motifs for satisfactory imagination. Louis Sullivan found his stimulus in Saracenic architecture and may have reincarnated from a Moorishexperience to give it adequate expression. His appearance would support such an hypothesis even if mine does not suggest the Indian. I have been given a copy of a document printed by the Government at the press of Thomason College, Roorkee, entitled;- Design for Lucknow University, prepared by Sir Edwin L. Lutyens R.A. Architect. Foundation Stone Laid on 19th March 1921, by His Excellency the Hon'ble Sir Spencer Harcourt ButlerK.C.S.I. CTE. Governor of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, First Chancellor of the University. The precious document represents an effort equivalent to two and a half days of our staff at 49 Park Page 35 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoStreet Sydney provided it [Note: ==== Beginning of page 44 ====] could take a holiday from thinking for that length of time. The building plans do not correspond with the ground plan and the elevations are without doors or windows, or shades or shadows. With a few of theadjustments of the machines, that du Pont factory at Elizabeth, New Jersey, could do half the plans and elevations which could then be folded for blue printing the other half. The pattern is pure Roman from Letarouilly (\"Edifices de Rome Moderne\"). This scientific architecture was applied to Lucknow without reference to the world or the sun or the air above nor the water beneath the earth, recking [Note: i.e., taking into account] not of man nor his works, his knowledge, nor resources. Nothing but the \"ideesfixes\" in his authoritative Ego were granted admission. He was here in the cold season which is why (I am told by Prof. McMahon) there is no consideration of the hot sun in summer and thus the buildings are squares mostly on the diagonals, inappropriate for this hot climate, or circuses such as we use for sunbathing because they both afford no shade in the middle of the day. He chose a site, not where the huge Medical Department was already established nor yet where the Academic Departments were in operation, several miles to the East, both in elaborate housing, nor yet where there was unoccupied expanse, as there was alongside, but astride a main road of North and South traffic and also astride the river withal destroying one bridge for one purpose and submitting another for only a University connection. He was here in the dry season so he chose a site of low level which was altogether under 21 feet of water at the next periodic flood of 1923. The conditions inLucknow are on all fours with Canberra. The river is dammed to a certain extent so that it can be used for boating, and especially for domestic laundry purposes in this country as in France. But it is not dammed sufficiently to provide an impounded area such as is required for a flood so there are large valley areas subject to occasional inundation and unsuitable for civic utilization. You may recall that most of the designs for [Note: ==== Beginning of page 45b (table of contents) ====] THE PIONEER PRESS . MANAGERIAL TOWER . LUCKNOW [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript. Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 45 ====] Canberra failed to take into account the actual data supplied in this respect. The less perfunctory feature of this Report, not mentioned in the document, is the fee paid by the taxpayers (income \u00a31 per yr.). One and one half lakhs, Rupees 150,000, which equals $75,000. This is not the whole story but it will have to suffice for the present. Page 36 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoLike all others the world over, my clients are inclined to hang onto the things they know until fully satisfied that another way is better in every respect. However the Library Committee, forming the first hurdle of the new design, was surmounted in a meeting, almost unanimous, yesterday afternoon after asatisfactory interview thereon with the Vice Chancellor who is the resident head, the Chancellor being the Governor of the Province, Sir Harry Haig. The next vital hurdle will be the engineer of the Province who is expected back from a trip Saturday next. He can approve or disapprove or order amendments under the delightful system of checks and balances of Parliamentary Governmental form. After him the Executive Council called by the Vice Chancellor for the 16th instant and then the Building Committee. Itis hoped to be ready to lay a foundation stone in February and complete the building for one and a half lakhs in the course of a year thereafter. The Librarian expressed concern that I did not intend to supervise the erection. Possibly he may want me back sometime or other in the construction stage in connection with the ornamentation but when he counts the cost he is bound to be satisfied with a proxy. THE PIONEER PRESS - MANAGERIAL TOWER - LUCKNOW [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] Mr. Craig is taking me tomorrow to interview the proprietor of the oldest newspaper in North India, who is about to have built for him a modern establishment by a contractor other than Mr. Alagappan, and who is financing the venture at a cost equaling the Library. I am just in receipt of a characteristic breezy letter from father written only just before leaving November 7 for Auckland where he must be by now. This is his farewell visit which I trust has precedents in those of Adelina Patti and Dame Melba for against these [Note: Adelina Patti and Dame Nellie Melba (an Australian) were famous opera singers.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 46 ====] is only apparent the law of averages, a principle which really is reliable only for insurance companies and not for their \"risks.\" I have already promised Mr. Alagappan that I will stop over in Calcutta a while beyond the limit of my excursion ticket as he thinks it will be necessary in consequence of the delays here. He is angling for an opening at the University in Bengal, wants to submit a commercial building design in a competition somewhere and says that several Nawak [Note: nawab?] palaces might have been accomplished in thetime consumed by the discussions over the Lucknow Library. These people so far as my experience goes now are concerned with architecture in terms of symmetry and ornament and will not readily subserve these features to mere dollars and cents. This works for a consistent vogue to be sure but, as is becoming apparent, that vogue is not necessarily reactionary. Particularly however it is not likely to become purely mechanical and in that is the possibility of creating a demand for our work if we were toestablish a permanent office of European character for an Indian clientele. But that would mean living here on the part of one or the other of us. I shall not be in a position to judge better of this prospect until after some experience in Calcutta which is the center of modern India as well as the 2nd city of the British Empire if not as thickly populated with practicing architects as some others. Hold on to Father Page 37 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagountil I come. Merry Christmas when it comes and a successful play in the valley. Walter 17 December. 1935 - Walter Burley Griffin to Mrs. Ula Maddocks - India is a lonesome place now and for a long time and will be the same tenfold for the little wife and child of Ronald Craig after what hashappened today. Last night we were discussing my Sunday luncheon with the editor of \"The Pioneer\" which Mr. Craig had been deterred from attending, also our trivial matters of business and the happenings of the last three days that had passed since I was with him Thursday. This afternoon I helped lower his coffin into the grave in the beautiful [Note: ==== Beginning of page 47 ====] cemetery over the River to the North of the City. For me the blows were in rapid succession, first the news yesterday noon that he was ill at the King George Hospital, trouble undiagnosed, but an operation; second the sight of him in the private ward all livid red and with blood-shot eyes yet withal cheerful, thoughtful and practical in the waking periods from the morphine injections found necessary to make his excruciating agony sufferable. He said his trouble was an inflammation of liver and gall bladder, his nurse gave a somewhat more indefinite account and the house surgeon insisting on the need ofimmediate operation admitted to me that they would have to wait until they had cut into the abdomen to find out which organ needed the operation. Not being able to reconcile the diagnosis with the remedy I went with Mr. Alagappan and the Craig's next door neighbor who is the University Treasurer to the house of the surgeon in charge to find out if nothing more could be done in the diagnosis, suggesting consulting physician, X-ray, in addition toblood and urine tests already made. He said that relief was so urgent all medicines having failed and the continuing with morphine being so undesirable, that it was not a case for a physician but for surgery and unless the pain was reduced by the time of the next consciousness at six, he would have to operate. Shortly after this we all went into the ward with the surgeon who asked Mr. Craig about a certain sore spot on his arm, which was a new development. He thereupon said it was no longer a question ofimmediate operation but of calling in a physician which he did and we left them in consultation in order to hunt for a private nurse for continuous attendance. Under the latter circumstances Mrs. Craig was finally induced to leave the patient with great reluctance. I only found thereafter that Mr. Alagappan's insistence was based on a suspicion of smallpox which the physician confirmed at 8 o'clock declaring the case to be homeroidal [sic] or suppressed smallpox which is said to be [Note: ==== Beginning of page 48b (table of contents) ====] CLOISTER OF THE SIX ARTS .

CLOISTER OF THE SIX ARTS [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] I was the first to whom this news was transmitted when Mr. Alagappan called this morning to report that the death ensued at 12:15 this morning relieving terrible agony and a fit of delirium. Earlier he had cried out in total blindness for the lights to be turned on as how otherwise could he see his baby. Yettwo electric lights were glaring over his bed. The little wife has been brave, almost stoical. Tomorrow the mother and child whom I had expected to know so well leave for her father's home in Madras. Her brilliant schoolmate, the History teacher in the Isabella Thoburn College, has offered to travel with her tomorrow afternoon away from the Lucknow of painful associations. We have all lost a friend whose only fault was a great carelessness of his own life and who bore his troubles with such fortitude that even those around hardly suspected that there were any such things. He valued humanity so much that he may have underrated the constituent element, the individual Ego, and in his own case I feel sure that he carried this too far. Mr. Alagappan has said many times that his capacities would make him a wealthy man in two years if he would apply them to the contracting business which, however, did not sufficiently engage his interest. Seemingly there are many openingsfor imaginative enterprise here where new education is only starting new demands. My sympathy goes to you for your loss of a far longerstanding friendship. His last words were of his mother who he said would be here now if he had let her know of his previous illness but under the circumstances it was he thought perhaps as well that he had not let her know. You will have heard the terrible fact of his loss by the cable sent her today. Admittedly confluential smallpox baffles diagnosis. One of the Physics stafftold us this morning of the only case he knew of, that of a young son of a Maharaja who brought the most eminent physicians of Bombay, Delhi and two from Calcutta, giving their names, all of whom acknowledged themselves completely [Note: ==== Beginning of page 49 ====] baffled. A servant then suggested an amateur follower of Hanneman [Note: Samuel Hahnemann?] who immediately named the disease and prescribed two doses which immediately brought the eruptions tothe surface allowing the natural development to take place leading to recovery. It is this that is unrecognized by the Allopathic School. I am glad therefore that the Craigs exhausted the possibilities of Homeopathy available in the first instance though the individual physician was unable within the limited time to hit upon the real cause. As to what I might say to Ronald Craig's mother when in Sydney the little mother said, \"Tell her to come sometime to see the child.\" His affection for his mother andsolicitude for his family occupied his mind. For himself he said he was happy and finally he had ten minutes of peace and quiet after his violent delirium and died with a smile on his face. Sincerely, Walter Burley Griffin 18 December, 1935, Lucknow. Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin. What a harvest this Page 39 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagogreat reaper is gathering from the fields we are in. There must be something stirring on the other side just now, and these fields are productive. The death of Ronald Craig cuts to the quick. We had planned to live near each other adjoining the University under more flexible and economic as well as more socialconditions than has been possible for either. There is always smallpox during the specific seasons of the different sections of India each year and in the north its season is the winter. For example there may be fifty cases in Lucknow now which are as a rule under segregation and are not regarded as anything more serious than most diseases. Though Mr. Craig had not done much during the period of finding a home, he had previously started and undertaken to complete a considerable course of Steiner's works which might have graduated him from Krishnamurti (Vedanta) as Krishnamurti graduated from Theosophy for him. Mr. Alagappan who has thought much about such things agrees that Krishnamurti is teaching only what he was taught as an Indian. When I read this morning your comparison of the teaching of the Bhagavad Gita [Note: \"Allopathic School\" in this context probably means conventional medical treatment.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 50b (table of contents) ====] ASAFI MOSQUE . LUCKNOW [Note: There are two images of the mosque. This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript.

In Mr. Craig's case the reversion to the Indian was not, in his opinion, beneficial. But Ronald Craig was a lovable personality and his local Indian friends and neighbors wentto no end of trouble in his dire emergency though they had only begun to know him. ASAFI MOSQUE - LUCKNOW [Note: There are two images of the mosque. This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] Monday a solid three hours with the provincial Engineer, his deputy Colonel Haig and the Librarian and Mr. Alagappan served to cover most of the points of the Library design and intended construction that the authorities, notwithstanding the \"revolutionary nature\" of both, agreed to the \"Experiment\" subject to their satisfactory checking of the calculations and the working out of the details as proposed by me. This affords the expert backing as well as the legal authority necessary for the more timid of the University Committeemen. One by one these latter are being committed tactfully so that the remaining step up theexecutive Council in January will be more or less formal ratifications. With due allowance for \"arriere-pensees\" there is a remarkable contrast with my Australian official experience. Page 40 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 51 ====] 24 December, 1935, Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin - A still week has passed since the swift tragedy of Ronald Craig, and five days since I said goodbye to the sad-visaged widow and bright-faced infant in the train bound for South India. In anticipation of an excursion nextweek I have reloaded my camera. The excursion if it comes off is to a Mohammadan wedding to which Mr. Alagappan and I are invited at Peshawar of all places the most unlikely one for me to see in India;- beyond Baluchistan in the North West frontier Province, at the Khyber pass: The frontier is seven hundred miles away. The route traverses also Amritsar of the Golden Temple and Taxila the vast city of disinterred foundations in successive layers to 3,000 years ago and whose King Taxilles wasAlexander's ally against Portus. Nothing has eventuated from my luncheon with the \"Pioneer\" editor, Mr. Young, but my Indian doctor at the University dispensary, who has been dressing a sore knuckle where I slid on it cycling, says that three wasteful social engagements on each side must precede any business undertaking in India as in Europe until the prevalence of rascality is reduced! This M.D. is a sterling type who says from hisexperience that 90% of the Christian Missionaries of which the Americans are the disinterested example have their individual welfare first at heart though the other one tenth are superb. But everyone has a missionary job with one person that is himself. The Bible contains certain precepts which applied would solve all the world's problems but to apply them is the only effective way to promulgate them and the examples are very, very wanting. This is only a rough paraphrase of his homely sentiment. Like theFrench in so many ways, these Hindus speak rapid fire even in English and are hard to keep up with. But unlike some of the students who buttonholed me to talk when photographing Harcourt Hotel this morning, the little old doctor speaks from long and hard experience. The students had with reason arrived at politics - Fascism, Communism and Non-co-operation severally but were not unreceptive of what I thought [Note: ==== Beginning of page 52 ====] of these things and more inclined to admit that the ultimate must be a medium way - the Threefold Commonwealth which is neither radical nor conservative but correct, organic. To revert to the American Christian missionaries for fear of doing them injustice I must say that they have provided the foundation for a large, if not the largest part, of the modern education of these parts which is the first need of India, wherever it may lead to. They make no requirement of conversion nor affiliation nor commitment of any sort but have afforded the facilities of splendid institutions to all alike without inquiry. Needless to say, the result of these good works may not be the Christianizing of the heathens for which the contributions were exacted in Boston and Chicago. As Isabella Thoburn Collegenamed after its first teacher is one of three large factors in the Lucknow University and affords all the facilities for the women, so is the Christian College named after its first master, whose name I forget, the major factor in Allahabad University of whose students it accounts for 2,000. I have just been interrupted by the exceptionally beautiful rendering outside with obviously trained Page 41 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoEuropean mixed voices, of \"Hark ye Herald Angels Sing\" and \"Come all ye Faithful\" a surprising and to me welcome alternative to the harsh guttural and monotonous male singing that is now and almost always going on in the adjacent chauk [Note: \"bazaar center\" from I.3.56] sometimes all night withscarcely any cessation. There is no moon just now but I am informed that its phases may have something to do with the singing or at any rate with the baleful conch hour [Note: horn?] blowing that goes on intermittently in a nearby Hindu Temple. The innumerable mosques are never out of sight in the streets and lanes of Lucknow. The Hindu temples are of diminutive proportions and are still, for the most part, almost inaccessibly secreted amongst the solid masses of the houses as a result of a thousandyears of persecution by the Muslim conquerors. City noises of the Occidental sort are of a much lesser degree except [Note: ==== Beginning of page 53b (table of contents) ====] ENTOURAGE OF EXPOSITION .

The kites are as large as eagles but they are the most perfect of soarers always gliding about in every direction without visible effort, more convincing even than the albatross of the Tasman sea because there is no evidence of any wind nor is there any rising of smoke of ship to support them. With an impending interview with a Rajah contemplating building a $250,000 library, I have been setting out the eighth scale drawings of the University Library for a draftsman. Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin ENTOURAGE [Note: i.e., surroundings, environment] OF EXPOSITION [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] 24 December, 1935, Castlecrag - Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin - What shocking, what dreadful word has come to us from India, the death of Ronald Craig. Truly December was, in our circle, the terrible month the astrologers have been telling us it would be. His letters to Mrs. Maddocks have been most fascinating, delightful, quaint and appreciative. It is hard indeed to accept these blows. As for the suggestion in your last of the possibility of establishing a permanent office in India, myadvice would be to do it if there was a straw of a possibility of a practice there. You could be back here for a month or two each year and I am satisfied to remain here if it is necessary. This would remain your residence. Apparently your period which Mr. Meebold says is important for us to learn, suggests that, Page 42 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagohowever little personal advantage there might be in it, and neither you nor I are interested in that side, you are due for a change:- 21 landscape architecture on your own, and architecture in conjunction with others - 28 independent architect and land planner practicing in 14 States - 35, Canberra - 42 Melbourne- 49 Sydney, Castlecrag - 56 India. Just stopped out to the mail box and discovered that there are 13 good sized apples on our apple trees and I have half a dozen of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 54 ====] those delicious rough lemons off our lemon tree, so you see I couldn't leave Sydney. We still have a performance to give Wednesday night. The Anthro Festival went very sweetly. The lawn border very gay. Miss Leeson makes it her Sunday task to behead the calliopsis, and the poker plant is out, and gladioli. Mr. Herbert lectured Saturday P.M. \"From Group Soul to Individual Soul\" (from [Note: Hermann Poppelbaum's?] Popplebaum's Man and Animal) an entirely Anthro Audience with Miss Mitchell here. Evening, Miss Drummond, a wonderful talk on a Christmas thought, followed by general carol singing. Sunday Miss Birch showed great capacity for lecturing in a talk on Christ and theEgo. We are looking on these Festivals as a sort of normal school for training Anthro lecturers for Miss Drummond to use as she thinks fit. She gave a lecture a week ago at Kings Hall, the biggest audience they have had in some time. This Theosophical group is not under bondage to the Adyar [Note: Theosophical Society headquarters in India] group re the Christ event so she was very pleased when two of their higher-ups came over to see her the following day to discuss what was the differencebetween them and us. She stated it as the emphasis on the nature of the Christ. They asked that we give further lectures and she suggested me for the Four Ethers, Warmth, Light, Sound, Magnetism and Mr. Herbert for Man and Animal and they are putting us on their announced program for the year, each of us for two. She had a wonderful letter from Mrs. Growcott stating in detail the marked increase in interest and activity in the Melbourne group, as if they had sort of come to life. Sunday P.M. Miss Mitchell's lecture on the \"Child and Temperament\" well attended, and a beautiful warm night for the Play, but my goodness we missed your efficient work down there. Many shortages in the illumination but mysterious and wonderful nevertheless. Bim alone on duty, which included the whole of the hill above, because the three Kings and the three shepherds kept all the other men tied up with the performance. Five groups of the third Hierarchy on the upper hill-side each with [Note: ==== Beginning of page 55 ====] one Archai holding a circle aloft, two Archangels with triangles back of head and two Angels with wings. In each group an Angel set off a Roman candle. The topmost group on a rocky promontory was silhouetted against the sky, the star of Bethlehem above their heads shining through the branches of agreat gum tree. Gradually during the play they moved down the hill taking formations as they came down till they all grouped on top of wall and then down the double flight of steps. The cherubs clustered around Mary. The speech chorus who had first spoken from the East Valley crest and then from top of Page 43 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowall, knelt in the low valley below the Madonna, Kings and shepherd group, each with a candle lighted by the five boys, the acolytes, who had previously set off the Roman candles for the Angel Gabriel. The only real faux pas was the shepherds coming in the 2nd scene instead of the third. I had to let them practically come to a conclusion so as not to mess it and then had to creep down behind the bushes and make them come off, and had to hustle on the speech chorus and Mary and the cherubs in the Annunciation scene and then made the shepherds go on from another entrance and do their whole scene again as their lines gave all the cues for the Heavenly Hosts on the hill which included flute solo and violin. If it had been anywhere but that enchanted valley it would have made an unholy mess but as itwas it was hardly noticed by the audience though one man's criticism was a certain lack of co-ordination !!! Hope the Wednesday will not have the flaws [Note: reading from N-YHS] of this really dress rehearsal. The girls were all enchantingly lovely. Everyone spoke of Mrs. Walker's loveliness when as an Angel on the heights she played the flute. It was a brilliant scene for they were all in color except the 5 cherubs who were in white as was Mary in the annunciation scene - Mrs. Prescott,Mary. Next time it will be Mrs. Nicholls who too has been lovely in rehearsals. There was a fine audience, Miss Leeson, the august librarian of Australia's History Library, taking the shilling entrance fees if that term can be used where there is no entrance.

These news sheets were so good that I have hung on to them to rereadseveral times. I have met very few Europeans here but the Indians have been most hospitable and pleasant to know and the environment is a great relief to live in because without being very \"ideal\" it has charms everywhere, something totally lacking in Australia and in America except where nature is free Page 44 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofrom man. In the buildings of all sorts I recognize most of the \"motifs\" I have used or even thought of in my lifetime of practice of architecture. Whenever I am free I take a fresh route through this city on the bicycle which can be hired for 2 pence per hour. The distances are \"magnificent\" except in the bazaarcenters or \"chauks\" which are crossed in crowded and often narrow and winding roads fed by narrower lanes where the bulk of the people live of course. On the other hand the bulk of the city is given over to residences that are \"palatial\" in character surrounded with luxurious gardens. The University occupies such a garden with some of the Arch Gates and sections of the old wall still standing. It was a garden famous for its mangos and the old stately trees are the main basis of the embellishment of the Campusand quadrangles. Marion tells me she is sending copies of my letters on to you. Love to all, Walter 26 December 1935 Lucknow, Walter Burley Griffin to his father - Welcome to Australia. Because of the so-called \"democracy\" in affairs in India, it has taken me a long time to get through the various adaptations of the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 57 ====] plan to the divergent if not conflicting requirements of the various committees, officials and Executive Council. All this has compelled me to forego the benefit of my excursion rate with the P. & O. and means another month in getting back to Sydney, February, when I shall expect to find you comfortably ensconced at 56 The Parapet, Castlecrag. I am comfortable here and find endless source of interest in the environment of an ancient civilization. More so too than one could have had said 20 years ago when everything in the East was stationary. It isnot so for the future and the prospect of fruitful activity is perhaps not less than in the new countries of America and Australia which used to be in such contrast with conservative European ways but which, unfortunately, have been coming to adopt them more and more. One of the difficulties here which makes for monopoly of opportunity now is that the standard of rascality set in the highest places has put all enterprise under suspicion and business goes by favor to those whose social position is established sowell that they are willingly highly paid for safety from fraud. Interest is fabulously high for enterprise because of the insurance factor against being swindled altogether. The Indians have been so adept in applying the tricks they have seen worked so successfully by Europeans that it is particularly difficult for one of them to gain the confidence of his fellows as yet and so, professionally, the work goes to one or the other of the more conspicuous foreigners whose reputation for trustworthiness has not beenforfeited and these are few indeed. My builder client, Mr. Alagappan who was for a long time the responsible officer of the British Construction Co. and whose wide-spreading work is the result of his known integrity says however that without the prestige of a foreign reputation he cannot carry conviction to his clients who are always expecting to be bluffed in technical matters. After all it is the European not the Indian characteristic to take serious account of things, just material things, which to the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 58 ====] Page 45 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagochief Asiatic religions and consciousness are primarily illusions, maya [Note: religious concept from Hinduism], hence not an end in themselves, and as a means to an end questionable at the best; at the worst it does not matter how much they are questionable so long as the end is served. Take-down is theaccepted principle with the servitor classes with whom the foreigner comes most in contact and it is not without much sound justification contemplating the higher standards of living and remuneration amongst these. Yet a tonga walla (sulky car driver) in my experience with one or two exceptions returns my money tendered as the legal fare posted in his cart and demands 50% more until after harsh words the police are sent for. Yet that does not make him in any way the less anxious to carry you the next timeknowing full well how he will be paid. Rules are not just rules but human beings and haggling as the means of all trading was only done away with in Europe through the Quakers. Americans particularly used to be the worst victims, and an acquaintance here once saw one pay a golden sovereign for a peacock tail fan, marked value then as now three cents, at the Lucknow station. Here in Lucknow we are not in the tropics but in the In-temperate zone. Lucknow was the hottest point in India last summer and it is often the coldest. I sleep under two blankets and an eiderdown comfort at elevation 500. As I have already mentioned, social contact is the only road to business engagements here. Already through the family of Raja Jahahjirabad [Note: Jahangirabad?] I have been requested to make an appointment with the second largest landlord Raja (Raja Mahmudabad) in these United Provinces, whose mania is the collection of a million books and who wants to spend $25,000 [Note: $250,000 at II.3.53] now on housing this library in the making. You see libraries are my particular speciality just now. His present English style plans obtained in Calcutta do not please him. A $25,0000 invested in buildings here produces to all intents and purposes a $100,000 building result according to Australian standards. This flat basin of the Ganges and its tributaries is a vast garden [Note: ==== Beginning of page 59 ====]with roads shaded by magnificent trees in many ways reminding one of the Mississippi valley. But the unequal seasonal distribution of the rains makes irrigation the rule rather than the exception and the exclusively hand processes employ 60,000,000 in these two small provinces of Agra and Oudh whose capital is Lucknow. Walter Burley Griffin to George Walter Griffin 31 December, 1935, Lucknow. - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin - I gave up the trip to Peshawar because Mr. Alagappan is ill with a fever in Benares. Even here, where there is such a considerable English sprinkling, the servants of these Europeans cannot speak their employer's language and so Hindustani is the connecting link with them as well as between the various peoples of India generally. Between our Christmas holidays there occurred after Friday night the Mohammedan breaking of the annual month's fast concurrently with the National Congress Diamond Jubilee Day. The streetswere filled with brilliant silks and satins and men and women and children who foregathered in a section, Aishbagh, which is their customary center for this particular festival. Evidently it is a picnic feast but, like all the goings on here in public, without any sign of organized amusement and without any hilarity or noise or confusion. I only skirted the throng taking the occasion to cycle through Old Lucknow, the Northwest section, where the picturesque narrow lanes were almost deserted. Evidentlystrong drink offers no temptation to the Indians for I have seen no sign of its sale or use or Page 46 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoconsequences anywhere as yet. Yesterday two gaily attired fellows were causing much congestion in the street by their conviviality with arms around each others necks and boisterousness but not rowdiness. From their feature characteristics, pointed out to me in examples previously by Mr. Craig, I recognizedthem as unmistakable Nepalese, predominantly Mongolian, from the adjoining inaccessible independent nation. Tommy Atkins is sometimes troublesome \"in bounds.\" [Note: \"Tommy Atkins\" is a common general name for a British Army soldier.] Motoring around India, as I found out in Ceylon, would not be the unadulterated joy that pedaling is. The roads in the country as well [Note: ==== Beginning of page 60 ====] as in the city are not only crowded with pedestrian travelers but with herds of animals large and small, pack animals, asses and cattle and occasional camels, and strings of massive wagons and carts drawn by oxen or buffaloes wobbling from side to side with the drivers, more frequently than not, fast asleep. Cycling in and around the town on roads, which at this season, are everywhere adapted for the purpose, circumvents all these obstacles and, at the moderate speed imposed, employs a minimum effort. For meanyway, perhaps because of boyhood training of the muscles, the wheel is a magic carpet under which the earth just rolls away in the opposite direction. I have not priced wheels, which I notice are even sold on installments here, because their rental is so cheap, but a Japanese machine such as I often ride and which is good for two years at least costs in Calcutta from 15 to 18 rupees!! This is perhaps the cause of the absence of tramways here. I got real satisfaction out of the American light opera \"Naughty Marietta\" of Victor Herbert's old fashioned music. Such a piece in a realistic setting makes a more convincing combination of singing and acting than the opera could afford on the stage. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer control the theatre here in Lucknow and have recently opened their picture palace in Calcutta. I understand they are planning to go into the production of Hindu drama for native consumption. Think what a magnificent field in religiousmystery and mythology and music such conscientious production as theirs could open up! There are three talkies in Lucknow given up to presenting species of local production of successions of stilted and actionless dialogue. We have had further boarders here for a day or so each of late all, as on the previous occasion, Anglo-Indians. By official edict this term no longer means English born in India but all who can tracetheir descent in whole or in part to Europe. Thus as a result of political organization and representations to government the separate characterization of Eurasian was done away with.

Poor martyred Germany, first under foreign yoke then under equally ferocious domestic tyranny. My new draftsman, [Note: name erased] who has had only engineering drawing experience with a Railroad and has never used a Tee square, is making a conscientious start with admirable pains and promises better speed with the help of the parallel rule that Mr. Alagappan borrowed for him today. Deputizing some of the tracing has enabled me to clear upsome of the lesser jobs that have been pending including some alterations for University buildings they have asked for. Servants are not a satisfactory substitute for mechanical aids even in India. Of course only Musselmen [Note: Mussulmen, i.e., Muslims] and pariahs will serve Europeans. It is customary for servants to pad prices, thus my landlady tells of a case where a nobleman made his cook a handsome monthly allowance on condition that he forego this practice. After a month's trial this servant handedback the allowance saying that he did better the old way! On two occasions I entrusted letters to be posted by Mr. Alagappan's \"munshi\" but as yet I do not know whether he did so or soaked off the stamps for himself. I found afterwards that Mr. Alagappan would not go so far as to trust him with stamped letters. Amongst our occasional transients at the boarding house were a Parsi and his wife. The Parsis are religious devotees, have fires they have kept burning for 1300 years, and say their prayers, in a language no longer understood by scarcely any one, five times a day including midnight. They have been translated but as a rule they go through them as [Note: ==== Beginning of page 62 ====] a ritual without any significance. Mr. Craig pointed out to me in Bombay several cases of obvious disability amongst these people who are all comfortably fixed. The cases I saw were paralytic but I am Page 48 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagotold that tuberculosis and leprosy are rife amongst them attributed to their long continued exclusive intermarriage. This is the other side of the eugenistic case in which the Persian Sect constitutes the outstanding example of cultural advancement through selection. I am still encountering the evidences of the educational prestige that is needed for success in an Indian amongst his own people. One of the professors on the Library committee obtained his decoration at Harvard. The Health officer in the Town Hall who signed my vaccination certificate did his post-graduate work at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore. What a pity they could not have studied \"The Threefold Commonwealth\" at these places also and so have found their bearings for the new educationaland political course on which they have just embarked. I am loath to part with your letters in a hurry for Georgine because of the wisdom to which I refer again and again. Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin 9 January 1936, - Castlecrag - Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin. Tuesday and Thursday evenings I went with Miss Drummond, who is working with the Australian broadcasters in theproduction of the operas, arranging connecting links where they have to be cut to fit the time requirements, to the broadcasting station where d'Abravanel, who it seems is a young Portuguese Jew, was conducting the opera Rosenkavalier of Strauss for the Radio. Miss Drummond heard the first production of the opera in Germany with Strauss himself conducting and, as she said, all the conductors in the world in the audience. Apart from the work itself which was I should say a remarkable andsustained play upon the emotions, I was immensely interested in how things are done in such a piece of broadcasting. The half hour preceding made you feel you understood the effectiveness of Chinese music. Most of the members of the orchestra were busy severally practicing for their lives the hard parts of their scores, no one paying the slightest attention to what anyone else was playing. It gave a feeling of intense excitement. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 63a (table of contents) ====] STUDENTS' UNION . CLUB HOUSE . LUCKNOW UNIVERSITY [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript. Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 63 ====] It certainly outfutured the futurists. After the program began, the big ones of the Australian singers were going for their lives into the microphones against the noisiest orchestra you ever heard. It would have been interesting to be able to hear it at the same time over the air but doubtless it sounded quite usual there. I think I have come to an understanding of this love business. We learn from Steiner that the soul longs for the spirit, our own soul longs for union with our own spirit. With no direct knowledge of this nor conscious contact with the spirit we interpret that as the urge for our human mate, and the search begins and disappointment comes for the unsatisfied longing continues, but finally when we are driven to the Page 49 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagospiritual for refuge, if we have developed ourselves sufficiently, we find our spirit, our Ego, and the soul becomes united with the spirit. When we have done that we have indeed changed our temperament for that is the balancing of the four ethers and then we are neither man nor woman but both. What did you do to your hand? Aren't you a bad little thing. Coasting down hills again without a proper brake? How wonderful if the American movies take up India. They will surely send them round the world. I am disgusted you didn't get that Northern trip but agree with you that it would have been embarrassing without Mr. Alagappan. Hope he is all better now. Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin STUDENTS UNION-CLUB HOUSE-LUCKNOW UNIVERSITY [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] 15 January, 1936 - Lucknow. - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin - My landlady is laid up with arthritis which may or may not be a reflection on the type of over-acidulate regimen that weshare here though she has said that if I stayed long enough she would have to become a vegetarian. However she has been going some seventeen years longer than I have as it is. She is somewhat of the type but on the whole much hardier seeming than my grandmother who lived to be 90 as you will remember. I have indulged in two cinema shows this week because the programs were so good - Anna Karenina with Greta Garbo and Cecil B. DeMille's \"Crusades.\" [Note: ==== Beginning of page 64 ====] An article in one of the papers has put the case that Hollywood is doing more for the awakening of India than the British ever could. Certainly such an artistic presentation of all phases of human civilization cannot but arouse a growing interest in things outside themselves that these so subjectively disposed peoples need if they are ever to change at all. As it is the Brahmin head Vice Chancellor of the University is quoted in the paper advising all Indians to relegate their religion to the background as theonly means of reconciling their differences and caste distinctions which he abhors but can fight only with contempt as we advocate for politics. Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin 23 January 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin - One of the popular illusions about India is that it is vegetarian, apparently by failing to take into account the insignificant proportion of higher castes. In the North here the meat consumption must be equivalent with otherplaces of similar economic state. Another illusion is that time doesn't matter much because the incidence of the matters concerned happens to be different from some other places. The Puja of the Brahmins, the exacting schedule of the Pardes and the five daily devotions of the Muslims must keep a live consciousness of time as good as that of the American hustler. So far in my affairs I have found as little leniency in this as in Sydney at any rate. Possibly the reduction in proportion of alien exploiters ischanging the condition. Though my draftsmen's hours are 10 to 4, there is no stopping for lunch nor is there any reduction Saturday nor Sunday. In fact, though Civil Station shops are closed and the church bells ring, there is little difference between Sunday and the other days amongst the populace. The hawkers start calling before daybreak and continue well into the dark. Just the same also with building operations with women as well as men carrying on construction with lanterns to eke out more wages at Page 50 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe 8 hour day time rate. The real difference of course is in the repeat of the wheel of time as against the spiral concept of evolution of the West. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 65 (table of JAHANGIRABAD . ZENANA PALACE . JAHANGIRABAD [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript. Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of ====] ZENANA - RAJA JAHANGIRABAD [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] My first building in India promises to be the additional Zenana Palace for Jahangirabad on which I am rushing the drawings because the Raja finds on consulting his almanac that Saturday of this week, the last of the lunar month, will be the most suspicious [Note: auspicious?] day for a long while to start mywork. My first view of the site was last Saturday afternoon when the arrangement of the floor plan was discussed at length, the dimensions being a question of inches almost because he is removing parts of other buildings to make a courtyard frontage available. Naturally some of these arrangements have had to be upset as the result of further study here of stairways, etc. and the whole question of exterior is being settled, I hope, without consultation with the owner, pending our breakfast with the Raja Saturdaymorning. Jahangirabad lies some thirty miles north of Lucknow and it was a fresh sensation when we were taken out there by the car sent for us Saturday. As with the Moguls themselves the chief sport of this landlord is pulling down, rebuilding and extending his palace buildings and gardens. The proprietor showed us through his main house in addition to the section we are immediately concerned with. The rooms werevast as he inherited them but he has been throwing them together to make them vaster still in his time. The only architectural feature of special interest however was a Paridari or garden pavilion which I was much taken with when we were escorted through the gardens by his overseer and his gardener. This fact made a hit with the chief when we got back to tea and found that it was all his work unassisted and I told him that architects were superfluous in his case. Because he is unable to draw he must have hadsome real assistance in modeling the exquisite plaques, all different, on the interior walls but that he has a developed aesthetic sense is evident from his garden as well as from some chance observations on the state of architecture in America. Gardening is a faculty that apparently came to India from Persia or at any rate with the Mohammedans. This example is based on a system [Note: \"Zenana\" is a dwelling in which the women of a family are secluded.] Page 51 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 66b (table JAHANGIRABAD [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript. Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 66 ====] of long wide terraces with 60 acres intensively developed and cared for including rosary, orangery, rockery, sunken garden, fern house, lake and broad lawns punctuated and surrounded with groups and groves of trees and numerous flower borders, the whole so disposed as to be impressive, and withintriguing glimpses from the windows and verandas of the main house. ZENANA PALACE - RAJA JAHANGIRABAD [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] We enjoyed a sumptuous afternoon tea with our host and his retinue of courtiers, or assistants, but of course not a vestige of the women of the household who live in purdah all their lives in such courts as the one I hope to make with cusped arcades and rich balustrades and with a lofty niche-arch gate deep enough to conceal the entrance and exit, per curtained car, of the noble lady and her attendants. Friday afternoon was the occasion of the lawn reception at the Ghulan Hasan home in Lucknow the Begam Hasan's brother and his bride from Peshawar. The catering was European style but there was nogovernor there nor any considerable proportion of Europeans but it was an occasion to see the elite of Lucknow, cloth of gold in rich embroidery was characteristic of many of the men's costumes including turban, and of course of the groom's. The saris of many of the women were the most attractive feature, in fine fabrics and rich coloring, one with bands of black and red and gold being especially striking. The bride was precisely the living Persian painting that we have seen reproduced in books of Eastern art.She was petite with finely modeled features, almost fair complexion, with a richly embroidered lace architectural head-dress and salmon and Naples yellow tinted gown. I took special note of this much for the purpose of this correspondence but my ignorance of the technical terms prevents my transmitting further details. The effect however was exquisite altogether and suited to the demure attitude such as one would expect from a lifetime of purdah. My most comprehensive contact at this function was with an Indian Yankee whose speech is Americanese, who is a graduate of Northwestern [Note: ==== Beginning of page 67 ====] and Illinois universities, and who was a member of both their football teams and was a Major in the American Expeditionary Forces in 1917 in France. He is now teaching physical education in one of the Page 52 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocolleges in Lucknow supported by American missions where he is handicapped by his poor knowledge of Hindustani. It seems that he went to America at the age of six with his parents who were completing their education there. When they returned to India he was fourteen and elected to stay in U.S.A. earninghis own way. He found no difficulty there due to race or color and succeeded and only came back to India because the British queried his citizenship qualifications for the American army and, for reasons I did not quite follow, induced him to leave. He attributes any color disability that people such as the Indians find, or before the war found, in America to their own inferiority complex or diffidence. However it has taken him so long to accustom himself to India that he would not advise others to gaintheir education abroad until they had become thoroughly grounded at home. An Anglo-Indian engineer of the Irrigation Department came in yesterday to get advice on the completion of his extensive home opposite Government House. He also left particulars of another house for sketches and broached a large business block which he had already planned for the business center of Lucknow. I shall go into these matters with him later. This week I was pressed to prepare a groundsplan for the University Library which I did including the plantings, some fifty species of the brightest things in the way of trees especially that I have seen in India so far. The phenology may be all off as I have not studied the cultural conditions or special soil requirements but most of my observed specimens were old and thoroughly established beyond cultural stages and mixed together in the Gardens at Perydenia and Lucknow or in the wild. The language difficulty which is a handicap with the draftsmanis also evident with the typist to whom I am dictating the specifications which are a test for most anybody. Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin [Note: ==== Beginning of page 68 ====] 30 January, 1936, - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin - Last Saturday I was transplanted back into the time of the real journeyman architect. On Friday the Raja called here to see that everything was in readiness, which was far from the fact, and to take me around to see an attractivearch at the Medical College for consideration in connection with the new entrance to this Zenana Court and to point out turrets on different palaces as alternatives to the minarets I had contrived for him which looked too much like a mosque. When I had completed in pencil the plans, elevations and section by Saturday morning Mr. Alagappan immediately pointed out that they did not look like any other palace and set about suggesting alternatives to propose in meeting that objection. But when we reachedJahangirabad the Raja said \"How beautiful; this is something entirely new,\" and to Mr. Alagappan only \"Can you build it?\" So that was all the argument there was on his part and he called in all his retinue one after the other to admire - which they did, of course, enthusiastically though the outlines on tracing cloth were indistinct and rather indefinite. So I completed the foundation plan then and there encountering the first distinctly Indian difficulty in the fact that the dimensions of the rooms arrived at according to my module were not all in even feet. I had not realized that this was important though previously all the witness line figures had been taken off the University Library plans and the room sizes indicated somewhat arbitrarily. Mr. Alagappan was upset when the veranda proved to be 13 feet instead of 12 feet and the drawing room 29 instead 30 feet! It seems the odd numbers would bring bad luck. The Raja said he would leave this matter to me when Ipointed out that the stairs and outlook would be adversely affected by changing but under the Page 53 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocircumstance that the building interpenetrated two others I was able to switch the wall with a clear conscience and relieve the misgivings of both parties. Naturally future occasions may not be so simple but I think a little subterfuge may be justified. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 69 (table of contents) ====] RAJA JAHANGIRABAD [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript. Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 69 (typescript) ====] However I was able to supply the mistri (overseer) that we had taken with us with a figured foundation plan before lunch after which I was astonished to find all the trenches for every room accurately set out with lime lines checked by cross diagonal measurements to the nearest half inch awaiting our approval. Then 50 men were set to incising all these lines and embedding brickwork corner and bench marks and soon after all the trenches were under way full blast with another 50 on-lookers when the cocoanutsweets were distributed to all as is the custom in starting works. Meantime the Ruler had set up his huge red umbrellas, with tables and chairs for us around him, in various positions of vantage, to discuss the next problem, of the motor-car entrance-way. After discussing, with Mr. Alagappan in Urdu, my suggestions for the locating of the stairs and the successive arches and screens, he exclaimed, \"Mr. Griffin is a real architect; this arrangement will create a perspective effect!\" And so what I say goes withhim and I am his white haired boy up to the present. RAJA - JAHANGIRABAD [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] He came around here again Monday afternoon for the ground story plan as already, during Sunday, the trenching had been completed and the concreting started! While we were there he suddenly decided to have us do a European kitchen for which a space was created by demolishing further ancient buildings forthwith. Aristocracy has much to commend it not the least of which is the will and the power to make decisions. How different from the fear of criticism, the subservience, the rationalization and inhibitions and paralysis that characterizes the sordid modern world and which are invading India even, asexemplified in the protracted discussions of the University Library (a government institution). However though the dependence on reason has already arrived here the reason at least is relatively unprejudiced still, and in my little experience I have yet to encounter the determination not to be convinced. I gave the Raja of Mamudhabad, with whom I had an interview in [Note: ==== Beginning of page 70 ====] Page 54 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagohis Lucknow palace Monday, a copy of \"Wild Life\" in exchange for which he gave me several similar publications of the Wild-Life Preservation Society of India on which he indorsed his name as President. His predilection for his library building at Mamudhabad is ancient Grecian with wide colonnadedentrance front and an open court with peristyle complete. Hence he showed particular appreciation of my Melbourne Palais de Dance photographs amongst those I showed him and also of the setting for Iphigeneia in Tauris with which he is very familiar though he is only in his early twenties. For that age a leaning toward Greece should be a good sign I should say. Though we set no appointment for a visit to his palace I have heard, through my introducer since, that he was favorably impressed with our workthough at this time the University Library plans were not at hand to show him unfortunately. Mr. Young says that a word from the Raja of Jahangirabad will have much influence with him for though he is of insignificant income as compared with Mamudhabad the former has an influential standing as a man of shrewdness as well as of taste. Incidentally he is chairman of the Pioneer newspaper, President of the British India Society, etc. etc. To me he is the Yankee Sultan or the Oriental Yankee as I told him withreason. I also advised him that if his chef wanted a job I could recommend him to the Waldorf-Astoria. Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin January, 1936 - Castlecrag, New South Wales - Mrs. Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley Griffin Dear Mr. Griffin, I met your father. I like him very much. He was so gay and gallant. He took me to task for placing a chair for him and later handing him his cane. \"Treating me as an old man,\" heexclaimed with much indignation covering a merry twinkle. Mrs. Griffin told him about my wanting the Craig boy. His comment wittily and flatteringly suggested that there were other ways of solving the problem of an only child than by bringing up another woman's. We spoke of you. He said that if you had stayed on in the U.S.A. you would have been the first architect in New York. Mrs. Griffin said with a sweeping gesture, \"As [Note: ==== Beginning of page 71b (table of contents) ====] HAVEN VALLEY THEATRE .

I had further particulars from Mrs. Griffin of work you are undertaking in India. Of course I am delighted, but - there is no mentionof your home-coming. You've been away ages! I have a hunch that Ernest Wood may know of wealthy Indians who would be eager to have you when they know of your presence in India. Did you post him a card to Adyar? I had a letter from Komalam too last week. One sentence I'll quote. \"I should very much like to go to Australia for three months and return. If Anna (Mr. Craig's mother) can look after Baby I can go to London and finish my training so as to be employed permanently somewhere. I am afraid ofthe future.\" She has her degree of B.S. in Economics from Madras University but feels that a M.A. from outside would make all the difference in getting an appointment. (She later took that degree in the Sydney University.) I have replied with the offer to mind him (Arjuna) for as long as she needs to finish her course. If they refer to you do please give me a good name as a bringer-up of babies. The idea is not at all fantastic. Don't you throw cold water on it. Tell them my own baby is thoroughly healthy and is as happy as the day is long. While I am at home and occupied with one I could so easily deal with two. Edgar is a generous darling. He is quite willing that I should do as I feel inclined in these matters. Arjuna is one year old today and Deirdre is two. A year is a convenient interval between babies. They each have the benefit of the companionship. It is almost impossible to make up for this in the case of anonly child. Last Sunday was Ross Duncan's three year old party and all the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 72 ====] Castlecrag children turned up to it in fresh frocks and rompers and brushed hair. A couple of hours later they had to be routed out from the disheveled medley running wild on the lawn and taken forcibly home. Deirdre always takes a while to warm up to a party. She arrives pensive and coy and begins with shy advances to brown bread slices with hundreds and thousands, but with accelerating speed she deals withpopcorns and jellies and after an orange drink or two is at the stage of mounting her chair in order to get a better view of what is to be had from the table. When it is time to go home she is tearing about with not an inhibition left and has to be caught and carried off. After dark she was found in pyjamas and slippers wandering about the Duncan lawn (next door) like a ghost haunting the scene of the afternoon festivities. On Saturday night the Godfrey - Guyatt party invited me to go to one of Dorris Fitton's productions. I like the spirit of that independent group. After supper I got involved in a profound discussion with Tom Godfrey with the result that I tip-toed home at 2 A.M. He is never rude to me as I have heard him be to others though Effie says I try him sorely when I mention fairies. But in spite of fairies we are quite good friends. Pearl Bault and Sheila are with me. She says \"It is good to be at Castlecrag when you are introuble. There is healing in this patch of earth.\" Harold Morton said of Charles' passing:- \"We could not have borne it anywhere else than in Castlecrag.\" Herewith a snapshot taken by Mrs. Griffin of your God-daughter. Is she not rather nice? Ronald Craig's mother may build in Castlecrag. She does not make lightning decisions as Ron did but has something of his pleasantness in action once she has made up her mind.

Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley Griffin 6 February, 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin - You can be content that you have not been on this trip heretofore because there would be no escape for you from going back to drafting. Nor have I found any effective alternative for either of us for that seems to be the thing thatneeds doing here now, and it is somewhat hard to account for where there is such a superfluity of qualified labor in almost every field. If the Ahmedabad project comes to anything it will be worthy of the architectural traditions of boldness, taste and skill that constituted basis of that town (then larger than London) \"the most beautiful city in the world\" five centuries ago. [Note: At this point in the New-York Historical Society copy the following line appears:]AHMEDABAD TOWN HALL [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] My client engineer with the second story of his house all awry is a born compromiser and I have neither the time nor the patience to argue all the issues he raises. It is too much to expect of anyone that hechange his character and his character it will have to be that is expressed in his muddled house. The only cinema I have seen since the \"Crusades\" is \"Les Miserables\" of the March-Laughton interpretation that I missed in Sydney, a much more forceful and telling one than possible on the silent screen. What is astounding about such plays with a purpose is that they can be so popular without apparently affecting men's thoughts or behavior. Perhaps the appearances are a little deceptive, but theadventure of giving is hardly given credence anywhere in Christendom since the case of Huge's [Note: Victor Hugo's?] bishop. I am wishing myself many happy returns of my Valentine (His wife's birthday) being too late to wish you the same. We are just rushing off to the mail for Ahmedabad the plans and covering letter for Mr. Alagappan's tender for the Municipal Offices. This 14 hours per day schedule however has not left me Page 57 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoany time for subsidiary letters but I am taking note of them for an early opportunity. Just after suggesting that you could address me here Mr. Alagappan has made an appointment for me to see [Note: ==== Beginning of page 74 ====] Rishi Valley trust in Benares next Tuesday the 18th. By the way the emphasis is on the last syllable of his name in this Hindi which sounds so much like French. Our Mogul client No. 1 always addresses him as Mr. Alla Gappa and says that with such a name he can go anywhere. Anent Mr. Nicholls admonitions against economizing, the Raja expressed an immovable prejudice against pressed cement ornament which is done so excellently and cheaply - and generally - here in Lucknow. I exhausted all my arguments for the sake of the elaborate ornament I was recommendinguntil yesterday when he explained that he wanted it carved in stone! I find that the Indian workman, who \"cannot read plans\" and is \"so stupid that he cannot be told anything\" and is therefore \"incapable of innovation\" as interpreted by the European misunderstanding, is one who is capable of carrying out anything , as soon as he knows what is wanted, and is not satisfied with mere abstractions nor formulas which are all the usual architect can generally supply and which must therefore result in mechanism. I have just learned one Indian word - \"verandha\" [Note: i.e., veranda] through Mr. Alagappan's correction of my draft of his letter to Ahmedabad of the word that every draftsman since America has changed from veranda by adding the \"h.\" Of the six ways in Sanskrit of rendering broad \"a\" the distinctly aspirated one with the accent is correct. This long lack of distinction of refinements of language on the part of both peoples makes mutual understanding difficult and curtails intercourse afterthree centuries of living together; \"nabob\" for \"nawab\" is as close as they generally get to the mark but the fact that the masters have had to learn the language of their life-long servants, even if after a fashion, seems to show that the Indians' difficulties are even greater than theirs. I am getting nearer and nearer to the bottom of the European fetish which has made all the good houses, of this part of India at any rate, as uninhabitable as the Australian houses were when we first went there.The palaces of Agra and Delhi and Fatephur, etc., on the other hand, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 75b (table of contents) ====] STONE TRACERY WINDOWS .

The Rajah when pressed by me finally said that of the three seasons in India the cool season was about seven months and the hot season and wet season halved the remainder between them including May and June in the former and July and August in the latter. Mrs. Palmer is habitually on the verandha [Note: i.e., veranda] to get the sun during the day. The salvation of my cottage is the open doors to the East in the forenoon and the sunlight windows on the West side in the afternoon and I would not trade it for any respectable bungalow I have visited. One of the paradoxes ofthe European bungalow life is that after shivering around grate fires in gloom two thirds of the year, the occupants habitually spend the remaining four months in \"the Hills\" to escape the heat their homes were fictitiously designed to preclude. The Englishman who superintends the buildings and grounds of the University here and who has lived in India most of his life says to me that he scarcely remembers what the hot season is like since he has taken good care never to be here that season! The whole of NewDelhi is as I have said before duplicated at Simla and presumably on the basis of such experience and judgment as of this Mr. Smith.

His is the characteristic temperamentof the new \"Democracy\" that believes in unanimity of opinion. Hence he is forever trotting out objections that have been raised after exhaustive canvass by all parties concerned. However he has sent to me the Authority from Aligarth University for I am to prepare the designs for their Medical College and Hospital . One thing about this predominance of the intellect in India is that though it can subvert through intellectual pride it means impersonality and does not subvert decision through sympathy and antipathy , the feelings, that have so often thwarted my efforts. On such terms I am reconciled to having no personal relationships for a while anyway. My landlady who was born in India and has lived here 75 years is not Indian in this sense yet and I have failed to outwit her in the game I have been playing with her afternoon tea. My Bengal draftsman has chosen Calcutta working hours - 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. without intermission, for five and a half dayswhich is much better than the 10 to 4 period seven days in the week of the previous recruit who was from Government not private previous employment. When the bearer brought out my pot of tea and cakes at 4 P.M. I sent him back for an extra cup which he brought with frowns and grumbling and for which Mrs. P. at dinner lectured me on sharing with an Indian and one whose caste I didn't know. I cannot argue with her because she is so deaf, so on the next occasion I turned the whole tray over to mylunchless assistant because I am already dopey in the afternoon from over-hearty lunches.

Of course there is no question ofreligious scruple in this for all Indians are equally heathen to her. The complex is not hard to fathom but all but impossible to combat. The only heathen worse than the others are my Raja clients because they build Zenana quarters as has been the custom for thousands of years. I am told that the recent restoration of Lucknow to primacy, as Capital of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh was brought about by Sir Harcourt Butler when Governor, out of recognition of the financialand cultural supremacy of the Mohammedans whose center it is in the provinces the majority of whose inhabitants are Hindus, who are in the majority at Allahabad the erstwhile capital. Mr. Alagappan, a Hindu of Hindus, approves the policy that has encouraged the development of this city out of all comparison with what it has been since the reign of the Moghuls. (A British method of gaining power Page 60 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoby dividing India into 2 groups.)

Since there are but few telephones private or in shops those who wish to communicate with me send their own private uniformed messengers who wait for a written reply acknowledgment or receipt. When or if I move to the Carlton Hotel, the best place in Lucknow, as Mr. Alagappan advises, I presume Ishall have the problem of devising the appropriate gold braid for my lackey. In discussing with Mr. Chowdry [Note: Chowdray?, Chowdhury?] just now the advantage of a septic tank here, he points to the overlooked difficulty that in dispensing with one of the servants the Palmers would lose caste to that extent. - 4 March - Mr. Alagappan finds that I can carry points with his clients that he cannot and says that the typical wealthy Indian [Note: ==== Beginning of page 78b (table of contents) ====] GROUND PLAN .

Working here is necessarily a gamble with numerous unknown factors but for some unknown reason, perhaps a good one not yet discovered, there is a considerable field here for my particular kind of work without any effective competition. Mr. Young, the Pioneer editor, says this is a fact but is equally at a loss to account for it in a world where the struggle for work and opportunity is desperate and nowhere worse than in India. Naturally I am lookingout for the \"catch\" and moving in a more cautions way than otherwise.

Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Ula Maddocks. At last, a week ago today, we put Page 61 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe final touches on the plans and specifications for the Library, including 15 sheets of blue prints of which four or five concerned furniture and grounds and layouts thereof. It was all enjoyable except too long-drawn-out by reason of the excessive checks and balances of the University. Of course there arestill things to be done that will take time, engineering works particularly that however need not go on before the construction is started. I have designed two buildings since, redesigning another and am on the elevations stage of two others whose plans are I believe settled now, and am feeling almost caught up in my work so far as it was not left with me to make the initial move which I shall do next with three other buildings whilst getting on with working drawings through my new experimental draftsmanmeantime. It sounds almost like organization of the work, but that is too good a name for this one-horse show yet. We have entered on a transition season strangely enough a combination of Spring and Autumn. Though there have been no rains, annual plants are springing up out of the ground magically and straightway blooming. On the erstwhile barren areas of my back door-yard are beautiful thistle-like weeds a foot anda half high bearing many yellow prickly poppies. The deadly nightshade datura, which is a perennial probably, is bearing white cornucopias 5 inches long but I am most [Note: ==== Beginning of page 79 ====] interested in a \"ground carpet\" of which one tiny-leaved dark mat is showing brightness in the sun and most attractive of all a miniature pinkish white convolvulus in crowns one inch high by a foot or two in diameter is sparkling with flowers in the mornings. This plant I find in the dooryard of the hottest part atthe base of a south fronting brick wall, amongst loose rocks under a tree and even in the trodden areas of the motor turn where the only other living thing is an occasional tuft of couch grass. Nobody in the household or amongst the guests has ever stopped to notice such a plant if any plant at all and so I only surmise that it is an evergreen perennial from my four months experience during which it has bloomed off and on. The crown looks old and if I dig one up I expect to find it deep-rooted because it seemsutterly indifferent to drought. Hence on the surface it seems to have the qualities I have been looking for to make a substitute for grass in many places where the care, watering, trimming and holding in check of grass are objectionable. The beautiful little-trampled lawns on which the Moghuls based their wonderful garden schemes required constant flo oding and moving to keep them bright, and the more democratic and povertystricken inheritors of these glories have had to let them fade. The University is an example and I am still battling for the preservation only of the arch-bridged stone-rimmed canal-like tank there because Dr. Walli Mohammed and others \"cannot see\" when it will be possible ever again to fill this with water. It is designed for irrigation purposes, higher than the surrounding gardens and would cost nothing for water on this account but requires only that the steam pump be removed to the river a third of a mile away andconnected with such a pipe as I laid down to the Haven Estate and which still supplies the Kanevsky's and your house amongst others. This tank, by the way, must have cost as much as the new library itself and is a thing of beauty without any water to all except those who can see the dead leaves strewn over the bottom demanding Page 62 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 80b (table of contents) ====] NO. 5.

We have tried geraniums and the cerulean blue convolvulus sauritanicus for turfing lawns at our Heidelberg, Victoria, home but though extremely lovely these plants presented the impediment of six inches in height and were subject to damage by trampling. I tried several years ago to obtain Lippia canescens from Peredynia Gardens, Ceylon, and managed to carry a few specimens that gradually dwindled from San Francisco to Auckland years ago and got no farther, for the same purpose in Australia that might possibly be served by this threepenny size sparkling morning glory yet to beidentified here. The Autumn side of nature here just now is the fact that a large portion of the native trees on the streets and elsewhere shed their leaves most unexpectedly if gradually and for no apparent seasonal reason. There is no grand display of color, merely browning yellowing of the leaves and I am told the new ones will be back in a fortnight. Since the trees do not shed simultaneously the evergreen character of thelandscape is not materially changed but there is less shade when more is beginning to be wanted.

Here we are just off the middle of March when the \"punkah\" fans are supposed to be put into operation and after the University hours have gone into summer schedule. 6 to 10:30 a.m., and I find two blankets none too much in the night and bicycling perfectlycomfortable at noontime. We are getting a price on air-conditioning for the Library which comes to about the initial outlay needed for punkah fans, and discussing the problem with one of the architectural staff of the Public Works Department the really insufferable season boils down to about a fortnight in June just before the monsoon when the hot dry spell means 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Of course we are still comfortable in this shack whose main drawback is the bare land all around it devoid of lawns or [Note: ==== Beginning of page 81 ====] Page 63 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoshrubberies to mitigate dust which if there is no wind to blow it up is whisked all over everything by the sweepers with their four foot long bunch of broomstraws. This stirring up and smoothing out of the dust on the roads, the yards and the floors is the nominal function of the \"untouchables\" now beingcalled \"harijans\" (sons of God) by the politicians and their organizers. For the past week I have been occupied with my tracer in working out the elevations and details for the houses in hand including the stone carving for the zenana at Jahangirabad. Mr. Alagappan thinks we should be taking our swing around the circle. He has already written to the newly segregated [Note: Handwritten insertion into the typescript \"(British scheme - Divide & Rule.)\"] Province of Orissa where they are already engaged upon selecting a site for their new Capital City and he is sending to their engineer a set of plans of the Lucknow Library. Apparently this spring time is the maximum of the flowering seasons without any of the obvious physical preliminaries of causes such as \"April showers bring spring flowers.\" In the parks and generally there are herbaceous beds and borders, largely annuals, by the acre almost, the real prototypesof the illustrations of the perfected types and selected color blends. Amongst the native trees Erythrina Indica is not only the gay specimen but a mere representative amongst large trees with brilliant red flowers, such as the Silk Cotton Tree, characterizing the warmth ether. And although there is only an occasional red or yellow amongst the fading and falling leaves some of the new leaves as in the case of the Kusam form a lace-like covering more brilliant than the scarlet maple and towering well above theaverage. For these three days there is a visiting troupe of \"Balinese\" dancers at the theatre. At first they were Balinese \"released for the first time for foreign performance by their King.\" Now they are advertised as 20 Balinese and 20 Javanese dancers, but Mr. Chowdray [Note: Chowdry?, Chowdhury?] (a sculptor) who is again staying here a while, knows the leading girl as a Bengalese of Calcutta so probably thewhole performance is an imitation if [Note: ==== Beginning of page 82b (table of contents) ====] BANK .

With Mr. Chowdray [Note: Chowdry?, Chowdhury?] I did attend a benefit presentation or exhibition rather of the rather worn film of \"Chand Dass\" which is the best known of the Indian talkies and which enjoyed a run of a year and a quarter in Calcutta some time ago.The theme and its presentation were somewhat obvious and lacking in action, for Westerners, but without affectation and the singing of the leading parts was especially delightful. The interior settings were rich but not aesthetically idealized as they would have been in Hollywood. Such a piece would Page 64 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagotherefore be unsuited for foreign screenings such as have been successful for German and French spoken films, but peculiarly adapted to the realist Hindu. JHANSI BANK - DOMED CEILING [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] In a set of plans for the bank at Jhansi, I had demarked the square banking chamber with an intersecting arc dome and had even studied out the methods of calculating the single rowlock brick vaulting that would serve for both shells which, erected without centering and with relatively little reinforcing, makesa specially appropriate covering in this climate for important rooms. I shall be using this expedient in houses maybe. For some time I could not find out why my arguments of economy, insulation, appearance, etc. had no effect with Mr. Alagappan until he was obliged to say that Hindus do not use domes which are the prerogative of the Mohammedans! Of course, all the ancient Hindu domes are corbelled, and on the other hand the Muslim predilection for domes came from Christian Byzantium.But in some Hindu University work Mr. Alagappan had been forced to employ huge steel beams because the practical expedient of the arch was tabu. Here at least I am on the other side of the fence in case of prejudice and after decades of fighting for flat roofs can yield to its use in this case with good grace. And yet there are Buddhists of the Stupa tradition and Islamites to turn to for domes for variety, but Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Mohammedans andZoroastrians must all be distinguished by their buildings as well as by their costumes and their names, like [Note: ==== Beginning of page 83 ====] Quasir Rowland. As the Mohammedans are restricted to the permutations and combinations of the names of some twenty prophets only it is easier to distinguish them from others than it is to differentiate between them. Of course Anthroposophy makes it possible for us to understand these differences inarchitectural requirements through a knowledge of the phylogenetic sequence of the creative ethers and so the underlying spiritual influences in the sequence of the civilizations [Note: Handwritten insertion into the typescript \"the 1st, the Warmth Ether manifesting in Spheres, Light in triangles, Sound in crescents, Life in quadrangles\"]. There is now an Air Mail to Australia on Sunday as well as on Thursday so I shall not have to compress all my correspondence into one day. Walter Burley Griffin toMarion Mahony Griffin 17 March, 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin - Still going like a scalded cat I have felt that I was coming to a hiatus this week with two clients off to distant parts before seeing their sketches, and others with work to be done and who are seemingly impatient who have failed to follow up with the requisite data for me to go on. The alternative bank plans went to Agra but therehas been no time to hear which if either has found favor. The Raja however calls twice daily at least to see that there is no letting up of the pace. Mrs. Palmer acquired nine choice eggs recently and now has five chicks from them. I have not started counting what may hatch from the 20 odd embryonic jobs in hand which would make me too busy to Page 65 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoenjoy life were they to pop out of their shells all at once. But this is far from likely where the consideration of time is so casual as it is in India. Yesterday the Director of Industries of the United Provinces came in from Cawnpore after I had gone out on quest for blue printing and said he would call this morning about 9:30. I waited until 11:30 before delivering to the University the prints promised for the early morning and so missed the Director again. However he made a third call this afternoon to tell me that I was wanted to make the scheme for the Industries' Exposition to be held on a forty acre tract in Lucknow in December. Tomorrow I am to inspect the site. This business emanated from the Editor of \"The Pioneer.\" Though I had heard [Note: ==== Beginning of page 84 ====] nothing of this project it seems that it is comparable only to an exposition in Allahabad before the war which was backed by the Government and cost seven lakhs. It has been 98 degrees on the verandha [Note: i.e., veranda] the last two afternoons but a \"wet bulb\" would show that equivalent to no more than 90 degrees in Chicago I am sure. Hot enough in the sun but breezy inside and cool and comfortable in the evenings and nights. In looking for the DeputyCommissioner of the American Consul I visited the Lucknow Christian College which is a huge institution with large buildings and grounds, the earlier ones designed by [Note: Henry V.] Lanchester. This is another of the American Missionary enterprises that are so much in evidence in India. It is a college institution in the Australian sense in that the students are of all ages. The Principal was away on leave but the acting Principal to whom I was introduced was looking for professional advice as towhether there was not a possible satisfactory alternative to the system of design and construction that makes all the houses in India uninhabitable practically for an American. He brought out most of the points I have complained of to you in my letters and I may hear from him since their house is such a good investment for the institution that they can expand in that direction. I have had the opportunity of looking through another, possibly typical, Indian house on the order of theone adjoining the Civil Station (Hazratganj) for which I am to do a new Zenana. In the newer instances the two story house rambles over an irregular site with two courtyards and a dozen bedrooms arranged with a jumble of stairs, baths, latrines and \"drawing rooms\" to make contained flats for the families of the various sons of the prosperous stationer from whom I get my drawing materials. He is demolishing an equivalent area for further extension of this communal home in the Chaulk facing one road which is perhaps 9 feet wide and another which dwindles to 3 feet 11 inches. The rooms are no more [Note: \"Chaulk\" is perhaps \"chauk\" and is defined by WBG as a \"bazaar center\" (Section I, No. 3, p. 56).] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 85 ====] Page 66 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothan 8 feet wide possibly because of the economic limits of flat roofs constructed without steel beams or reinforcements, but the courtyards, open to the sky, were cool to the point of chilliness in striking contrast to the streets outside, in the middle of the hottest day so far this season. The theory ofcourtyards as collecting basins for the cool air of the night on the principle of the refrigerator which is open only at the top seems to be borne out here. If it were not so I can conceive of the Indians as baked in the ovens that their clustered congested houses, with few if any outside windows or cross drafts, would be. The cheerlessness of the cramped quarters with no view and little light, where even the roofs are high parapeted for privacy was not, in this case, compensated for by any charm such as might obtainwith all the picturesque possibilities of interiors of varying levels, and the impression was of confusion and squalor. In chatting with the Civil Servant who does my blue-printing I discovered that the Public Works Department have been busy with the plans for the Exposition which is an All-India and International affair. And what do you think the materials they are providing for are? Light steel framing andcorrugated galvanized iron! And this in a region where they can be guaranteed to have no rain during the whole season of the fair and so there is here available the cheapest form of temporary construction that is used everywhere in the village - Bamboo frame work with woven cane lathing and mud and cow dung plastering both sides, all whitewashed in tints. Evidently the engineers are working on the unfortunate precedent of the Chicago Fair hoping that standardized materials will have a full salvagevalue. I shall give this policy short shrift when the matter comes into my hands. If there would be one thing better adapted than anything else to discourage patronage it would be such housing. I am reverting to the reading of a Steiner lecture before getting out of bed in the morning and have already encompassed your translation [Note: ==== Beginning of page 86b (table of contents) ====] MUNICIPAL INCINERATOR .

After three or four days in Lucknow last week Mr. Alagappan is off on another trip for a week going as far as Rajamundry in Orissa where incidentally is the paper mill for which I am supposed to be working out the water supply scheme. I will have to gain an idea of the quantities required from a study of the Lucknow Paper Mill.

It seems to me much better that he should go instead of myself to meet the drive that you are in. I am cross with Nicholls for saying anything about money for there is plenty here as he himself said when he showed me the cable, saying he put it in only to try to make you feel that you should occasionally collect some of your fees. I only hope you recognize it as a bit of Nichollism and that I wasnot a party to it. Mr. Nicholls sees to it that Mr. Dowland pays his quota on his back rent regularly. Mr. Herbert gave his second lecture at Kings Hall on Man and Animal and was given great applause at the end. They have asked him to continue as often as he will. Miss Drummond again next Sunday. Kings Hall will be turning Anthro if they don't watch out. I have resumed after vacation time, the children's paintinglessons, Josephine (Keller, next door to Johnston's) and Ross being the new comers and Kaaren too having won the fight with her mother. She's the cutest piece ever, is will personified and so sweet withal, but simply must make her own decisions. On Mrs. Trinick's initiative the kindergarten isflourishing under the Mothers again, Mrs. Duncan takes them Monday morning with tramps through the valley, Trinick Tuesday, Kelleher (Who is a bit of a sculptor) Wednesday, I Thursday and CappyFriday. The problem in finger painting now is to get pigments that are not permanent. Do you know any such? These I have stain hands, clothes and bath tub. Friday Miss Violet Roach of the Hotel Australia who once wrote an article on Castlecrag and who is now secretary of the Australia Travel [Note: ==== Beginning of page 87 ====] Association, came out here with a young American and his wife - Mr. and Mrs. Furness. David Jones department store is back of this, the idea being to get Australia better known in the U.S. and they paid the expenses of this reporter to come over and write up articles in America. It was on Mr. Furness' own request that he came out here. He had seen Canberra and wanted to see you. Failing you he asked to see me. Deans brought them out by the way of the bridges, Pyrmount Incinerator, Pymble and Killara houses. He seemed intelligent and I gave him a Canberra plan and pamphlet. The time was short but hegot a few things right perhaps. Possibly this is a Threefold Commonwealth movement to bring the Economic interests to an understanding without going through the Political instruments. Saturday Elizabeth Guy gave Bronwen a farm party and all Castlecrag mothers and children were there, five packed car-loads, my claim to all of the children being of course recognized. It was a lovely day, and wonderfully planned. The children all pirates, bright bandannas wound round their heads andgradually stripping to a string around their waists with a palm or fig leaf dangling therefrom, a search for treasure, a bonfire feast at which Beth did all sorts of wonderful things, rides on the pony the whole tribe of pirates with their gay colors trailing around after the horse, a tree planting - a really wonderful afternoon. When I came home I stretched out on the couch to read the Atlantic [Note: March, 1936] and started with their featured article, the first, some 12 pages long, and spent the evening shouting with Page 68 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagolaughter and wiping the consequent tears from my cheeks. It is by a child twelve years old. The title is \"I, Patience.\" [Note: At this point in both the New-York Historical Society and Art Institute copies the following line appears:] INCINERATOR [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found above on page \"86b (table of contents)\" may have been intended to be placed here.] Last night (Sunday) after rehearsal of Everyman and tea we all went down to Kings Hall to hear Miss Drummond's lecture on Goethe, the Scientist, and Faust. It was an inspired talk and she rounded up with the point the Theosophists lack, the search for the grail, man's perfected body the chalice, the Ego through the Christ filling it with [Note: ==== Beginning of page 88 ====] the Holy Spirit. Mr. Stoker comes in every day now to go over his lines. His antipathy to the Christian initiation made it hard for him to memorize. Everyman is a tremendous role. I heard it in Chicago when a girl. Mr. Blake took me. It was one of the greatest dramatic impressions I ever got but it was practically given as a monologue not as a drama which, as we give it, is a valley filling thing. Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin 26 March, 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin - We had a long and satisfactory session with the Provincial Engineer and his assistant yesterday over the working plans and specifications of the Library. There is no reason why this could not have happened about a month ago in accordance with our schedule except for the indecisions of the Librarian. There were no objections on the part of the building authorities to anything. One continually meets with difficulty in getting details or instructions carried out. Col. Haig of the I.W.B. says that he can never get any instructions carried out by the craftsmen no matter how reasonable or expedient they may be. As soon as his back is turned the worker proceeds as he was doing before, in his accustomed way, because he considers himself a qualified tradesman which the architect is not. Unless the Mistri (foreman) can be convinced that the instructions are reasonable, which is likely only after long experience with the particular architect, the workers will not be moved from their customaryways. From the Mistry [Note: foreman, overseer], provided the latter has been persuaded, they will take and carry out instructions because he is their equal, being a qualified tradesman in their craft. This system has preserved a standard of workmanship from the degradation that has superseded in Western countries. At the same time it exacts qualifications of the architect as masters in the respective crafts which they have not kept up and the craftsmanship has become fixed and stationary in consequence.This was borne home to me last night at the first comprehensive Village Industries exhibition of all India which was opened by Mahatma Gandhi here in Lucknow in connection with the forthcoming Congress. Page 69 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoHe spoke in the open and I heard [Note: ==== Beginning of page 89c (table of contents) ====] JHANSI BANK . FLAT ROOFED [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript. The structure is theJawala Bank at Jhansi.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 89 (typescript) ====] every word through the agency of the \"Chicago Radio\" but it was all in Hindustani and as good as Greek to me. The bulk of India consists in the 300,000 villages whose products are exhibited, also theprocesses themselves of deft handiwork in all materials which bring such a miserable pittance to the producers, perhaps one meal a day. Certainly the prices were tempting and highly competitive with the machine products in all lines. I can sympathize with the tremendous self-sacrificing efforts of Mr. Gandhi and the organization he leads for the purpose of popularizing these home products and giving continuous employment in thevillage and moreover a decent living for the Indians. But, as he said in his speech, the ordinary bazaars would be much more crowded during the evening than this exhibition. Amongst the thousands who were there I failed to notice a single person of European extraction. The exhibits are simply housed in shelters mostly of wicker mats and the whole has been done through voluntary labor by devotees who have in some cases been months finding their way afoot. Three hours I spent there with a young University student who found himself at the inner gate with a ticket (8 annas) and a bicycle and with no place to put the latter. This was my predicament also except that I had been unable to get a padlock whereas he had been able to borrow one with which at his suggestion our two \"wheels\" were locked together and left outside; and even the lanterns were still on them when we came out at 8:30 P.M. JHANSI BANK [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here. Yesterday I had a surprise visit from our Agra client, the owner of fourteen banks, who arrived in his car with a guard who patrolled the front of my cottage with his rifle over his shoulder during the fewminutes of the visit in the manner of Government House. He brought with him the three alternative sketches for the Jhansi branch that had been sent to him some weeks ago. Meantime the building has been constructed up to plinth level, 3 feet above grade. When I suggested that it was too much to expect a client to decide between elevations which were purely [Note: ==== Beginning of page 90 (table of contents) ====] Page 70 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright of ChicagoGRIFFIN HOME .

Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin 29 March, 1936 - Cawnpore - Walter Burley Griffin to Eric Nicholls - Thank you for your report, also the handbook. I agree as to everything done or proposed. Mr. Young has decided to take his six month's leave from the Pioneer, in England, at Doctor's orders, on account of his wife's illness and is flying off on the 18th May. He has offered me the use of his house rent free if I elect to stay in Lucknow but of course this involves the retention of cook and perhaps the other servants, also car and chauffeur if I wish. This would work out at least as economically as The Carlton Hotel and be eminently desirable. Ofcourse if the Exposition eventuates it will be the solution of my problem here. Mr. Young advises strongly against plunging Marion into the Lucknow summer and I am waiting to see what it may be like. This I am writing on the verandha [Note: i.e., veranda] of the Cawnpore West post office which is closed for some reason. It is the Chamber of Commerce Building where Shrivastova, whom I came to see, and Mr. Young who drove me over are both attending a meeting. Cawnpore reminds me of anAmerican inland town in many ways. The largest textile mills are much in evidence and the interesting town is a park to all intents and purposes with large home places and tree enveloped meandering roadway drives. The bricks of the buildings are more in evidence than in the predominantly plastered Lucknow. Walter Burley Griffin to Eric M. Nicholls HOME OF MARION MAHONY GRIFFIN - CASTLECRAG [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] 30 March, 1936 - Castlecrag - Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin - With all our feasting on fruit these days, I was wondering if you got much of a variety there and what your fruits are. Your pictures of the flora and the climate have been most interesting. The young man in my Wednesdaygroup, Mr. Latter, my Anthroposophic son he calls himself, has joined the Society and his card has gone to Dornach. Mr. and Mrs. Searby often come Fridays as well as Wednesdays and bring me home afterward and stay [Note: ==== Beginning of page 91 ====] visiting and talking Anthro with me afterward till midnight, and Mr. Searby (Chiropractor) is sending one mother after another of his patients to consult me about their children. Page 71 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThursday evening I went to Joan Hammond's farewell concert (a pupil of Lute Drummond's who is being sent to Vienna to train as an opera singer, another Melba. You see they live down here in the water hemisphere - the realm of the Sound Ether) in the Town Hall. A full house and very appreciative,a beautiful concert. I am sending the program by regular mail. Joan with her black hair looked lovely in a pale blue dress with white shoes and gloves one of the ladies had given her, and Lute Drummond looked perfectly beautiful and like an angel, in a long drapey, silver (not grey, silver) gown and golden hair a halo, and played superbly, the most perfect accompanist I ever heard except perhaps the leader of the Boston symphony orchestra, Nikish [Note: Arthur Nikisch?], who used to play accompaniments forthe soloists in the concerts. She and Joan were as one. It is all like a wonderful fairy story. Next Thursday I am going to a dinner party at Pakies [Note: a Sydney cafe owned by Augusta Macdougall]. Mrs. Prehn (captain) in inviting me said it was wonderful to see how everyone loved me. It was a nice tell for her to pass on wasn't it? The series of concerts of Joan's have brought in \u00a31250 with which she sets sail for Europe on Saturday. If you had been at that concert you would have realizedwhat a power Lute is in Sydney. (She was the founder of Opera in Australia. Was the only one who had an opera score.) The man in \"Everyman\" thought we ought to have an evening rehearsal for the placing and attending of the lights so after spending yesterday (Sunday) afternoon making costumes, at six o'clock we went down to the valley. We all felt it helped tremendously and eliminated worries for the comingperformances. It was a full-moon night so we all enjoyed being down there. We have been most favored in the midst of very frequent rains in having good Sundays for our rehearsals. The fairies appreciate our recognition of them and our safeguarding of their haunts.

The chrysanthemums are coming out beautifully for the Easter Festival, and the peach-blossom ti-tree all over the Crag has been more lovely and a more vivid pink than ever this year. Lute told me to be sure to tell you about it. The Council gained nothing by taking the taxes to the court and everything is now running on an even keel for a year anyhow. Dr. Rivett's study over his garage and the nurses' quarters with the tennis courtthis side (west) of it are making a very attractive and imposing group. Will try to get photos to send you. Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin Page 72 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoLIVING ROOM - HOME OF MARION MAHONY GRIFFIN - CASTLECRAG [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] 6 April, 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin - The warm weather here is much like Sydney's 96 degrees with considerable breeze and comfortable nights so far. At Cawnpore to which Mr. Young took me to visit Sir Jwala Prasid Shivastova, Minister of Education. etc. etc. I had a delightful outing. Here is a self-made man who controls large woolen mills who was educated at Manchester University and has been building himself a huge mansion, costly and ostentatious, withoutprofessional advice except from the 60 visitors such as I who have been invited to criticise. As the building was long beyond the stage where it might be cured, I confined my criticism to commendation of the unusual amount of light and air provided. However he was starting work on his 17 acre garden and I revised his drive-way arrangement presuming that no later critic has interfered. Even with such a type, the Knighthood is carried as a pocket weapon and no one addresses him as \"Sir,\" and in seekinghis address I found he is known as \"J.P.\" to distinguish him from his two brothers. While I was there he rang up the bungalow of the Director of Industries on whom I called in style with the Young's car and chauffeur. My competitors for the Exposition I was told are the firm of Ford and MacDonald, \"Architects, Engineers and Contractors\" whose factotum Mr. Souter [Note: ==== Beginning of page 93 ====] is also the Chairman of the \"Cawnpore Improvement Trust.\" However I quoted a price for a general plan which seemed to interest the Director and, as he requested, sent the next day an estimate of the cost of a unit of quadrangle frontage according to my own notion of plastic construction, not galvanized iron which they have in mind. This housing to the extent of a room 10'X12' comes to about Rs.40 net for the structure and an additional Rs.35 for embellishments, arcade lanterns, pinnacles, signs, banners, etc. and the whole takes the form of Pyramids, domes, arcades, etc. After my visit the Lucknow assistant calledand showed me over the site and said he would be seeing me again with the survey feature plan of the whole of Victoria Park which has been allocated to them. If this comes off I shall accept Mr. Young's proposal. My servitors would consist Electricity Rs.25, Household books, Rs.60. The above would provide for entertainment to some extent and as much comfort as there is anywhere here, at an advance of 50% on the primitive living in the Anglo-Indian section. Mr. Chowdry [Note: Chowdray?, Chowdhury?], the Hindustani who occasionally stops here, reports meeting American missionaries in almost every town he visits. It is astounding to see the extent to which education in India, in the European sense, has depended on the Americans. The institutions named for the British such as \"Canning College,\" \"Hewitt Institute\" etc., are merely Indian orGovernmental enterprises paid for by the Indian taxpayers and named after the British Governor for the time being. And this is true of the Churches which are the established Church whose clergy are paid out of the Indian taxes as part of the cost of the British military protection. The American contributors to the Europeanizing of India would be interested to know how much their Page 73 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoactivities have redounded to the success of British Investors and commercial interests who seem to be acknowledged as the rightful monopolists. One thing that may eventually undermine the British control is a thing that is being depended on to sustain it - a [Note: ==== Beginning of page 94b (table of contents) ====] EXPOSITION . JEWEL ARCADE . UNIT FOR BIDS FOR CONTRACT [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript. Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.

To hear from a Minister of the Crown the recital of cases of abduction of young women of all grades by this service is enough to stimulate such disparaging comment on imperialism as above indulged in. I have been interrupted by a visit of two officials of the Exposition who are anxious to get their ideas formulated, and a scheme to publish and circulate amongst the prospective visitors especially exhibitors. It seems that the Director of Industries (and of the Exposition) is still off on a trip with \"J.P.\", the Minister. At each visit I have thrown out some further hints of what I have in mind and evidently these officers are attracted by them. Anyway they are sending a preliminary survey plan tomorrow for me to operate upon in anticipation of a meeting of the Authorities on the 22nd. Mr. Young will be getting intouch with Shrivastova on his return hoping to get my authorization in order. The Librarian has been a perfect pest with his procrastination and unwillingness to shoulder responsibility for action. A specimen chair is now being made in my bathroom! and his demand for complete calculations for all the construction has been putting me through a course of sprouts in Rigid frame construction, the most difficult part of reinforced construction. Walter Burley Griffin to MarionMahony Griffin (Ultimately the librarian lost his job at about the time the foundations were completed.) JEWEL ARCADE - UNIT FOR COST ESTIMATES [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] 13 April, 1936 - Castlecrag - Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin - The Easter Festival over. A storm Sunday night so the play didn't come off so will be given next Sunday and the Sunday following. All sorts of things happened but nothing that prevented the Festival's being a very pleasant success. Miss Beale gave a lecture a fortnight ago and found herself sick after it. Naturally it takes longer to recover from the effects of so serious an operation than she realized so we wouldn't [Note: ==== Beginning of page 95b (table of contents) ====] Page 74 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 of INDIA EXPOSITION .

Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 95 ====] let her take the strain, so Saturday I gave a lecture instead on the Four Ethers in connection with the human organism which I have never touched on in my previous talks; and tied it up with Dr. Pfeiffer's recent publication on the diagnosis of all diseases and their allocation to special organs by means of investigating the crystals of the blood. The Hectors were here for all sessions. Mr. Hector is talking about giving his color organ to the valley theatre. My piano has been at the Deans' for some six months. Little Kaaren tried for some time to work out the problem of why it was there and finally came to me with such a knowing tilt of her little head and such a look of understanding and said - \"I know, you used to let Clarmyra (my niece in Chicago) use the piano and now you are letting me use it.\" Irven has her baby dancing class there these days with Cappy (Kaaren's mother) at the piano. Miss Drummond's Lecture was on Lohengrin illustrated on the piano and was given there, and that wee mite Kaaren sat the whole program through in her nighty gown and scarcely took her eyes off Lute in her simple flowing pale blue gown and her constant graceful gestures. Any suggestion that Kaaren should go to bed was met with a shrug of her shoulders and not even a turning of her eyes. I saw Lute's aura for the first time, a lovely golden radiance encircling her head. The creative art forces have risen andtaken the place of the normal intellectual forces there. Lute said if she had known the baby was going to be there she would have made her talk for her but there was no need for doing that. It was a marvelous evening. What a story when you know it Anthroposophically. ALL INDIA EXPOSITION - LUCKNOW [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page wasintended to be placed here.] Sunday morning I had to go down to the valley with the carpenter at 7:30 A.M. to locate and start the work on the pergola for the festival colonnaded pavilion and table for the convivial scene for the opening of \"Everyman.\" Mr. Stoker has been rehearsing his lines, which constitute almost the whole play, every day this week. He won't [Note: ==== Beginning of page 96 ====] mind having another week on them. I got back at 10:30 to Mr. Herbert's continuation of \"Man and Animal\" which he gives in a very masterful way now, that amazing turning upside down of [Note: Ernst] Haeckel's tree of evolution, making man the original creation out of which all else has come, MissBeale stayed both nights with me, and Pakie [Note: Augusta Macdougall] Sunday night and tonight, and old Mr. Harrison of course. Miss Drummond and Bette Ainsworth broke into the Nicholls' house and Page 75 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagostayed there, Mr. Nicholls being up in the mountains on a week's holiday, Mrs. N. and Glyn in Melbourne for a month. Sunday afternoon another emergency to be met. Mr. Lightband was in bed with a cold. Fortunately I had set aside a chapter I had recently translated to meet possible needs, one labeled - An Easter Meditation - a chapter on chance showing that there is no such thing but that all this realm falls under spiritual law. It shows that what appears to be chance gives us a tie-over to the spiritual realms in this mechanical age of natural law, and enables us to resurrect the spirit in ourselves. It makes us realize that we have experience in other realms than those under natural law. Mr. Hector (a Chemical engineer with a most wonderful collection of crystals) was very anxious to have a fling at a talk to us and had brought over some of his diagrams so we gave him the floor after the 4 o'clock afternoon tea till a 7 o'clock supper, for by 5 the storm had settled in so we were able to tell everyone who rang that the play was off. It was just as well for one of our Five Wits was ill, and Miss Ruth Pierce Jones had rung to say she was down with dysentery, and unknown to me Miss Leeson wasbusy learning the lines of Knowledge; and Helen Morton arrived with such a croak in her voice that she, who was Strength, could hardly speak. Miss Jones came along, plucky little piece, but we put her to bed as soon as she arrived. A fine sense of responsibility in these young people. By seven the girls had spread a regular feast so our roomful of folks [Note: ==== Beginning of page 97b (table of contents) ====] MARION MAHONY GRIFFIN .

Storming still today. Pakie [Note: Augusta Macdougall] is asleep and old Mr. Harrison has been spending the whole morning trying to brace up the shelf of the south room to lift it off the door. While Pakie sleeps and I write he is hammering and singing and enjoying himself generally. One of the wonderful, unforgettable pictures, like a Fra Angelico, is to see him at Lute's weekly readings sittingbeside her with his old white head, his ear close to her mouth, as she, a golden haired angel, reads a Steiner lecture to the group. If you-all didn't keep me so busy I'd paint that picture and become world famous. Every minute filled these days. Time for this to go. The following is a characteristic bit from Mr. R.C.M. Searby:- VULCANA - MARION MAHONY GRIFFIN Page 76 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] VULCANA - to Marion - From out your bold triumphant Soul the troubles of all Jewry are flung into the seething bowl of Earth's exultant Fury. The Russian and the Englishman, The Swede and Mexicano, are scorched down to their primal clan by your heart's live Volcano. For you are come to stop the rot of Mankind's barren thinking. Yours is the soul that God begot to stop the earth from shrinking. Again the luscious streams will run when from your brow comes flowing the Spirit Manna from the Sun all live and warm and glowing. Oh! humble one who stands above Earth's Queen or proud Sultana, pour forththe anger of your love, beloved sweet Vulcana. I am so pleased that you suggested that I come over and that Mr. Alagappan seconded it and of course I should be very glad to throw myself into the breach in the drafting, but I am sure it is best that Colin [Note: Colin Day] should go at present. He has more endurance than I to say nothing of other advantages for meeting the emergencies. Be sure you make him feel that he should learn the language.Some day I should love to come over and none of the things you speak of as disadvantages would trouble me at all. Last night the Trinick party went [Note: ==== Beginning of page 98b (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . DR.

Mrs. Jenkins as usual wrote a skit, this time on Mr. Trinick, the important newspaper man whose avocation was tending his cow, five characters, good fun. Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin 13 April 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin - As soon as the lithographic survey is supplied, I'll be on the general plan for the Exposition. Mr. Desmond Young of course put in the good word to the effect that the officers would be committing suicide in going ahead with the tin housing. All are agreed now that the public will be attracted only by a spectacle. I have just said goodbye to Dr. Walli Mohammad who is off to Europe on Thursday. Meantime nothing much ifanything will be done to further the Library and three months will be freed from much wasted effort trying to meet his whims in regard to questions that cannot be settled, but only unsettled, prior to the stage of execution, after completing the building in most cases. DWELLING - DR. SAHNI [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page wasintended to be placed here.] Page 77 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoDr. Sahni whose designs were submitted to him some weeks ago is too busy just now to give the attention necessary to authorize completion of plans and specifications. He likes the plans and elevations and queries only the size of guest rooms in the service wing which is a matter \"neither here nor there.\" I have been puzzled by the apparently general expectation that professional assistance is an honorary undertaking. Probably it arises from the aristocratic antecedents whereby the nobles could command any service and pay or not pay as the whim happened. The local Representatives of the Director of Industries, deploring the efforts of one of the committee men to take onto himself the duties belonging to the architect, says that the custom arises from the fact that 95% of the persons interested in such mattersas buildings for instance are Civil Servants whose time consequently is of no value, on the basis that their income is patronage. Do you follow? The results are amateurish anyway and in this particular case, where Hamid Hussain insisted that he look after the surveyors instead [Note: ==== Beginning of page 99 ====] of their coming to me for instructions, the result has been unnecessary delay in getting the whole scheme started and the publicity going, and the end is not yet. Lucknow is the center of popular interest for a few days because of the 51st Indian National Congress where the organized political thought of India gives itself free expression for which there is no scope in the Government institutions. Mahatma Gandhi has been, until recently his health has precluded, the leader of the movement but he is deemed too conservative by the present President Nehru who espouses Communism as the only road toindependence. His socialist views are not yet shared by the majority which still looks to Gandhi, but he hopes for conversion among the younger element of the Congress, and quite possibly not in vain, in the future. What one could look for in Socialism in a country evidently 90% socialist already as indicated above - that industries are run by the Government - is only the threadbare hope that the majority could control things better than the experienced minority who may be mostly inferior to the majority but thenagain may prove to be only of the same low level. Political wonders have been accomplished along Mr. Gandhi's lines, so much so that his thunder has already been stolen, but the step that will create wealth sufficient for better living conditions rather than the shift of the small quotum existing from one set of privileged beneficiaries to another set of privileged beneficiaries has yet to be taken, that is the building up of a complete National Economic Organizationcompletely separated from the Political Organization. The huge and increasing taxation that is going to these special beneficiaries certainly operated to frustrate individual and industrial enterprise. Except Tata, the Parsi, who owns the largest single steel works in the British Empire, and some of the textile mills largely Indian owned, these are few established concerns with plants. The Tata concern is outstanding, valued at \u00a330,000,000 and staffed by American engineers and with a considerable proportion of the fifty percent foreign owned shares [Note: ==== Beginning of page 100b (table of contents) ====] Page 78 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright .

PLANS [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 100 ====] owned in America.Thus far in industrial as well as educational advance the Indians owe more to American than to European encouragement. The taxes however go to England, and the bureaucracy. All the Imperial efforts to prevent manufacturing being undertaken in Australia were a repetition of the measures employed in India . Just now the most effective deterrent of all is political agitation. Interest rates through the disorganized state of business and irresponsible political activity threatening interference will have to be overcome somehow. Otherwise no country has greater sources of wealth and prosperity. The Congress is being held in a \"pandal\" [Note: a temporary structure] mostly roofless said to accommodate 50,000. The whole of the 40 acres or so will revert to bare ground after the three days use. Father should have come here, he is so fond of warm weather. At 97\u00ba I do not find it very uncomfortable with the electric fan going for which my landlady charges me 5 rupees a month. Whenesoteric judgment counters reason I cannot be satisfied of its authenticity. That of Dr. Steiner seldom or never passes understanding, unprejudiced understanding, but that of his followers is sometimes less comprehensible. I think your letter to New Zealand was superb, Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin DWELLING - PLAN - DR. SAHNI [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] 17 April, 1936 - Castlecrag - Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin - So glad to get your letters today. They make everything so perfectly clear. We do hope Mr. Alagappan soon recovers. He shouldn't pile things up too high all at once. We think Colin Day's coming over will relieve both of youand hope it can be arranged before both of you work yourselves to death. Yes you buy the book \"God Is My Adventure\" there and send it on to Clarmyra. You'll probably not want to read it all but one gets such a thrill out of such a splendid ad for Steiner. The two pictures of him and of Krishnamurti are a striking comparison, the one - Krishnamurti - a perfect example of a most wonderful civilization giving us a bond with the past (and no wonder he can't read our modern dead philosophies), [Note: ==== Beginning of page 101a ====] the other the personification of the terrible searing struggle to found a new civilization for the lack of which Europe may before long find itself perishing. Wouldn't it be a thrill to have a gold watch given you by the lady of the palace you had built. Do accept it if she really offers it to you. Have had a nice note from New Zealand from father. I had a good laugh Page 79 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoover it. Am sending it to you by regular mail. We had a quarrel while he was over here because he was calling people niggers, dagoes, etc. He really behaved wonderfully over it but when he got to a safe distance away he had a good fling back at me as you will see in his letter. He's like little Mary who aftera week of bread and water, said her prayer right when she thought she was going to be left out of the camping outing, and as soon as she got there said it wrong again. Mr. Pratten gave such an interesting report to his wife of Father's visit to their house that Mrs. Pratten told Mr. Nicholls she was very disappointed not to have been at home to meet him. The other day I ran across in Steiner that creative accomplishment is not in vain because it has not manifested in material form but that it persists in the etheric realms where it is accessible to creative thinkers and continues to serve human progress. This can be a real comfort to architects whose work differs from that of other artists in being dependent on others for its material fruition. Mr. Searby can cure insomnia by chiropractic. Steffen [Note: Albert Steffen?] says \"the Ego can become an organ of perception only if it becomes disinterested like an eye. In its gradual ascent toknowledge it becomes independent of the body..... The artist does not eliminate as does the scientist but uses the perceptible as a garment for the essential. The scientist produces a vacuum in his consciousness in order to grasp the creative essence. The artist strives after fullness of experience in order to give shape to a perfect work of art.\" Poincare, the scientist, says no creative idea ever came from reason. For sleeplessness Mr. Alagappan should eat much lettuce and celery [Note: ==== Beginning of page 101b ====]and should eat his heavy meal late, go to bed as soon as possible after and do no heavy thinking in between. The other meals can be as light as he wishes so long as he drinks plenty in between. This was the doctor's advice to the Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, when he was making up his mind about conscription. Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin 20 April 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin - Mr. Desmond Young has invited me to join his household next Sunday so my mail address hereafter will be \"Ghulistan\" 6 Couper Road, Lucknow, probably for some months since he has supplied me with the data for the Pioneer building and the Industrial Director is bringing me the surveys for the Exposition plan today. I am also engaged with the third Professor's house sketches and have inspected the site for a fourth. 21 April 1936 - Castlecrag - Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin - Our whole news this week is the production of the play - Everyman. A clear still night Sunday and a good audience sitting on their stone and backless seats in breathless stillness, gripped in the magic of that matchless valley, your gift. All the reports back were that they were deeply impressed. You wouldn't expect an old Church mystery play to be exactly popular but that's the position it seems to hold. Some liked it better than Iphigeneia. Stoker was very fine and so was Johnston as Death for which role his rich bass voice wasvery appropriate. His mantel was the two Persian couch covers, black embroidered with gold, sewed end to end carried by four of the children. - Possessions (greed) in magnificent costume, the blue and gold drape, high cylindrical hat of the Indian gold pattern squares, broad gold belt and much bejeweled - rose out of a golden chest centered between the double flight of stairs, at the foot of the stone wall.

Many comments on the richness and variety of the costuming. The human beings in the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 101c ====] festive scene were wonderful - all pantomime - the men's get-ups in old dresses of mine, gay in color of course cut and slashed, and the house curtains, and the headdresses, etc. were sumptuous and in true Medieval style. Then the abstract personalities, Beauty, Strength and Discretion, a group in Greek costume like the three graces; and the Five Senses (the five wits) sort of wide betrousered group with crossing strips of various colors and rakish caps; Mr. Williams, all in scarlet, a Cardinal's costume, etc.,etc., made most interesting and lovely groups on the East slopes where the Angel of the Threshold came at the end and led Everyman up to Heaven - and the Angel groups on the upper hillside from the top of the wall to the top of the hill where an angel (Mrs. Walker) played the flute for both the beginning and the close of the play and from where God (Mr. Herbert concealed behind the rocks) spoke with his powerful voice; and the different colored flares on the various groups, made a magnificent spectaclewhich never for a moment lost its simplicity and its lofty appeal. The Greater Sydney Development Association directors were all here Saturday. I tried to get Powell to stay to the play but he didn't have enough sense. Tonight I am going to see Charlie Chaplin with Nicholls.

The site, in and about Victoria Park, is embowered in large trees and environed by further famous gardens, Hussainebagh Hussainabad? at the North West and Gwinne Park at the North East corners. The area, altogether 140 acres, extends to a half mile across and a mile along, including 1/3 mile of fields across the river Gumti. Abutting on the East are the extensive cupola-bedecked structures of the King George V Medical College of Lucknow University and the imposing piles erected by the ruler Asaf-ud-daula [Note: reigned 1775-97], who first made Lucknow a capital, including his splendid Imambara enclosing a unique brick vaulted hall, his Great Mosque and the Rumi Darwaza, which forms an imposing portal to the Exposition. Beyond it is the surmounting Mosque of Auraqzeb [Note: Aurangzeb?]. At the North, pinnacled Hindu temples of the Bathing Ghats are in the foreground and west thereof is the extensive festive Hussainabad with its two towering gateways in alignment with the Rumi Darwaza and its golden domed Imambara and handsome Jama Masjid looming large in our western background. The tall clock Tower of 1885 is conspicuous generally and convenient.

The \"Suburban Gate\" is the Rumi Darwaza on the east terminating the system of roads of the River Valley which comprises the parklike suburban districts of Lucknow, stretching to and through the Cantonment, a distance of seven miles. The \"Village Gate\" at the west end of the Exchange Court is the terminus of the High Way (Napier Street) with bus service for the villages extending to the Hardoi, 50 miles. The \"Country Gate\" at the west end of the \"Court of Seven Gates\" serves Hussainabad and the district south of the upper reaches of the River. The \"Water Gate\" at the North opens from the Bridge of Boats and the Agricultural Demonstration area of the Exposition as well as the North Bank of the upper River. The \"Royal Gate\" on the East at the Vice Regal Gardens opens from the King George College Road at the Imambara of Asaf-ud-daula onto the \"Bridge of State,\" across the Ravine in the Exposition Groundsat the terminus of the main transverse axis through the Exchange Court. The \"Service Gate\" on the South East corner terminates the Victoria Road artery and is the inlet from Canning Street direct from the Railway Junction to the Goods Storehouses within the Exposition. It also relieves the City Gate by offering a by-pass during congested periods and to divert bicycle traffic and storage from the main tonga [Note: \"covered horse cart\" from I.2.37] concentration. The bounding road, South and West, is considerably widened for the Exposition Traffic and an average of two acres of open vehicle parking space has been provided at each end of three principal gates, and four acres of internal motor parking at the City and Suburban Gate, the main motor entrances and bicycle stands being at each main entrance except the City Gate.

Entering the last mentioned from Lucknow's well known Chauk [Note: \"bazaarcenter\" from I.3.56], one proceeds along the stately Polyalthea-lined Avenue of Seven Lanterns, so called from the four luminous bastions flanking the entrance from the forecourt to the concourse and Urban Court, and the three terminating towers where the ramp leads to the lower level of the cultural courts and the Rural cycle. TERRACE TOPOGRAPHY : The Exposition terrain is in three planes, the highest of which is the Terrace of the Concourse and Courts of Urban Industries and Exchange. A crescent bank, 2000 feet long, 20 feet high, leads from the Urban Terrace to the complete amphitheatre of the spacious Cycle of Rural Industries to the North. And on the East a straight stopped declivity drops 20 feet to the plain of the Valley of the Cultural Courts. Beyond the \"Cycle\" to the North a four hundred foot semicircular plaza slopes to the plain of the GumtiRiver to the bank of which extend the Carnival Course and Water-Gateway.

Amusements occupy the river bank plain. RECTANGULAR SYSTEM OF CONNECTING AXES : The intersection of the open longitudinal \"Industrial\" and transverse \"Exchange\" Axes is at the center of the Exchange Court, the focus of the architectural ensemble of the Exposition. Down the long axis the view extends from the Electricity Tower of the Engineering Courts across the Upper and Lower esplanades of the Fountain Basin, across the Fountain, between the Agricultural Pylons, to the Seven Gateways Court, through the \"Flashing Towers\" the pairs of turrets framing the Carnival Course and on to the Water Gate at the pontoon Bridge finally leading along a stretch of river,reaching also Northward to decorative date palms on the skyline beyond the Trans-Gumti Agricultural Demonstration Fields.

One secondary transverse axis extends from the terminal Electric Tower across the Textile Court between the quadruple bastions of its gateway to an eastern terminal in the Medical College on the crest of the high bank beyond the \"Service Entrance\" Ravine. The third important transverse axis is the Quadrangle of the Seven Gates connecting the principal East and West Gateways, continuing outside, beyond under the two archways of Hussainabad and passing midway inside, between the gateways of the Rural Industries Cyclorama and the double gateways of the Rural Industries Cyclorama [Note: Pylons of Agriculture?] and the double gateway of the amusement park. ENCLOSURES : Page 85 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe four main formal enclosed courts are demarked by numerous alcove courts and portals consisting of cellular stalls for small individual exhibits and pavilions for instructive arrangement, display and demonstration; and since for the most part the walls of the Exposition coincide with those constructions,the Enclave City becomes an attraction of its environment in beautifying Lucknow. The cellular construction of stiffened whitewashed rustic vermiculated brickwork comprises architecturally a screen consisting mostly of voids for the framing of which there are embellishments of clay modeling and decorative envelopment and roofing of whitewashed clay of bamboo and jaffri framework and fabric. For contrast therewith a simulation of massiveness is economically achieved bythe curving slender masonry or battered jaffri walls of the domed and turreted and pinnacled display pavilions which accentuate all the focal points and geometric intersections of the intricate plan pattern. [Note: \"Jaffri\" (or \"jaffrey\") may be \"jaffry,\" which means a screen or lattice work. WBG may be referring to the term when he writes of \"bamboo frame work with woven cane lathing and mud and cow dung plastering both sides, all whitewashed in tints\" in Section I on page 85, above.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 107b (table of contents) ====] HALLS OF EDUCATION [Note: The illustration's placement here follows the location indicated in the New-York Historical Society typescript.

This illustration is associated with the United Provinces Exposition in Lucknow, India.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 107 ====] CULTURAL SECTION : The Court of Asaf-ud-daula is impressive because of the central oblong panel of the parade or arena surrounded by high banks with surmounting architecture, that of the Exposition itself and that whose beauty has long been the pride of Lucknow. A flanked bank of spacious brick theatre seats for 10,000 spectators faces this latter background and forms the stadium of the arena with its quartermile coursingtrack. Popular restaurants overtop this open air theatre whose long terrace banks are stopped by the bastion lanterns. Galleries and cloisters of the graphic and plastic arts close the North extremity of this open arena for pageantry, wrestling, boxing, folk-dancing and festivals and sports as well as serious conclaves in a season free from storms. South of the Parade the Valley is a narrow ravine along which lead the short-cut paths for the Page 86 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagopedestrians and cyclists from the Service Gate and through which narrow paths lead to the features on the further bank and the Vice-Regal Gardens. The hexagonal Art Gallery and the angled Halls of Education connecting Rumi Darwaza with the mosque reconcile their conflicting orientation. The Lecture Hall Rotunda at the Motor Gate will make attractive programme features most convenient to the general public.

The minor subdivisions are for metallurgy, metal equipment, etc. A Cross Court toward the Exchange Terrace is for composite mass-production of mechanized industry. In the Exchange Court are represented Commercial, Financial Institutions with an administration pavilion housing the Executive Offices of the Exposition and its Inquiry, Courier, Banking, Clerical andother special facilities for exhibitors and visitors. The Cycle of Rural Industries a quarter of a mile in diameter is punctuated with eight pairs of Cupola rotundas on axes 15 degrees apart separated in turn by spacings of 30 degrees for the diametrical axes of the main vistas from the other courts and out onto the architectural background of the Hussainabad Mosque and Golden Imambara, also the white Mosque of Aurungzeb [Note: Aurangzeb] all of which the wide central spaces bring into play in the panorama.

The echelon of intercommunicating gateway steps and the parallel aisles of the Hydro-Electric and Forestry alcove courts accentuate further here the main single open axis. Conversely however, allthe Exposition Divisions look directly upon this widespread area and the electric spray, the aquatic displays and the eight statuary groups will be the focus of attention at periods for the visitors in every part of the Exposition, especially at night. The Rural Exhibits are disposed in clockwise sequence in the circumference around Agriculture and allied forms of extractive industry, following the nature of materials used proceeding from chemicals,minerals, and to metals, to vegetable, and finally to animal products. The booths of the Terrace Embankment are mainly at the Rural Cycle Water level to afford promenades and parapets for uninterrupted prospect above them.

Illumination throughout, white and multicolored, is from concealed sources, and signs and transparency are part and parcel of the architecture. The salient pavilions accentuating the court entrances and court boundaries, generally rotundas, characterized as Bastions, Bartizans, Basilians [Note: \"bassillions\" in Section I, No. 7, p. 150], and Barbettes the peaks and domes of which are flood lighted in rainbow colors for whose distribution they are especially featured with reflector sheathes and reflecting facets.

The delicately chased fronts of the metal craft and jewelry booths represent a phase of art for which the United Provinces is famous. The descent to the Rural Cycle is through the Echelon Steps of classic formality of form joined across the great fountain basin by the similarly dignified foreground of Water Cabaret and Water Theatre underlying the lofty terrace bank of reflected arcades and cupolas. The twelve large pedestals of the fountain architecture carry sculptures of the emblematic sportive fishes of Oudh. Within the Rural Cycle are the \"Courts of Forestry\" and \"Woodcraft\" on the West and of Irrigation and Hydro-Electricity on the East demarked by wide floral borders. Surrounding the \"Sylvan Creek\" bend at the West are a model house, two groups of thatched huts for forest workers in basketry and khatta [Note: khata?, i.e., a kind of scarf?] making and a bamboo-pattern Canopy for the Indian Wild Life Preservation Conference.

And this Hexagonal form is repeated as the motif for the accentuating Kiosks of Art and Literature and all the connecting cloisters forming the close over which looms the elaborate monumental architecture ofAsaf-ud-daula as an imposing exhibit of that important branch of the Arts, contributing to the historical background whose sentiment is shared in the architectural expression of the Exposition, which however is distinctly that of today.

GRIFFIN FOLLOWS HER MAN 28 April 1936 - Castlecrag - No cable from you saying not to come so I am sailing tomorrow on the Comorin for Calcutta. One day's stop in Calcutta. Hope to get some word from you there as to where togo next. Mrs. Maddocks is moving into our house right away and Mr. Nicholls has made some dicker with to carry things on. It gives me a very comfortable feeling to know that she is going to be there. The hot summer means nothing to me. I am like Mother who loved the days that went to 105\u00ba and was disappointed that all Australia days were not like that. All sorts of things to be done these last days so will [Note: ==== Beginning of page 116b ====] scurry along. Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin Cable from Lucknow - Thankful. 30 April 1936 - S.S. Comorin, between Sydney and Melbourne. Marion Mahony Griffin to Walter Burley Griffin. Wednesday - An hour after I mailed my air letter your cable came and I got much satisfaction out of its comprehensive word \"Thankful.\" It was a wild scramble to get off but that seemsto be my destiny or the one I bring down on myself. Before I forget I'll give you Nicholls' message which was that this week Mr. Eric Pratten's stairway has been settled. As he expressed it - he wore him down, so evidently he has been having the same kind of dance you had with the fireplaces. Yesterday was a mill pond, today white-caps but I am taking it all right. We had a bigger audience at the 2nd Everyman performance than at the first and everyone most enthusiastic. They let me off from back stage,or rather over the hill, duties to see the whole play. It was entrancing. Quite a number gathered afterward for a cup of tea. Pakie [Note: Augusta Macdougall] who had brought half a dozen the first evening brought a dozen the 2nd time. The evening ended with complimentary speeches to me. Lute and Mr. Herbert were lovely, Lute saying I was a true human, no class, no distinctions. I rang Dr. Rivett re vaccination but didn't have a chance to get it in, the passport and visa business take such a time. I had cabled I was coming in all innocence having completely forgotten the fact and the jokes cracked about the fact that I should be a prisoner in Australia because you in your usual rush had gone off on my passport, the one about which the British Consul in Chicago had said \"The American Government does do the most extraordinary things!\" because you were going as my husband instead of my going as your wife. For they can't issue two passports to one person. However the young womanthere in the Consul's office was very ingenious and wangled it for me saying the one you went on had expired in March though strictly speaking, etc. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 117 ====] Also you had registered yourself as an American citizen and that included me though strictly speaking etc., etc. Page 93 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoTwenty ladies of one of the Clubs had planned to come out at 11 o'clock Tuesday to see Castlecrag. They came but Mrs. Maddocks took them off my hands so we still have to thank the angels for Mrs. Maddocks. I did not get home till 4:30 and within a quarter of an hour Mrs. Evers dropped in. She wasfeeling bitter about something and I had to get the bitterness out of her (No good in one over 80 years of age) so we talked till seven and still no packing done. Monday Mrs. Maddocks and I had spent a few hours in town shopping, my need being summer things most of which she supplied me with out of her own wardrobe. You wouldn't believe it but all of her things fit me perfectly, dresses, hats, coat. After Mrs. Evers left I sorted out things for a while and then Mr. Junge was sent up for me from down belowto bring me down in his car to a goodbye party of Castlecraggers. A good turn-up. Mr. Duncan master of ceremonies, a jolly time. Pakie [Note: Augusta Macdougall] and Irven [Note: Herbert] and Joan stayed all night with me. I didn't wake up till 6:30 in the morning and packed steadily till Mr. Deans came for me in his car at about 10. So trunk and valise were strapped on and heaven only knows what I am bringing and what I am leaving behind. A jolly bunch at the boat to see me off, four of my babies with their parents, Deirdre, Kaaren, Ross and Bronwen with baskets and bunches of Castlecrag flowers. Thoughtful gifts meeting all my needs, letters of introduction, one from Miss Leeson saying we were two of the greatest people in the world, a wonderful box of every sort of fruit, persimmons, custard apples, pawpaws, grapes and all sorts of surprises tucked in that I haven't come to the end of yet including a Teddy Bear (Koala) for a permanentmascot from the Searbys. A Daily Telegraph reporter was there. Heaven only knows how he got the word I was going. It is now in new hands, the same as the weekly which has been publishing your houses, and which put in the article about Mr. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 118 (table of contents) ====] LA MARTINIERE COLLEGE [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript.

Everybody made me feel that they loved me very much. I could not but feel that they were very sincere. They expresseddeep regrets and hopes of our speedy return. Lute gave me the Astronomy book we have been studying together so I shall be observing the stars coming over leaving the spectacular southern skies for the much less star bedecked northern ones. Nicholls is coming to Melbourne by rail so I shall be having a spin with his family the day I am down there. The lunch horn is blowing and I am all right for eating. It is beginning to get cold and I suppose that will last all around the South of Australia.

Castlecrag gathered to farewell Mrs. Griffin on Tuesday evening and waved her farewell on Wednesday. Mr. Nicholls made the suggestion that we should live in yourhouse and that he would take over ours for the time being. I was very well pleased with the proposal he made. First it will be a real help financially but principally because I know of nothing I'd rather expend my energies on than Castlecrag and no one for whom I'd rather work than you. We're going to enjoy this house. I've always liked it and the magic still lingers though I admit I was appalled and amused at the contents of the garage as seen in the glare of the headlights. I can see that my mental dimensions forthe duration of your absence will be understanding this filing system of yours. I look at CDCCCBB and am reminded of Tennyson's poem:- \"Flower in the crannied wall, If I knew what you are Stem and all and all in all, I would know what God and man are.\" 21 May - Mr. Nicholls has been exceptionally nice and helpful to me. He solves all the problems that arise with a free and easy confidence and without fuss, and at the same time with a sense of responsibility [Note: ==== Beginning of page 119 ====] which makes working with him easy and pleasant. Mr. Deans too, though somewhat aloof and formal (Probably because he is shy) is being quietly helpful. He prepared a set of sales plans, price lists and general information all neatly assembled in a folder for me and spent an afternoon driving me around to locate the blocks. Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley Griffin 25 May - 1936 - Sunnyside Crescent, Castlecrag, Mrs. Trinick to Marion Mahony Griffin, Annette was delighted with her letter from the boat. When she brought it to me and I said \"Oh this one is for you\" she couldn't open it for excitement.....My second attempt - Well Annette's letter is safely put away in her own writing desk, after I read it to her. Wally was also called upon to read it to her. She astounds with her sayings and what happened yesterday was so unusual that I can't help passing it on to you as I know you'll appreciate it fully. She had been ..... Well a third attempt - My babies arrived Michael and Mary soyou see I had twins after all. 28 May 1936 - 6 Couper Road - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Ula Maddocks - Marion is due in Calcutta where Mr. Alagappan will meet her and see her safely off in the Lucknow carriage of the Punjab Mail of the East Indian Rail Road which is broad gauge and well equipped. The train leaves Hourah (Calcutta) in the evening and reaches here about noon tomorrow. I could not make the journeymyself because of my clamorous clients and moreover I would be as much lost in that direction as she. Marion can let down a peg her activities here, in fact the heat will enforce that if she is not otherwise relieved by the fact. I think she might find it a relief, but a whole month on the Pacific and Orient is a big dose to start with. Another six months alone on my part though would be too much. The two of us together will make it quite different. A thing that they think here that they must do each year or so with their \"cheap\" kuli [Note: coolie] labor is to dig up, trench and turn over the entire lawns. So the front section of this place as a result of two weeks work now looks like a plowed field, and the two side lawns will Page 95 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 120b (table of contents) ====] PLAN .

Placement of theillustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 120 ====] be similarly treated and left to fallow for a couple of months. Aside from the to me seemingly great waste of effort this process destroys the attractiveness of all the beautiful home settings for a third of the time. The same with the flower borders which are almost entirely annuals. During this time the elite are supposed to be up in the Hills. I have undertaken to plant and seed next year's extensive borders here forMrs. Young but surely if I were to stay here any length of time I would find the way to \"balance\" the growths in perpetuity by using perennials, and would substitute mechanical irrigation to provide continuity in place of the ingenious tin pipe distribution from the oxen lifted well buckets still general as in biblical times. One of the things that may perhaps justify the Lucknow Exposition is the four acre demonstration of the Provincial Hydro-Electric Department under Sir William Stamp of the application of low cost electricity to the solution of all the problems of village industry and domestic amenity. One of the model houses I have to make is for this demonstration and I know of no better way out of the difficulty of the perennially starving and suffering millions in the villages that make up India. The Exposition in adopting my plan also accepted my classification of the whole five distinct sections: Industry - divided into (Urban (Exchange (Rural CultureAmusement, the last named the most segregated. So far this has worked well to the satisfaction of prospective exhibitors though there has been one lapse in introducing dog races into the stadium which is the center of the Cultural Section! and where I am providing banked seats for 25,000. The attractions of profit are too great, Walter Burley Griffin to Ula Maddocks ALL INDIA EXPOSITION - GROUNDS PLAN - LUCKNOW [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] 1 June, 1936 - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin - Dear ones, made no stop in Calcutta but came directly on to Lucknow which is lovely. For a month Walt has been living in the home of the Editor of\"The Pioneer\" paper. A week before I arrived he and his wife flew to England. So we are Page 96 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 121 ====] living in this quite palatial home with spacious grounds, and are cared for by 12 servants - 2 butlers (bearers) who also take full charge of the household arrangements, a cook who is worth coming to India to experience, a real artist and a picture himself, 2 sweepers, a night watchman who is of the renouned[Note: renowned?] caste of thieves who have now taken over this polar opposite profession, 5 gardeners and I have forgotten who the other one is - Oh yes the laundryman. Next month we may inherit the chauffeur. This arrangement is for six months. You see we live up to the ideals of the simple life. The hot season is on and it is delightful. Haven't yet experienced the extreme temperatures, only around 98\u00ba. So far, thanks to Mrs. Maddocks, I am properly equipped for clothes. In that little flamecolored frock you made, Mrs. Maddocks, even my husband thought I was a \"pretty goil\" and took me out for a journey through a magic land of wonders. The evening before we had had a good two hours' walk about this district of palatial homes and gardens so I suspected nothing when after our dinner (always served at about half past eight) we went out into the brilliant moonlight and wandered across open fields and past low-lying, flat-roofed charming residences making one feel that he was walkingthrough Castlecrag some 30 years hence only not the wide outlooks; and suddenly, without warning, came upon \"la Martiniere\" a palace for a king of kings, compared with which the palaces of Europe look like thirty cents. A magic scene, an astounding imaginative combination of the Grand Prix of the Beaux Arts and Indian splendour, an enormous building and fascinating from every angle. I shall try to get some photographs of it but photos can tell nothing. (I just now went into another room and found one ofthe bearers sewing a button on Mr. Griffin's pants.) The trip through the great Ganges delta and the endless flat land to the North was very interesting. Even where it seemed perfectly flat every bit of it was terraced, with little earth dikes everywhere. You realized what painstaking care was taken to preserve the water and the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 122b (table of contents) ====] LUCKNOW . INTERIOR OF THEATRE .

Then all of a sudden pyramidal hills and mountains, single mountains, began to rise out of the plain and you saw that you were in the land of the light ether. However before morning we were back in the plains of the Gumti River on whose banks lies Lucknow. Walt met me with the car and within an hour we were at the drafting board. Next morning, Sunday, the first draftsman appeared at 6 o'clock in the morning, 2 others later who stayed till 7. However the general plan for the Exposition willbe blueprinted this morning so that work on the grounds can be started and the huge task of getting Page 97 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoeverything ready in six months. It is the undertaking of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh with its 60 million inhabitants but it is expected to attract all India and the Viceroy will be here. 160 acres and the garden tract across the river, Walt controlling all designs not only of the grounds but of the buildings. Athousand booths in the show and already there have been 5,000 applicants. Marion Mahony Griffin INTERIOR OF THEATRE - LUCKNOW - INDIRECT LIGHTING [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] 10 June, 1936 - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Mrs. Nicholls - You should see us at our meals being served by two butlers. At breakfast for instance, the one brings in 2 plates and sets them before us then stands at attention in the door of the butler's pantry while the other brings in two eggs on toast. No.1 majestically pours lime juice in our two glasses or brings coffee, the other brings a tiny stand with two pieces of toast. No.1 presently follows with melons or mangoes or such. (And by Jove they know how to raise melons, no neighboring pumpkins to spoil their flavor as in Australia.) How's that for awoman who has always refused to have a servant in the house. Tonight we walked to town to a 6:30 movie, planning to have our dinner at nine, but no escape for Walt. A messenger came for him to the movie and when it was over he had to go to the United Provinces Office. They sent me home in a car and Heaven only knows when we'll get our dinner. But never mind, we'll have two butlers when it does come. We marvel at the most satisfactory achievements of your husband. What a record! MarionMahony Griffin to Mrs. Nicholls. Dear Gene (from Walter Burley Griffin to Marion Mahony Griffin's sister) Some persons earn their [Note: ==== Beginning of page 123 ====] holidays like you, others take them, but still others have them forced upon them. The last seems to be my case covering my journeys around and across the continents of North America (Where Griffin's practice was in 14 States), Australia, Europe and now Asia. In most ways it would have been moreadvantageous to have stayed at home for I could doubtless have accomplished more than I have to show for forty year's work but my compensation must be in having started things possibly in wide areas. Alexander had to conquer peoples to spread his culture. The British have already at one time or another conquered the countries in advance of us, for other purposes no doubt. I do not know yet whether it will be effective on my part but I have found out that there is a vast field for enterprise amongst this 400,000,000 who are dissatisfied with their economic paucity and are finding political amelioration slow and painful. (We have to realize that here the British deliberately destroyed a highly developed industrial system, though not a mechanical one, ruthlessly in order to create a market for her own industrial products. The case was very different in other regions where she found quite primitive civilizations.) Private local capitalism is practically confined to the thrifty Parseswho seem to be the small nucleus about which a prosperous India will have to grow. Through these some modern industries such as steel works and banks are already supplying employment for skill and talent at rates consistent with a suitable standard of living. The British also destroyed the unity of India by making separate States where there were Moslem majorities.

My Father is brief in his letters but frequent in his visits, one of which he is planning again now on the principle of going while the going is good. He has already said it seems that his next trip will have to be a round one, NewZealand (with his oldest daughter's family), Australia, India, London (for he has enjoyed his visits with Marguerite there) and home to Chicago. I have not yet seen a cloud since I came as here on the mainland there have been none since [Note: ==== Beginning of page 124 ====] September and will be none before July for that is the way it always is here. Of course the ground looks like August in Chicago but the giant shade trees are evergreen everywhere in these Northern Provincesand the gardens are green. What a place for our out-door theatre. Walter Burley Griffin to Gene [Note: Georgine] Mahony Smith 4 June 1936 - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Eric Nicholls. - The sun rises and sets a pure white these days. Today was full of incidents. In the morning, the contractor, a fine intelligent looking man, like an Arab, came in to make sure he understood the blueprint we sent him yesterday for the secondstory of a city building in a conspicuous position, the first story being already constructed. It is a strategic position to attract much attention. Later the general electric man (Indian) concerned with the electric fountain and Electric Tower building of the Exposition noticed the drawing of the interior of the picture theatre in the above building which I had just finished penciling, and was much interested in the lighting scheme, a series of diminishing bands from floor to ceiling concealing the lamps, each band adifferent color and he began to realize that Walt knew his business in that line. He wanted to know if Walt was doing the pylons in the exposition that way which he was. After lunch the boys began making five blue prints of the Exposition plan and Walt who had been working on it since 6 A.M. had time to shave. I in the meantime had gone out to the show grounds with a very attractive man (English) who has charge of all the public plantings of Lucknow, is apparentlyenergetic and has charge of the gardening of the show, and is now hard at work on it since he has a blue print of Walt's design for plantations. It was my first daylight tour of the city proper, we living in the South East and the show being to the North West of the City. The buildings surrounding the grounds are beautiful palaces, temples and tombs, and will form a wonderful background for the exposition.

The man who is trying to push himself into that place, Hussain, and is saying he will do it for nothing is a perfect nuisance and an utter incompetent but has a political pull. He is in a position to handover the Mohammedan vote. They had just gone when Mr. Gupta, the drawing of whose alterations in his rabbit warren of a house I had just completed, came in and is still talking it over with Walt and it is quarter to seven. I am going now for my 2nd daily bath to tidy up for an 8:30 dinner. One can do these things when all personal and domestic things are cared for by many hands. This Mr. Gupta is of the family who, a thousand yearsago, were the rulers of the whole of India, the only Indian Kings who ever ruled the whole of India. DWELLING - DR.

The man who has the Amusement concession for the show blew in the other day and where do you think he came from - Chicago, our hometown. I think he'll make a good job of it, all the stunts plus elephants and camels and all their caparisons to take folks the tour of the grounds. I am sending out blueprints of the grounds today and the man in charge, Captain Smith, is already at work on the grounds. We have to do all the blueprinting, no blueprinters in Lucknow. We have Government apparatus. Could never get it done if it were left to them. They are of course like governmentseverywhere, no reason for being efficient and every inducement the other way. Marion Mahony Griffin to Eric M. Nicholls 14 June, 1936 - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Ula Maddocks - How disgusting that package was not delivered to me in Perth.

They didn't even bother to deliver to me a telegram until it was too late to be of any service. But you send that package on to me and have Mr. Nicholls pay the charges. It will be warm weather here for a long time yet and the things most welcome. Already Walt has scooted off and left meby my lonesome but only for two days. He has gone to Agra (Mean of him not to take me to see the Taj wasn't it) to see a brother of Mr. Mathur for whom he is planning a house, the sketch plans for which I got ready for him to take along, re a subdivision scheme of about 40 acres which looks as if it might be interesting. On his way back he will stop at Cawnpore to see the chairman of the Exposition Committee as the meddler, Hussain, is trying to make hash of his plan. [Note: At this point in the New-York Historical Society copy the following line appears:] PLAN - SUBDIVISION [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] Tell Nicholls I have snitched a blue print of the plan to send him. Walt is sadly disappointed in his wife because she didn't bring on two perfectly good pairs of garters and his present ones are done for. Do see if you can find them. Think they are in a drawer of the case in the South Bedroom. Have sent your cute letter about the babes and the boots, etc. on to my sister. Dear Miss Drummond, how wonderful that you are at Castlecrag. Do hope it will prove practical for you to be there permanently. Dear Mrs. Evers, I was so glad you got over to see me. I should not have been satisfied if I hadn't been able to get intouch with you before leaving. I have thought many times of how true your words were that every Anthroposophist is a potential enemy of the Anthro. Society. That is bound to be the case so long as we are dominated by our personal opinions and our feelings. What a task and what a responsibility we have. Your darling tapestry hand-bag is with me constantly. Dear Mr. Searby, Brindel tells us what a marvelous symbol is that of our civilization, the 5th period, the lovely five-pointed star, but we must beware and not use it with the point downward as in the emblem of the Soviet Republic which signifies materialization, but with the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 127 ====] point upward so that our free will, the quality of the 5th period, may bear us up from the fourness [Note: i.e., four-ness] of the material - warmth, air, water, solidity - into the spiritual realms by means of the etheric forces which create the material realm - heat, light, sound and life. (Curiously enough thesmashing of the atom has proved there is no matter, only form held in place by forces. Thus are the West and the East brought together.) I finished the working drawings for Dr. Batia's house adjacent to the University buildings, and construction is started though he hasn't got his complete specifications yet. I am sending you a copy, Mr. Nicholls. Thought you might show it to Mr. Pollard as the type of thing that would be nice on hisCastlecrag lot. We think he ought to place his house on the edge of the second precipice, as that is the strategic position and it will always be easier to make the climb in connection with an outing on the Harbor than when pressed for time when going to town. Off to a movie. Page 101 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoWe couldn't but be interested when our draftsman, Mr. Halder (Bengali), a very pleasant young man and proving to be a valuable draftsmen and assistant, watchful and helpful in all sorts of ways and knowing the Hindi language as well as his own and the English, so a valuable interpreter - told us early this weekthat on Friday many thousands of people would be traveling to the Ganges to pray and bathe on Friday the 19th because of the eclipse of the Sun and 3 conjunctions and two squares - because, as I told him, with Walt's squares to the Sun in the Zenith, etc. it was no wonder he was having a rumpus with those in governmental positions. We could only hope that he had made some headway in conquering his planets as is the task of present-day humanity. Well two days later Mr. Shivdasanni, in charge of theexposition, came over with a hashed revision of the plan by the bad man of the story, Hosain [Note: Hussain?], to put it up to Walt to accept all the ridiculous changes. In the mean time however Walt had seen the Chairman of the Exhibit, Mr. Carnegie, and had a good talk with him putting the case right. We think he must have [Note: ==== Beginning of page 128b (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . DR. BATIA . ON RIVER BANK [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript. Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 128 ====] taken it up with Mr. Shivdasanni for he presently condescended to listen to Walt. That was Wednesday. From then till this noon (when the eclipse was over) we have been on a drafting drive from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. tracing the plan over, complying where possible with the silly suggestions, but introducing them in such a way as not to mess up the plan and really taking advantage of the retracing to add some lovely touches. I'll have to describe them to you some day. The plan, we think, is truly Anthroposophic, organic, the fertilizing of the lotus flower - the square penetrating the circle. Well today at 5 P.M. was a committee meeting at which Mr. Shivdasanni said that Walt was in entire charge of the construction, and he repeated the statement at the formal meeting. So it looks as if the chief thing needed was won, the battle over and the victory Walt's which does not mean we are expecting an easy time but that apparently the way has been made possible for carrying on. We are convinced that the only way to carry on business in India is in your own home. Any time of day or night is right for business. Shivdasanni and his right hand man, Mr. Goshal, a good friend of ours in all the issues that come up, showed up here tonight shortly after eight and they are still at it after nine which means we have had no supper yet. With half an hour's intermission at times during the day it is amazing what hours one can put in drafting without being worn out by it. That last letter of yours was a mean one promising titbits of Deirdre and then not giving them. Next time begin with Deirdre.

It is tremendously amusing and interesting to contemplate the contrast and to see you both so involved in the tasks of your adventure in India. But you are missed, Beloved, very badly. Well it is great for you both being together again in a new [Note: ==== Beginning of page 129 ====] experience and in the enchanting surroundings - and with an artist for a cook. The Pentecostal Festival drew a crowd both evenings with many new faces. The Mozart and Faust evenings were charming. Luteused it as a sort of dress rehearsal for a performance she and her students were putting on at Hopewood House. Besides these musical evenings we had three lectures taken by Mr. Lightband, Mr. Herbert and myself. The social atmosphere was a little divided by the fact that several with a little group of friends got so involved in domesticity and a high sense of office respectively that they had no time to attend the lectures. It was a happy time and the weather was glorious. Do you know that by way of perpetuating your good work on Sunday evenings I am taking the lead at the Nicholls'? So far there has been very lively interest and Mr. and Mrs. Nicholls are both very keen to have a group meeting at Castlecrag. Glyn produces his books the moment he sees me. It has become the order of the day that he and I shall engage in story telling the moment I arrive. At table he asked for a helping of crocodile referring to sardines on a wee dish. The word has only just appeared in hisvocabulary. He told me yesterday in a whisper that when he is a big, big boy he is going to have a baby sister. Whether there is any truth in this statement or not I do not know. I did not repeat so great a confidence to his Mother. The little Cragites have lost temporarily a marvelous friend in you. Mrs. Nicholls told me that when she knew that you were not to be in Castlecrag on her return from Melbourne she didn't want to come back at all even. You have heard perhaps of Mrs. Trinick'sachievement - twins! A heart's desire apparently amazing though this sounds. As a result of being X-rayed to ascertain some weeks before the findings were for one child, so the twins caused considerable astonishment. When I stopped to ask Ida (Leeson) for a message for you she grumpily said, \"Tell her it's time they came home again.\" Affectionately, Florence Birch to Marion Mahony Griffin [Note: ==== Beginning of page 130b (table of contents) ====] DWELLING .

Again mycoming into the undertaking has interfered with ambitions for knighthood, etc. and for two months the Director was bamboozled into making four successive starts until he realized that the precious time was slipping by without getting any \"forrader\" and on the 19th June announced that thenceforth I was in full charge of the construction. After that I was able to get the surveys and assistance all along the line needed to enable me to design the 57 varieties of buildings and fix their locations and levels togetherwith the quarter mile of terracing, three acre fountain basin, 25,000 seat stadium, quarter mile track, etc., etc., and last week a contract was let to a Cawnpore firm to carry out the whole. The buildings, aside from the amusement section, will cover half a million square feet. They will be rich with sculpture and ornament all flood-lighted in colors from sources concealed within themselves and form a consistent white city with roofs as well as walls consisting of clay with tinted whitewash. Allbuilding materials are of local origin in the strictest sense, and the framework will be chiefly of bamboo. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 131 ====] Vaults and domes will surmount some thirty of the buildings. The employment of bamboo, Jaffrey (basket) and clay with brick partitions and division walls throughout was my own notion and got me the job of planning after the whole had been worked out for a scheme based on the corrugated iron such as was used at the last Indian exposition at Allahabad in 1910. Almost to the finish there was keencompetition amongst the contractors at an even lower price. The buildings will cost less (8 annas) than one shilling and two pence sterling per square foot with the outer work of stadium, fountain basin (Concrete) and enclosure walls and fencing over a mile long thrown in. The rainy season came 6 weeks ahead of time on June 1st so that there could not have been much of the construction carried out so far but it is to be hoped it will let up correspondingly early for the contractrequires completion in October. We have really enjoyed the wet weather in Lucknow. The heat has been no longer oppressive as it was in April and May but for the most part very comfortable. I am sure you would have enjoyed it.

The Gumti river has been in flood for a week, covering the amusement section of the Exposition site and also, to a height of six feet, one of the houses I am building near the University. I was not consulted as to the site of this latter though I queried it as to the danger and was assured that it was above flood lines. The present flood is 6 feet below the high water mark of the last and greatest flood, of 1923, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 132b (table of contents) ====] SOUTH GATE TO EXPOSITION [Note: The structure may be the Husainabad Bazaar Gateway to the west of the Exposition.] THE RESIDENCY .

They will have to construct a drainage canal of 6 to 7 miles in length I should say to prevent a recurrence, otherwise they surely will have on their hands the greater part of the area which is still unoccupied. Shortly after I came here a Parliamentary Investigating Committee reproved this Trust at Lucknow for not having obtained expert Town Planning advice but so far as I know up to now they have done nothing about it. Three times lately I have had to visit Cawnpore, on the Ganges, inconnection with the Exposition, and once, last week, I spent a day at Naini Tal in the \"Hills,\" the Summer Capital of these Provinces. It takes a night and half a day to get there by meter gauge railway and by motor for the last 24 miles climbing to the 6,000 foot elevation on roads graded like the one from Bowral to Wombeyaa Caves, our Australian experience of which you will remember as being far from comfortable. SOUTH GATE TO EXPOSITION & RESIDENCY [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustrations found on the preceding page were intended to be placed here.] The town itself surrounds a lake a mile or so long, in a steep narrow valley 1,000 feet deep. Motors and draft animals are barred out [Note: shut out with bars] at the foot of the lake. Rickshaws and bicycles arenot allowed except along the shore and the only transport over the many miles of roads zigzagging up the forested precipice is legs, either one's own or those of four kulis [Note: coolies] carrying a \"dandi,\" Page 105 of 923 to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoor those of a pony. Most of the visitors use the \"dandi\" but I bought an umbrella and walked and climbed for five hours in the rain over the spectacular scene. The mountain sides of pine, cypress and deodars were layered with cloud-belts like Hiroshige's and the views down the blue serrated valleys andover the Indian Plain were superb. Only the gimcrack European houses with lots of sheet iron a la Australian resorts were disagreeable. It rained during the 24 hours I was there and clouds overhung the higher Himalayas so the flag did not fly from Sher ka Danda peak as it does when the snow-caps of the higher Himalayas are visible therefrom. [Note: \"Dandi\" is a transport conveyance consisting of a strong cloth slung like a hammock to a bamboo staff and carried by at least two men; the passenger can either sit sideways or lie on his back.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 133b (table This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript.

My trip up there to meet with a committee was a complete fiasco so far as the work went but it was an experience. Marion has not been on any of these trips which arehurried and on business. She has not even begun to see Lucknow yet. Nor was she on the hot trip to Agra a few weeks ago where I was the guest of the family of a Brahmin in the heart of the old city along side the fort. Those city houses are merely ovens and the Indians are realizing it only after several thousand years of trying to become inured to them. My client was Mr. Mathur who has done a remarkable thing in organizing the Agra Co-operative Housing Co. which is building up its suburbanestates with bungalows.

PIRTHI NATH BHARGAVA - LUCKNOW [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] 20 July, 1936 - 301 Remuera Road, Auckland, New Zealand, Genevieve Lippincott (Walt's sister) to Walter Burley Griffin - Dear Walter and Marion, Since Marion has followed we have lost you both. I'm not the one to talk. I've not been expressing our appreciation of your long letters - but I have been missing them. You seem ages away. I'll be as bad as Dad - and he finds it hard to take - How he does think he hates India! You seem absolutely lost to him - and he finds it hard to take. Roy [Note: Lippincott, Genevieve's husband] is now British. His naturalization papers are a fact. The American Consulate now invites him to say he has no further use for the U.S.A., off with the old love, on with the new! When I read the document I was most amazed at the attitude. Roy explained that Mr. Boyle says Page 106 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagonobody ever signs it. He sends it out - his duty is done - finis. To return to your venture - we are most interested - the actual living conditions do not appeal to my fancy - but from the point of view of your work it must be fascinating though I should think that allIndians to work with would be most trying (Which was quite contrary to the fact M.M.G.). Am eager to get Marion's impressions. Roy fortunately [Note: ==== Beginning of page 134 ====] continues to be busy, another small house for the master for the St. Peters School group, and the Auckland University is adding a science building. We are trying to come to an understanding of what Steiner's Threefold Commonwealth intends. We have started to read the notes on it now. We arestudying his \"The Gospel of St. John\" now in the afternoon class with Mrs. Coe. She is a remarkable teacher. Do send father frequent notes, just so he can feel in touch. The copies Marion used to send I would read to him - once or twice even and then he'd take them off and study them by himself. If you had seen him this time you would realize that quick and keen as he is, he is getting on. Alstan (the oldest of three daughters) is registering with the American Consul to keep her U.S. citizen's rights. Being 21she has to take a stand. Genevieve Lippincott to Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin 13 July, 1936 - Castlecrag, New South Wales - Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin - Deirdre is at the Deans' this morning. Irven Herbert has a group for rhythm and Deirdre loves it. Turning somersaults is her latest thrill. The blue dragon in the center of your Chinese rug known as \"Griffin's lizard\" is the taking off ground. With her head placed on this and a good aimshe ends up with feet on the twin lizards in each corner in turn. She hung about me while I poured tea for a visitor, grumbling about something. When I turned my attention to her and found out what it was, she said- \"That big thing is sitting on Griffin's lizard!\" Obviously there was no doubt in her mind as to the relative importance of the woman and the lizard. I found an excuse to move her chair and Deirdre ran outside quite happy again. I'll send your clothes and Mr. Griffin's garters which I have found. UlaMaddocks to Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin 13 July 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to Ula Maddocks - You have been very good in your newsy reports of Castlecrag and we have not been keeping up our end during this rush where Marion has been doing much valiant work filling the breach with gay decorative sketches that overawed and conquered the enemy. For the time being anyway this fort is ours including [Note: ==== Beginning of page 135 ====] the Exposition grounds. Housekeeping with a retinue is no better than anticipated all my life. I set out desperately to be economical, no hot water for baths, no tea, no coffee, only the most seasonable fruits and vegetables, saving electric current by leaving only one light on in the evening and retiring early,daylight saving by rising at 5:30 a.m. power saving by turning off the electric refrigerator at night and by allowing only one punkah fan to run at a time - net result:- 1st fuel bill Rs 20 - \u00a32 for the month Page 107 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago1st elec. bill Rs 40 - \u00a34 for the month plus ice 1st food accnt.

I transferred the latter purchase to one of the Bearers. Inspection of the rendered accounts for bakery, dairy, grocery for which I have insisted that only orders signed by me should be acknowledged show that last month Marion andI consumed 30 quarts of milk, 33 loaves of bread and 40 pounds of sugar. We are both in good health but Marion is no fatter than usual and I find my weight for the first time down to what it was when I left this hemisphere 23 years ago, i.e. 137 pounds. In all our household supplies for June amounted just under Rs. 200 in addition to the part of the wages of the staff that I pay - Rs 135. Such is life in India, the cheapest place in the world to live and where the average income of the 350,000,000 people is Rs. 3 per month! Gandhi lives on Annas 3 per day. I think I know where the main difficulty lies, in the kitchen, but under the circumstances I have not taken the drastic action that I should if these were my own staff and the house were on different terms. One has to be set against the other to a certain extent but not indefinitely. Walter Burley Griffin to Ula Maddocks [Note: ==== Beginning of page [136b] / 137a (table of contents) ====] NO. 7.

Nicholls - Although there are still perhaps a dozen or so of the 60 odd different types of buildings of the Exposition for which elevations have not been sketched, they are mostly the insignificant service buildings. The contract has been let to aCawnpore firm for 7 and one half annas per foot. This is less than my original estimate but the largest Lucknow contractor and the wealthiest and most liked by all was willing to take it for one half anna less so his manager told me. Doubtless there was some political reason for not accepting his bid. In their present mood both the proprietors and the contractors are disposed to let me work out the most economical way of getting the result. The present unpopularity of my enemy, Hosain [Note: Hussain?], is evidenced by the visit this morning of his wealthy client, Bhargava, who has asked me to redesign the large house for Bhargava's brother and to take charge of the construction hereafter. The house I am building for Dr. Batia, half way up now is six feet under water! What it is like after its bath remains to be seen (it came through all right) Walter Burley Griffin to Eric M. Nicholls The location of the Exposition is in the North West section of Lucknow which was central when Page 108 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoLucknow had a million inhabitants, and it is the focus of the main roads today as well as of historical interest. No. 7. INITIAL - ELECTRICITY TOWER - JEWEL ESPLANADE [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] A SIX MONTHS DRIVE THEN ON TO NEW REALMS In India it didn't take long for me to have the same feeling of being at home with the people of this wonderful civilization that Mr. Griffin had expressed. This in spite of the fact that their social systemand their ways of thinking are as utterly different from ours as their language which is almost impossible for a European to learn. You simply can't understand the simplest sentence even knowing the words and having memorized the sentence and knowing the meaning. It simply doesn't make sense. The whole matter is so reversed and so [Note: ==== Beginning of page 137 ====] strangely related that you can't twist your thinking into its form. However the atmosphere is one of a people completely alive, with all capacities functioning, deep interests and great enthusiasms and confidence, no vestige of the fears which dominate the life of the European peoples and shatter their soul forces. There is a great interest in modernism but no tendency to limit enterprise to the material to the elimination of soul and spiritual qualities and output. In material ways it looks as if India would be accomplishing in fifty years what it has taken America a hundred and fifty years to accomplish. The menace lies in the possibility of its becoming a centralized movement whereas the urgent need throughout modern countries is for decentralization, especially functionally - three types of organization - each independent of the others - to meet the needs of the body, of the soul and of the spirit of human beings in a society, each organization as different in form and scope as these three entities of the human being are. It would be a pity if India had to go the circuitous way in the solving of her problems thatEurope has taken. She has a great advantage over Mexico (the mass of whose people has likewise never come under the domination of Rome in either Juridical or imperial thinking or customs) in that she has highly developed intellectual capacities which belong to the Post-Atlantean stream of evolution whose function down through the immediately past millenniums has been to develop man's thinking powers whereas theAmerican-Indian peoples dropped out of the stream in going to the West from Atlantis instead of East, and retained the picture consciousness universal in those long past times. It is a pity Mexico cannot get the benefit of democratic instead of imperial thinking from her nearest neighbor - the United States - to enable her and the United States to develop together the double form of picture-plus-rational thinking which is the essence of 20th Century thinking now overdue. Perhaps thatchange is now coming about. Page 109 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 138 and 139 ====] The consequence in India is that when the European tries to match his intellect against that of the Indian or Moslem, he finds he hasn't a chance. We were interested in the unanimity of advice from Europeanshere never to go to law, that one would have no chance against the subtleties of the thinking powers of these men. I arrived in Lucknow just as Griffin was completing the General Plan for the Exposition. Within a week the plans were completed and the specifications for what terracing of the grounds was required, with location and embankments for the great reflecting pool, and the specifications determining the type ofconstruction for the buildings, some of them brick plastered as is universal in Lucknow, others a type he had noticed with interest which is being used in some of the rural districts, a bamboo frame covered with a woven basket work covered with a concrete-like mud so generally used, which would make it possible to get a great variety of form at a very low cost. He could also count on the use of considerable ornament and filigree tracery which is used very extensively here and done at an amazingly low cost. The next weeks were devoted to driving out certain type designs which made it possible to get a fairly close estimate of the total cost from the contractor on the basis of area. The next six months were a terrific drive for both architect and contractor to get ready for the announced opening date in December. One can glimpse the difficulties when one realizes that there were no drafting boards nor tee-squares in Lucknow. Finally one big board was found in the Technical School, another in a Government office andcarpenters were set to work to make others. A couple of tee-squares turned up from somewhere and we sent to Bombay for others. Neither were draftsmen to be found. So finally the Government allowed some eight or ten of the senior Technical school boys to get credits from their work in our office which filled two big rooms of the house. So these young fellows in their teens came into what might be called a kindergarten of architecture. None had ever used a tee-square. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 140 ====] They were a fine set of young fellows and though I spent most of my time driving and scolding them, they called me \"Mother\" and had a real affection for me as I had for them. But with a design a day to be turned out, sketches completed and rendered for exhibition and publication to be sent all over India, and working drawings during the whole six months and endless details for the structures, and forms allnew, it was a task one wouldn't care to undertake more than once in a lifetime. At the same time there was a continuous succession of private clients whose needs had to be met. Though the draftsmen had the routine European hours, since that was established in Government Offices though by no means elsewhere in India, neither Mr. Griffin nor myself nor our clients were bound by them for from seven o'clock in the morning till ten at night anyone was likely to drop in and,as one of our most continual visitors said, he had never come in, at no matter what time, that he did not find me at the drafting board. Things were complicated here again by the fact that we were working for the government and up against Page 110 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoall the delays and inefficiencies and enmities that are inevitable when an outsider is brought into officialdom though in this case it was the head of the Industrial Department who came to Griffin and asked him to take on the work. He himself often found himself helpless in the coils of the machine. Thechief source of delay and difficulty was an illegitimate child of half European blood with consequently an inferiority complex and great motive force in obstruction. In India, quite apart from the work being done in the office, the relationship with the young men in the office and with our clientele as a whole was a very interesting and delightful experience. The young students brought in to help us could not be blamed for their lack of experience however great a hardshipthe impossibility of getting experienced draftsmen might be to us in meeting the obligations we took on. The connection [Note: ==== Beginning of page 141 (table of contents) ====] LUCKNOW'S SUPERB ARCHITECTURE [Note: There are two images for this one title.

They are beautiful physically, charming and appreciative in manner, earnest, devoted and hardworking, and eager and enthusiastic at the opportunity of having the new experience and the training that Mr. Griffin was offering them. They were in fact fine, sometimes exquisite, draftsmen, or what would be more technically known as tracers. One, an older man, who was with us for a while, was an incredibly exquisite draftsman. Never have I seen such marvelous drawings as he got out when he was given an ornamental detail to carry out for publication.Rarely would a draftsman be called upon in any office today for such a range and variety as was required for this exposition for, although the construction was simple, the drawings were far from being simple. Parabolic domes were things that solved themselves in actual construction with bending bamboos, but were by no means simple problems for a draftsman to solve for either elevations or sections or perspectives - sketches, plans and details driven through in a few months, a greater varietythan would go through any architect's or a dozen architects' offices ordinarily in the course of their whole experience. LUCKNOW'S SUPERB ARCHITECTURE [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustrations found on the preceding page were intended to be placed here.] One of the difficulties we ourselves were up against in delegating this work instead of doing it personally arose not only from the fact that, though a number of these young people spoke English apparently fluently, they, even the best of them, rarely really understood an instruction which lack of Page 111 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagounderstanding could become apparent only after they had made the drawing. But there was also the greater difficulty in that they were in fact too much inclined to think things out themselves. It was extremely difficult for them to take an instruction. In their own work they were in the habit of doingwhat really came out from within themselves, carrying on one might say in the blood stream the results of millenniums of experience in their own particular way of expressing themselves. We ourselves marveled as we stood before the workman decorating pottery with exquisite precision in the finest details with no [Note: ==== Beginning of page 142 ====] mechanical assistance and no pattern before him, but entirely free hand and direct from within. The Technical school was trying to train their students to work from drawings. We had in the office two more experienced men, Mr. Halder, a Hindu, who was our head draftsman, and Mr. Mohsin, a Mohammedan, who was our Superintendent, the out-door man and much older than Mr. Halder. They were wonderful assistants in every way, absolutely trustworthy and most painstaking and watchful of our interests in every direction. It was interesting to see what a close friendship grew upbetween these two men, one Hindu and the other Mohammedan. I had interesting discussions with Mr. Halder especially when I found that he belonged to a comparatively new group, the Vishnavarites, for in the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, Vishnu though spoken of was for the Indians the unknown God, the one who had not yet manifested. Mr. Halder was very devoted and conscientious in giving the required time - long hours daily - to his mediations, and I as an Anthroposophist could speak to him oneven terms as to why Christianity, resting today on faith, could not hold its own with the Indians whose religion was based on knowledge, supersensible knowledge. I called his attention to the fact that if he was entirely unprejudiced - that is without pre-judging - (in which case he would see true in the supersensible realms) his supersensible experiences would reveal to him that Vishnu was the Indian name of the God who incarnated in Palestine whose name to the Europeans was Christ. It would beinteresting indeed if, having taken a definite stand against any Christianizing in India as they have done, as is confirmed by all the missionaries I had an opportunity to talk with, the Indian should come, through the work of this group, in its own way, to a knowledge of Christianity, of the incarnated Ego. Mr. Mohsin was a most remarkable character and really one of the persecuted ones because of his absolute integrity which over and over again foiled the conspiracies against us, conspiracies which areso general in Indian affairs, so that he was constantly being accused of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 143b (table of contents) ====] FOUNTAIN PAVILION CABARET [Note: Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York HistoricalSociety copy.

It was so very kind of you to spend so much time on me when you are so desperately busy, and you will be pleased to hear that it did me a world of good when you told me how you laughed, well I laughed too, and the very fact of laughing put an entirely different perspective on the matter, and I really think that from now on there will always be an aspect that I shall find humorous. Mack has been very good with the Anthro meetings, I do not think he hasmissed one of them but I have missed several. You know that I find that my greatest joy was the talks with you after the meeting, how's that for an heartfelt compliment? Have just sent on your second community letter. What a wonderful time you must be having. It has always been one of the dreams of my life to visit India. I really intend to one of these days when the children are on their feet and I can be free. I would not mind hiking through India with a begging bowl if there were no other way to see it.You will remember how Mack and I hiked across from San Francisco to Chicago dragging the babies in a cart. The parts I want most to see are the Northern parts, the Kashmir valley and the mountains up from the valley toward Leh. Perhaps I'll get that trip yet. Dorothy Searby to Marion Mahony Griffin 15 August. 1936 - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Ula Maddocks - We adore the tales about Deirdre, \"the trees having a fighting game\" was amazing and we shouted with laughter over \"that bigthing is sitting on Griffin's lizard.\" As to your \"enjoying having a finger in the pie\" we think you are in it with both hands having practically made the pie. The exposition has been under construction for some three or four weeks but there have been torrential rains almost every day so walls are being carried up only four feet but all over the place. They want a dome completed by the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 144 ====] end of next week when the Governor is making a visit here. The Gumti went higher than in last month's flood and some 4,000 buildings in Lucknow collapsed. The powers and potentates come in day by day and jobs outside the show are piling up. The latest is the modernizing of a hundred of the 500 rooms of a former Raja's 500 wives, by a descendant whose quota is about one fifth, for the renovation of whichWalt will be making sketches shortly. He has quoted him Rs. 2,500 for plans. The publisher of the Wild Life Magazine brought him this job. He is greatly interested in Walt's architecture, says it is original. The plans for the Agra subdivision go tomorrow, charge Rs. 400. These figures are for Mr. Nicholls' benefit. Mr. Searby, (a chiropractor) you will be interested in the following quotation from Dr. Steiner:- \"The etheric streams follow the path of the nerves.\" As you know the etheric forces are the life forces. I sent you a clipping about the cobra. It is wonderful to have wild peacocks light in your yard and wander around, and to see monkeys around who can take care of themselves. And every night we hear the lions roar (only that is because the Zoo is so near). What a pity it is to be honest. It spoils so many good Page 113 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagostories. The other night we were walking to a movie when we encountered a stream across the road. I didn't want to wade across it in my new cream shoes (you know Mrs. Maddocks) so Walt carried me acrosspick-a-back. Just then with a footman running ahead to make sure the crossing was safe, along came a resplendent coach and four in all its panoply and some 8 or more people in this commodious sort of charabank [Note: large open carriage?] in full view with the Rajah of Jahangirabad in the rear seat so he got a full view down the retreating road. Among his guests was the Governor. All that is not completely true in this story is that Walt insisted on our waiting standing by till this magnificence had passed beforehe would carry me across dangling on his neck, so the Rajah missed a sight I am sure he would have enjoyed. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 145 ====] The contractor of the Exposition is a youth (English) 21 years old, and at present he is living with us. He seems a pleasant youth and I hope the task doesn't prove too heavy for him. Of course he has elder partners (Indians) though it is he who inherited his father's business. He was born and has lived all hislife in India and is very sympathetic with the Indians. He was laid up two days this week with a fever. We have had a very sad thing happen this month. One of our bearers, Das, the majestic one I spoke of, died so suddenly one night that it was thought at first he must have been bitten by a snake. We all went out to their quarters, a group of buildings on the border of the compound - and his little wife sobbed in my arms for an hour and more crying \"Mon Raja, mon Raja est mouri\" - My king, my king is dead -(see the resemblance to French). She stopped only when one of the gardeners, a Brahmin (of the highest caste but working as a day-laborer with the others - in the gardening - you see how we misunderstand the caste business) said \"you must stop crying, Memsahib (myself) tells you to stop crying.\" There are seven children. Das had been bearer to the Editors of the Pioneer for 25 years and they are providing for the family who have returned to their home town where the grandmother lives. Walter Burley Griffin to Ula Maddocks - I can only add a footnote to Marion's account of the happenings here, much abridged as that is. First to wish you many happy returns of your birthday since the simple memento sent you, posted a week ago, will be long in coming. The rough spots of our track with the exposition have by no means all been smoothed out and because of the deep-seated motives and persistence of our few opponents we have to make continual fresh starts and sidetrack efforts in the faceof time limits which do not provide for that sort of thing. The official Director is a weak vacillating type who interrupts and diverts to meet nonessentials and yields to fears which are pumped into him incessantly, and makes important decisions without consulting me. If not reversed, sooner or later these would destroy our scheme entirely as is the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 146b (table of contents) ====] LIBRARY ELEVATION AND CROSS SECTION [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript.

However we are hopefully going on making the most beautiful exposition yet, despite a few open sores, black eyes and teeth knocked out as there will be in the final outcome. I shall write to Komalan Craig, and also look after her commission of a planting list for the continuous blossoming for Ronald's grave just as soon as I can, but at the moment my hands are full. Marion Mahony Griffin & Walter Burley Griffin to Ula Maddocks LUCKNOW LIBRARY - END ELEVATION & CROSS SECTION [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] 20 August 1936 - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Eric M. Nicholls - Another battle royal fought and won. Day before yesterday Walt sent in his resignation to the Exposition Director. Yesterday, in the presence of the Minister, the Director agreed to Walt's requirements, and today at 7 a.m. everybody isover at the grounds welcoming the Governor who is here to see how things are getting on. The enemy who has a Hitleresque power with the Director fought tirelessly for his various destructive points but lost on all of them. Walter's three requirements were First:- that his plan should be considered as final and no changes to be made except omissions if the Governor found they couldn't afford them, leaving the way open to build if means were found later. Second:- Control of all money expended thus controlof contractor who was inclined to take the enemy's advice and cut out everything except raw construction since he is being paid per square foot of area of foundations. Now he will be paid only on Walter's certificate. Third:- That decisions on all matters, final ones, could be made by the Director's brother who lives here so is constantly available and who is sympathetic to making the show beautiful instead of a shanty town. This meant that some work already done over Walt's head in the wrong placewill be torn down, etc., etc. The package you sent arrived much to our satisfaction. Walt's eyes stuck out when he saw the box of chewing gum. He immediately took one of his kind and I one of my kind. The next day when he saw me chewing he asked me if it was the same piece I had taken the day before. As a result of long training and consequently an understanding of how a wife ought to meet such a situation, I refused to tell him.The next time [Note: ==== Beginning of page 147 ====] I wanted a piece of gum I couldn't find the box. I accused him of hiding it. He denied, but the next day he produced the box. Peace now reigns in the family. Genevieve [Note: Lippincott, WBG's sister], Walt is writing to Father oftener than monthly though probably the boats don't get them over oftener. We enjoy our association with the Indian people very Page 115 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagomuch though in our wild rush at present we contact only those connected with our work but an architect's work brings him in touch with all sorts of people. I have been thrilled from the beginning with how many handsome men there are. One sees every European type only instead of being homely[Note: \"ugly\" has been crossed out] as our menfolk are (father excepted) these are perfectly beautiful. We rarely see the women though I have glimpsed several lovely ones. Occasionally a man brings his wife along to see the strange Mrs. Griffin, architect and draftsman, working at her drafting board twelve hours a day. They always have the satisfaction of finding me there. When here one realizes that India can never be unified nor have a feeling for humanity as a whole until the seclusion of women ends.There is no way of their knowing each other. There is no social life, only family life except in the small villages where there is some neighborliness. This is a general statement. There is a very considerable number of individual women who are getting a thorough education and are functioning in community affairs, including exhibiting and lecturing at the Exposition. Lillian [Note: Lillian Hamilton Moore?], you remember the darling contraption you gave me some years ago, the necklace of sewing equipment. I let Walt bring it over with him. It is one of our constant companions and reminder of you. Was sorry not to have been able to send you the pointers re the Haven Theatre shows for publication but the pressure hasn't given us a moment. And Dorothy [Note: Searby], you can rest easy re the Teddy bear mascot you gave me. The little Koala is being well cared for. Our Siamese cats Minnie and Monster had a family of four kittens and as they get older and scamper off ontheir own, much to the anxiety of their mother, she takes much satisfaction in taking Koala off my dressing table, walking off with him [Note: ==== Beginning of page 148 ====] and mothering this foster child. Every time I put him back, down she takes him. These Siamese cats are more like dogs than cats, demand attention, want to be talked to. If I don't pay attention to Monster he gets up on his hind legs with his front paws on my legs and gazes into my face. If I don't pet and talk tohim he jumps upon me as if he were climbing a tree, not at all pleasant with my thin clothes, now I pay attention to him when he demands it. At times it is quite a problem to keep him from settling under my chin on my drawings or letters to lie for hours. Our Indian draftsmen watch to see how I treat Monster. I'm sure I'm being judged thereby. 9 a.m. Well they are just back from the Governor's visit and the roll of drawings is here, so I must to breakfast and then to my task. I have a regular kindergarten of architecture here, ten draftsmen who are having to do tasks quite beyond them so I have to teach them projection, etc. and keep my eyes peeled for mistakes all the time. The contractor's manager - Ishmael an Indian - is a very fine and interesting man and likes to talk Anthro with me as does our head draftsman Mr. Halder. Just received Miss Birch's letter with the great newsabout Stella Miles Franklin's prize for her new book - \"All That Swagger\" and the promise of its publication. (It is a great story. All Americans should read it - a true story of pioneer life in Australia.) Love and congratulations to her. Received Lute Drummond's lovely letters. Am so glad she kept the Anthroposophic Fairy Tales. No time for reading them here these days. When her class has translated them she could have each one write out one translation and then Miss Shead could make five copies ofeach for the Castlecrag children's library. I have a Steiner book with a number of Children's and Page 116 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoMother's prayers. Will send some on when I get a chance to translate them. Marion Mahony Griffin 30 August 1936 - Walter Burley Griffin to Ula Maddocks - Am enclosing a letter to father for you to forward to him. Our boy builder is putting up a temporary brick house for himself on permissiveoccupancy near the exposition [Note: ==== Beginning of page 149b (table of contents) ====] LIBRARY SECTIONS AND DETAILS [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript. Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy. This illustration is of the second version of the Lucknow University Library.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 149 ====] and we have been considering doing likewise for the period from 15 October when the Youngs may return. However we are first going to shop around for a lot on which to do the same thing in a different way and not lose all the principal in 4 months, little though that amount may be. It does not look as ifour Monsoon were over for when it does not rain we drip and only when it does rain is it cool. Either way is a relief however since the construction can go on only when it is not raining. I have prepared a flowering shrub planting list for Ronald's grave which I hope to attend to setting out before writing Mrs. [Note: Komalan] Craig. Walter Burley Griffin to Ula Maddocks LUCKNOW LIBRARY SECTIONS & DETAILS [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] 30 August. 1936 - Lucknow - Walter Burley Griffin to George W. Griffin - Marion is working like a slave and she is the only effective help I have had for this exhibition. (Mr. Molder worked only on the private jobs.) We should be further ahead if we had not experimented with a dozen scratch draftsmenwhom she spends much time teaching and then doing their work over again. However things are moving somewhat out on the grounds so that in the face of the floods during July and August which covered and may again cover half the site the showing was quite a surprise for the Governor whom the Public Works Department had led to believe that the task was impossible. Our boy contractor who is living with us comes home entirely discouraged at each constructional problem, where his foreman talks and where detractors decry. But a way seems to open immediately afterwards. Lately it was that the poles sagged so that nobody would risk erecting the first 50 foot peak but they did it and it was raised. Yesterday after a day's struggle the bamboo ribs of domes and vaults would not bend and that because of the snake season and the floods no green ones could be obtained for two months! Then a good fairy came along who told us what to do and the dry bamboos are beingstored in the Hussainabad Tank under water for three days to make them pliable. Page 117 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe people here have used bamboo, jaffrey and clay all their lives but only in restricted ways which are not subject to the dictates of more common sense. When the latter is applied over the workers dead [Note: ==== Beginning of page 150 ====] bodies it usually works however just as well in India as in the West to the surprise of all and sundry. The salvation of my position as well as the difficulty of it lies in the limited time. There is no leisure to apply the \"wearing down\" policy that worked so well at Canberra. After a lapse of some months, heard from our bank job at Jhansi this week when the supervisor got into deep water through having substituted inadequate steel beams for the reinforced concrete roof girders I had designed for the [Note: Jwala] bank. So I paid my first visit to this town about 190 miles SouthWest spending a day there redesigning a Manager's residence, redesigning the interior of the bank to provide for the structural change, and detailing the exterior modeled ornament of columns, cornices, etc. Here I had my first experience of modeling full size in damp clay and with three or four assistants a perfect model resulted only to be destroyed, before it could be copied in mortar, by urchins who ran over it. So this had to be done again from scratch in position in two variations. The horizontal membersand ornament were modeled in lime mortar in the first instance, a slower but more reliable process. At Jhansi toward evening I went for a stroll to the old fort and historic city. This veritable castle is the most impressive I have seen yet though its situation is not as spectacular as that of Gwalior. It has towering bastions, barbettes, bassillions [Note: \"Basilians\" stonetoo. I surmounted one of those rocky buttes that are characteristic of the district, and the walled city lies at its base. (No wonder he was never stumped in the naming of the streets of Castlecrag. M.M.G.) Jhansi is quite unlike Lucknow or Agra or Delhi and does not seem so dense and untidy. It is predominately Hindu and abounds in beautiful cylindrical temples which are far more imaginistic though less comprehensive than the studied Mohammedan buildings of the United Provinces. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 151b (table of contents) ====] ULA MADDOCKS AND DEIRDRE [Note: There are two images for this one title. This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript. Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in theNew-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 151 ====] In the parts I trudged through from 5 to 8 p.m. the people were quite different in appearance, on the whole, lighter and not so hardboiled as the natives of this Province. I was surprised in all this because I had known of Jhansi only as a military center, and a Railway town of the Great India Peninsular Page 118 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoSystem. The stone is evidently intractable and is in irregular chunks laid with considerable range in sizes and plenty of mortar sometimes interspersed with the oriental bricks about one inch thick - which were universal before the European influx - and which give a beautiful texture. I also found some reallybeautiful brown brick of this shale-field texture never intended for plastering as in the case of the United Provinces. The overseer of our bank building was very apologetic over the various liberties taken with both design and construction and for which perhaps the Proprietor was as much to blame as anyone. No client or workman in India has the slightest respect for plans or details even if there should be one who had theslightest understanding of them which I doubt. Perhaps the next time with the same parties the case may be different. The client in this case admires the building such as it is, and has a site now for another [Note: Jwala bank] in Cawnpore, I believe, which he wishes me to do. For journeyman Architects, such as we are, there is not much in life but our trade to write about but that has its thrills along with its trials. Walter Burley Griffin to George W. Griffin ULA MADDOCKS & DEIRDRE [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] 7 September, 1936 - Castlecrag - Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin - How nice of you to remember my birthday in the midst of so busy a life. The gold hair band and bagpleased me immensely. I have a black evening frock with which I wear a gold coat so you see your gifts provide the perfect accessories. You know peacocks are anathema to the superstitious. Is this a challenge to me to rule my stars and ignore timid inhibitions and safety policy? I've already broken two mirrors and I'm dying to flaunt this golden peacock abroad. But they are incredibly lovely birds. Sometimes the things that have become banal in literature, as roses and peacocks and moonlight,astonish one with fresh beauty [Note: ==== Beginning of page 152 ====] when met with face to face. To have wild peacocks alight in your garden must be a rare sight. Mr. Nicholls has just telephoned me he has a letter from you today but he's working like a Trojan and will be late again tonight so I'll not see it until morning. I told Deirdre what you said about the battle between the light and the dark making all the colors. She loves it. At sunset time in the excitement of somuch color she waves her arms vigorously saying \"plash, plash\" and does twice around the lawn to give bodily expression to the thrill. I was too amused to be annoyed today when Deirdre came and announced that - \"I swallowed an egg down the sink.\" I investigated and found a broken shell on the drain board and realized that the contents had disappeared down the plug hole of the sink. \"Swallowed\" was an apt term for the pause and then the disappearance in one gulp of a good fresh egg down the sinkpipe. You have stressed this early period for the training of all the senses giving wide experience to all of them. I have been lightly directing her attention to scents and she has responded readily, our own scented gum, the leaves of the scented angophora by the Johnston's gate, the big leaved wattle on the lawn, a verbena and just now jasmine. All these she knows and others too like freshly out paw-paw, pineapples and lately we had strawberries. I said, \"We'll wait till Edgar comes before eating them.\" She Page 119 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosaid, \"But may I smell them till Edgar comes?\" which meant I hadn't the heart to refuse and if a few did disappear it was hardly by conscious decision on her part but a nose-hand-mouth reaction that went off on its own accord. One can't wallop a kid for that. I went to the Nicholls' to the Anthro meeting last Sunday and intend to continue whenever I can leave the family. G.K. Chesterton wrote an amusing poem from the dog's point of view. They haven't got no noses, The fallen sons of Eve Even the smell of rosesIs not what they supposes But more than mind discloses [Note: ==== Beginning of page 153 ====] And more than men believe ......... too long to quote but ends - They haven't got no noses Goodness only knowsesThe noselessness of man. It takes Anthroposophy to reveal that smells reveal the presence of the life ether, and their importance in humus for gardens. A fire broke out near the golf links on Sunday - a hot day and a breeze blowing. Deans and Nicholls worked like Trojans at it and put it out. They really were tireless. They packed me back when I arrivedin overalls with a rake on my shoulder. Nicholls said I'd be more nuisance falling over precipices and such and that this wasn't the Spanish war. So they drank the tea I'd brought and scrambled back to finish their difficult task. There's not so much destroyed so do not be apprehensive. Your garden here is looking very well. The mesembrianthemums at the gate are a blaze of color and the gate painted green adds to the picture. The bottlebrush above the bamboos are blooming, a very fine leaved small orangeone is particularly lovely. The lawn does not get much chance - there is such a traffic of children over it. Many honey-eaters come to the callistemons. The children have just come for crumbs to throw to them and at the moment all are quiet and pensive sitting on the lawn watching them. I would like to send you a living picture of them. We are on the track of another house to be built at Roseville. The woman is meeting Mr. Nicholls tomorrow and seeing the Pratten houses. The second Pratten house is nowfinished and is very lovely - that warm stone and settled down on the earth (battered walls) as if it was connected with the Earth's live center - not an accretion like all the houses around. I would like to show it to you - like a bulb that has flowered in your absence. But then - you created the bulb! How do you do it? To quote Ron Craig in a letter from Lucknow on Walter Burley \"This is my first experience with sheer, pure, unadulterated genius.\" Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley & Marion Mahony Griffin The Pent House, 17 Bond Street, Sydney - Lute Drummond to Marion Mahony Griffin - You were laying your plans, counting your chances for being a musician in your next incarnation. Well Miss Leeson has lent me a new Page 120 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 154 ====] book by Cecil Grey called \"Predicaments, on Music and the Future.\" [Note: \"Predicaments; or, Music and the Future\" (1936)] It is very interesting indeed especially when dealing with architecture - the arts dominating in repeating sequences - \"the first to awaken from its slumber was unquestionablyarchitecture (the spacial [Note: spatial?] art using the forces of Saturn, the space creator). Then sculpture, painting, literature, and, in the 19th century, music. Here we have a definite sequence starting from the 11th century. We are now due for another cycle starting with architecture.\" Today in conformity with Prof. Petrie's theory and with observable fact we are living in an age dominated by anti-artistic activities such as mechanics, science, wealth, but already we see emergingfrom it a new phase of more purely artistic activity in which Architecture, as in the 11th and 12th centuries, is once more the dominant factor. It follows that in the immediate future all the arts will aspire toward the conditions of architecture. Consequently the values which will most probably characterize the music of the future will be architectural values.\" And speaking of music of the future he adds \"and the kind of form most likely to characterize this art is architectural form for architecture as we have seenseems destined to be the archetype of the immediate future. Architecture, of all the arts, is the one which is best reconciled into a unity the eternal antithetic duality of classicism and romanticism. Architecture has been well expressed in the well known dictum - that architecture is frozen music. The corollary that music is molten architecture provides the best possible index to the nature of the musical art which is to come. Its leading place during the coming period is further strengthened by the fact that of all the artsarchitecture is the least nationalistic and this may well be one of the reasons to account for its almost complete eclipse during the whole of the 19th century. In the second place it is the most impersonal of all the arts. The art we are led to visualize then is the one neither classic nor romantic but partaking of the attributes of both, monumental in style, cosmopolitan [Note: ==== Beginning of page 155 ====] in idiom, communal in thought, impersonal in expression, organic in form with every part, every detail, every note even discharging its function, strictly subordinate to the whole.\" [Note: The preceding quotation probably starts at the beginning of the paragraph.] So my dear when you come back to this earth after your sojourn in the spiritual realms, having your architectural background already in this life you'll be ready to float in on the new classic polyphonic idiom which is awaiting the magician's wand to give it its glorious form. The whole book is absorbing. I have told Nicholls about it. He is getting very interested in Anthroposophy - taking it as a life necessity. He hasn't said this but it is very evident. Bim and Roma Hilder who have a large room in their new home would love to have us use it for our next festival. I think we might accept it for somehow there is a freedom in the home of artists which one does not get elsewhere. That is why we roamed around your castle as if we were the sole proprietors. The German groups are working hard - preparing for performances. They love this cottage on the roof Page 121 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowhich is so central as well. (Right in the heart of Sydney's business district - a pent house on the roof.) The sun is just streaming in warming even my bare legs for although it is supposed to be mid-winter I can write this in my pajamas. Nearly like India, nicht wahr? I saw a film on India last Thursday, and thevarious views of Lucknow were very lovely. Dick had to sing some of the Indian love-lyrics. It was a private function. You can imagine where my thoughts were. We're doing Mozart's \"Marriage de Figaro\" at the E.S.W. next Thursday in the afternoon illustrated by the young singers. They enjoy rehearsing their ensembles on my roof. In fact they would never go home unless forced. I have a young policeman with a top \"C\" who is like a young Apollo more or less, so thegirls are nicely balanced now and I needn't go out of the studio looking for tenors or baritones. They are right on the spot. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 156 ====] I finished the 12 lectures, Dr. Steiner's \"New Art of Education\" to the teachers at Neutral Bay. They were all at the Indian film and are coming to see me on Monday evening. They kept up their interest to the last. And Jo - \"Der schoene Jungling\" also comes to see me. He has gone to learn speech fromStewart Montgomery having at last come to realize that a careless and shapeless accent is beneath the dignity of an intelligent human being. His first contact with a different kind of human being, so he told me on Friday, and other than the swearing and racing and batting genus, was through Mr. Herbert, and on to us at Castlecrag. He wants to matriculate and go to America to study at Springfield. He is coming to dine with me next Friday week and show me his vowel and consonant exercises. Dora Jackson justrang me and wants to be remembered to you both. Prometheus is growing a beautiful boy (Born while our play of Prometheus Bound was on in the Valley.) Phyllis was in Cologne when we last heard and Joan was settled in the castle in Vienna doing her intensive studies and loving it all. And now many thanks for all your help. I can see you with the flaming torch carrying the truth of the Spirit even into the land of the Krishna and the Bhagavad Gita. Love to you and Mr. Griffin, Lute Drummond. Dear Georgine (from M.M.G.), Miss Drummond's letter arose from the fact that I thought I had the promise of being a musician in my next life as in this incarnation I was fulfilling a number of things Steiner says may be prerequisites. I am an architect, working with form, also in mural decoration, have mathematical talent, have worked with music \"no matter with how little effective results,\" etc. And we have always stressed the importance of maintaining the balance and making full use of both classic andromantic principles.

I told her not to grow up, to make the exams a game to seehow much she knew and to have great fun waiting for the results. She thoroughly enjoyed them and was most amusing over them and incidentally did very well and pleased her teacher. She asked me the other day - \"How old are you? Were you born in the reign of William the Conqueror?\" Another time she said - \"Peggy says when she grows up and has little girls of her own she's going to beat them every time they do anything wrong and bring them up good citizens. I'm notgoing to do that. I'm going to bring them up like you do me, by love. I'm not going to be a horrid grown-up lady - I'm not going to be a lady at all.

However the rains switched the main efforts of the builders off the brickwork onto the bamboo and jaffry work at which they have been stalling heretofore, because of lack of experience. The past week the skeletons of the domes have been springing up like bubbles. The huge amusement area is still mostly submerged mud flat but nearly every important structure outside that section is under construction. Moreover the exhibitors all over India have begun towaken and the Director is more encouraged to go on than to hold back and cut out.

The roads being impossible for this fifty mile journey, I went by rail accompanied by the young Rajah's younger brother, the only first class passengers in the only first class compartment of the train or trams for we had one change. The trip out took only the afternoon, but the return trip lasted from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. the delays being at the junction occasioned by the precarious condition of the mile-long bridge across the Golga, the mostunreliable of Indian rivers in its most erratic season. The altered channel had been cutting down at one pier from fifteen to seventy five feet below water level, i.e., to but fifteen feet from the foundation ninety feet deep. Hence all the passengers on that section of the Bengal North-Western had to disembark and walk across this part of the bridge to another train. There is a picturesque sailboat-ferry for other kinds of vehicles. The Mahmudabad railway station is one of the four villages aggregating 8,000 populationwhich surround the palace separated only by the wide moat on three sides and by the park into which the moat has been converted on the entrance front. It has been too recently extended to be altogether charming and is of the Lucknow version of Mogul architecture with Italian flavoring. The Rajah Sahib was broadcasting Indian music to the Indian villages as he does every evening from phonograph records, and we viewed the scene from the upper story balconies. For three nights Ioccupied, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 160 (table of contents) ====] LIBRARY AND MUSEUM .

Opening off the dining room the Rajah's room was ascetic by comparison with that of his guest opening from the drawing room. The first morning I selected the site for the new [Note: Mahmudabad] library for 100,000 books choosing, from the three alternatives, the one just outside the moat and overlooking a long reach of it. Previously in the evening I had been taken out a mile or two to a spot alongside a tank where I am to build a modest cottage for the two brothers converting the pond into a \"paka\" swimming pool at the same time. This is so that the Rajah may have a place he \"can call his own\" escaping from an existencefor all the world like that of Henry VIII as characterized in the film where Charles Laughton was unable to escape from his courtiers by any strategy. LIBRARY - RAJA MAHMUDABAD [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] After that we looked at some of the thousands of books, stored in the third floor towers, of the library that is to be devoted to Indiana or perhaps less ambiguously, Indianiana. There for the first time I viewed the rings of Saturn and the moons of Jupiter through a telescope. The next afternoon we had popcorn for afternoon tea because I had asked about that kind of Indian corn, and with the help of a compass and a globe we worked out the bearing of Mecca from Mahmudabadand found that its angle with the axis of the palace was about 30\u00b0. Hence for the Mosque for the family which I am asked to build, I selected an angle in the wall between the main compound and the Zenana Court yard for a hexagonal \"bastion\" mosque which with its mihrab properly pointed toward Mecca will not clash in its grouping with the surroundings as does practically every Mosque I have seen including those adjoining the Exposition I am building and that with which I have planned the Pioneer building toparallel. It is intended that this small mosque shall be as \"modern\" as was the first that was worked out in the terms of the Koran and [Note: ==== Beginning of page 161b (table of contents) ====] RAJA MAHMUDABAD [Note: This illustration is from the periodical \"Indian Wild Life.\" Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 161 ====] its one minaret shall be equipped with a loud speaker for muezzin!

His final heirs are the two sisters to whom the Mohammedan brothers are now married andthe estates henceforth are merged. The original brothers agreed so well on most everything that they had the same architect for their forts and chose almost identical furnishings, bric-a-brac, paintings, etc., but Belahra has been much less added to and has an elevated site and is on that account more picturesque especially on the side of its ramp approaches. It took half a day to traverse the various rooms and courts and to appraise the repairs and alterations necessary to convert this into a Durban [Note: durbar?, i.e., acourt or public audience] building which we are commissioned to do at the same time giving to it something more of oldtime character of fortress than it now has. Can you imagine anything more congenial to me? We had expected to have to make this little journey by elephant but couriers brought word that the road was possible for car which proved to be precisely right. Possibly to preclude any disappointment on mypart an elephant followed on in the afternoon and we set out in a shikar into the surrounding meadows and marshes, seven of us on the elephant's back with an ox-cart load of \"monskere\" - jesters - four footmen and four horsemen - and one bicyclist. Our host, the president of the Wild Life Preservation Conference of India is also the President of the United Province Association for the Preservation of Game, and had therefore no very bad conscience when he bagged only a snake, a pigeon and two otherbirds suitable for the kulis [Note: coolies] of the party. The peacocks we saw kept too far out of range and we did not find anything else, but on viewing the sunset from the castle on our return, all voted it the end of a perfect day. Though they cooked for me European food, of which the younger brother partook slightly, and enough for half a dozen guests, they [Note: \"Shikar\" is Anglo-Indian word for a \"hunt.\" The phrase used by WBG should probably read \". . . we set out on a shikar . . .\" This page is not in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 162 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING .

Though I was somewhat upset in my digestive tract the last night after this high living and the little dinner I ate, I noted that the Rajah himself skipped it altogether and did not even appear at breakfast Page 126 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothough he drove us to the station thereafter, perfect host and gentleman that he is.

I hope December will bring a pause from work. Will you pleasekeep half a dozen of those albums of sketches of the Exposition buildings such as you sent me. Several people want mine and I won't give it up but they want it so badly that I fear me they'll pinch it if I let it get out of my hands. Here it has caused quite a stir of appreciation and admiration and affection for you folks. Yesterday I took some visitors over to the Pratten houses, then to afternoon tea with Eunice Cameron. Her garden is flourishing with many lovely rock plants most of which you suggested to her. She offered me cuttings and roots. I am to go another day because with Halloween on my hands I'd not have the time to spend a day planting them out just now. \"The Pinnacle\" is let to Miss Stella Scroggie. Did I tell you that the indirect lighting in our Barbette house is a great success. There were many doubts expressed about those troughs (carried around the rooms at door and window head height to conceallamps completely, lighting the rooms indirectly) but as we switched the light on for the first time there was great excitement and Mrs. Guyatt said, \"There, don't ever tell me that Walter Burley isn't a genius!\" [Note: ==== RAZA BUNGALOW .

Can you write me about the block by return mail as it will help the movement. Lute Drummond - to Walter Burley Griffin P 164FOREWORD The Managing Editor of Indian Wild Life in publishing the following article by Mr. Griffin says:- The Editor is particularly gratified to have this article from the pen of Walter Burley Griffin who has achieved such world wide distinction as an architect, landscape architect and Town Planner; and to whom we, as wild life conservationists, owe so much for his noble vision in setting out the originalplans of the Federal Capital City of Australia [Note: Canberra], and for his monumental work mentioned in this article. Mr. Griffin and his colleagues are at present setting a great example and object lesson for the whole of Australia in the work of occupational conservation which they are engaged upon in the areas here described. OCCUPATIONAL CONSERVATION Walter the current tentative names here or [Note: ==== Beginning of page 165 ====] abroad for overlapping experiments directed toward attaining greater unity in our use and administration of the land. Each successive stage has been missing its mark because of the deficient consciousness of alarger organic element of which it has sooner or later found itself to be but a part. Comprehensive planning will have to learn from Mother Nature the secret of growth and equilibrium, and that conservation which contrasts so strikingly with the devastation, even to desert conditions, that the greatest of man's civilizations have always left in their wake, and which is proceeding at accelerating pace in spite of recent pricks of our consciences, and of all the attempted safeguards possible to ourpresent consciousness. Castlecrag is an effort toward Land Planning in the fundamental sense of arranging for that use to which the terrain is most suitable. Land in this sense is accorded the respect due to a highly developed and perfected living organism not to be exterminated nor treated as dead material, nor as a mere section of the map. That part of the Metropolitan Unity which comprises the natural setting of Sydney has nowgone through a metamorphosis throughout its whole extent, from Botany Bay almost to Broken Bay, so complete that without the latter's fortunate survival one would scarcely be able to picture the Sydney of the last century with its then justly famous Harbour. In the eighteen-eighties upper Middle Harbour was chosen in advance of the farther Eastern suburbs, by a far-seeing group, for residential development; and the monumental Suspension Bridge was built togive access. For this, however, the Government so positively denied either tramway facilities or franchise that the bulk of the territory was precluded from occupation until the days of private motor Page 128 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocars. Since 1920 the motive of the suburban development of 750 acres of this land in Castlecrag, Castlecove and Covecrag peninsulas in Middle Harbour within five miles of the City center has been the permanent preservation, through the vigilance of numerous interested owners and appreciative [Note: ==== Beginning of page 166 ====] rangers, of the pristine loveliness of some five miles of remnant of the rock bound woodland coves. Whatever benefits may accrue from a general overhead Governmental and public interest, no control that is not localized in the strictest sense possible, i.e. personal, has ever yet availed to prevent the disappearance of our wild life before the advancing population. In the present incipient stage of general understanding of nature even the best of our organized communities, authorities and municipalitiessuffer their reserves to be \"improved\" or despoliated, gradually obliterating the natural character. It is only necessary to stand on some lookout such as Covecrag to be able to distinguish, from all the rest, primitive spots that are under the care of considerate owners and are not indiscriminately accessible to the public. Unfortunately the cases of personal protective interests are exceptional; and even for these the hazards of bush fires, vandalism, rubbish dumping and reckless depredation for flowers, plants, firewood, poles, bee-trees, timber, soil, sand and stones are uninsurable. Notwithstanding these difficulties and the unsympathetic obstacles of the public authorities, the restoration to the natural state has already been noticeable in Castlecrag with a resident community of about two dozen families only, and during the period of surveys and construction work of many miles of roads and sewers, as well as playing areas,baths, tennis courts and golf courses besides the quarrying and housing. These operations have not so appreciably silted up the coves as in other sections because of the general contour alignment of the narrow roads, their early sealing and the drainage precautions taken wherever possible. The placing of the roads and the allocation of the home sites thus required complete topographical surveys followed by detailed personal feature-studies in order to determine and to conserve the distinctive formations andflora. The whole of the shores, the predominant heights, the caves and [Note: ==== Beginning of page 167 ====] sculptural rocks are embraced in a connected system of local reserves which separate and screen the lots at the garden fronts. In the same way the roadside and junction groves and thickets screen and make private their street fronts. Thus in addition to the site individually occupied by a self-selected nature lover, there is a reserve on two sides over which, as a contiguous owner, he has an interest through the local Parks Committee of each neighborhood in which the control of these areas will all ultimately be vested. At present one Committee administers the Castlecrag reserves - collecting the ten shillings peryear provided for by covenant from each abutting lot for the expense of upkeep and improvement. Nearly 2,000 native trees and shrubs have been planted by this means. As the Castlecrag plans provided for general segregation of pedestrian from vehicular traffic, these connected reserves will eventually be Page 129 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoprovided with woodland short-cut paths and steps with lighting in contradistinction to the circuitous driveways as required by the gradients, where the land rises in ledges to 330 feet above the tidewater that washes the shores of these promontories. The common property interest in the adjacent play space, for the children especially, of each neighborhood of homes surrounding such an area, fills a want and restores a corrective in the social life of a great city which has been a most important factor of the more healthy country communities. TheCastlecrag social will arises from the consciousness of a unified plan and purpose and provides persuasion and example that have resulted in a practice of not clearing each property to afford evidenceof the personal will or assertiveness that seeks to express itself in artificial gardens, or otherwise irrespective of justification. The acid soil of the Hawksbury sandstone underlying the Middle Harbour has furnished what is undoubtedly the cleanest, most delicate and varied ligneous evergreen perpetually-blossoming flora extant. For these reasons no vegetation could be better to live with, free as it is of rank growth,brambles, burrs, weeds or plants seasonably untidy.

Not the least important factor in the conservation of nature is, however, the covenant-controlled housing to prevent obtrusive or obstructive buildings and enclosures. The vernacular practice in this respect is all to the contrary, in forms that are unnecessarily bulky as well as uncouth, in colors that are harsh and hot, and in construction that is intolerant of the proximity of trees or shrubs as with palings [Note: wooden fencing?], and through the susceptibility of the roofs to fire, climbers or falling branches and the encouragement afforded by the elevated timber flooring to roots, white ants and vermin. The typicalhouses so far exhibit indestructible construction of stone and concrete with flat impregnable terrace roofs and natural stone textures which, wherever they are visible at all, merge with the primitive features and leave the land 100% that rock garden which it was created.

I have just sent a somewhat detailed account to Molly Nicholls which should be typed and sent on to you. We are in a heavenly spot here and fairies certainly led up to it. A palatial house with stately formal garden, big trees, and not an excessive rent.The avenues in every direction are lined with magnificent trees, Lucknow is [Note: ==== Beginning of page 169 ====] certainly a lovely city and we are now in the suburb of the princes, Sultan Gang meaning the Sultans' district. Interestingly enough, in the original Town Plan of Lucknow, Couper Road where we have been living is where the Architects were allocated. Though we can glimpse the surrounding houses from the street, from the house one sees none of the other buildings. The lawyer who effected our lease lives nextdoor (an Indian) and is going to give us lessons in Hindi. Though we have been studying it a bit when a moment offered we can't say we have made any perceptible progress. Our landlord lives about two doors away. Am so glad Clarmyra does not find teaching too trying. It will be great if she has her mother's genius in that field. This is what Miss Drummond says about Mr. Nicholls:- \"Mr. Nicholls is a tower of strength to me and is growing rapidly into Anthroposophy.

He does things for me, quickly and without any ado.\" - Marion Mahony Griffin to Georgine Mahony Smith 15 Saunders Road, 1936 - Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Molly Nicholls - We are not going from bad to worse but from good to better. Our compound (yard in the Yankee language) is 220 feet by 360 feet with the palace (you should see it by moonlight) set about half way back. One (not we) drivesin one gate, through the porte-cochere, and out the other gate. Fine trees and big ones, especially around the border, thickets and hedges, the drive lined with an informal hedge of \"Our Lady of the Night\" which fills the air with perfume as soon as the sun sets though its flower is but a tiny greenish blossom. The fairies brought us here. We were being tossed about with various alternative suggestions none of them materializing and meanwhile Lucknow filling up with people for the Exposition months. Onesuggestion to move into a hospital building, empty now, that is to be used as an hostel, so as to be on the spot for convenience in superintending the Show - a bluff, dangling from day to day by not turning on water or electric light; one to live on the University campus also on and off; one a house on which we had advanced a month's rent and then had our check returned as it had already been rented by another agent, etc. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 170b (table of contents) ====] THE ROYAL TOMBS OF KAISERBAGH Page 131 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 170 ====] Finally I was not willing to impose on the Youngs any longer though both of them were perfectly lovely and insisted there was no urgency about our getting out. So we set out to hunt something down. We found the boarding houses filled up for the whole winter, but one told us of an empty house near by. We went but were told that it was not available so left but as we were going we saw a young couple drive up in their tonga [Note: \"two-wheeled covered horse cart\" from I.2.37] so we went back to see if they might be willing to go 50,50 on the house. They were not the tenants but were searching likeourselves and would be glad to have half a house (credentials exchanged Walt the architect of the Exposition and Mr. Stephens a Government official). So our tongas [Note: \"covered horse cart[s]\" from I.2.37] trailed around together till finally a stray man said he knew a house that was available and we were led to a different suburb where all the buildings are palaces in beautiful extensive gardens, the suburb of the Indian nahwabs [Note: nawabs?] - Sultan Gang. The last tenant, a Rajah, had paid Rs. 250 a month rent but they offered it to us for about half that (The Stevens were at home in the Indian language, Mrs. Stephens an Anglo-Indian) and it divides perfectly into quarters for three families, so we took it and have already had an application for the third apartment but he had too many servants. At present the Stevens are to occupy the East half, their preference, on the ground floor. We shall use the great middle entrance and the center room, almost like a court, incommon as a reception room and Walt will use the South-West corner room as his private office. Our intention is to use the spiral tower stairway and the suite on the roof for ourselves subletting the other half of the lower floor. Upstairs is lovely all facing south and opening out to a big roof terrace. We would be living among the treetops and no house visible anywhere except the turrets of Butler Palace, our neighbor across the street (for we are on the corner) a full block away, in its great gardens some twoblocks square. It is one of the notable palaces of Lucknow. Our exterior is spick and span as all Lucknow is fast becoming with its annual new coat of whitewash, greenish grey [Note: ==== Beginning of page 171 ====] with white trimmings. This whitewashing is done every year in Lucknow.Miss Drummond gave us a vivid picture of the plays but no one has told us who took the role of Merlin. She was thrilled with Mr. Nicholls' architectural effects. What a living thing Miss Drummond has made of the Anthro society - Anthroposophy, that new world conception comparable to that of Copernicus which succeeded that of the Greek conception of a flat world with the sun and stars swinging around it - and how wonderfully everyone is taking his part. Tell her that Walt will write herfor this Air Mail the technicalities for getting possession of one or the other locations for the Little Theatre. The wording of the function of those reserves gives the Council no rights of ownership at all. That wording was another of Walt's inspirations for when that plan was laid down he had no idea of the difficulties there would be in establishing proper open spaces for community development. For the Page 132 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagolocation where he had planned the circular building for the kindergarten, which is a reserve, there would probably have to be a permanent right of entrance. The building would be one which would qualify as one appropriate to place there. In the location adjacent to the shops there could be a full title to theproperty. Mrs. Maddocks - it is wonderful to see how Deirdre is showing herself so early as a true Saturnian, as is Eric Nicholls, and how marvelously you are opening up the paths to her:- that delight in conflict - she will dare anything. Of her own nature (and she is opening the eyes of her mother isn't she) she knows that an essential of creation is polarity, conflict if you are not afraid of that word. We were thrilled at herresponse to the knowledge of the battle between the great Angels of Light and of Darkness, and what a picture of her you painted in our hearts with her joy in the plash, plash by which they were filling the world with color. For four years still to come her education should be that of the senses.

It, interestingly enough, is the fighting sense. It rouses man to a knowledge of his battle with the external world. It warns him of danger and awakenshis consciousness to the things that he can enjoy without fear. It is the first of the five senses which acquaint us with the manifested world, the Solar system, the world in which the polarities are Life and Death in which world only could the human being be created, a Being with the power of Free Will. Through these five senses which arise from the contact or conflict of the astral with the etheric (smell, taste, seeing, warmth, hearing) the brain mind - the moon mind - is developed. You see how wisely youare laying the foundation of her intellect, her reasoning faculty, which is founded on these five sense perceptions. Afterward if these senses have been well developed including the hearing which is a transition sense giving us a knowledge of the inner nature of things, of their soul, then we can, through the power of our free will, develop in full consciousness other senses - the Imaginational, the Inspirational and the Intuitional senses - by which we can perceive things in the supersensible world.

A loss of feeling for design and a slovenliness in construction in the vast bulk of the current work. 2. A hankering after stark, logical, European modernism on the part of the cultured thinkers who are in the minority. These must be vigorously combated not merely for the welfare of India but for the sake of the regeneration of the outside world whose main ambitions are wealth and power. For architecture, according even [Note: ==== Beginning of page 174 ====] to Herbert Spencer, is essentially a religious production or, as in the profound statement of Dr. [Note: James H.?] Cousins, omitting his particular qualifications, \"all art is the extroversion of what in religion is introversion.\" Here in India materialistic modernism would be unnatural and the occasional intrusionof it even into the architecture of the industrial centers are hardly happy. As things are, the forces that gave rise to architecture in India are no longer expressed therein, since it has long been static, and the meticulous rules that superseded them for ages are breaking down as natural science subtly undermines religious authority, notwithstanding that the process has been retarded longest here in the East. The hereditary artistic crafts, which have kept the oriental more attractive thanthe occidental scene, are already becoming dependent upon governmental or other artificial agencies for their stimulus and cannot be expected to remain affective much longer. In the case of buildings and groups simple principles, such as symmetry with axis defined, retain here an authoritative standing which one does not observe so generally elsewhere. But even so the general run of construction in the towns is evidently the worst that has ever afflicted them. There has, indeed, been only the repetition ofSaracenic, European and the occasionally attempted adaptation and revival of historic Hindu forms to contrast with the vast mass of buildings wherein the disdain for \"ideal\" has eliminated the practical architect's craft so that in practice the lion's share of building is carried on wholly through engineers and the mistris [Note: foremen, overseers] who are legion. Against both these currents is set the course for a renaissance which depends upon the individualized fresh longings and imagination of the people inwhom the impulse has for a long time been dormant. No longer is there a sound case for national or communal styles. For the spirit of the times rather than of Page 134 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe localities finds consciousness in these days of world-wide contacts, notwithstanding that the stamp of the place is an essential element of each architectural [Note: ==== Beginning of page 175 ====] problem, and any building, except the most vast, that is unsympathetic with its natural, human-natural, and artificial environment is neutralized and vitiated thereby. No one need expect a personal inventiveness of individuals to solve the problems of aesthetics which the academies of traditional art have failed to work out on a basis of precedence and laws, science and \"orders,\" for hundreds of years. Yet individuals, in the absence of guilds and castes, will have to evoke the forms for future buildings in the same imaginative way as the earlier folk through their periods of historic architectural creation, inChina, India, Persia, Egypt, Greece or France, or as, in the nineteenth century, devoted composers brought our greatest epoch in music. This century while still young was shown the way by architectural forerunners at the end of the last century among whom Louis H. Sullivan was the first. But amongst the confusion and visual discord following upon a century of intensive industrialism the way has not been smooth nor has much progressbeen made though interest in the architect's work is growing all over the world and mere reproduction of forms has lost its news value, so to speak, in favor of something fresh. For forty years in America, Europe and Australia, the writer looked in vain for crockery table-ware that could be accommodated in any decorative scheme that embraced colors. But India appears to have the facilities to develop such products with the addition of chemical technology to village potteries, and ofproducing decorative values at a cost competitive with the ephemeral Japanese mass-production, which is confined to minor pieces only. It is not necessary that the status of the handicrafts should be as humble as most people imagine it to be. So far as artistic products are concerned, Mr. Gandhi's instincts are sound in pinning to the villages his faith for a fruitful future in India. Increased attention to them might result in a world-wide demand for the useful and attractive articles which they can produce at aprice to compete with the factories. Such a demand would permit of the adoption of better [Note: ==== Beginning of page 176 ====] technical methods, and increased earnings would follow in their turn. With emphasis on the advantages that are unique to handicraft the competition of the factories can be reduced to a borderland of the less clearly selective fields of operation. It is not difficult to realize how each village or district could be brought to take pride in some distinctive output and how better organization and co-operation could be effected on the basis of a world-wide economy , not on just that of a local supply and demand. The results that can be achieved by a little more individual self-reliance,which educative methods of training could bring out in the craftsman, are evidenced by the astonishingresponse of the indigenous painting art to the new stress on individuality, as shown in the Art Gallery of the Lucknow Exposition. It is notable, too, that in the local market certain printed cotton pieces of greater merit than the general run bring a 100 per cent advance in price. It is of no slight moment to artistic Page 135 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosalvation that fabric designs can be carried out to order without undue delay or cost. Abroad this possibility has been for many years, and may still be, limited to carpets from Austria or, with limitations, from China. Here are gaps wide open for artistic craftsmen and a chance for distinctive interiorsconsistent with the character of each owner and his comprehensive scheme of architecture and decoration. Much is being said now and, especially in America, done in educating human feelings toward a standard of effectiveness and control comparable with that of our intellects and physiques as developed through modern training. And far-reaching consequences to the art of living and especially of living togetherform the outlet into some form of creative effort of otherwise futile, or, at their worst, wasteful and destructive emotions. Where habitual criminals of the deepest dye have been reformed at San Quentin, California, through the simple expedient of a year of choral singing in the penitentiary, there is fair prospect for remedial measures with the larger number of those uncondemned at large. It is probably too much to anticipate that the progress of our feelings will come [Note: ==== Beginning of page 177b (table of contents) ====] ONE .

But imaginative moods can be and are, though still too rarely, utilized for the material activities of artistic productiveness. Though natural science is wrongly serving us in diverting all our interests to personal welfare it does offer a new vantage point for artistic endeavour by vastly augmenting every individual's labor power and, still more, by constantly putting new processes and materials at our disposal. There will be no glutted markets and consequent depressions when its services become a question of satisfying the appetite of free imaginations instead of mathematically restricted physical and intellectual permutationsand combinations. Appreciative critics of the jewel-like beauty of the Taj Mahal can see how the most beautiful buildings can still be improved in many different ways under the play of fancies as free as that of the designer in his time.

The virtues of the greatest quality of India, individualism, have been less emphasizedthan its defects, perhaps, but it is to be trusted that it will yield to no leveling down to mass dominance whether of \"communistic\" or of \"dictatorial\" unitarianism in thinking, not to the substituting of any common denominator either of tradition become sentimentality, nor logic, nor unique individual feeling. The relation between architecture and religious consciousness may, perhaps, be made more comprehensible to some if expressed as a numerical series of increasing complexity.

Before this stage there could be no meaning nor sense in unity, nor in multiplicity,since both derive from division. HOUSE OF CUBES - THREE DIMENSIONS [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] Three - Triplicity - \"Brahma\" - \"Siva\" - \"Vishnu.\" The restoration of completeness, - the Founder, the Page 137 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoDisturber and the Savior - the Body, Soul and Spirit - the Thinking, Feeling and Willing, the embodiment of the Divine in Matter and the three dimensions necessary for that. This third age of our Aryan epoch, that of Egypt, Chaldea, Babylon, where architecture was born to us in the guise of atriangle, the static fundamental of construction, and in the pyramids with prophetic square base. Before this stage there could be no meaning in duplicity or polarity because these were otherwise without purpose or end. This is the sentient or \"feeling\" soul at work. Thus, as in the case of the other civilizations, the period of utilization follows that of experience. THE PROPHESY OF THE STUPA [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the top image on the succeeding page was intended to be placed here.] Four - Quadruplicity - With this fourth age the indivisibility of man first came into his religious consciousness of separation from the Divinities. In other words, the Individual Egos first functioned in their threefold instruments. Art, as a separate entity, first perfected in Greek sculpture, was introduced toand developed by people in all fields, arousing an intellectual soul and an understanding of the feelings. How natural that the first Indian conception of the pyramid should have been given us the globe of the Sanchi stupa with its four entrances celebrating unity where that phase of the Divine had been longest established and that this culminating unit form should be related right down to our day in the form of Hindu temples and Buddhist pagodas.

And how significant still are those pairs of minarets where the roots of dualismare deepest. All over Asia states, triplicity still remains the aim and acme of architectural perfection. The Greeks, however, with their own intellectual mastery of the \"feelings\" brought perfection to all the arts, made art the servant and educator of the whole life, and their architecture idealized the Quadruple form. Evidence of intellect, appearing with Abraham first, functions wholly with Aristotle in this great age when, only, has it become the common prerogative of men. Man working with the feelings joinedwith the thinking not only evolved all the great arts in this period but organized the great religions that have been spread wide over the world by enthusiastic missionaries, Confucianism, Buddhism, Christianity, Mohammedanism. The Individual ego came into its own when the Godhead Himself brought Divinity to the earthly human being. The simple cube or parallelepipedon would be the architectural evidence of man's identification of himself with the solid earth - North, South, East and West, already given idealized expression in Greek architecture but really only admitted as an end in itself in a later age by the ultra moderns of today. The inspired prophets of the succeeding age, quite naturally, came only as a reaction at the close of such a period, to formulate a sign prophesying the succession. The hip or gable growing out of the walls and the cross crocketed pinnacles of churches are five sided and five angled respectively, and they stilldominate these most resplendent architectural efforts of all time. Understanding of trinity, the unity of the three, to be experienced also in this age, ripened at the time of Thomas Aquinas, but has receded into empty words in the succeeding civilization. As Greek art brought the feelings into the activity of each individual, so Roman law brought [Note: ==== Beginning of page 180 ====] judgment of man's thinking and conduct out of the hands of Gods into those of common men, the stage when man is conscious, not only that feeling and thinking are at every individual's disposal, but that his physical body is also, and consequently his deeds. THE SPIRE AS IN THE CATHEDRALS [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on page \"179 (table of contents)\" was intended to be placed here.] Five - Quintuplicity - This age has commenced only with the 15th century A.D. It first gained expression in Europe where individual freedom had become widespread under conditions of Christian moral teachings and the consciousness that, even during the struggle of each against all, there was an instrument of the Sun Deity on earth for the help of each one. In ancient times five was instinctively comprehended as an evil omen, but is so only in the sense of free choice between the compressiveforces of natural law and mechanization, easily yielded to, on the one hand and centrifugal forces of individual initiative gradually to develop man out of dependence on or interference with other beings. So far as I know the only attempt to give architectural form to this consciousness is the present Page 139 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoportentous \"Goetheanum,\" center of the General Anthroposophic Society, the work of its founder, Rudolf Steiner, Ph.D. on sundry studies of whose publications these observations on the relationship between the different stages of religious consciousness and architecture are based. This threateningscull-like [Note: skull-like?] structure in Switzerland puts the stern and forbidding aspect of the work of this age before the society's European students and workers which the present seems to justify. However it is just as possible to beings of intellectual aspirations to accept the necessities of materialization without accepting the ugliness it reveals when man succumbs to materialism's thankless rigidity as a taskmaster. Meaning and interest given to this solid state of incarnation can transform it inlife and in architecture into the servant of new beauty instead of a one-eyed tyrant. Such an alternative depends, however, upon the comprehension of reincarnation and Karma which are Indian elements.

NORTH GATE TO THE EXPOSITION [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] SCIENTIFIC APPROACH The coming scientific approach to architecture is less concerned with the auspices of the moon's phases or the \"aspect\" of planets than with the aspects of the Sun, that medicinal heating and lighting agency whose service is of so vast importance. It takes note of such unusual phenomena as earthquakes and requires a knowledge of the character and direction of the prevailing winds each month of the year. Itsubordinates even dimensions of rooms to the matter of repetitional modules for the arrangement and organization of the building horizontally and vertically, in an inclusive unit; and the standardization of all the parts therein and the simplification of construction. It utilizes the local facilities of the market for economically solving the problems of effective structure and protective covering. But this sort of approach does not overlook those factors of internal planning that contribute to orderliness, spaciousness and impressiveness, as well as to convenience and comfort. Nor does it ignore Page 140 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe character and value of the environment with which the building must not clash if it is not to lose its permanent value. In many commercial buildings the greatest value may be that of publicity; in domestic housing the evidence of culture. In the long run, buildings cannot be arbitrarily dissected and culledfrom the surroundings but must stand or fall with them. No great proportion of buildings at present start from these simplest fundamentals of practice. When they do, much of the present customs and habits will be sloughed off. The seasons must be considered and the orientation as well as the type of construction appropriate to the climate, the fenestration, and in India, worshippers of the moon, the fear of the Sun must be eliminated. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 182 ====] FOR THE HOT SEASON In Lucknow, except in the case of preponderant need for working light from the North, preference might well be given to a north and south major alignment to minimize the southern aspect of the building, and consideration of the desirable and undesirable aspects for the winds for cooling and ventilation or for bearing disagreeable storms, corroborates this assumption. For the hot season the easterly breezes willbe conserved for the east side and for the cold weather the same side will be sheltered from the westerly winds, whilst during the monsoon the through currents will most effectively afford necessary ventilation. Verandhas [Note: i.e., verandas] as projecting ample out-of-door rooms have many advantages in themselves as compared with galleries and they do permit the light of heaven to reach the rooms. Wherethis light at times carries the radiant heat of the sun, the adjustable Venetian blind, outside the glass, always affords the means of averting this heat without losing the light or ventilation. Likewise it affords positive rain protection in the extreme as compared with gallery protection for windows and it has the advantage of adaptability to all the seasons. Khustatis are rather a disagreeable expedient for they require incessant attention and shut off the light and withhold much of the draft. An alternative proposal for theLucknow University Library is a modern gauze curtain, Rui Tati, rolled along water pipes perforated to give an adjustable drip on the windward side when the curtain is rolled down and a valve opened. This is a special case where the greatest difficulty will be in the hot dry season and where the bands of the roof windows offer a ready receptacle. As an expedient for weather protection the chagga seems to me to have been the least satisfactory as well as the most common feature of Indian buildings. It is not only flimsy, as old monuments attest, but it looks flimsy, and a parting of the ways between the wholly logical architecture and that which accepts beauty as a mere semblance of ideal [Note: ==== Beginning of page 183b (table of contents) ====] MINIMUM COST HOUSE . INTERLOCKING CONCRETE TILE [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript.

Massive ledges, deep reveals, label hoods and other constructions meet the same practical need and afford elements of a dignifiedfenestration pattern not stressing the apertures as merely holes in the wall. INTERLOCKING CONCRETE TILE DWELLING - CASTLECRAG [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] The bulk of the remaining heat evil can be removed by structural insulation for which fibrous magnesium oxychloride composition affords most effective, and at the same time permanent, insulation, an advantage which the more expensive cork surpasses only by 10 per cent. As India is a source of all the ingredients for such composition for the world outside, these insulations may well become a field for mass production. Incorporated in cellular roof slab construction, it is doubtful if the extra cost would be an appreciable factor in the cost of the house. It may be possible ultimately to come to insulated housesentirely of this material in a tessellated form of masonry such as the writer has been employing for 20 years in Australia where Portland cement is the sufficiently protective building material. The mass of structural material is thereby reduced to a trifling fraction of the accepted type of masonry construction so that the volume of the materials amounted to one fifth of the entire bulk of the houses themselves and the two simple structural units lend themselves to an infinitude of combination for architectural effect.The walls, assembled rather than laid, had the advantage of producing precision, and the sincerity of their cut-stone-like structural finish, which needed no film nor plastic coating inside or out, gave them a solidity and permanence not obtainable with bricks and mortar or plaster. The flat roof is the greatest advantage in subordinating buildings to their natural surroundings and in harmonizing the relations in groups and masses. It is doubtful whether the lime terracing for certainterracing protection will be necessary hereafter in all cases since proper reinforcement counteracts the stresses which cause flat roofs to leak and avoidance of such leaks has been obtained in current houses at [Note: ==== Beginning of page 184 ====] Castlecrag, New South Wales carried out by the writer. The possibility of interior spaciousness attained by loosely separated compartments and varying heights are indicated in the illustrations. The vital question of ceiling heights about which there has been so much misapprehension, even in Australia, is gradually becoming answered there in favor of heights almost as low as in England, though the municipal and state enactments stood long in the way. The alternatives, besides offering effectiveness,will ultimately prove less costly than building rooms to inordinate heights. Improved methods and materials are what each modern architect needs and not the determination of his Page 142 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocourse by rules of structural economy or schedules of prices but by giving him greater freedom to work out practically fresh forms of design, unfettered as far as possible, in order to bring about in substance the forms that are his heritage in imagination. THE FINAL TEST The horizontal architecture typical of the early Hindu south, and the vertical architecture of the north and the Saracens are both relatively under-developed as architecture and afford innumerable points of departure for a modern expression not inconsistent with the historic past but giving it new interest. The effective ledge roof lighting that admits a brilliant glow without heat or light is an inheritance from South India that will assist in giving to the Reading Room of the Library of Lucknow University the desired distribution of the sun. The final test of modernism is the replacement of industrial eye-sores with public amenities. During the seven years of depression, whilst industrial growth had stopped, the writer fortunately found a field in which the architect could help allay the suspicious fears and political animosities sufficiently to enable adozen municipal authorities to determine upon sites within their own boundaries for replacing dumps [Note: ==== Beginning of page 185b (table of contents) ====] MUNICIPAL INCINERATOR [Note: This illustration was intended to be placed on the next page in the typescript.

It has been intended in these buildings also to awaken an aversion to the fundamentally uneconomic conditions of industrial ugliness.

Deirdre, ever anxious for a celebration, willdoubtless greet the news that - \"Today is Mr. Griffin's birthday\" with \"Shall we have a party?\" We'd like to include a wish for a speedy return but then, after all, it's your birthday and it's for you that we should be invoking the Gods, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 186 ====] not for ourselves. So we will leave it to them, already well satisfied that they have landed us all on the earth at the same time. (Nothing less than the earth is your home. It is not the case of the \"homelesswanderer\" for you are everywhere at home.) Really the gods are such capable managers of human affairs that it is sad that they should be resigning in our favor, leaving us to run our own shows consciously. We're pretty sure to make a grand muddle of it before we attain the graceful inevitability of - even a calliopsis in bloom. Here is one petal and so again birthday greetings. Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley Griffin 24 November - 1936 - Castlecrag - Ula Maddocks to Walter Burley Griffin - Your birthday - a most auspicious day. Now you both are celebrating by going to a cinema am I right? Yesterday began the new kindergarten nursery group here. A particularly happy and successful beginning it was too. Nine children were brought by their parents punctually at 9:30 all freshly washed and brushed and each with a packet of play lunch. I had a fine collection of new toys and each child as he came in immediatelypounced on one or the other of these and the parents' last minute instructions to \"be good and remember to wipe your nose\" were lost in a rising babel of hammering and shunting and bouncing intermingled with squeals as to who got what first. They are a particularly fine lot of children and I am enjoying them immensely. Graham, Stewart and Paul will benefit from being separated for a while from the domination of older sisters. I give these three together with Deirdre and Julius free play on the lawn with a big 16\" diameter ball and wheel-barrows, scooters, etc., things that call into play the big muscles, while the older ones work inside at tables. Then we sit around cross-legged in a circle and eat play lunch all together and with considerable ceremony. Then a game of follow the leader.

To a Mr. Short, here for a few days from New Zealand examining the diploma students at the Conservatorium. He decided on a block not far from Mr. Junge's place on the Battlement and is to call in at the office and sign the contract before Thursday when he returns to New Zealand. A particularly nice man. I introduced him to Miss Drummond as she was rehearsing the play at the valley Theatre. They had studied music in Germany at the same time - a happy meeting.

If you want to know what I think about the King's marrying an American ask Father Griffin. We talked over the possibility several years ago when he and Mother Griffin were with us in Melbourne at dinner at the Lippincotts - the easiest way for Britain to get the U.S. back into the\"empire.\" It made him so mad he couldn't eat his desert. However I don't think this marriage has been made according to the plan laid down. Theodore Roosevelt's daughter was the one under discussion. Only the Gods removed that threat when he was the Wilson opponent.

Nicholls to Walter Burley Griffin LAND SALES - Gates has just bought a block on the East side of his present holding on Covecrag. A Mr. Moriarty is going to buy the lot No. 6 next to Pollard's on the Haven. It happened this way. Saturday I was lunching at the Deans' when two chaps knocked at the door, having been sent there by Page 146 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe Castlecrag grocer in whose shop they were having a drink as a refresher after spending the morning walking the foreshores from suspension bridge to us, a continuation of their intermittent search for a waterfront lot. One of the two remembered me as a fellow student at the Victoria Art Gallery some 20years ago. The brother had met Edgar Deans' brother so no introductions were needed. I remembered well a shy lad commencing art to whom I magnanimously gave Ruskin's \"Elements of Drawing,\" and this same chap had always harbored an appreciative spot for me as a consequence. Now a commercial artist he has his own business here and owns a launch, and one look at the above lot and I could see that he was satisfied. We went the rounds but came back to this lot. The next Saturday the deposit was paidand they are going to begin forthwith to build a house. He already had a flat roofed house in mind and wanted a native garden so all is simple so far. Both he and his sister are interested in Anthroposophy and have considerable knowledge of the Aboriginals and their occult knowledge, so are fair prospects for Anthroposophy. He had quite a chat at my house on Sunday when Miss Drummond and the others popped in on their return from the Nativity play rehearsal down at the theatre. And of course under land sales should come that of the Greater Sydney Development Association's two major promontories for \u00a3125,000!! (pure hanky panky) The enclosed copy letters will tell their own story. For your amusement I also enclose letters I wrote [Note: James?] Irvine. RATES - Peace prevails. Greater Sydney Development Association continues to pay \u00a330 per month as required by the judgment. CLIENTS' HOUSES - Eric Pratten has taken occupancy today despite the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 190 ====] fact that four men continue to work in the garage making staircase newel and hand rail, etc. His house is superlatively finished and furnished and is a delight to them and to all visitors. Ramsay and his wife were among the many I showed over and were delighted. He has seen through many expensive houses but none where the proprietor has got so much real value for his money. Eric's garden is all in anadvanced state and the sunken garden which continues the long axis of the house is stocked with some couple of hundred different varieties of most suitable small plants, many of which are blossoming lustily. F.G. Pratten has no doubt that Eric has the best house on the North Shore. I'll soon be forwarding photographs. Watson, one of Pratten's managers, is away for three weeks. I am finishing his house elevation superstructure. Mr. and Mrs. [Note: name erased] continue to fight. What she mostly needs is a good smacking, but [Note: name erased] is such a diminutive chap. Their house is a two level or rather a three level house on a lot with a fall of 50 feet in 150 feet, a spectacular lot in a spectacular location. She, having bought the lot, is in a strong position. I am about to make complete drawings for Mr. Hawksford, a friend of Mrs. Maddocks.Stapleton - I continue to change its inwards [Note: \"inward\" = \"inside\"] room by room, as Mrs. F.C. persuades pa to provide the funds.

He has been toying with the idea of two stories of flats on top and for which I have drawn sketches but strongly advised against erecting them for they would not be competitive with the multitudealready around.

He is beginning to appreciate us, consequent upon his experience with certain architects. They together with the South Australia Structural engineer have given him a very raw deal trebling up on their agreed price. Said they had spent \u00a335 on drafting alone on a couple of sheets whichColin could have done in two days. I calmed Kanevsky down by writing to Adelaide pointing out anomalies in their charge and am awaiting reply. Kanevsky has recently been flirting with the Melbourne City Council engineer who wants an incinerator \"tomorrow.\" BUSH FIRES - This unquestionably has been one of the worst seasons in the history of New South Wales. Fires have ravaged the State, the Blue Mountains having received the worst grueling. It isdepressing to take a run along The Eastern Valley Highway, burned out everywhere. Don't comment in your letters on Mrs. Maddocks' studying Steiner's \"Education\" with us for as Molly was telling me Mrs. Guyatt has strong feelings against anything spiritual and especially children's belief in fairy stories, thinks it does them harm. David, however, much to her disgust still talks about God and \"waves his arms around just like Mrs. Griffin.\" He was over at the house one day and there were a fewdrops of rain and he said \"That's God's rain isn't it?\" So Molly sang him a simple little thing - \"Through the air everywhere God is sending rain, Pitter, patter, pitter, patter down the window pane.\" We are all saying \"Thank God for the rain.\" Eric M.

All efficiency derives from free spirit. Man is spirit. His capacity to do, to conceive, to create has no limits. Putting spirit in bondage brings illness and death to his body and soul.The inspired slogan of the French Revolution was Liberty, Equity, Fraternity. The 18th century established in the United States a political organization, based on the control by the majority, to establish and maintain EQUITY . By what means can we attain Liberty in addition to Equity? Obviously by establishing a social organization whose function [Note: ==== Beginning of page 192b ====] is to maintain Liberty . Such an organization would have to include all the citizenry as the Equity organization does. But could it function through the decisions of a majority? Obviously not, but only through an instrument which makes it possible for each individual to determine and use his own abilities in his own way. This organ, to attain its end, must be able to place the means, for ability to function, in this realm and not in the political realm whose natural interest is not in ability but in equity. Men cannot be equal in their abilities - no two men's abilities are alike. So the nature of this organization will be thepolar opposite of that of the Political organ. It cannot function by means of a majority vote. So to attain democracy we must free our Political organ from the task of concerning itself with questions of Liberty, watching out only for equity (like the traffic officer). Land rentals which belong to the community (if we can say land \"belongs\" to humans in any true sense) as a whole could well meet the needs of this organization. Imagination and inspiration can flourish and become effective only through an Abilities Organ which would assure its free play and see to it that every individual has full opportunity to develop his abilities throughout his life. If one undertakes to break down all boundaries one is still on the downward path if he tackles them by material forces. It is a misinterpretation of that inner urge if violence is used as we see it being used in Europe at present where the necessity for a United States of Europe is very great - a Federation with aunified Economic Organization which should become a World Economic Organization . Our task is to transform matter into spirit, not too great a task since the coming of the Christ effected theturn in the Cosmos completing the evolution of spirit into matter which was necessary to make Free Will possible. I had not been in Australia long before the burden of my song became - \"You will find your problems solved when you have transformed the British Empire into a Federation. You can't expect England to do that. It is [Note: ==== Beginning of page 193 ====] the task of the Dominions.\" I once listened to a lecture of Mr. Laski [Note: Harold J. Laski?], a self-confident young Britisher, in Yale. When questions were being put by the audience, I asked if it would not be a great step toward solving world problems he was discussing if the form of the British Page 149 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoEmpire were so altered. He said that you could never bring that about, and then seeing the Irish in my face he flung back - \"Ireland would never stand for that.\" But interestingly enough within these last few years Ireland has done that very thing and has accomplished the step in that direction for the Empire. Itwould be no more difficult for each of the others to do the same. Because of the threat of Ireland's being used as a take-off for an attack on England, de Valera was able to establish the complete freeing of Irish affairs from interference from England; and Ireland accepts no titles (the cheapest form of bribery). Then later, after a new king was crowned, Ireland of her own free will as an act of Parliament accepted this king as the king of Ireland to function so in matters that wereof common concern to all the British units. So there already exists a federation of Britain and Eire and it has so functioned during the present war though much misunderstood by the general public. Ireland is now in a position to attain what she first desired - a congressional form of government. A woman in the audience said to her friend whom I met after the lecture - \"That woman has the sweetest face I ever saw.\" That, like Ireland's achievement, was the transformation of matter by spirit for as adraftsman in the first office I worked in, a very good friend of mine, once in an earnest discussion said to me that I was like his wife - I knew I was a very plain looking woman. You see my spirit has since transformed matter. India is working to the same end as Ireland. With this federation accomplished the menace of Britain would be gone - the British federation could carry out its natural function of breaking down boundariesand Germany and the rest of the world would no longer need to resort to violence in joining that world movement - a World Economic Organization.

There's one thing I would like to have though I've got my nerve to suggest it but if you will put temptation before me, a pyjama gown cut on the pattern ofMrs. Nicholls' red one. When mosquito season is on the only costume that makes life endurable is the pyjama with long wide legs and wide flowing sleeves and light colored ones are no good here. That red Page 150 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosmock you sent me is perfect. Those we bought, the linen colored ones, are dirtier in two hours than they would be in two months in Castlecrag. My goodness, you folks should appreciate dustless Castlecrag. Within three days of the Monsoon, everything is covered with a fine red or black dust whichat this season one doesn't notice in the atmosphere but you couldn't drop a handkerchief and use it after picking it up. It would be spotted with patches of stain which won't shake off, wherever it touched anything. So gaudy rich colors are the thing. They call the Indians dirty but it takes more than any ordinary washing to get these stains out and no wonder the poorer one's clothes usually look very rusty. One day I watched with interest (as I was sitting in a car waiting for Walt to come out of the Expositionoffice) an Indian come to a well a hundred or so feet away, dip his pail and take a full bath with the utmost modesty and greater cleverness than any movie film actor, never exposing his body at all, screened always by his sari like scarf over which he finally threw a clean one dropping the one he had been wearing to the ground and then proceeding to wash it. It was very interesting. The fact that it was right out in a public highway didn't concern him at all. Naturally the clothes he was wearing got wellsoaked as he poured a pailful of water down his back. 10 February [Note: 1937] - Well there goes the chance of getting in on January sales but there really was no urgent need. The letter to Nicholls tells [Note: ==== Beginning of page 195 ====] of the mischief Walt has been in. The day before he had to go to Cawnpore for a miserable committee meeting of the Exposition for finalizing the accounts of the contractor, all perfectly useless as it was allhanky-panky. The meeting was closed just five minutes after a train had left so he had three hours on his hands which he spent walking. Perhaps this was the last straw which ruptured the walls of the gall bladder so we can lay that up against the miserable Exposition coterie though that doesn't wash with Anthroposophists who know that nothing happens by chance but all in accordance with one's own decisions so one can really feel no bitterness about anything that happens. It is really amazing to be ableto see things that way. However one is tempted to quote a favorite saying of Roy Lippincott's \"I wish them no harm but I hope they choke.\" By the way Genevieve [Note: Lippincott], it isn't for the lack of thinking of you we haven't written to thank you for the beautiful photos of you and Alstan. We received your postal re Arjuna [Note: Ronald Craig's daughter] last week, Mrs. Maddocks. Steiner says that one of the most important things atpresent is for Europeans and Indians to learn to understand each other. In carrying out the plan you suggest we both think you would certainly be doing your bit in that great work. Genie [Note: Georgine Mahony Smith] dear - I'm glad Carl has established a group in Rogers Park [Note: a Chicago neighborhood]. You should go along too. For years Walt always went to sleep at the readings. Mrs. Williams wouldn't let anybody make fun of him and said he learned more while asleepthan most of the ones who kept awake. And there is almost no one who can remember and quote anything that has been read during the evening. The matter really doesn't belong in the memory realm but it gradually soaks in and becomes a part of yourself. Mrs. Cummings should go too. I got a lovely letter from her and am delighted at the possibility of her coming to India. Mrs. Prescott, tell your husband to be sure to go to see some of the Eurythmy performances given in London. I have a notion hewould think it a lovely field for Margaret to work in. Marion Mahony Griffin to Ula Maddocks Page 151 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 196b (table of contents) ====] CANOPY FOR ROYAL STATUE .

From the domestic point of view we were revolutionaries as except for the Child of Heaven Harijan, who disposed of our sewage, and the gardener who was part of the estate, the Mrs. did her own house work. With breakfast over, a four story double boiler was filled with the next meal and taken into the drafting room where it could be stokedwith coke when needed. The four of us - Walter Burley Griffin, Mr. Halder (Hindu) draftsman and Mr. Mohsin (Mohammedan) superintendent, and Marion Mahony Griffin with an occasional experiment in a draftsman, drove out the private work which was coming in from all sides even to that last day of his life when a Raja appeared who had just acquired 10,000 acres at the foot of the Himalayas and who wanted him to develop it. Itwas a happy and busy office and we learned how completely false is the usual American conception of India. Oh! they'll outwit you if they can in the matter of paying their bills but that's a part of their clever way of getting rid of Britishers, in addition to having almost completely manned the bureaucracy with Indians when they found how easy it is to bribe officials. Only by pulling off this last war in which Chamberlain was an implement were the consequences of that postponed. There was completefriendliness between the members of the two great religions. It was only the kings who played the game with the British Imperialists. Until we realized the difference in dress nothing in their relationships was evident to reveal any distinction in the young students' feelings toward each other, and they called me their \"little mother,\" I suspect because I scolded them. Now Halder and Mohsin eat their lunches together on the doorsteps of the \"kitchen\" we never used - a building separate from the house, they werelike bosom pals. The work in hand included subdivisions by two different enterprisers and minimum cost houses, the various jobs already mentioned, now either in sketch stage calling for rendered perspectives or working [Note: ==== Beginning of page 197b (table of contents) ====] CANOPY FOR ROYAL STATUE .

The sketches now included a large dwelling for a judge in Lucknow, soon in working drawing stage; dwellings for several University professors; the building for the Paper Mills in Lucknow; a palace for the Prince of Nepal at Bholanpur, and so on. And now the working drawings for the Pioneer Press were drawing toward completion. Then the blow fell and I had to make the decisions. If Eric Nicholls had been inclined to join me we would have carried on but when he decided not to come over I realized that it was probably for the bestsince he did not have a University degree and that was the first question asked by those whom I talked with concerning his coming over. One Architectural firm offered me a partnership and the Technical school wanted me as a teacher. But nobody could really have stepped into Mr. Griffin's boots so I did what I could to meet the urgent needs of the clients and prepared to return to Sydney. CANOPY FOR ROYAL STATUE - PLAN [Note: This reference in the typescript indicates that the illustration found on the preceding page was intended to be placed here.] The Lucknow Post office occupies a half block, this Canopy for Mr. Chowdray [Note: Chowdry?, Chowdhury?] statue of King George [Note: George V] is to be placed in the park of the other half of the block. The stepped indirect light standards cut diagonally across the square of the canopy with flowerboxes at their bases giving mystery and color to the whole. The upper half of the pyramid forms the protecting roof for the statue which is heroic in dimensions. The statue itself is a fine piece of work and is illuminated by indirect lighting from the molded shelves from which the interior vaults spring. Broad flights of stairs lead to the entrances on the four sides. It is a very radical, a truly revolutionary design. The drawings of the canopy were only just finished when Mr. Griffin died. Mr. Chowdray [Note: Chowdry?, Chowdhury?] asked me to go with him to get the approval of the design by the chairman in charge. So we planned together what we should say. We took it to his office. Mr. Chowdray said:- \"We have come to present the sketch design for acceptance.\" There was a statue of Queen [Note: ==== Beginning of page 198 ====] Victoria in Lucknow so I said:- \"Mr. Griffin felt that the protection of King George's monument called for a masculine touch, \" - and The Chairman said:- \"I accept it.\" Mr. Chowdray and I looked at each other. There was evidently nothing more to be said. So to break the silence Mr. Chowdray asked if he would like to have a model made and he said \"Yes.\" So that was that. 17 February, 1937 - Sultangung [Note: Sultan Gung?], Lucknow - Marion Mahony Griffin to Ula Maddocks - I'm afraid my last letter sounded rather flippant what with the \"Hope they choke\" etc. Page 153 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocoming just after you had received the cable, but it was written on that fourth day when everything seemed to be going so well. Saturday after the operation I sat by Walt's bed through the night. What a pity you couldn't have been here to help nurse him. He waked at about five quietly with no sign of pain.At about seven I started home. I expected to pick up a tonga [Note: \"covered horse cart\" from I.2.37] along the way but at that time in the morning there were none so I walked the five miles home. It was a pleasant walk in the early morning quite a bit of it along the river bank, and I didn't mind it a bit. A few days before, Walter had taken pencil sketches of the Mahmudabad Library over to show the Rajah who was delighted with the scheme. He promised a rendered perspective for the Monday morning following.So on my arrival home I put in a long day on that and then had a good night's sleep, was up early Monday morning and worked on the drawing (the men in the office had gone over to see Walt Sunday afternoon) till one o'clock and was just putting on the last wash when they came - two men and the Rajah. It was the first time I had seen them though he had invited me to come over with Walt but I had put my time on the drawing instead. He is a very charming young man, very unassuming, remindedvery much of Glanville Smith which will mean something to Florence Birch and Miss Leeson. He took off the drawing and I bustled around over a few things and then went over to the hospital. The first thing Walt asked me was if I had written to you. I had to say I hadn't but that a letter was started and I would [Note: ==== Beginning of page 199b (table of contents) ====] RESIDENCE . PRINCE OF NEPAL [Note: Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 199 ====] see that it got off Thursday. It was well that I posted it Wednesday or that promise would not have been kept. Toward the end his mind wandered and he talked swiftly but all about his work, calculations, demanding answers and when I gave him figures he heard me for he took them up and went on from there. And then quiet again. As the end drew near I talked to him telling him what a wonderful life I had had with him, how he was beloved by everybody, and suddenly he turned as if with a great effort andlooked straight in my eyes, his own wide, round, startled as if it had never once occurred to him that he could die. His eyes never left mine till he drew his last breath and I closed them. A few months ago after I had several times said we must take time to go over to the bank together and get my name on the account, I finally said to him that we must go, that his Mars was in the 8th house which meant death through accident and that if something happened to him the very fact of my nothaving access to money might cause his death. He said but you never told me that, well naturally one wouldn't. Anyway, he said, that won't happen, my Mars is well aspected. I replied that had nothing to do with the case, whatever the aspects, Mars in 8 meant just that. The next day we went to the bank. After the decision for the operation he turned to me and said, \"A pity that Mars is in the 8th House isn't Page 154 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoit.\" I brushed it aside and said, \"That's a long way off,\" and we both brushed the idea out of our minds. He didn't want to go. Things were pouring in here and he was very happy. There was a beautiful notice in the Pioneer about him which I'll send when I get a moment to address them. Night before last Mr. Mohsin had a dream confirming mine of which I had told him nothing. He came to me in the morning and said he had that night dreamed that Mr. Griffin and he met on the road on the bank of the River Gumti, that Mr. Griffin was very joyous, very joyous, and had said many things to him but that mostly he could not remember them, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 200 ====] he had said too many things but that one thing he had stressed and that was a message to me saying to Mr. Mohsin \"Be sure to remember.\" In Mr. Mohsin's words to me - \"You must lead an active life.\" One might think I had earned a holiday but that answer to my call to him is more convincing than a dream of my own could be and seems also that perhaps I should stay here. I am awaiting what Mr. Nicholls says about coming over as I can't see how my work here could be useful unless he was here too. What a beautiful photo of Deirdre at the Christmas tree - and that one on the grass of you was lovely too. I don't think you could have a better one, that was just exactly yourself. I have had many loving cables and two very lovely ones from the Australian Government. I can see Dr. Maloney's hand in them with his great power of appreciation and his wonderful sense of justice. I don't know when I shall have a chance to write to him. He did send a booklet of the Exposition to Mr. James Alexander Smith but I have not yet written to him of Walter's death. Will you do that for me? MarionMahony Griffin to Ula Maddocks Tell Mr. Nicholls that the blue prints of the Paper Mill sent by ordinary mail arrived today. It was under Mr. Mohsin's clever instructions and watchful eye that I was able to collect our fees for that job. Also with our Judge client. Mr. Mohsin insisted on taking over the bill himself and had me put at the bottom of it - Mr. Mohsin sign here. He presented the bill to the Judge who said the equivalent of our \"right oh\"and started to retire. But Mr. Mohsin said, \"But I must have the money or Mrs. Griffin will think I have stolen it.\" \"Oh,\" said the judge and gave him the money which he signed for. Really I think a large part of the decline in the number of Englishmen who are coming to India these days is because the Indians have decided to pay none of their bills, as well as by the fact that with judicious bribery Indians have replaced almost all of the British in the Civil Service.

When the competition was called for the Tribune Building in Chicago [Note: Tribune Tower, 1922], the eight members of the Melbourne office worked jointly and sent a set of drawingswhich like those of Mr. Saarinen of Finland arrived too late for adjudication. Even if they had been there we think the job would still have gone as it did to a charming set of drawings and a harmonious adaptation of Gothic motives to this Tower building, but the erection of this building marked, as if time had been cut with a knife, the close of a copy book architecture in the U.S. and the establishment of creative design in city buildings. Interestingly enough it was Mr. Saarinen who won the second prize in the Australian Federal Capital competition with a set also of exquisite drawings and a plan full of soul but not so rich in the solution of problems - not dominated by the Spirits of Mathematics (utterly different from mechanical). A book of all designs submitted was published and probably every architect in Chicago has it. WithWalter's was sent a statement that in city buildings the structure should not be handled as an individualthing striving to hold its own by its individuality of character but that the fact should be recognized that the essential character of a city building was that it was necessarily a parallelepipedon and that it should be handled simply as a detail in the whole of the city. The two town planners recognized this and in the minor motives took up this form and played with it. In the other designs you felt either the effort to adapt old forms or to be original the latter being mostly grotesque. When a problem is solved it isinescapable. Walter, the more conscious of the two of underlying principles, stated the nature of the solution of the problem in both drawing and words. The Tribune building was scarcely built when along the Wacker Drive, within sight of it, a whole series of buildings with the sure touch of the creative designer, very beautiful, were erected, different architects but all harmonious, each with [Note: ==== Beginning of page 202 ====] its own strong character but coming together on a basic principle. They made the Tribune building, not because of its size but because of its character, look like a plaything. As you stand there you see the close of the past era in architecture and the opening of the new. New York swiftly followed. I saw just the beginning of it when I was there. This letter must do for the present for the expression of my gratitude for the cables and letters that come from the loved ones in Australia. Curiously enough Dorothy [Note: Searby?] it was the message of you and your husband, your love sending happy thoughts, that I cried over. It came as I was getting up in the morning and I had a good self-pitying cry, filled also with the thought that after a lifetime of self sacrifice Walter seemed to be just on the point of gathering the fruits. It did me good I think but it lastedonly a short time when your happy thoughts poured in and took possession. You will realize now Ula [Note: Maddocks], that his was not a stomach trouble. Nevertheless we have often expressed the desire to have some information as to food combinations and immediately followed Page 156 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoyour prescriptions strictly though it takes one by surprise continually if you do so - no cake, no milk and flour sauces for vegetables, etc. Still we had already come to prefer on the whole to do away with most combinations since all things grown in this Light Ether realm seem to have especially flavoury and wewere enjoying each particular flavour. Love and love, Marion Mahony Griffin CHANGES IN INDIA In India I was talking over with Mr. Mohsin, who is a Mohammedan, an unfortunate incident which happened in connection with the celebration of a Hindu festival....The young folk came to the office with their clothes bespattered with red stains, symbolic of blood. To the Mohammedans this wascontamination and a boy had been killed. I told him that if one part of a community felt like that the other part ought not to indulge in this game for it was in the nature of our Halloween frolics for all its religious significance. Each should be able to cross the boundaries of his own way of thinking. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 203b (table of contents) ====] RESIDENCE . RAJA TAGORE - GROUND FLOOR [Note: Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York HistoricalSociety copy. The structure is also known as the Chatterji House.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 203 ====] One afternoon I invited Mr. Mohsin's wife and daughter to afternoon tea. They came in true Indian fashion in tonga [Note: \"covered horse cart\" from I.2.37] with curtains drawn, themselves completelyveiled in their formal cylindrical garment dropping from a disc on their heads and only two holes for their eyes. They took off these outer garments when they came but when I suggested walking across the veranda to the spiral stairs to the upper quarters on the roof, on went the veils again. When we sat down in our little kitchen-dining room (which from the Indian point of view were a bath and dressing room) for simplifying my own work, I was surprised to learn that Mr. Halder was not to be permitted to eatwith us so I took tea, scones, cakes and various goodies in to the drafting room for him. Afterward he went with us as planned to a picture show which is helping to break down the custom of the veil since our two gentlemen taking their place back of us, the ladies sat in the audience room unveiled. When I came to arrange for leaving India, I asked Mr. Mohsin if his daughter would use my bicycle if I gave it to her, for Lucknow has no trams nor buses, nor motor cars on hire. I chatted with him about theimportance of giving girls an opportunity to earn their own living in case of emergencies, suggesting laughingly that he should make modern women of them. He talked the matter over with his family and the next morning said his daughter would love to have the bicycle so he took it over to her. I shouldn't be surprised at all if she rode it still in her flowing robes and veil. I have seen a number of Hindu girls on bicycles but never a veiled Mohammedan. In those last weeks one afternoon I slipped into my living quarters and slept for an hour. When I came back Mr. Mohsin looked at me with anxious eyes and asked me if I was not feeling well. I told him I Page 157 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowas just tired and had taken a nap. He said, \"This is the first time you have ever done that.\" Of course the siesta is very common practice in India. In those last days he said - \"You are so lovely. You have such a lovely [Note: ==== Beginning of page 204 ====] formality.\" (I who was the greatest bohemian my cousin [Note: Dwight Perkins] had ever known.) And he told me that never before had he seen such benevolence, not even in their religious leaders. He did not mean charity for that did not enter our lives there. He meant \"Well wishing\" and I understood him. In his really elegant English he used words carefully. Through well wishing we can cross all boundaries. We can free all people from their bondage to material things if to well-wishing we addcorrect concepts. A friend once told me I had the saddest eyes she had ever seen except those of one man, one who had spent his life solving the problems necessary to save humanity of our time by correct concepts and definite action. That sadness which comes from what we see does not indicate a sadness of spirit when one has contacted those clear concepts and so can see the way out of the morass we are in. LETTERS RECEIVED DURING THE LAST DAYS IN INDIAFrom Florence Birch - Dearest Marion, greatly beloved and longed for, by the time this reaches you a whole eternity will have passed or been lived through since your overwhelming experience of parting with your great companion. Yet I must tell you how deeply grieved we were and how we were filled with sorrow at every remembrance of the sudden and almost unbelievable news. The fact that life had held so many difficulties for him added to the pain. I hated to think too of the great slogging heavy,workingman's jobs he had tackled here in connection with the theatre and its plays; and how he had not been recognized here; and of the loss to the world. Sorrow on sorrow mounted up involuntarily - Then there was the painful thought of your utter desolation and agony in those first hours. We went from one friend to another in our dismay to find that the same distress prevailed and anxiety for you. So long it seemed before your first air mail letter came to Mrs. Maddocks and to Mr. Nicholls from which to hearany word from you. But since then there has been the great comfort of knowing that you would not have us think of you as grieving. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 205 (table of contents) ====] RESIDENCE .

His last letter to me, written between what he thought were stomach attacks, had in a way worried me, but the suddenness of the final news leaves me virtually expressionless andstunned. How can it be so? The question goes round and round in my mind. I will eventually realize it is the sad truth, but from our human point I cannot comprehend he is gone from us, just vanished from our mundane lives. As you well know, both you and he have supplied the aim and direction of my life and have become so much a part of it that I cannot yet visualize the future without Mr. Griffin. I seem to have counted on him for the next thirty years or so. And you - the isolation and utter loneliness - a lumpcomes in my throat every time I think of you. I trust you can find some solace in the thought that you were favored for so long, to know him so well. He was the most unique person I ever had the privilege to know, and one out of whom creative forces flowed so abundantly. I could fill pages with questions of the future. You know I am ever at your service. Please let me know what needs you have or help you want and their fulfillment will be a privilege. I will write Molly and I am sure she will write you directly.She is in Melbourne awaiting the arrival in about a week's time of another soul to this earth. Our written sympathies are poor props I feel but I send them fully and freely. I am daily thankful that fate so favored me as to have brought me under your joint influence which has been the dominant impulse of my life. And from young Edgar Deans, the Secretary of the Greater Sydney Development Association, of whom Mr. Griffin had said to me that he was the ideal secretary:- I was with him through many trials and troubles and, through all, his conduct and capacity and outlook were an example and an inspiration. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 206 ====] He was always patient, calm, courteous - even to those who wronged him. Unlike most men he never looked back nor was he ever daunted in his objectives by the severest obstacles and difficulties. It was only those who did not know him that said hard things about him and tried to hinder him in hispurposes. But those who like myself were privileged to know him well he himself - W.B. Griffin - will always remain a shining light in the blackness - an example and an inspiration. And from Mr. Deans' brother to him. I feel that his spirit does not survive only in the temples made with hands according to the plans his brain fashioned - but also in the lives of folks like yourself who were wise enough to see the beauty ofhis soul and to build into your lives a design by Walter Burley Griffin more beautiful than even the tower of Newman College. There can be no question that he was a poet of a type that is very rare nowadays. And from William Harte Smith, a youth who came to his own, one might say, from the contact with real civilization - one which recognized the threeness [Note: i.e., three-ness] of man - body, soul and spirit - who writes - CASTLECRAG Page 159 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoComes a vision in the architect, a prophet of a new elect, Not in negation of our quest,But that we might somewhere know rest, and find us intimate with life - a garden door to God from strife. He builds with inspiration sought in wind-carved rock, in color caught from nature, octaves of her three in unobtrusive harmony. Of forms to build discretely bold: to age as she is aged; to hold most friendly converse with the earth, part of herself. And this, his worth, must linger in the hearts of few now death delays the braver new. Delighted to assist him so, green creepers in a flood will flowupon the walls; the trees will bend about the place as to a friend. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 207 ====] And we may live, said he, this way; and if we will, our homes can pray. Yet nothing heeds the busy bandtoo occupied to understand. Slowly the red roofed tide moves on and Castlecrag is frowned upon. 'Such waste of space is unforeseen! 'We could not see our friends for green! The ax will come, and men will shout, and space will wander farther out until the earth is sick and sore. We shall not know her any more.

Every noon during the succeeding weeks Mrs. Stevens placed a dinner for me on my living room table, and at the end of every day no sooner had the draftsmen had gone than wee Hazel, not yet five, broughtme in a bouquet from the garden and took me in charge. Then we would prepare my supper together and she would feed me like a baby spooning it into my mouth. She solved the problem of cracking nuts by shutting the door on them held near the hinges. Once she brushed the shells off the table onto the floor, accustomed to many servants in the house, I said - \"See here don't you do that. You deliberately brushed them onto the floor!\" She looked at me severely and said - \"Did you say I deliberately brushed thenoff?\" - \"Yes I did.\" - \"Don't you ebber say that to me again,\" she said. I didn't. Neither did she. Her mother had looked in once with solemn eyes to see if she was bothering me but quickly withdrew. She knew little Hazel was a lifesaver for me. 19 July 1937 - 15 Saunders Road, Lucknow - Mrs. Stevens to Marion Mahony Griffin - Dear Mrs. Griffin, Oh! We have missed you and talked much about you and even little Hazel often says - Oh,Mummy, this is absolutely de-li-ci-ous, or marvelous!! in exactly the same tone of your voice. We knew everyone would be good to you in Castlecrag and that you would be busy [Note: ==== Beginning of page 208 ====] doing things almost immediately and you have surely lived up to our expectations! Yes, you have quite a lot to live for in proving the success of the Castlecrag scheme and we are glad that you are settled with definite work for the future. We will always wish for you the best. Today little Hazel is preparing a\"concert\" and I can hear her saying - \"Come on - Attention! Marche!\" as you used to play. Sir Galahad (my name for her husband) is very busy and worn out. I wish I could go to the office for him and let him stay home for a few days' holiday. I have decided to take a full time job next year and let Steve have a proper holiday. Our new home is nearly finished and you should see it. We are in the throes of packing. Mr. Mohsin came to see us and said he had been ill with his chest. He said that hewas superintending The Pioneer building and had some other work in the Chauk [Note: \"bazaar center\" from I.3.56]. Lots of love from us all - and a big kiss from my midget (Hazel). From \"Lucifer\" (My name for her and she was indeed an angel of light.) When the year had gone its round I was back in Castlecrag, but the round of my tasks in life was not complete so all the bonds of my adult life, the companionship with friends and co-workers had to bebroken. Now I left Castlecrag, truly a bit of Paradise on Earth, to take on the next adventure, the return to the land where I was born to put my shoulder to the wheel of molding the destiny of my country, to break down its boundaries in Economic thinking, to transform it, the only democratic community in the world, into a wholesome community, into a form which would make possible the solution of problems as they arose, as the body of the human being itself continually solves its ever rising problems throughits threefold organization:- the brain organization, the heart organization and the stomach organization.

INITIAL . PIONEER PRESS OFFICE AT ALL INDIA EXPOSITION [Note: This \"initial\" illustration begins the chapter which starts on the next page in the typescript.Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 209 (typescript) / 209c (table of contents) ====] No. 11. - INITIAL - THE PIONEER OFFICE AT THE EXPOSITION Mr. Desmond Young says:- A HOME TO BE PROUD OF It was a fortunate chance for The Pioneer that brought Mr. Walter Burley Griffin to Lucknow. Ever since the move in July 1933, the paper had been produced under great difficulties in hired premises and the location of the Job Department, also in hired premises almost a mile away, was a serious obstacle to co-ordination and efficient supervision. To gather the whole of the enterprise together again under one roof as soon as possible was obviously desirable and for some time a search had been in progress for a suitable site. The finding of such a site, midway between the telegraph office and the railway station,near enough to a main road for business purposes but far enough back from it to escape noise and dust, and only a stone's throw from the Council Chamber, coincided with Mr. Griffin's arrival and the opportunity of taking advantage of his skill was too good to be missed. He had been asked to submit plans for the new Library for Lucknow University and these having been approved, he came from Australia to supervise the erection of the building early in 1936. A graduate of the University of Illinois, Mr. Griffin was a pioneer of the town planning movement and was building \"modern\" houses long before the modernism of Corbusier and the German school was heard of. When the Commonwealth Government of Australia offered a prize for the best layout and design for its new capital at Canberra, he was successful in a competition open to the world, and was invited to Australia to see his designs carried out. In addition to having many fine buildings to his credithe developed a residential suburb of Sydney - Castlecrag - so far in advance of current Australian ideas that it is only now beginning to be appreciated at its full value. Mr. Griffin threw himself into the task of designing The Pioneer's new home with enthusiasm and it was both a pleasure and an education to discuss the plans with him. With characteristic thoroughness he set himself to mastering the fundamentals and, indeed, the details of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 210 ====] newspaper production so as to insure that the first essential, that of \"fitness for function,\" should be achieved. But he had great respect for tradition and a great love of beauty and would never accept the theory that a house is merely \"a machine to live in\" or a factory merely a \"machine to work in.\" Whenone has an opportunity to plan a building for a special purpose and that purpose is the manufacture of a Page 162 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagonews paper, there is a natural tendency to \"go all modern\" and to seek for a design which shall stand out as strikingly up-to-date. Mr. Griffin suppressed any such tendency on the part of his client with a firm hand. He would have been the first to approve such a building as the railway station in Helsinki, forHelsinki is a city only 20 years old. But he felt - and said bluntly - that ultra-modernism in Lucknow would be an error of taste, in fact, bad manners. As he wrote in the Pioneer, the faults of the present-day Indian architecture are:- 1. A loss of feeling for design and a slovenliness in construction. 2. A hankering after stark, logical, European modernism on the part of the cultured thinkers who are in the minority. \"These tendencies,\" he added \"are quite understandable. But in the only remaining great country where religion, however people may differ about it, is the dominating force in human conduct, they must be vigorously combated ...... The Western world, having concentrated on making nature the servant of man, is tending in \"modernistic\" architecture toward constituting of frank utilitarianism the sole test of beauty.This is perhaps a praiseworthy reaction from the state of absence of all principles save size and ostentation. But for India, where religion is not forgotten and where industrialism has not yet engrossed other interests, materialistic modernism would be unnatural:.... The secret of artistic growth under modern conditions is that everything, however trivial, must be made more and more beautiful, for in that way only is progress possible.\" This certainly did not mean that Mr. Griffin approved of the repetition of Saracenic, European or historic Hindu styles, revived and debased, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 211 (table of contents) ====] PLAN OF PIONEER PRESS EXPOSITION OFFICE [Note: Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page [211-2] ====] which characterizes only too many buildings in India today. On the contrary, he held that \"the general run of construction in the towns is evidently the worst that has ever afflicted them.\" Nor did it mean that he was prepared to accept the conventions of verandas, chaggas, unnecessarily high ceilings, etc., whenhe could adapt his building to the climate by more modern and more efficient devices. On this subject he is worth quoting. \"The three distinct and contrasting seasons of India present some apparently contradictory requirements, in the United Provinces particularly,\" he wrote, \"but these difficulties are no greater than elsewhere where the temperature range is far greater. Perhaps too exclusive attention has been paid to the most disagreeable season, for as a result buildings are generallyso dark and cheerless in the cold season that artificial lights, as well as heat, are imposed upon the Page 163 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagooccupants when the sun is shining brightly and warmly out of doors. Encircling verandas, deemed desirable for keeping the sun off the walls, do not effectively reduce the heat absorption of the building proportionately with the effort, and in the case of one-story buildings this absorption is mainlyattributable to the roof. In characteristic internal rooms with clere-story windows the proportionate roof absorption can easily be seen to be as 16 to one, taking account of the incidence of the sun's rays in this low latitude and the greater insulating resistance of the customary wall construction. Verandas on the North should certainly be avoided for the sake of interior brightness and usefulness at all seasons. On the remaining sides, so far as the utility of the rooms is concerned, the device of hollow wallconstruction, costing nothing, reduces the heat penetration one third and the shadows of the trees are more effective than verandas in intercepting the horizontal rays of morning and afternoon.\" \"The main culprit in construction which renders houses in the hot months so much like bake-ovens is the roof terrace, which accumulates the sun's rays for distribution during the night and succeeding days.

Clerestory windows ran the full length of the Press Room between the two tower buildings. One of these towers was the Management Tower, the other the Office building. The top floor of the 2ndterminal building is Mr. Young's flat which supplements his home. [Note: This page is not in the Art Institute of Chicago copy and is transcribed from the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 212 ====] [Note: Continued from page [211-2]] Its advantage for outdoor refuge for sleeping is not an adequate compensation. Here again a vital one-third of the remedy is to be found in the structural boon of hollow or cellular slabs at no cost..... The flat roof is of the greatest advantage in subordinating buildings to their natural surroundings and in Page 164 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoharmonizing the relations in groups and masses. Wider spans, facilitated by reinforced concrete, not only make practicable large rooms but encourage greater diversity in the planning of buildings than has been obtained with steel beams and jack arches of reinforced brickwork.\" \"On the vital question of ceiling heights, there is no excuse for unnecessary loftiness. For when one considers how radiant heat is transmitted from the ceiling under a roof one can see that the effect of distance is almost negligible. What is of real importance is the insulation above the radiant ceiling, whether of confined or connecting air spaces, evaporation or insulative substances or reflecting whiteness or all three of these.\" Hollow walls and a reinforced concrete slab roof, 13\" deep, with a cavity of 6\", the roof being supported at the lower flanges by reinforced concrete beams 4\" deep and 2\" wide were adopted and the soundness of Mr. Griffin's theories, as well as his successful setting of the building, was shown by the fact that it was possible to work in comfort in the main hall throughout the hot weather of 1939 without fans. The roof was constructed on two levels, thus allowing of a row of windows to give light and airfrom one end of the hall to the other. Equally ingenious was the plan of a carriageway under the editorial tower, which allows of the reels of newsprint being taken into the Works under cover during the monsoon. On December 16, 1936, His Excellency the Viceroy did The Pioneer the honor of laying the foundation-stone. On February 11, 1937, Mr. Griffin died of peritonitis in King George's Hospital, tothe great regret of all [Note: ==== Beginning of page 213 ====] who knew him. After speaking of his qualifications as an architect, The Pioneer wrote:- \"as a man, Mr. Griffin was one of those few who are naturally described as \"too good for this world.\" With great charm of manner and a fund of humor and good spirits, he was so entirely and so obviously selfless that there was something saintly about him. He could be obstinate - but only in defense of a job, to see that itwas properly done. Where his own interests were concerned he was only too ready to give way rather than argue with those with whom he was not in sympathy. He could be intolerant but only of the cheap, the shoddy, the second-rate. He had strong opinions - but he was, as he himself said, always learning and kept a receptive mind. Finally, he was courtesy, kindness and patience itself and lived in great simplicity and happiness.\" His death inevitably caused difficulties and delay, for the construction of the building - and particularly the roof - was something new in India or at least in Lucknow. Mrs. Griffin, herself a gifted architect with the same professional qualifications as her husband, continued his work on the drawings for some little time, for the details had naturally not been completed. But she had to return to Australia to settle his affairs and The Pioneer was again fortunate in securing the services of Mr. S.N. Irfanullah, who hadalready been associated with Mr. Griffin on the plans of the building. On him fell the full burden of supervising the construction and making all the necessary calculations and drawings while it was in progress. To him is due the credit for carrying out Mr. Griffin's design. But it must be shared with the contractors, Messrs Saghir and Shri Ram who tackled a big and far from easy job with great spirit and Page 165 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 The of Chicagoefficiency. The Indian mistri [Note: foreman, overseer] and workman is a creature of habit who is not readily persuaded to change his ways. But Messrs Saghir and Shri Ram, thanks to the personal interest and attention of the partners, saw that Mr. Griffin's methods were successfully adopted. Invaluableassistance in solving the problems of the roof was also given by Rai Sahib Hari Chand, the Delhi representative of the Concrete [Note: ==== Beginning of page 214b (table of contents) ====] PHOTO OF CORNER PIER OF COMPLETED BUILDING [Note: Placement of the illustration page at this point is based on its location in the New-York Historical Society copy.

The very extensive electrical installation was entrusted to the G.E.C., and Messrs Bottomley supplied the Hewitic arc rectifiers. The G.E.C. did a first class job under difficult conditions and their Osiradaylight lamps have proved most successful. The arc rectifiers represent the latest method of current transformation and run entirely without supervision. The plumbing was efficiently carried out and all the sanitary fittings provided by the Lucknow firm of Messrs Sen & Sanyal. On April 2, 1939, The Pioneer moved in. The general layout is as simple as it is practical. Facing the entrance and thus convenient for calling on business is the Managerial Tower. On the ground floor is the office of the Job Department, the substation containing the rectifying plant and the stores. On the next floor is the Manager's office, the Circulation, Advertisement and Accounts Departments and the Works Manager's office with a window from which every section of the Job and News Department is within view. On the top floor is the Process Department and the records. Between the two towers is the Main Hall. 1908'[sic] long by 908'[sic] wide with a clear run from end to end. Under its roof are the whole of the News and Job Departments. The right hand or Editorial Tower has, on the first floor, the newsprint stores and the covered carriage-way to the bindery. On the top floor is the Editor's flat. The sterio [Note: stereotype plate?] plant is outside the main hall, but within a few feet of the rotary press. The workshops, garages,post-office, lavatories, etc., are grouped round the large, brick-paved yard behind the building. Vehicles enter under the Editorial Tower and drive through the yard and out by the side of the Managerial Tower. The main entrance is the only entrance. It only remains to be said that the building has stood the test of a year's working so well that there has been no criticism of the accommodation arranged for it by any department, and efficiency has been Page 166 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 215 ====] very greatly increased. As an addition to the architecture of Lucknow it has been praised by all who have seen it and the masses of the towers, the imposing frontage and the absence of all unnecessaryornament give it a dignity and beauty such as few industrial buildings possess.

Looking at the destruction already wrought, at the materialism growing on every side, at the increasing bitterness and unrest throughout the world, at the tremendous power of our latest weapons, a realist might well conclude that many of us now living will see the start of a war which will end in more dark ages. There is no materialistic solution, no political formula, which alone can save us. Man has never been able to find his salvation in the exact terms of politics, economics and logic. From Plato's Republic to Roosevelt's United Nations, his planned Utopias have not proved the answer, for the answer is at a deeper level. Our salvation, and our only salvation, lies in controlling the Arm of Western Science by the Mind of Page 175 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoWestern philosophy guided by the eternal truths of God. It lies in the balanced qualities of spirit, mind and body of our people. Without this control, without this balance, our military victories can bring no lasting peace, our science no lasting progress.

CANBERRA [Note: This illustration may be the one referred to above from the New-York Historical Society.] PREFACE CANBERRA - AUSTRALIA THE PLAN - by J.E.M. - Architectural Record In the capital city of the Commonwealth of Australia modern theories in city planning are applied on a scale heretofore unknown. At the time of the organization of the Commonwealth provision was made for the creation of a new Capital in preference to utilizing for that purpose either of the leading cities of the Commonwealth, and a Federal District corresponding to our District of Columbia was established in the Yass-Canberra region of New South Wales. The Plan of Walter Burley Griffin of Chicago providesfor a city having an area of approximately twenty-five square miles. In its essential outlines the city is completely planned, while the arrangement of the federal and other public groups is developed in considerable detail. The location is about midway between Sydney and Melbourne and seventy five miles from the east coast of Australia. The site is a valley having a general elevation of two thousand feet above sea leveland is bordered by hills and mountains. Two prominent peaks, Mount Ainslie and Black Mountain, rise Page 177 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoabruptly out of the northerly part of the valley. On the southerly edge is a low-lying mountain, Mugga-Mugga, and sheltering forested ranges culminating in the distance in the snow-capped peaks of the Murrumbidgee watershed. Scattered over the valley are a number of lesser hills among which are Kurrajong, Camp Hill, Vernon, Russel and Shale. A stream known as the Molonglo River flows through the site from east to west. A determining factor in the plan of the city is the form of the valley which, as will be noted on the map, is irregular. It is evident that while presenting a number of serious problems this site furnishes a magnificent setting for a city of monumental character. The city consists of a group of connected functional centers. In an ordinary city a gradation in relative requirements from centers of lines of activity would be sufficient; but in a capital city the problem of distribution of centers in accordance with their relative [Note: ==== Beginning of page 2a (table of contents) ====] MOLONGLO MAGIC HILLS ALL EVERGREEN [Note: The New-York Historical Society copy has the following caption (between the two illustrations): \"Molonglo Magic! Foliage gracefully droops toward the waters as they thread their sparkling way across Canberra to the hills, all evergreen.\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 2 or 2b ====] importance becomes much more complex. The functional centers provided for are as follows:- Federal, municipal, educational, recreational, manufacturing, market, residential and agricultural. The central portion of the city is designed with reference to two axes placed at right angles to each other. One, designated as the land axis, extends from the summit of Mount Ainslie through Camp Hill and Kurrajong, and has its distant terminus in the peak of Mount Bimberi thirty miles to the southwest, itbeing a fortunate coincidence that the line joining the summits of these two mountains passes through the two lesser hills. The secondary axis, designated as the water axis, extends from the summit of Black Mountain to a prominent point on the shore of the upper lake. These axes lie midway between cardinal and diagonal points of the compass. Since this is recognized as the most favorable orientation with reference to sunlight and shade in a warm climate, the federal and other public groups are located parallelto these axes. The Molonglo River is utilized for the development of five lagoons, two of which have shore lines determined by the topography, and three of which are architectural in form. These lagoons are designed as the central feature in the architectural setting, and determine the location of the public groups. The fall of the river is slight, and a weir dam of moderate height is sufficient for impounding the water for thefour lower lagoons. For forming the upper lake a dam with sluiceways for regulating the flood waters is Page 178 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoprovided. This dam will also serve for carrying the railway across the waterway. Since the prime object of a federal capital is the housing of various federal activities, the federal group is the one of dominating importance, and is therefore given the central position. A further consideration isthat such activities are largely deliberative and require an accessible but quiet location. The center of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 3 ====] the federal group is at Kurrajong Hill, on the land axis. From this center radiate one avenue to the north through the Municipal Center and continuing through the Manufacturing Center at the northern limits of the city, and another avenue to the northeast terminating in the Market Center. On the crest of Kurrajong is the administration building, flanked on the east by the premier's residence and on the west by thegovernor general's residence. In the triangle formed by the two radial avenues and the south shore of the central lagoon is the federal group. The crest of Kurrajong is about one hundred and sixty feet above the general level of the valley. From this hill the ground slopes to Camp Hill, and thence to the lagoon. This feature of the topography has been utilized in a series of terraces on which the parliament and departmental buildings are located. Aswill be seen from the above tabulation this group is developed in sequence of function. Driveways wind in and out among the units of the federal group. Connection between driveways on different levels and between driveways and main radial avenues is made by means of ramps. Across the lagoon from the watergate recessed into the hill to avoid obstructing the view along the land axis is the stadium. The museums, gymnasium and baths are located along the north shore of the lagoonbetween the radial avenues, the intermediate and adjoining spaces being used as public gardens. North of the gardens are the theatre and opera and several other buildings devoted to public and non-utilitarian uses. Continuing on the land axis north from the stadium is Ainslie Parkway, terminating in Ainslie Park on the lower slopes of the mountain. This entire group, to be used in general by the people as distinct from their representatives and agents, comprise the Recreational Center. At the Municipal Center are the buildings required for conducting the business of the municipality, while surrounding this center is a district devoted to the administration of financial and [Note: ==== Beginning of page 4 ====] industrial affairs, such as banks, stock exchange and office buildings generally.It is planned to locate the important wholesale and retail establishments around the Market Center. At this center will also be located the central railway station. The streets connecting the Market and Municipal centers will form a shopping district. West of the Municipal Center is a large group of buildings forming the commonwealth university. These buildings are arranged in logical sequence and radiate from the centers in the order given below. Page 179 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago1. Natural Science - Descriptive 2. Theoretical Sciences - Derivative 3. Applied sciencesThe building devoted to each natural science is correlated to the group of buildings devoted to its derivative theoretical sciences, and the same principle is observed in correlating the theoretical and applied sciences. This principle is carried further in locating different sciences adjacent to facilities for illustrating their theory and application. In the application of this principle the school of law is located on the side nearest the Municipal Center. The school of agriculture is adjacent to the botanical gardens,which extend inland from the west shore of the lower lake, while the school of medicine is adjacent to the hospital which occupies the small peninsula jutting into the west circular lagoon. On the east slope of Black Mountain is a district to be known as University Heights, and to be occupied by residences for the University faculty and dormitories for the students. The various centers are laid out in polygonal form, both the hexagon and the octagon being used. Such an arrangement results in a multiplicity of obtuse street angles within the polygons and, owing to the relative positions of the different centers, in the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 5 ====] intermediate sections as well. With the exception of the main avenues practically all streets will be discontinuous or will have vistas closed by obtuse angles, a condition furnishing excellent opportunity for informal and picturesque treatment by means of residences or otherwise. At the same time this planprovides rectangular building between points of junction of the different systems thus formed. It was considered advisable to leave certain tracts to be laid out and developed according to individual initiative. For this purpose many of the blocks in the intermediate sections are made of unusual size. These blocks, in whole or as subdivided, are available as sites for institutions of various kinds, horticultural gardens, playgrounds, enclosed residential courts, etc. The modern tendency in city development is toward long alignments of trade along lines of communication. With the long avenues connecting the centers, as provided in this plan this tendency is encouraged. The plan is such, however, as to discourage the spread of trade into adjacent territory, since the intermediate streets, owing to discontinuity or change in direction, are ill adapted to use as thoroughfares and are therefore unattractive as locations for trade. In this way permanently quiet zonesare provided that are suitable for residential purposes and, at the same time, are convenient to lines of trade and communication. Main avenues are planned for a width of 200 feet. They will be divided by parkways into three separate arteries of travel to provide for fast and slow vehicles and tramways. It is designed so to locate the tramways in the intermediate sections that at any point in the city will be within five blocks of atramway. The Federal Center is the focus and transfer point of all tramways in the city. Tramways will be laid in the avenue encircling Kurrajong Hill, and connections will be provided to lines on each of the radial avenues. Page 180 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe railway throughout the city will be depressed 12' below the street level, all streets being carried over the tracks by means of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 6 ====] viaducts. The central station is at the Market Center where the railway passes through a tunnel under the slopes of two hills. A local station will be provided at each of the other centers passed through. The railway yards are located immediately south of the Manufacturing center. As would be expected in view of Mr. Griffin's well known canons of design, the buildings of the public groups if built according to his recommendations will consist of compositions in line and mass designed with reference to the purposes of the buildings and the requirements of the materials used, andindependently of all historical styles. Reinforced concrete and marble are recommended by him as the materials best suited to the purpose. A study of the plans reveals remarkable success in utilizing prominent points for aspect and prospect. In this connection it is only necessary to call specific attention to Mount Ainslie and Kurrajong Hill, both visible from all parts of the city and both commanding the widest possible view of the city and its mountain background. J.E.M. A Scotchman writing Mr. Griffin said it was the only comprehensible town plan he had ever seen.

It may call for the perfect solution for a single lot or for any other unit such as municipality, state, continent or world. The world solution is a primal element and should be tackled without delay since humanity is now a unit for since the Christ gave the individualized Ego - \"that light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world\" - to every man in the world there is no longer any difference between races, and there should be no artificial boundaries erected between them. 1st.

GENERAL - Griffith, so named in honor of the late New South Wales Minister for Public Works, is designed to be the capital of the great Murrumbidgee Irrigation District in the southern part of the state.It is established as the terminus of a main line of railway that is being by degrees extended westward into the interior of the State and the continent. THE SITE - Forty miles west-northwest of Leeton, the site occupies gently rising land, including some Page 183 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoslightly marked offshoots from the western end of the southern convex base of a crescent-shaped, sharply-defined ridge known as the Macpherson Range, rising here to 250 ft. above the level of the Australian plateau which from this side stretches almost flat indefinitely into the distances. Situated in a central position on the main irrigation canal, 91 miles from the Murrumbidgee River, this site is near the northern border of the whole irrigation tract which will stretch 50 miles to the east, ten miles to the south, 40 miles to the west, and seven miles northwest. Surrounded by grassy plains, the slopes of this virgin site are openly wooded, chiefly with blue-green, cypress-like callitris trees interspersed with small eucalyptus Mallee and Yarran. The main canal, which will flow through thelower portion of the city, will be of service for irrigation to only its smaller lower portion, but a high level channel, part of a projected pumping scheme, may serve for the bulk of the remainder of the city. The headquarters of the Irrigation Commission, with authority over the entire Murrumbidgee project of nearly 3000 square miles, Griffith is designed as the seat of administration, law, and education for this very important section of the State, in addition to its functions as the commercial distributing center for aconsiderable area, comprising not only the early developed and perhaps most promising section of the irrigated lands, but an almost equal area of non-irrigable agricultural and pastoral regions accessible around the end of the ridge. Not merely [Note: ==== Beginning of page 8 or 9 ====] is this to be a railway terminus for the period that this north-westward projection of the line from Sydney and the east is deferred, but it is due eventually to make a distinct change in direction for threelines, counting a line through Wilbriggie (a point on the New South Wales main South-western line 15 miles southward), intended to join the Victorian system beyond, and thus reach the southern coast ports. For that time Griffith as a railway focal point must be prepared to carry on effective exchange and transfer business arising through its special facility for direct shipment, involving a minimum of switching and re-handling, with consequent economy as a point for breaking of bulk goods, and withthe resultant depots, stores, and markets. The alternative of almost equally distant Pacific and Antarctic Oceans may be assumed to be of increasing advantage to this location as new and more favorably competitive ports are opened up. Through these considerations it is evident that wide latitude for expansion and a considerable degree of convertibility in uses of land and broad generalizations of comprehensive classification are required inthe plan. Assuming as a modest estimate 30,000 for the population, a circle, of radius one and a quarter miles, centered where the main wide avenue crosses the railway in front of the post office, provides accommodation as follows:- Areas AreasPublic Acres Private Acres Aggregate Acres General 63 1510.29Building Sites Page 184 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoOccupation 2206.44 Reservations Ridge Park 378.72 Canal Gardens 29.02 Radial Parks 87.41 Local Parks 138 page 10a (table of contents) ====] GRIFFITH PERSPECTIVE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 9 or 10b ====]OCCUPATION.- As is evident by the arbitrary circular boundary line, the short radius assumed, and the balanced character of the development allowed for, any question of expansion to a possibly disproportionate population is answered. Of the circumscribed city site about 20 percent is dedicated to communal purpose not including communication ways, and about 50 percent to private purposes. Increase of radius will but slightly alterthese relations since a proportionate sector of the main reservation, Ridge Park, naturally withheld from other development, being of poor adaptation, will be embraced, and since a consistent system of local reserves is clearly indicated throughout the extensible general arrangement. A maximum of square corners and the avoidance of acute angles is sought to reduce waste, as well as ugliness in buildings. BUSINESS.- The central point in the plan which is clearly here the spot most uniformly accessible from all portions of the city, marks at the same time the point of access from the outside world by railway, and therefore may be counted upon to fix the starting point and also the perpetual business center. COMMERCE.- As such it must be adapted finally to retail trade purposes to which the highest land values may be expected to attach. The influence of this advantage, extending in all directions as the citygrows will in time make it economical to do the necessary filling and construction work required to carry the two parallel streets that will afford additional thoroughfare across the East-west railway trafficway without interruption of grade or traffic. These two streets are, of course, indicated on the plan, but in advance of their execution the railway station grounds will extend that much closer to the main business avenue axis while the corresponding markets may also in the meantime be accommodated on Page 185 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoeither or both sides of the track in independent sections. The provision for these markets is on a scale to permit of the sale of produce direct from the carts of the producers effecting a most [Note: ==== Beginning of page 10 or 10c ====] intimate contact between production and consumption, and assisting to diminish the cost of living. The markets being central public structures cannot, of course, occupy the main street because of their bulk and their interruption with private shops, which demand continuity, but by an open passage-way connecting the market entrance with the post office these two permanent features of the civic architecture in the commercial zone are opposed and displayed to the best advantage, and through their alignmentwith the station, which is the gateway to the city, they may insure the visitor's favorable first impression. Central retail merchandising is provided for not only along the main avenue or axis, but on the curved streets connecting it with the main radial thoroughfares and their attendant parallels by which all the customers must approach. Allotments for business are of a maximum depth of 160 feet and are provided with rear shipping ways 30 ft. wide. The typical frontage width is 30 ft. in order to allow of the mosteconomical spans to fix a serviceable minimum limit of shop. Extending radially from the markets and the station along the lines of the railway are the business districts to accommodate the storage, sale, and handling of the wholesale merchandise and retail bulky goods. Along these lines, which pass underneath the main avenues of the city, it is possible to accommodate with a minimum of interruption all the long distance wagon haulage as additional to rail transportation from the country to the market,and the driving of stock as well. MANUFACTURING.- On the eastern leeward line in a narrow valley special provision is made for the beginnings of manufactures where there is the greatest possibility of concealment and minimum annoyance as well as proximity to station, the shunting yards and team tracks adjoining. The district is served only by vehicular traffic lanes flanking the whole reservation clear of all switching operations. Manufacturing, especially through extractive processes, may become an important feature here, and for elasticity in case attenuation becomes too great in one direction from town, it is evident that a [Note: ==== Beginning of page 11 ====] re-disposition of the traffic lanes on the other lines, either the south or north-west railway, will make them similarly available for sidings. However, in view of the special accessibility of the eastern railway to arterial street traffic and tramways, no necessity for such expansion is likely to arise for a long while. The public service plant for the production of power, electricity and gas, which can be assured architectural consideration in the public interest, is located in a separate but less unobtrusive land pocket on the railway route and main industrial channel, and for efficiency it is given the advantage of waterfrontage on the main canal. Page 186 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoADMINISTRATION.- Commercial and professional offices, banks, and Chamber of Commerce are specially favored in sites near the extremities of the business axis, where there are special advantages in elevation and the attractions of parks and public buildings, as well as lesser pressure of rent. The ringsaround the Government offices are generally advantageous in these respects, but the other end will be most accessible to the highest class residential district, and probably preferable for the physicians and dentists. GOVERNMENT.- For the combined governments of the district and the municipality an area of 10 1/2 acres is reserved, crowning the central hill, where these most important structures of the city willcommand the commercial axis and dominate the vistas from every other direction. Moreover, all the other public buildings and most conspicuous edifices of the city are platted on the same system of parallels to contribute additional elements to this architectural domination, definitely linked in the simplest possible way. The central group thus governing the public architecture of the town as well as its affairs comprises the headquarters of the irrigation district, the Town Hall, the court house, and subordinate public offices. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 12a (table of contents) ====] GRIFFITH PLAN [Note: This illustration is listed as being on \"page 12a\" in the table of contents. The presence of a \"caption\" (below) suggests placement of the illustration at this point.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 12 or 12a ====] CAPTION - On Griffin's first arrival in Australia, before he had been made director of the Federal Capital, Mr. Wade [Note: L.A.B. Wade?]who was in control of the Irrigation District asked him to design the capital of this district - the city of Griffith. The lay of the land made it possible to divert the irrigation canal from a straight line to a semicircle for the Civic Center. Mr. Wade saw the possibilities this offered and agreed. It took many long arguments with the railroad people to get them to consent to bring together the 3 Railroad systems. No occasion for it at present, they said. But Griffin said that as the decades rolled on into centuries it would be needed. \"Oh, by that time the Japs will be here,\" they said. \"Well let's have it right for the Japs.\" He said. He won. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 12 or 12b ====] THE CITY PLAN OF GRIFFITH by Walter Burley Griffin continued Page 187 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoOf this the editor of the Irrigation Record says (The designer's conception of the city of Griffith as it should appear when completely developed on the lines he has laid down is illustrated below. The following notes may be an aid to the identification of theprominent features of the bird's-eye view now given with the ground plan published in the last issue. No difficulty will be experienced in tracing the line of the main canal from where it enters the urban area on the east and crosses the Wilbriggie railway just north of the hotel center (A). The effect which will be produced by its sweeping curve round the central portion of the city and by the two enlargements of the waterway is very apparent. Due north of the hotel center, the railway station (B) can be readily distinguished, but the line of the railway from Barellan to Griffith is not at all prominent. Further north again, and a little to the east of the railway station, the block of academy buildings (C) makes another prominent feature of the landscape. Following the western curve of the railway from Wilbriggie, just after its junction with the Barellan line at the railway station, the post office buildings (D) and markets can be picked out, and still further to theleft-hand side of the picture, right in the center of the town, is possibly the most prominent landmark of all - the administrative center (E). No doubt the years to come will see the Town Hall flag waving gaily on many festive occasions. The theatre (F) does not show out very distinctly, and the same is also true to a lesser extent of the hospital (G). There is nothing of outstanding prominence in the manufacturing and commercial area (H), and buildings of striking design have not been shown for the agriculturalshow grounds (I), but in a reproduction of such small dimensions it is impossible to illustrate adequately many of the important features of the plan. There can be no question as to the general effect of the artist's work, and a Griffith stately and spacious as that foreseen would be a [Note: ==== Beginning of page 13 ====] worthy capital of the State's great irrigation scheme. - Editor.)GRIFFITH - EDUCATION.- Since the Capital of a large district will first of all attract leading educational activities, a site of 16.48 acres is given the high terminal point of the commercial axis opposite the government, where at the outset, anyway, the public high school or academy group may be established to be supplemented by contiguous parallel private institutions for which flanking situations are reserved. As the center combining recreation with educational motives, a site for a Public Institute to house library, art gallery, museum and lecture halls is indicated facing the Government group across the broad water and park from the north-west direction. This important edifice might well be allied with an agricultural college, whose experimentation plots occupying irrigated land, would have unobstructed scope for extension toward the west without necessity for intersection by or interruption with anyinternal traffic of the city. Page 188 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoA more popular and general educational feature merging into recreational use is the Exhibition Grounds, wherein race meetings may be held as well as the annual agricultural and horticultural show. Such a site, because of its merely occasional use, cannot be central, but in this case it is most readily accessible bymeans of main traffic and tram routes on either side. It occupies a hillock terminating another one of the radial avenues. This mound of just appreciable rise is enough to greatly enhance the effect of a show feature of the city, and the canal which abuts it for a distance of almost half a mile will contribute a special attraction. RECREATION.- The indicated 20 percent proportion of the site in public parks by no means gives a true conception of the permanent wild reserve that will be available to the residents for outing; the whole wooded rocky ridge extending for miles being contiguous with the Ridge Park that lies within the mile and a quarter radius. In fact, this range may be one of the inducements to bring additional residents [Note: ==== Beginning of page 14 ====] to Griffith. The next feature of the site that provides unique attractiveness is the main canal, which flows around the administrative center in an arc. This channel, with curving embankments with expanded ponds and water gardens, is the enlivening natural element of the City Park for midday respite of the sedentary workers and for continual promenade. A resplendent garden holds inspiration for everyone, and an additional benefit if the attempt is made to widely vary the examples of plants or animal life and indicate their names and associations. Where handy like this one, it not only offers the social rallying place andcommons for all but invites general use for concerts, festivals, and pageants, and affords youths opportunity for competitive games and water sports. Disposed in a belt on the lower side of the business area, this City Park interposes but slight burden in distance on the communication to and from the south-western and least valuable residential area, while the promenade form stretching for a mile is capable of augmentation by five radially connected series oflocal parks that lead directly into the open country, and which, though intersected by short cross roads, are not disrupted by heavy traffic, and will afford great scope for peaceful stroll and varied explorations. LOCAL PARKS.- These radial local parks, having only garden and not service frontages in the surrounding houses, afford permanent \"vacant allotments\" for youthful activities, and are so large and so numerous that excessive concentration and consequent boisterous activities away from parentalcontrol are not encouraged. They are supplemented by corresponding smaller parks in alternate blocks throughout the city, an arrangement which is optional in all the districts of Griffith by reason of the typical block depth of 400 ft. to provide in each locality for the diverse needs of various kinds of families as to accommodation for children, for pleasure garden, or for horticulture, and for individual preferences as to separateresponsibility or neighborhood co-operation in any of these directions. Page 189 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 15a (table of contents) ====] MUNICIPAL INCINERATOR [Note: ==== Beginning of page 15 or 15b ====] Local schools as well as local associations and clubs, always, and often even churches, are to be situated in contact with these many parks, to facilitate not only their use but their supervision and the helpful direction of children's activities, and as well, to supply handy housing for the general accoutrements of the recreation field for all ages. HABITATION TRANSIENTS' CENTER.- The capital characteristics as well as the commercial promise in addition to the Government policy of a single State hotel dispensary for alcoholic drinks forecasts considerable concentration in an hotel district which naturally should have the benefit of the main public gardens and also be convenient to general business, and especially to the railway station. These conditions are met in a subsidiary mound diverging from the administration hill where two main avenues of approach cross the southern railway line here conducted through a subway and free from shunting. This transients'group is conspicuous in itself, and enjoys fine prospects of public administration buildings and gardens, as well as the privilege of two stretches of radially linked local parks. Hotels of a residential type, as well as the hospital, are suitably located on the public gardens, while for a Resort the ridge reserve offers an unusual opportunity. HOMES.- The \"upper\" and \"lower\" sides of town furnish distinctive advantages for residents who may on the one hand prefer the height and views and the generally closer allotments for most intimately sociable semi-urban living, or on the other hand those who may desire to combine gardening or semi-agricultural activities with suburban home life, merging gradually at the outskirts into full-fledged farm units of 10 acres upwards. Simple bungalow houses, ranged not in monotonous rows but grouped for the effect of open courts to conserve air and views, are in general to be allowed a minimum latitude of 50 ft. each and are to be set close upon the minimum 100 ft. street building lines which mark the legal [Note: ==== Beginning of page 16 ====] highways but do not indicate the varying and generally much narrower actual thoroughfares.The point of vantage for the living quarters in such houses is the 200 ft. minimum depth of lot or the alternative local enclosed park prospect providing ample scope and privacy to garden fronts, secluded, free of services and offices. COMMUNICATION.- A proportion of nearly 30 percent reserved for communication marks the Page 190 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocharacteristic of spaciousness for Griffith, but it indicates a maximum far above the actual area that will be utilized for public thoroughfares, since it includes highways everywhere provided with private forecourts, also, since the legal widths fix only the front-building-line, separation of structures. ACCESS.- The ridge bounding the city on the north-east and the irrigated area of intensive culture extending in the other directions determine that the external communication lines be so laid down as to afford direct access from east, south-east, south, south-west, and north-west. The railway requiring minimum gradients, and through routing is kept entirely on the level of the plain, but conforms in alignment with a corresponding radial system of through roadways for the other sortsof heavy and long-distance traffic connecting with the outlying country and nearest important towns or centers already established. Barellan, to the north-west, Wilbriggie due south, and Hillaton to the north-west, are the immediate objectives of the railway lines, while all the existing important country roads are made directly tributary to the existent highways which they join at a distance of two miles from the focus. For these roads, the maximum thoroughfare width of 150 ft. is allowed in each case to accommodate interurban tramways, separate from the roadways, on a wide central shaded promenade parking. The main irrigation canal, whose location is definitely fixed by the configuration of the slopes, is incorporated with highways to insure proper supervision and to secure the greatest possible public benefit [Note: ==== Beginning of page 17 ====] from the water surface for appearance and for boating, for which latter purpose and for bathing it is expanded in the public gardens. CIRCULATION.- The arteries of internal traffic comprise the 150 ft. radiating avenues, together with their cross connecting annular streets in the business districts. Every opportunity that the undulations of the site afford has been utilized to provide the necessary separate grade over the railway thoroughfares,the natural slopes intersected by the latter being sufficient to accommodate not only roadways but their attendant building frontages, insuring a maximum of continuity and flexibility for commercial development. DISTRIBUTION.- All subsidiary streets have a minimum building line spacing of 100 ft. which allows for central parking where needed for tramway cross connections or for distributing irrigation canals inaddition to moderate roadways. Option with the authorities is reserved as to the treatment of individual streets, but the roads generally are intended to be occupied for public use only to the extent of widths proportionate to their lengths and positions in the city, thus conforming to the amount of traffic that may be expected or that may develop. With the lengths and breadths reduced where the least traffic is wanted, the additional depth thus made available for the more out of the way of the uniformly plotted blocks,registers that increasing proportion of private site to public ways which is natural.

MELSON DWELLING [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.] BEYOND THE WEST1915 - March - Greenwich, New South Wales - Dear Miss Franklin [Note: Stella (Miles) Franklin?], We are breaking up our private partnership. Mr. Clamp [Note: J. Burcham Clamp] feels that with so large a percentage of Mr. Griffin's time absorbed by Federal matters (out of the last ten months he has given less than two to his private work) he is not reaping much advantage from the partnership. We all feel that it is much better that it should not continue. It is not to be expected that a chance partner shouldhave the burning devotion to Mr. Griffin's ideals that he and we uns have, nor a willingness to work on the very long lines which leave financial reward to the distant future. As to the Federal Capital matters there are two possible solutions of the very trying and we sometimes fear impossible situation. One is that the Parliament and Ministers do not understand the motives of the Civil Service which is determined to control everything itself without the embarrassment of outside Page 192 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoinspection of its methods or results, or that they feel helpless to contend against the absolute autocracy of a body established for life over which neither the people nor their political agents have any control whatever and into whose hands the nation pours all its taxes for them to spend entirely at their pleasurethe result necessarily being that they care nothing for the efficiency of the works they undertake but only for the increasing of their own force and power. The other is that they are in cahoots with them for of course there are to be tremendous contracts let or expenditures made in the course of construction of the city. Both elements may enter into the situation. The fact is that in the ten months we have been here Walter has not been able to accomplish a single thing. The Parliament House competition which he sent out has been cancelled. He took infinite pains with that and one of the European city planners who passed through this country at the time said that if he never did another thing that alone was enough to establish his claim on the gratitude of the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 19 ====] world - not only because of the ideals but because of the sane, rational method it established, and because of the caliber of the work it would call forth. We still hope that the mistake of calling it off canbe remedied although it will be very hard to reestablish the confidence of competitors, or in the judges for whom, standing at the head of their profession, it would be almost impossible to find alternates. The Civil Service is determined to make its own program and make their own control complete. As to the plan they have no notion of letting any plan but their own be carried into execution and as they are in power for life they can gain their ends, they hope, by delay piled on delay, working in a scheme oftheir own whenever they get a chance as they have recently been trying to do by proceeding with a sewerage system of their own, antiquated and wasteful, throwing away money into hundreds of thousands of pounds. The present Minister of Home Affairs [Note: William Oliver Archibald] is by common consent of his colleagues the least fitted for his position. He is entirely a tool of the department, and has no intelligence to appeal to. The Prime Minister [Note: Andrew Fisher] up to the present has refused to allow Mr. Griffin an interview. Is [Note: He's?, It's?] apparently determined not to let him state his case. Why we can only surmise. The architects, especially of Melbourne, are jealous, and the people as a whole, not comprehending the facts, are indifferent. Bit by bit Mr. Griffin has awakened various individuals to the facts, and there are several men who are doing what they can to help but it is mighty little they can do apparently. Dr.Maloney [Note: William Robert Nuttall Maloney?] a member of Parliament since its first days is a staunch and untiring fighter for the cause. It is time there was a muckraking campaign in Australia but as yet Australians feel that it is their duty to conceal the defects of their system. It of course makes them easy prey. Our whole strength lies in the conspicuousness of the undertaking and hope of a gradual realization of that fact by the Labor Party. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 20 ====] Page 193 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoWe are hoping the Party will realize before too late that the publication of Mr. Griffin's correspondence with the Minister would lay them open to grave suspicions, that the execution of the Department Plan would make them the butt of the ridicule of the world, that their failure to fulfill the government'scontract with Mr. Griffin, with the International jury of eminent architects, and with the competitors many of whom had done a lot of work before cancellation, will seriously impair the nation's credit, that the undertaking has such an appeal to the imagination that these things are going to be talked and written about for a very long time to come. However it is very difficult for them to get any comprehension of the general interest. If the Labor Party fails to recognize this we are going to have to depend on a gradualawakening of the Australian people which may take decades. I had such a charming hour with your Mother at her home a week ago. I am afraid I got the uplift from her and she nothing from me but depression as you see the tale I have to tell is not a pleasant one. But we all love Australia and hope we can find a way to help.

Dear Robins [Note: members of a round robin letter group of MMG's MIT classmates], Am doing so much writing of one kind or another that I have taken to the type-writer. I know it will be a relief not to have to puzzle over my writing. Though I am far from being an expert with the machine it is very mucheasier than writing and, I think, faster even with the short practice that I have had. It was a delight to get the Round Robin and I am mailing it back on the boat it came on though this has been a busy week for me, not that that is unusual, but I had to make a speech Thursday to the Citizens' Association on Citizenship and Town Planning and as I could not use lantern [Note: ==== Beginning of page 22 ====] slides because of ceiling lighting it had to be given some special attention. I certainly could write a volume on this year's experience but that will have to be postponed till later and be written perhaps for a larger audience. There is a very strong anti-American feeling here for one aspect of which Theodore Roosevelt is responsible in his pompous sending around the world of the U.S. fleetwith its flip assurance which of course he had no business to make, that if Australia ever needed assistance the U.S. fleet would be on hand to help. In fact the coming of the U.S. fleet was a large element in starting them here on the battleship building fever and military movements which are getting an appalling grip on the spirit of the people which, in connection with a firmly entrenched bureaucracy over which the people have absolutely no control, bids fair to strangle the development and prosperity ofthe country for the next decade or two. There is no chance here for any foreigner (and any new-comer is considered to be a foreigner) to prosper in any field, trade or profession (except dentistry) and that is not Page 194 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoonly our personal judgment but the universal opinion of those with whom we talk many of whom have lived here some years. But is not only the freezing out of strangers but a deliberate destruction of all the business of the country for Socialism is being established here by both parties whether radical orconservative and all its deadly consequences are in process. It is a nation of pessimists full of fears; ideals are rarely to be found in the country. All their policies are based on fear. Protective tariff is doing its deadliest for as G.H. Perris (whose writings by the way you all ought to read) says though a large country can stand the consequences of a protective policy (the U.S. for instance being one of the biggest examples) it will quickly strangle a small country. It certainlyis strangling them here where wages are very low compared to ours and the cost of living high. There is bitter class feeling, the political parties being purely a class division with no [Note: ==== Beginning of page 23 ====] difference of principles. As one liberal woman put it, \"A liberal is one who has, a laborite is one who hasn't.\" In private business no one trusts anyone and we are finding they have good reason. You would be amazed if I should tell you who made the following remark to us - \"If I were in America I would takemore pains than I would here in making a contract, but when it was once made I should feel confident that it would be fulfilled. Here I should know that no attention would be paid to it.\" My husband is having the fight of his life in the matter which brought us over here and this is the remark reported to me by a lawyer, \"I can't make out what is the difficulty. It seems as if there must be something wrong.\" \"There certainly is,\" was the answer; \"the whole Civil Service is rotten in everyDepartment.\" \"Well but it seems to me that if Mr. Griffin had come over here and drawn his salary and not fussed he would have got along all right.\" \"He certainly would,\" was the answer, \"but he didn't come over here to draw his salary but to do the work he was appointed to do and to do it right,\" - and that's what we don't seem to be able to make any Australian understand. And that is a fact. Though the fight isn't over yet, we are still hopeful that we have so far come in contact with the worst side and that soon the better element will begin to manifest itself and help to start things going right. There will have to be some signs of change soon or we shall feel called upon to start a publicity campaign making an open statement of the decidedly scandalous facts. The one word that describes the methods here is inefficiency and the one that describes the ideals is mediocrity. Now you mustn't think I am so pessimistic as this letter sounds. In fact I am a confirmed optimist and am thinking that Australia may be on the verge of a muck-raking period comparable to America's in the early 20th century in which case changes may take place very rapidly. We may help the muck-raking ball along. That may be quite as [Note: ==== Beginning of page 24 ====] useful a work as the one we were expecting to do. But one thing I must say. Don't ever let them fool you into thinking that, in comparison, Americans are a money loving people. The impression has arisen Page 195 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofrom the Americans' open expression of contempt of those of their compatriots who have been led by their desire of it, and from the many active measures that are being taken in America to make it impossible for the unfair accumulation of money. In European countries, and Australia is utterlyEuropean in its ideas, they have never yet dreamed of questioning the manner of getting money. They accept Special Privilege, which of course means unfairness, as a system divinely right, and give unquestioning adoration to those who hold the Privileges, envying of course but never questioning the propriety of the System, trying when they do anything at all only, by any means whatever, to get a privilege themselves. There is not here a vestige of the feeling that it is a joy to work. No one has enthusiasm in what he is doing. The interest is merely in getting the money out of it. Of course we see that feeling in America, but here there is nothing else. At any rate the attitude is so all but universal that it is appalling, as is the feeling that one human being has a right to feel superior to another and that superiority gives him the right to do anything he wants to do to the inferior. The \"ladies\" are shocked if the servants refuse as theythemselves do to eat the dark meat of the fowl, and are scandalized when they find the servant's family serves ham at home. Fortunately my job as a draftsman made it unnecessary for me to participate in society life. The Australians find the Americans as inscrutable as the Chinese and I think for the same reason, that they do not believe that might is right, they do not believe in militarism nor imperialism. TwoAustralians, one a college professor, made a curious remark to me. It is typical of the general point of view and shows that they really [Note: ==== Beginning of page 25 ====] admire the German methods and are fighting them simply because they will grab something they themselves want, something neither has a right to have. Really the ideals of the two peoples are the same. There are individual exceptions of course. The remark was - \"Here is someone who doesn'tbelieve that the virility of a people is evidenced by its fighting tendency,\" - meaning me. I was hooted at as being ridiculously silly. I said - \"Do you mean to say that you think that the Germans are proving their excellence and virility by the fighting at the present time?\" \"Certainly, they are showing what a splendid people they are.\" These were men who believed that Germany had started the war. Well we rarely hear anything but vituperation of the Germans at present but it is everywhere evident that theGerman ideal is the general ideal. This was but the unusually frank expression of the common ideal. In fact there is no such hatred of the Germans as there is of the Americans. The war has put a stop to our architectural work almost, but our community work being on longer lines has not been seriously affected and we are very busy as always even if we are not getting rich fast. Of course one of the difficulties of our work is that we have to do so much of it ourselves, it is verydifficult to find anyone to whom we can delegate it. We have an able assistant in Roy Lippincott who with his wife, Walt's sister Genevieve, is here with us. Since the general conditions, which became apparent after we had been here a few months, have made the future so uncertain we gave up the idea of building a home until we could see more clearly, so our beautiful lot in Vaucluse [Note: a suburb of Sydney] is still unoccupied. We four have been living in a cottage on another arm of the Harbor, righton the water's edge, with a beautiful bank dropping terrace after terrace for some 80 feet, and at the Page 196 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobottom a swimming pool enclosed in concrete to keep the sharks from eating us up - quite a necessary precaution. The only complaint I make is that my husband has to [Note: ==== Beginning of page 26 ====] spend so much of his time in Melbourne. But he is with us week-ends. Our being on the water makes it a real holiday for him and if any settlement could be reached all his work, public as well as private, could be handled from here. On clear days we get a glimpse of the Blue Mountains across the water. Our yard has flowers in bloom all the year around and we get the full benefit of the most gorgeous sunsets across the harbor looking up the waters of Lane Cove. Bushels of love to you all, Marion 1916 - May - Melbourne - Dear Gene [Note: Georgine Mahony Smith, MMG's sister], I hope Mother doesn't think she has to write me long letters to make them worth while to me. Just a few sentences is enough to put me in touch with you all and give me a homey feeling. In fact your letters are all the home I have. Way back in Chicago Walter said to me he'd have to break me of the homing habit. He insisted that I had broken him of the home habit and that he'd have to do the same by me. Well I guess at last he has done it for except for the purpose of going to bed I have no desire to go anywhere. The office looksbetter than anything else to me. When Walter works at the private office I go to sleep on the couch, when he has to work at the Federal Office I stretch out on his desk and sleep there till he is ready to go which is usually half past eleven or twelve. Then we trail home looking like a couple of inebriates. Sometimes he sleeps on my shoulder, sometimes I sleep on his. Sometimes he keeps on with his work on the train and after he is in bed till one or two o'clock. This is Sunday and I have been having afternoon tea with some of the ladies at the home of Mrs. Paling - a very pleasant home but I didn't want to go and two weeks from tonight I have another social appointment. I can't get out of them but have no way of returning the courtesy which adds to the trial. They always want him and he never can go so it makes it as unpleasant as it used to be to have to go instead of you where you were the one wanted. This having to play first fiddle roles when you are only built forsecond [Note: ==== Beginning of page 27a ====] fiddle parts is terribly trying. If I only had never married Walt but had just been his draftsman and had stuck to him in that capacity it would have been so much better. I would have been saved so manycomplications. The only difficulty would be that it might have added somewhat to his complications and heaven knows he has enough. During the coming week in addition to all his legitimate work he has to write some volumes summarizing the evidence he had been giving the Works Committee for the past year and replying to the evidence of other witnesses called in on the questions of the Lakes of the Federal Capital and theRailroad and the roads, etc. and much of their evidence is deliberately misrepresented by a bunch of shysters who don't pay the slightest regard to truth in anything they say. Naturally it makes it very hard to reply to. Parliament meets on Wednesday and there are a dozen things he has to get ready for Page 197 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagopresentation to them. However we are hopeful that something may come of it. The only thing I take any interest in doing is the work and I keep at it long after I have a curl in my back bone, and am sick with fatigue. I don't know what will become of me unless some of you folks comeover to play with me. It's a queer kind of life Walter and I are living full of a kind of satisfaction but altogether too intense but with all its strenuousness there is a peace of soul which after all is all that is necessary. The currents we are pulling against have not yet proved too strong for us and we'll paddle on as long as we can. I have a notion we're helping to clear a way through the jungle but Lord how the beasts do snap and bite. At present I am doing mostly listing of native plants for planting now for both private work and the Federal Capital. I ought to be at it now but guess I'll go stretch on Walter's desk and go to sleep instead. Love Marion. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 27b (table of contents) ====] NEWMAN COLLEGE . MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY [Note: ==== Beginning of page 27c ====] CAPTION Newman College, one of Griffin's first private jobs, is planned to make use of the whole street frontage of the Catholics' terraced property. The Chapel as shown will be in the center and the part already constructed will be duplicated on the other half of the property. A dome building - the ultimate library -will be on the street corner and the two dormitory wings with their terminal specialized buildings will complete the enclosing of the interior court. The word \"College\" does not mean what it does in America. It means a dormitory building for students. This group however included in addition to dormitories and dining Hall not only a building for sports for the students, gymnasium, swimming pool, etc. but another building, architecturally identical, withlaboratories, etc., for supplementing the university facilities. These two buildings terminate the two stretches of student dormitories which extend at right angles to each other from the dining hall dome. The whole of this is to be duplicated when its dome will become the Library. Then a chapel will be entered from between the two groups its forecourt flanked by the two scientific buildings, connected bya chapel cloister.

So that is one definite thing accomplished. The contract is \u00a351,000 and Walter feels that the contractor is a capable and energetic man so we hope things will go smoothly. All the conditions of the chief donor have been met so he will have a hard time to make trouble though he may. His chief objection was to having modern plumbing replace the time honored \"thunder mug.\" Our \"friends,\" the trio, are no doubt gnashing their teeth, their really strenuous efforts having come to naught. They are trifling people, as Mrs. Holman (wife of the New South Wales Prime Minister) said, and so apparently malicious that if they have any effect it is the opposite of their intentions. Gene [Note: Georgine Mahony Smith] doesn't seem to be appealed to by Australia and of course I fully understand her feeling. But that doesn't mean [Note: ==== Beginning of page 27e ====] that you all would not enjoy a good old 4 months holiday over here. Last Thursday Walt went to his College Committee meeting at five and I snoozed on the couch till eight when he came back with the good news. We had all been on tenterhooks for several weeks, the Committee and all fearing war prices might make the costs prohibitive so when he came we danced a jig and said let's go to a picture show. Then ensued a discussion as to whether we should go to a show or be rational and get something to eat. We finally decided to be sensible for once and went to a China shop and had our favorite Ki Si Min.Finished at nine so we went to a movie too. Hit a fairly good one so we felt we had spreed it satisfactorily. We had to send for Roy [Note: Lippincott] to come down here to Melbourne so Genevieve is the lonesome one this week. Miss Benke stays nights when Roy is away so she is not really alone. We all wish Mother Griffin could have stayed two or three weeks longer even if Father did have to go home tohis business. I think they really enjoyed their visit though it was a shame we could not all have been together more of the time. But then baby Alstan [Note: Genevieve and Roy's child] was the most important one to be with. Walt is working away in the next room. It's ten o'clock. Think I'll have be go put a stop to his nonsense shortly. I don't know what he would do if he didn't have me to pester him. He never recognizes a stopping place by himself. Good night sweet mother.

[Note: ==== Beginning of page 28 or 28e ====] See III No 8 [Note: Handwritten editorial comment.] THE CAPITOL THEATRE - MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA. WALTER BURLEY GRIFFIN - ARCHITECT When it came to the Capitol Theatre in the heart of Melbourne, he was up against as difficult a situation as could face an architect, not only the bureaucracy but three different owners (one absentee, difficulty of dealing with an agent) none with a grain of aesthetic inclination. They all knew that to build a firstclass theatre they must maintain a certain standard but hated to spend a penny they could get out of. So there was another long fight - the Capitol as well as the Capital. In every case he had to put in a drawing of the ordinary thing and get a price on it. Then put in his own conception, beautiful, the price of which would be less than the ordinary thing so from their own standards they had to accept it. There is still nothing comparable to it in the world. There has been much talk about interior illumination of theatres but here it is done on a grand scale, a stepped, oblong pyramidal ceiling, thousands of Page 202 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagodifferent colored lamps hidden by the beam steps and the light thrown up on intensely rich and deeply cut crystalline pattern, cuttings sometimes three feet deep so that, played as a color organ, it glows from alabaster white to rainbow colors in endless combinations and rich with shades and shadows, amysterious loveliness and a powerful grandeur. As one architect expressed it, he could sit and watch that ceiling for a fortnight and when he came away he would not be able to draw it. The Paramount people at the opening said if it were built in New York it would be packed continually without their having to give any shows. By means of an electric switchboard this color organ is played for a half hour before each performance as well as in the intermissions. When the question was brought up by the Council of a roof ten stories above the street which projected a few feet beyond the building line Griffin put in another design with stepped piers running up above the roof, the center one the highest, and the others stepping down, all extending back giving a feeling of a substantial third [Note: ==== Beginning of page 29a (table of contents) ====] THE CAPITOL THEATRE . MELBOURNE . Proscenium from Balcony [Note: The illustration's placement here is suggested by the its location in the New-York Historical Society typescript as well as the presence of a \"caption\" (below).] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 29b ====] 29CAPTION The shape of the property necessitated a very long and narrow building determining many unusual treatments in construction and design. It gave the opportunity for grand entrance treatments, sumptuous foyer with its balconette, and a unique and mysteriously beautiful ceiling and lighting treatment. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 29c ====] [Note: Continued from page 28 or 28e]dimension. He had already used this motif in the Melson Dwelling in Mason City Iowa, in that case not the piers but the keystones over the openings. His co-architect who according to the contract was to have no participation in design, construction nor superintendence, advised against this design. The first design was carried through. Later a building was constructed to this alternative design in Melbourne. For some years this markedly striking design appeared in many city buildings, [Note: the words \"Melbourne, Sydney\" have been erased] and when I went to India some years later the first tall building I saw under construction - in Madras - was this design. In this case it was charmingly and delicately handled. When I came back to the United States I found it in general use in bridges, etc. and in the most Page 203 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobeautiful building of the New York Fair - the Russian Building. Truly a design once conceived persists in the etheric realm and becomes accessible to imaginative thinkers. We were always glad to see the senor's [Note: Walter Burley Griffin's] work having so swift an influence on his time, only too slow forus. We could only wish that more builders took the trouble to train themselves to enter these realms in full consciousness and bring back treasures of beauty to be built into the world of manifestation. Anyway it was a joy to know that such creative work as constantly dropped from Griffin's pencil would have its influence in molding our civilization to beauty as our people trained themselves to loftier concepts than mere security; and as they learned the simple lesson of organizing their communities onlines that bring health instead of inevitable disease. THE FIRST \"SKYSCRAPER\" IN AUSTRALIA.- THE CAPITOL, MELBOURNE. The Capitol, built in 1924 is 10 stories high and made history in many ways in Australia. During the following quarter of a century tall buildings approaching America's have been built in Sydney but only at the end of that time have they begun to appear in Melbourne. In the Melbourne Herald of 1943,Lieutenant Carrara, graduate of Architecture of the University of Illinois, in addressing the conference on Town Planning, is quoted by the Melbourne Herald as saying:- Melbourne has only two buildings that merit praise - \"The Royal Melbourne Hospital [Note: ==== Beginning of page 30a (table of contents) ====] THE CAPITOL . Swanston Street . Melbourne [Note: The placement of the illustration at this point is suggested by the reference to it in the followingparagraph. The entire building is sometimes referred to as \"Capitol House.\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 30b ====] is possibly the finest building in Australia (it is about the same height as The Capitol) and the theatre (The Capitol) is so perfect that often even architects fail to see how well Mr. Griffin carried out histheme.\" In 1924 the Melbourne Herald in publishing the above photograph so said:- A WONDERFUL BUILDING - In the midst of the celebrated Howie Estate in Swanston Street, a colossal structure of steel frame and concrete has lately been stripped of scaffolding and stands now revealed to thousands daily passing as a noble architectural feature set in the heart of the city. The New Building is to beknown as \"The Capitol.\" It will contain a remarkable picture theatre, surrounded by shops and surmounted by offices, housing, it is believed, the elite of the business enterprise of the metropolis. The entrance hall visible from the street is broken by a low flight of semi-circular marble steps leading to a broad landing, and is ceiled with ornamented shallow gilt domes brilliantly lighted. Straight forward a broad arch leads to the floor of the house while, at the right of this, horse-shoe arches open on thestairways to the foyer and dress circle. An array of stout pillars in arabesque design supports a low roof heavily girdered in white coated concrete. The stairway walls are carved at the landings in consonance Page 204 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowith the geometric design of the whole entrance hall. The motif of the design, deeply carved with arabesques, suggests something of mysteries beyond, which the moving picture men will no doubt endeavor to live up to. Upstairs the foyer surrounds a balustraded light area from the floor of whichpeople will be able to look down upon the assembling crowds in the auditorium. Unusual stability and tensile strength characterizes the whole building and some remarkable expedients in structural engineering have been introduced. To keep the theatre and gallery free from columns an immense steel girder spans the theatre entrance and carries the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 31a (table of contents) ====] ALTERNATE DESIGN for the Capitol building [Note: The illustration's placement here is suggested by the illustration's location in the New-York Historical Society typescript as well as the presence of a \"caption\" (below).] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 31b ====] 31CAPTION To maintain face with their London client a second architect shared the commission with Griffin on this building. In the course of meeting the opposition of the Town Hall Griffin submitted alternative designs for the facade, stepped plinths rising above the roof with molding as shown here or stepped piers between the windows. Shortly after this his \"silent\" partner used the latter design in a building inMelbourne. The idea has swept around the world - in buildings, bridges, etc. It appeared nobly in the Russian Building in New York World's Fair and most charmingly in Madras, India. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 31c ====] [Note: Continued from page 30b] whole of the nine office floors above. From the girder is suspended also the roof of the theatre entrance. The awning is a noteworthy piece of engineering construction, weighing approximately 25 tons, built on the cantilever principle, of reinforced concrete and structural steel. Reinforced concrete is the material used by the architect in the construction of the whole building, the first in Australia. One of the most remarkable structural features are the escape staircases, all completely isolated in concrete. These descend on both sides of the theatre. (Comment by M.M.G. - These escape stairs accomplished the impossible task of two objects occupying the same space at the same time. Each was adouble flight and in both cases neither of the two flights had any connection with the other. They were Page 205 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoentered from various levels of the unusually deep balcony. The Municipal Council couldn't believe it was possible so a model was made to prove it. The supervisors of construction tried later to change certain flights here or there but found they couldn't change a single step. Though that was W.B.G.'sconcept and requirement it was M.M.G.'s patience that worked it out as built.) PHOTO - THE CAPITOL - THE THEATRE MAGNIFICENT - TENTH ANNIVERSARY - 1934 THE AUDITORIUM LOOKING TOWARD THE BALCONY TEXT - The following text is quoted from the Tenth Anniversary Souvenir of The Capitol Theatre. THE THEATRE AS AN INSTITUTION - Ten years ago, on November 8th, 1924, a theatre opened its doors that cherished an ideal - an ideal that was institutional in its inspiration; An ideal to give to the citizens of Melbourne and Australia in general a theatre that could be justly termed, by its achievements and its records, a National Institution. Commencing with The Ten Commandments, the Capitol Theatre began its history in a blaze of glory. A standard in entertainment was inaugurated that definitely set a standard not only for Australia but for deluxe cinema houses all over the world. In music we have submitted every kind, from Symphonic, Classical, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 32a (table of contents) ====] THE CAPITOL PLAN [Note: ==== Beginning of page 32b ====] Operatic and at the present time are featuring the trend in music toward modernism. We trust we may be forgiven for quoting those famous words of Addison:- \"It is not in mortals to command success but we'll do more, Sempronius - deserve it.\" Not only is our pride in the entertainment but likewise in the theatre itself. The unusual architecture and decorations even after ten years can still vie with any theatre in the world today. It has defied the passage of years. It is as modern in its appointments, its comforts and its architecture as though it was at its FirstAnniversary instead of its Tenth. Truly it is still the showplace of Melbourne, the world's most unusual theatre. Architectural forms never before attempted were blended with a color scheme of bronze and gold, and the unique lighting effects, completely indirect, were enlisted to produce a perfect palace for the motion pictures. Columns, arches and arabesques of surpassing beauty gather the vision of all audiences to thebrilliant proscenium. The lofty fretted ceiling glows and pulsates with all the splendor of the Aurora, amid the mystic architectural forms of this theatre magnificent slowly dawns on the observers the daring conception of the designer - a picture playhouse where music, form and color conspire in a complete captivation of the senses. Page 206 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoMost buildings are describable by reference to the architectural style to which they belong. Not so the Capitol. The theory of the designer was far adrift from all the five orders. It was boldly declared that the conventional forms of pillar, arch, architrave and pediment, with all their developed beauty, sprang fromthe Stone Age; and that modern material, steel and concrete, had no dependence on these time honored bases of stability. Concrete in its plastic state can be molded to any fancy; in its final setting, reinforced with steel, it is stronger than granite. So, in the Capitol Theatre, we have wide floors and balconies depended on their own tensile strength, and the very roof of the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 33a (table of contents) ====] THE CAPITOL AUDITORIUM LOOKING TOWARD BALCONY Showing Well of Foyer above [Note: ==== Beginning of page 33b ====] theatre not resting on the walls beneath but suspended from the floors of the commercial offices overhead. The pillars in the foyers are not fluted and tapered on the classical sculptured models but aremodeled in cement with quaint diapered designs that compel admiration by their originality. Even the cornices have been left without the conventional moldings, and are outlined in strips of varying light from hidden lamps. A Color Symphony - The magnificent roof span of the theatre gave the designer full range for a fanciful effect, and audiences find their attention captured by the unique design of the walls and ceiling. Sincethere is a complete absence of pillars the designer applied his imagination to the novel decorations on the walls and ceiling, and not a square inch has been allowed to escape. The side walls are buttressed by arrays of square-cut supports, and above these the walls break into the ceiling in cubes, triangles and stalactites of fretted plaster. Everywhere the straight line prevails. The curves and moldings of conventional design are entirely absent. The ceiling itself, over the central stalls, breaks up into a greatheight in serrated lines of fretted plaster, all broken into little cubicles upon which thousands of unseen globes pour artificial light in a myriad of varied hues. The light effects are changeable at a touch and a skilled operator is able to play them like a color symphony. THE WIZARDRY OF A SYMPHONY IN COLORS - The quaint and strictly original idea of the interior decoration of the Capitol Theatre is one not yet duplicated or conceived by any other architect inthe world. The architect, Mr. Walter Burley Griffin, with his peculiar and unique genius performed wonders with concrete and fibrous plaster that are truly astonishing. The remarkable architectural feature is the array of beautiful alabaster prisms constructed about the ceiling and side walls of the auditorium. The structure of these features was an art in itself. Each block of prisms had to be exactly molded and securely installed in the proper positions so as to bring out the Page 207 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 34a (table of contents) ====] THE CAPITOL PROSCENIUM . Concealed Organ on both sides [Note: ==== Beginning of page 34b ====] beautiful shades and coloring of the indirect lighting effects.Seen in ordinary electric light the impression is of being in a colossal cave cut and chiseled by skilled hands at the order of a cool, competent but inspired brain. A thousand projections like trimmed horizontal stalactites, thrust out symmetrically from the sides and the roof. Each speaks for the design and all speak in unison so that a chorus of units each like a regularized rock-crystal makes a mighty, architectural chorus. One gets an impression similar to that received when watching that chemical miracle of the formation of crystals except that here a particularly appropriate form has been decided on and fixed in concrete form. That a man could conceive such an idea, so aloof from the orthodox and standard architectural canons, is a matter of utter astonishment and admiration. There is a suggestion in the architecture of liquefied stone having been thrown up in successive rectangular jets and congealed when and where the architect's vividimagination decreed geometric formation. Yet so consistent and deliberate is the whole scheme that one comes to the conclusion that its madness has a lot of calculation in it. These solid forms are not shaped as prisms or faceted for fun, but more like gems by a giant lapidary. Something serious is behind it all. This becomes evident when the lights are turned on. At the back of the stage is a monster electric switchboard. To the layman it is a mystery. Handles unlimited, numbered and colored tell the initiatedwhat they are capable of. Mr. Frank Cunningham is the wizard of this keyboard. He has manipulated and worked out thousands of color combinations which he has used in the past ten years. By working the various handles he is able to suffuse the crystallized ceiling in all the rosiness of the Aurora Borealis. His combinations are as illimitable as those of the kaleidoscope. With his ability to operate the lamps in the colors of red, greenand violet he can make as many chromatic variations as there are in prismatic glows. Yet not a light is to be seen. The reason is [Note: ==== Beginning of page 35a (table of contents) ====] THE CAPITOL FOYER . FIREPLACE END Opposite is stairway to upper levels [Note: ==== Beginning of page 35 or 35b ====]that all are concealed behind the concrete shelves which separate the stepped prisms, and nothing but indirect light reaches the eye of the audience. Page 208 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoEach of the prisms is built on the principle of mirrors and each reflects on to their neighbors the original light. With each later reflection the intensity of light decreases, but this it is that gives gradation to the colors and aids in the blending and the changing from one color to another. There is no otherarchitecture or lighting scheme like it in the world. It is the work of a genius in resource and an artist in effects. In the past ten years the beauty of these effects had left a memorable admiration on every patron of the theatre. Today this wizardry of lighting and elaborate decoration is as modern and unique as any of the present day architecture. THE MAIN ENTRANCE LOBBY.- Entering the theatre from Swanston Street the curious and heavily gilded ticket boxes attract attention immediately. Most original in design and construction they are decorated entirely in cubes and squares of bronze, plaster and metal, these decorations forming frames for the large sheets of grained glass which serve as walls to the boxes. Behind the glass, gold leaf is heavily applied. The huge glass chandelier hanging from the roof above the main box-office adds to the brilliance and decorative scheme of the front lobby. The entrance foyer, visible from the street, is broken by a low broad flight of semicircular stairs leading to a broad landing and carpeted in rich tones of orange and apricot with curious arrowheads of black and green, designed by Griffin and woven in London. The landing is ceilinged with ornamented plaster and shallow gilt domes brilliantly lighted. Straight forward a broad arch leads to the floor of the house while, right and left of this horseshoe arches open to the stairways to the foyer and dress circle. An array of stout pillars in arabesque design supports a low [Note: ==== Beginning of page 36a (table of contents) ====] THE CAPITOL FOYER . BALCONY IS SMOKING ROOM [Note: ==== Beginning of page 36b ====] roof, heavily girded in cream-coated concrete. The stairway walls are curved at the landings in consonance with the geometric design of the whole entrance lobby. The motif of the design, deeply carved with arabesque suggests something of the mysteries beyond. EXOTIC BUT CAPTIVATING.- Upstairs on the first floor is the dress circle foyer and lounge dignified and richly furnished in a harmonious note of gaiety. Covering the vast foyer, the lush Wilton carpets were specially designed to harmonize with the color and decorative scheme of the whole theatre.Ivory, sandstone and bronze - these are the three main motives of the color scheme of the interior decorations. Ivory for the various ceilings, sandstone for the walls, pillars and stairways, and bronze for all metal-work, railings and portions of the colorings which pick out the interstices in the plaster ornamentations. This combination, in addition to the brilliant orange and green carpetings, seems strangely bizarre but actually the colorings harmonize remarkably and offset well the Aztec like cubesand squares which serve as bases for the structural decorations. Page 209 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoFOYER - THE MURAL DECORATION.- The height of the ceiling gives an impression of coolness which impression is increased by the ivory color and the vast area. A cool theatre and a restful one were primary aims in the interior decoration. Indeed color effects throughout were watched very closely andskillfully. Almost as impressive as the ceiling are the giant sandstone pillars in the foyer. Light sienna in tone, they are multisided with the tops and bases relieved by broad dual shoulders painted in brown and bronze. Let into the faces of these pillars are risen squares of plaster, the spaces between the squares being decorated in gold leaf. The stairs bring one to the fireplace end of the foyer. On the long side across the well looking down into the auditorium below is a mural decoration of Australian forestry which is ideal in form and coloring for decorative purposes. Above we see the front rail of the Balconette. The mural was painted by Mr. Nicholls of Melbourne. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 37a (table of contents) ====] THE CAPITOL SMOKERS' ROOM . A BALCONY of the Foyer [Note: ==== Beginning of page 37 or 38 ====] THE BALCONETTE - THE SMOKE ROOM.- One can reach the different levels of the balcony of the auditorium from the entrance which leads from the fireplace end of the Foyer or from the stairs opposite whose first run leads off to the Balconette, or smoking Room, secluded yet not secluded and well ventilated. It is like a gorgeous and luxuriant living room, apart from yet a part of the great foyer. PROSCENIUM AND ORGAN.- The motifs of the elongated pyramid of the Auditorium ceiling are carried down in the proscenium arch whose main form is determined by the forms of the units. These surfaces in the ceiling are built up of crystalline forms cut from depths of a few inches to a depth of three feet giving endless reflections from surface to surface quite indescribably lovely. These forms of the ceiling steps are carried down in the Proscenium where enough of their more hidden surfaces areopen for sound transmission. The organ pipes are concealed on both sides and the sound pours out from the center. The proscenium is illuminated as is the ceiling from concealed lamps so that any color can be played as a whole or in any part in any combination. Since the whole of the material world is made up from the battle between light and sound - the form-building forces - these two can touch all the strings of human nature for the temperaments too - choleric, sanguine, phlegmatic and melancholic aredetermined by a preponderance of one or another of these forces, red, yellow, blue, lilac - creating warmth, light, sound & magnetism.

This is evidenced in the hopeless ugliness of everything done by man, in the antipathy to and fear of beauty. The first step in the construction of Canberra was taken, before the plan of the city had been made, in establishing the Military Quarters - Duntroon. The designer had to accept its location as one of the external facts to be faced. Empty spaces for hundreds of miles around but every pains taken to make it a slum - narrow streets (very narrow as in Europe) with shanty houses jammed together. Always in these ways the Civil Servants keep up the pretense of economizing in the expenditure of tax money andalways the costs are enormously greater than they need be, and always it establishes conditions which tend to maintain classes. This urge to maintain classes is still evidenced in Canberra (1940) by the requirement that officials build their homes in particular suburbs according to their salaries. This is not a law but if, as occasionally happens, a man builds in a suburb for lower salaried officials his chances for promotion become smallindeed. In the early years the majority of citizens are certain to be Civil or Military officials. They put through the construction of the Cotter dam some 40 feet high supposed to be necessary for the city water supply but as the Royal Commission made clear later, a 10 foot dam of the upper Molonglo River was all that was necessary and would at the same time have maintained the series of lakes within the city in those river bottoms which cannot be used for anything else for each year they are flooded bythe rains. For years the officials built the Canberra Railroad on these nice flats and, each year after the floods, built them over again. One hopes this dam will not follow the example of the great Murrimbidge [Note: Murrumbidgee?] dam of the irrigation district, also built by the Civil Service Page 211 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 42 ====] (as practically everything in Australia is) which is so cracked that the water level has had to be lowered a third of the height. No one knows where it will go next. A pleasant prospect for those below. AScandinavian engineer has been consulted who says the method of construction is faulty but when I saw it a short time ago the water was still dammed up. Well the irrigation districts are dependent on it so one can but live in hope they won't all be drowned. Anyway the building of another is all to the good from the Civil Service point of view. We must remember that bureaucratic works cannot be judged by newly established experiments such as are being tried in the U.S. in the taking over by the government of public utilities, for example, for the men trained in private enterprise are taken over, men accustomed to efficiency without which private undertakings cannot continue to exist. The problem of these great enterprises can be properly solved only when our communities add a national Economic Organization to their Political one to be extended to a World Organization if we want peace in the world. As for the Civil Service, inefficiency is derigueur, for inefficiency can always be made up out of taxation where it is usually not obvious because of lack of competition and where all advantage derives from inefficiency for through it the personnel is increased, the department strengthened and renown achieved through the fact of having spent great sums. In Canberra it meant nothing to the officials that the bridge they built across the Molonglo was washed away the next season. They built another. They finally got into trouble about it only because the Canberra plan had been gazetted which meant no change could be made in it without an act of Parliament, and the dragon-eyed Mr. Smith [Note: James Alexander Smith?] got questions asked in Parliament as to who had been authorized to change the levels established by the designer. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 43 ====] But why should it care what people think or know or say. Thus with transportation. As you travel over the mountains going from Sydney to Melbourne you look down below to the old wagon road making the crossing at a much better grade. Quite deliberately Governments choose the wrong way first. People gradually realize that another way is better so it becomes easy to scrap the old and build another, thus maintaining their force, still not choosing the right way if it can be avoided as in the case of the Railway to Canberra where in connection with the Arsenal City he was designing in the Federal District Griffinconnected it with Sydney with a comfortable gradient but they chose a half way between his and the old one thus keeping the way open for another tear down and rebuild. Australia suffers from the disadvantage of having had the Railroads in the control of the government from the beginning. A comparison with America shows the consequences, for individual initiative has brought continental development in the United States. The Railroads have been undertaken and pushedfar and wide, ahead of and encouraging settlement and development. The governmental control in Australia has made that impossible from the beginning and it is hard to see how there can be any escape from a system firmly established where the preponderating vote of the population of the present cities now makes it always to the advantage of the politician to cater to the apparent urban interests and votes, and not \"waste\" their money on wild Railroads built out into empty spaces. Page 212 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoAs Professor Meyers [Note: Hugo Richard Meyer?] says, the history of Australia is the history of its Railroads. So on the whole the Railroads are simply connecting links between the established sea-coast cities leaving the interior of the continent empty (not because it is a desert which it isn't) constantlyfrustrating any hopes or plans of increasing the population of the rural districts. The problem of decentralization will probably never be solved until the radical step has been taken of breaking the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 44 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . SYDNEY . DAVID PRATTEN [Note: ==== Beginning of page 45 ====] liaison between politics and economics through the establishment of a Threefold Commonwealth. This is the more difficult perhaps because in Australia the Labor Party is by no means a Labor Party but an industrial Organization whose interests are with the manufacturing elements as versus the primary producers. From another angle, Mr. Valentine, an official in the railway department but one of those whose mentality had not been perverted through that fact, made a comparative study of nationally ownedand privately owned railroads. A particular thing to be done in a definite time requires 8 men in the privately owned railroad; in the government owned railroad it takes two hundred and forty seven. Our own experiences would lead us to take this as a typical example in the expense to a community of the Bureaucratic method. This does not mean that such undertakings should be handed over to individuals indiscriminately nor as monopolies but calls for a Political Organ that strictly maintains Equity and notPrivilege. An electrical engineer in chinning [Note: i.e., talking, chatting] with Griffin on their personal experiences told the following tale:- As sometimes happens, though rarely, he had been called in from outside to take charge of the undergrounding of the electric wires of the district of Sydney. As the work approached completion he called the attention of his superior officer to the necessity of placing the menin some other work as it was de rigueur not to dismiss civil servants. The chief not wanting to bother told him to find something for them to do. He replied that he couldn't and got the answer - \"Well then tear out the work and do it over again.\" We have been informed that Chicago's drainage canal was dug in the daytime and filled at night, but however that may be bureaucracy in the economic realm is sure to end that way. Of course in Australia there is always the added pressure from England's wanting to lend money and never wanting the principle to be returned. In the tramways for instance - the most awful, uncomfortable miserable things imaginable. In Melbourne they ran the buses off the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 46 ====] streets by increasing the taxation. In Sydney the case was worse yet for with the often very steep slopes Page 213 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe grinding noise of the cable-drawn trams is unendurable and the old board seats intolerable. The buses on the whole simply supplemented the trams in districts where the trams were often miles away. For why should a bureaucracy bother to meet the needs of a community? Much better hold back asmuch of the income as possible for munition makers and other pals who will help pull off a war any time England wants one as it does every time an economic rival appears on the scene. The buses were comfortable, fast, safe (for they pulled in to the curbs for passengers). When the tramways began the fight against them they offered to buy the tramways and pay off the whole indebtedness in fifteen years, but no, the government bit by bit increased the tax till they could no longermeet expenses and had to quit. The years roll on with no decrease in the heavy rates. With increasing demands for buses they put on a few but first seeing that buses would have to come they replaced the old trams with new heavily built ones, still uncomfortable, noisy and dangerous but enabling them to spend that much more money before coming to the only suitable up and down hill transportation for Sydney - the buses. Moreover the perpetual deputizing of the government to obtain some long and urgently required service helps to maintain the \"morale,\" helps keep the people, all the people, properly subservient. I had a bit of experience in the endless and practically always futile deputizing the first year I was in Australia, but it keeps people busy and feeling important. I thought a pleasant way to enter into the life of Sydney would be to join some of the women's organizations. I soon withdrew from most of them so large a part oftheir efforts consisted in deputizing the government to get assistance in something they had at heart which seemed a shocking thing to me who had been accustomed to a community where no one looked to the government for [Note: A similar discussion of Australian railroads and the Sydney trams and buses can be found in Section II, No. 17, pages 265b-265d (below).] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 47 ====] any sort of charity or for assistance in any personal undertakings. I am sorry that I can no longer say that of my country for in this as in so many things America is beginning to try all the things that have been done in Europe all of which are failures. I listened to a lecture by Dr. Mary Booth urging the deputizing of the government to get financial aid for a health clinic for mothers separate from the clinic where sick children were brought. I went up to herafterward saying it would seem impossible for the government to supply money and then hand over the control of it to outsiders which was what they wanted, and asked why they didn't collect the money and carry out this work privately citing the work of that nature, hospitals, etc., in America that were supported by private contributions. Her answer was that America was richer than Australia. But, I said, Sydney is just as rich as New Orleans; Melbourne is as rich as many cities in America. They did this.But no! It wasn't to be considered for a moment. This is but one of the many ways of pauperizing Australia. I spoke of it so in a letter to my brother that first year in Australia and was called up by the police about it and had it not been that the U.S. was not yet in the war, I should in all likelihood have been put in jail for it as they quoted their authority for such a step which would have been applied if America had been allied with the world powers. Page 214 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoOnce established the Bureaucracy is ruthless. It is all-powerful. Why should it care what people think or know or say. England is an example. The oldest sons of the aristocracy form the House of Lords, the younger sons fill the offices of the bureaucracy which has complete control of the House of Parliament.So the aristocracy owns the government. Neat isn't it? The general run of the people have no way of finding this out. The Sydney bridge is another instance. It was let to a British contractor who was not the lowest bidder. It should have been a sus- [Note: ==== Beginning of page 48 ====] pension bridge instead of a cantilever, aside from the practical advantages, for the whole of this bridge depends on the strength of four pins only some ten inches in diameter necessary to take up movement. As it is, it is most unsightly and destroys the beauty of Sydney's Harbor by its scale as well as its intrinsic ugliness. But really there should have been a tunnel instead. Everything was right for a tunnel anyway to meet the increasing traffic. From a military point of view it should have been a tunnel. And shortly they will have to build a tunnel anyway to meet the increasing traffic. But then the government,on principle, does the wrong way first. From the British Empire they receive their titles for this. Just so much more money to be lent as well as fat jobs for Britishers. The first bombers of an enemy would strike this tempting target and that would block up the whole channel above which lies Cockatoo Island, the naval and armament works. Many of the structures built are too high to go under the bridge. Of course that's just what the government wants so now they are destroying another of Sydney's beautifulpromontories gradually moving the whole of the Cockatoo Island factories, etc., over to Clifton Gardens. Of course they were a fine target for the Japanese there if Americans had not interfered with their southern course. [Note: ==== Beginning of page [49] ====] TOWN HALL . ALLAHABAD . is the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 49a ====] CAPTION But Mr. [Note: James Alexander?] Smith was right though the antagonism of the bureaucracy is basic and not increased by any personal considerations. But Sir Elliot's (notice, he already had a title) positionas head of the Town Planning Association lent support to the idea that town planning capacity was being used in the Federal City whereas it was nothing but imperial obstruction. He was put in charge of starting the business center and - ca va sans dire - placed it in the center of a residential section. It has caused confusion ever since. Nobody can find his way around. One day Page 215 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoGriffin asked him why he did that. Of course there was no reply. But since private ownership does not exist in the capital and the minting of money costs the government nothing, that mistake will be remedied in time which was not possible in Washington.

DECATUR [Note: ==== Beginning of page 50b ====] FAMILY GROUP . HOLIDAY RESORT & SUMMER OCCUPANCY ALLEN RAVINES . 5 MUELLER FAMILIES . DECATUR . ILLINOIS Allen Ravines comprise a most charming area of wooded glen and meadowed glade luckily left undisturbed by the agricultural interests which have long preempted the surrounding country. Its development is for the private use of its owners as a suburban place of residence accessible by motor, and wherein their common interests are met in the joint club house group and farm, and their individualinterests in the private cabins of the several brothers. The scheme as a whole is based on a conception of the tract as a wilderness to be maintained intact, so far as consistent with use, in its natural state. The general tendency in preserving the few exceptionally beautiful spots that are left to preserve in the midst of our civilization will be to convert them into parks more or less public, and injured because of that fact and of the consequent cleaning for use andthoroughfares, etc., etc. Here where we are not forced by such considerations is the opportunity to maintain a true relic of primeval Illinois. This conception then determined, against the alternative of entering below the grounds say over the levy from the road on the east, and for acquiring land and entering at the northwest for a grandiose effect and for the advantage of providing for traffic as far as possible away from the most beautiful parts so thatthese are reached only last, by inconspicuous trails and foot paths. The entrance from the west side highway is located where one, on entering, obtains a fine view of Decatur across the basin-like part of pasture most suitable to field sports for the outings of the owners' factory employees and at a level low enough to make the travel around the hill pasture and through the woods gradual ascent without special grading to the vehicle terminal, nowhere with a general view ofthe entire site and its boundaries, always with the objective undiscovered beforehand, and the limits left to the imagination. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 50c ====] Page 216 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] \"Entertainment House,\" Garage, \"Custodian's Lodge\" are but a short distance from the entrance yet sheltered from the highway by the round of the hill. The \"House\" on a commanding peninsula overlooks the first ravine with a vista of the Sangamon beyond and conversely shuts off the onlyobjectionable view now obtaining on the premises, that of the farm-house on the highway as seen from the peninsula to the east of this one. The Club Group is thus in a central position contiguous to the Game Fields as well as to the woods and ravines, to the custodian for easy supervision and to the features of wilderness, especially the spring-fed pool and private green, and accessible directly by foot paths as well as indirectly by \"trails.\" The cabins are located at such strategic points as indicated by their different names, \"Valley Views,\" \"Meadow View,\" \"River View\" and \"Glen Point.\" They are reached from the Club by trails following lines where they will least interfere with the wildest features of the landscape thus keeping that rich rarity - a gem of Illinois forest as far as possible in its primitive state. Only the slightest touch in the depths of the valley is needed to make the springs available for a useful swimming pool. The trails themselves as they leave the Club House are confined to such treatment of the ground as will prevent rutting but will not indicate the artificiality. The private domiciles in rough, saw-finished wood construction are to become almost as natural as birds' nests or, where of masonry, are to be terraced into the hillsides as unobtrusive as homes of Cliff dwellers.

In a way it was again the Revolutionary War between America and Britain for our coming to Australia was another throwing of the tea into the Boston Harbor. And curiously enough Griffin's fight with the government was reflected in my battles in private life. The publisher of a magazine, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor and their pal, Mr. Stowe, who had tied up with us from the first days, called me into their office and told me that from now on Griffin was to do what they told him to do in Federal Capital matters, etc. I left pronto. My own battle in Sydney is reflected in some of the correspondence of that year. A number of fine and very capable women lined up with me in the democratizing of Sydney's Town Planning Association. Page 217 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe following scraps of correspondence will hint at what was going on. It came to a head in the Town Planning Association in which a group of very capable women, including Mrs. [Note: William Arthur] Holman, the wife of the Prime Minister [Note: Premier] of New South Wales, who backed me through thick and thin in the battle for a new and democratic constitution for the society. The three chief enemies later spent much time vilifying Griffin going even to the Prime Minister, Mr. [Note: William Morris] Hughes, who showed Griffin the matter they had put before him. The women won. These scraps of correspondence hint what was going on. 17 February, 1915 - Dear Walter, Genevieve (Griffin's sister) worked all Tuesday morning on the drawing of Mossmain, Montana with me so I got through comfortably by four o'clock. Can't get a litho-print on tracing cloth because the gelatin plate is moist. Can't get a litho at all satisfactory this weather and he said it was impossible to make the print in one day so am [Note: ==== Beginning of page 52 ====] diazo print?] made. Roy [Note: Lippincott] will bring it home tonight and I'll letter it in the morning and take it down to mail at noon. Genevieve and I went down at ten this morningfor a swim. Mrs. Taylor called up just now to see if I would come to the Town Planning annual meeting and lunch. Nothing to say but yes. Genevieve is going to try to go down with me. Have written to Mrs. Franklin that we are planning to go over to see her next Wednesday afternoon. (Mother of Author of All That Swagger.) [Note: Stella (Miles) Franklin published \"All That Swagger\" in 1936.] I think in laying out the general perspective of Mossmain, Montana I'll stand near the business center to bring that into big scale and look across to the bluff and social center in the distance. The difficulty with this is that it doesn't show the Yellowstone River. How about it? It might be better to make my foreground the axis between the two centers. That would show the bluff well but the distance would not be so interesting. We are still living high off the birthday party, chicken salad last night, chicken and rice tonight. Your devoted wife, Marion. Roy brought home the Helio, a good print but you know what Helios are, kind of pale at the best. By the time I had lettered it the buildings were invisible so I blacked them in. Then it seemed a pity to put so much work on and run the risk of not being able to get a reproduction after all so I started in inking in the streets and ended by inking the whole thing practically except the lines of the curb on the streets.Worked from seven after supper straight through till three o'clock in the morning. Up again and at it at eight and am now rushing down town to get it in the mail before twelve - the latest for packages. Mrs. Holman called on us yesterday afternoon. Fed her on birthday cake. Miss Sulman called me up last evening and I am to meet her at Farmers' to go together to the Town Planning lunch. Very much pleasanter. Genevieve and Roy had to report at jail this morning. Love, Marion [Note: ==== Beginning of page 53 ====] Page 218 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoMelbourne - Dear Marion, Am leaving tomorrow night, Friday, in order to be on hand when Senator Grant's [Note: John Grant?] motion is under consideration. It will not come up until about 8 P.M. today and no one can tell what may happen to it or how it may be changed or what advice I may want to give.Please go with Roy as escort to the Fitzgerald dinner and I will send a telegram tomorrow to Sulman [Note: John Sulman] expressing my regrets, etc. I have just seen Grant who arrived in Melbourne at 2 this afternoon and is also leaving tomorrow. I feel that all has been right with you today. The Grahams are coming around all right (clients for a residence). Lovingly, Walter. Dearest Walter, I'm terribly lonesome tonight. Mr. and Miss Sulman have been here. I'm afraid my surmise was true and that none of these men have any desire to have what they are doing under the scrutiny of a bunch of disinterested members. You can't get an Australian to be direct. Mr. Sulman settled himself close to me, and Miss Sulman went over and engaged Roy and Genevieve in animated conversation on the other side of the room. This was after we had been out in the yard and had discussed the beauty of the location in general. I asked him if he wanted to talk over Town Planningmatters. He said he wanted to ask how matters were getting along in Melbourne. So we talked around the bush for a while and then, casually of course making it seem as if it were not premeditated, he dropped into the question. I can't give you the conversation but he insisted that the Women could not be organized as a Branch. (They must this week have organized a Randwick Branch.) He said the women could not take up general work but must do what the Council told them to do. I said if that were the casethe women should be told what they were expected to do. He said they had thought they could take up such subjects as would be delicate for the men to handle. \"That's why \"we\" have been giving such prominence to lowering street car steps so that pregnant women might not sustain injury, and to the height of laundry tubs.\" He said [Note: John Sulman was a noted Australian architect and town planner. In 1908 he had published a plan for Canberra. In the early 1920s he would become chair of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee. A prestigious architecture prize, the Sir John Sulman Medal, is named after him.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 54 ====] he had made out a minute to be given to us stating that our work was to be the investigation of reserves and asked if that had been given to us. I told him it had not. Finally he said why would it not be well to have just a general conference. I said that was just what we were asking for. Well but not to considerany special motion but just to talk things over to come to an understanding. - - That's what we have asked for. There is no special motion. - - But I was told we were to consider a motion of yours. - - No I had no motion. - - Then the announcement we sent out isn't exactly correct. - - No, Mr. Sulman that is one of our difficulties. We are not being reported correctly. - - Are you sure there is no motion? - - Yes, the only motions made were that we should hold two meetings for consultation on the suggestions thatwere presented at the last meeting and any others that might be made, one to be at the next regular meeting and one special next week when we hoped the Council would meet with us. And so the matter stands. The next meeting will certainly be a very difficult one. Of course Mr. Sulman will be in the chair. He is very suave and I don't know just how positive the women will be in the stand they take. To accomplish anything it may be necessary for the women to get busy and reorganize themain Association. Any 20 members can require the calling of a Special Meeting to consider amending Page 219 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe Constitution. And now I am tired sweetheart, kind of soul tired. So I am going to a lonely bed, lovingly Marion. Melbourne, 1915 April 28, Marion my darling, - I have been more or less in the dumps since the conference yesterday, it all seemed so hopeless. There did come out very plainly however the actual facts of the situation and I put my side of it straight if not effectively. The enemy went the limit also, even beyond I should say, but whatever were the chief's opinions in the end he did not give me the least mite of encouragement and in fact did convey the converse throughout.

When we went into the Albany Station for breakfast we saw his Ex. incog.

I shall even forgive you if I getno letters during your rush. Here everything is evidently just in the balance yet, I know absolutely nothing new. I did have a long talk with the editor of one of the papers yesterday afternoon, which was satisfactory but I am fully aware of the dominating policy of the Melbourne Press which is anti-Canberra of course first and last. The House probably has met today and possibly the ruling of the Government may become evident. Otherwise the Senate motion comes up tomorrow and then more problems as to what to say and not say. I am wondering whether it will be possible for me to leave tomorrow night. I cannot tell until I have seen Senator Grant at least and he evidently will not arrive from Sydney until tomorrow. Success and joy to you in the morning, Your loving Walter Walter darling, Am on my way to conference with Mrs. Holman. Got to the Circular Quay last night in time for the 8:15 ferry and found Genevieve and Roy on it. They had been to Manly.

The lawyer told Roy he'd better see [Note: J. Burcham] Clamp alone, that if a solicitor went along Clamp wouldn't say a word. Such nonsense. As if he's say a word to Roy if he went alone. Roy went to see him and is going to try to make him go along. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 59 (table of contents) ====] THE WOMBAT . Minister of Home Affairs [Note: William Oliver Archibald] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 60 ====] I'm afraid the lawyer doesn't want to get mixed up with an American client. Devotedly, Marion. Snaefell, Greenwich, 12 May 1915 - Dear Walter, Three more days and we shall have been here a year. You should be here so that we might fittingly celebrate the occasion (with tears and hisses and groans). We had our Town Planning meeting yesterday. I am sure we got results - greater than I should have thought possible. Mrs. Taylor [Note: Florence M. Taylor] is really a pathetic figure. She is like your friend Archie [Note: William Oliver Archibald]. (Minister of Home Affairs, called the Wombat by his pals. M.M.G.) Her caretaker ought not to let her out of his sight. I don't see how he is going to pull herout of this hole. I was very glad I had sent in notice of my motion for organization for the Agenda paper for it led them instead of sliding over things to come out and make a complete statement of the correspondence since the last meeting so we did not have to do that. As I told you, the women there are very far from being stupid and a number that I have never met or talked to rose to the occasion. A Mrs. Thomas got up immediately and inquired why the men should not take action on the motions we made.Mrs. Taylor told her the motion was entirely out of order, so unexpected, etc. She asked what there was out of order. \"It was not on the Agenda paper.\" To which I told Mrs. Thomas that so far as I knew the Agenda paper was entirely unofficial and therefore informal and that any motion from any member was quite in order. I hoped the matter would be followed up. Then I passed around my scheme of organization. Mrs. Taylor tried to stop me after I had read a sentence or two but of course I paid no attention to her, read through and explained as I went. Then made my motion that the next meeting should be a purely business meeting for the organization of the Section. Then we were lively for some fifteen minutes. Mrs. Thomas got up promptly with the remark that there was much of value in the suggestions and that as it was an important matter and that as only about half of our members [Note: Florence M. Taylor was an architect and engineer who was also interested in town planning. In 1907 she married George A. Taylor, also an architect and engineer, and together they founded a publishing company for trade and professional journals. She is considered Australia's first professional woman architect and was the first woman to fly a heavier-than-air craft, a glider designed by her husband, in Australia (1909).] Page 222 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 61 ====] were there these suggestions be sent to all the members with the understanding that it would be taken up at the next meeting. This as an amendment to my motion was passed. Her promptness saved the day forthen our secretary Mrs. Taylor got up and delivered a tirade. \"It was a pity that the valuable time of the meeting should be taken up by such silly stuff. It was entirely out of order.\" (It was in the order of the Agenda paper.) \"Such an outrage to thrust a great long mess of stuff on them so unexpectedly, etc.\" Then Miss Geach bobbed up. She certainly is all right and has a good head, ready to adjust herself to emergencies. She moved that we meet in two weeks for a preliminary discussion. The Taylor cohortshad had a lively whispered consultation during my reading. One now moved that the whole matter be dropped. Mrs. Thomas reminded them that her motion had been passed. Miss Geach reminded them that her motion was before the meeting and had been seconded. They then suggested that the men's Council should be asked to meet with us at that time. This was a substitute for the motion we had planned to have Miss Geach make and was entirely satisfactory, so it was passed. I enclose the agenda paper of theMen's council with notice of report of Women's Committee today. It came in the mail this morning. It is almost a pity you can't be there to witness this spicy report. I shall be deeply interested in the stand the man take at our joint meeting. Of course it is altogether probable that the men from motives of self interest would much prefer not to be under the inspection and interference of a bunch of disinterested women. I think however from what I have seen they will notfind the women entirely easy to manage. One of the ladies, a stranger to me, came up to me after our meeting and said \"they\" would find that a lot of brains had come into this club since the first meeting two months age. I said I hoped she would be at the joint meeting and she said she certainly [Note: ==== Beginning of page 62 ====] would. A number of others spoke to me in similar vein. One of the cohort, a Mrs. Clark, had said that stuff of mine was pure theory. She didn't see why they should bother with it. They showed themselvesso purely spiteful and personal that I think it had a very marked effect on the members as a whole. Am going to call on Mrs. Wade this afternoon so must now write my letters to Mrs. Mess and Mr. Melson (Chicago Clients). Wonder what sort of a hornet's nest they will stir up this week and if they will show their stripes as plainly as my hornets did. Beautiful days we are having right along now. You ought to come and live in Sydney. Hope the Grahams have told you to go ahead with working drawings. Your loving wife. Marion Dear Walter, I didn't tell you that Mrs. Holman said, \"What do those men mean by getting up there and talking all that dribble about lofty motives and Australia this and that. What do they think we are anyway.\" Also that after we were seated she said, \"Lets go into the other room where perhaps we can get a bit of carpet under our feet\" - so she too suffers from cold feet - that kind. Hope her chilblainsaren't as bad as mine. This afternoon I went to see Mrs. R.D. Hall at her husband's office, so I met the State's attorney himself, while another lady came whose name I couldn't understand. I'll call her X. She got quite heated about it Page 223 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoafter I had explained the requisition, thought no action ought to be taken except at the suggestion of the Secretary. Mrs. Holman said there was no secretary. X answered that it ought not to be brought up except at the next meeting. But there is nothing to meet said Mrs. Holman. But said X, a meeting hasbeen called for next Tuesday. If Mrs. Holman had any hesitation about signing, this woman's talk evidently decided her to do so for when X said there were two factions and she thought they ought to come together, she said that [Note: ==== Beginning of page 63 ====] was just the purpose of this requisition and walked off to sign it. X said she thought nothing ought to be done in an underhand way but overboard with which I entirely agreed. She is the only one I have runacross that has not been entirely in sympathy. So far as I can make out there is a very widespread opinion that the Town Planning Association is in the wrong hands and is being run for interested motives. I really think this is helping put you straight before the reputable element of Sydney. After that I went to Mrs. Milner's home. Her sister and Lady Lyne were there and I find Lady Lyne is a very pleasant and wide awake woman. Mrs. Milner said she had been inundated with petitions andpamphlets to which she had paid no attention. I had feared she was one of those who would wish to drop out. But all three signed very willingly. A number of names have been given to me and it looks as if we should have our 20 names by the end of the week. Miss Sulman called me up last night and asked me if I was going to the Citizens Association Thursday. I told her I was and she said she would be on the lookout for me there. I don't think her father gave hervery particular details of the meeting though the facts have been more or less in the papers. Mrs. Milner told me the Friday Evening News said, Mrs. Taylor got up and resigned but her husband grabbed her and said, \"Don't do that,\" and she sat down. The women as a whole are quite resentful of being made fools of and do not as a whole seem inclined to lie down under it. And there seems to be a feeling that they ought to be taking part in governmental work. Maybe they'll take a hold of things yet and makesome fur fly. Politics is very fatiguing so I am going to bed. Got your letter this afternoon. So glad you got a berth. Your lovingest wife, Marion. Snaefell, New South Wales - 18 May 1915 - Dear Walter, The plot thickens. At about six o'clock this evening Mr. Taylor [Note: George A. Taylor] called me up and in the most dictatorial tone conceivable (I'm sure the Great Panjan [Note: Panjandrum] never spoke with [Note: ==== Beginning of page 64 (table of contents) ====] COMSTOCK DWELLING . SYDNEY [Note: The structure is the A.C. Cameron House in Killara, New South Wales, Australia.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 65 ====] Page 224 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagogreater assurance of implicit obedience) said, \"When are you coming down town?\" Your humble wife answered - I don't think I shall be down this week. T. - Are you coming down tomorrow?Me. I think I'll not be down this week. Will next week be all right? T. Nawh - I want you to rescind that motion of yours for a meeting next week. Me. That was not my motion. T. We-e-el, that is your scheme of organization and I (I wish I could make that \"I\" about four times that size) want you to recall it. When will you be down? Me. Do you want to come out to see me? T. O, I suppose I might come out. I have a slight cold but I suppose I can come out !!!!!!! Me. When will you be out? (of course always in the most hospitable tones) T. I'll run out tonight. Me. Alright Mr. Taylor.Then I went into the sitting room and told Roy and Genevieve that they must not leave the room while T. was here and we began to try to think of pleasant and noncontroversial topics of conversation. Couldn't talk about the war of course. Couldn't mention the U.S.A. Couldn't talk about you. We finally decided that the only safe subject would be the expected baby. So we were going to ask him whether he thought Alstan a better name for a boy or a girl, and since that was the only name we had been able todecide on, what would he advise us to do if it were twins. We toted the couch and drafting board out of the hall, leaving the horses which, with the drawer upside down, made a very handsome coat rack, and Roy brought his brand new velvet hat and his coat and laid them on it so that the purpose of this mysterious looking piece of furniture might be recognized at a glance. The big table in the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 66 ====] living room looks very library-y with a brown cover over it and the vase of chrysanthemums on it. We lighted the lights in all the rooms so that he could glimpse our new sideboard and Genevieve's handsome dresser. Then the telephone rang again. I answered. It was Mrs. Taylor this time and I really ought not to have hung up the receiver while she was still talking but I did. It was a pity because I missed a valuablehuman document in so doing. Of course they used the telephone so as to have no witnesses. The Page 225 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofollowing I cannot possibly do justice to. Mrs. T.- Now about this matter of organization, we want you to recall your motion. We don't want any confusion. Several of the ladies have been to me about it. We want to maintain our womanliness. We want to spare you any humiliation. We can. A number of the ladies have spoken to me about it. The men decided your motion was all out of order. Me.- Is Mr. Taylor coming over this evening? Mrs. T.- Why, no he can't come over there. You know I made you vice-president. Me.- Oh, did you?Mrs. T.- Yes I made you vice-president. Me.- Oh. Mrs. T.- Yes I made you vice-president you know and we hope you will have the decency to resign. You were made vice-president not because of your popularity. I suppose you know that. But you - Here I hung up the receiver. A pity too because of course I know she made me vice-president (an interesting confession of the truth of Mrs. Rutter's statement) because of the advertising value of Walter Burley Griffin's name, and it would have been interesting to hear just how she would put it. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 67 ====] While I was still writing this the telephone rang again. Genevieve went to find out who it was and if it were the T's say I couldn't come to the phone just now. Would they leave a message? But it was Miss Sulman to say that if I was going to be at home she and her father would like to come over in theafternoon. I told her I was delighted and tried to get them to stay to dinner but they are coming earlier. They know you are not here. I bet Taylor called him up to get him to take me in hand. Anyhow he is the president of the Town Planning Association and I shall ask him what report was made to the association. I told Miss Sulman I'd be glad to have a talk with her father and I know they will expect me to bring up the subject. I shall leave out all the spice and make no personal remarks but if he wants thefacts of our last meeting I'll give them to him still without spice, and without using any names except those who made the motions. He probably knows he can't get facts from the Taylors, and I shall ask him if the council is going to hold a joint meeting with us as we asked. Off to bed now. Playing the game with Australians is some sport if you look at it that way. I hope you told Mr. J.A.S. [Note: James Alexander Smith?] I love him. It's good to find one person in a countryyou can love. Lovingly, Marion. 20 May [Note: 1915] - Dear Walter, I didn't tell you that in talking about the Melbourne matter Mr. Sulman told me that they were planning to have some one of them go down to do what they could for you before the Works Committee. He didn't know whether it would be himself or Taylor. I would hate to think he would be guilty of a deliberate veiled threat like that but he certainly laid himself open to Page 226 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosuspicion. I told him that it was not yet decided that the plan should be laid before the Works Committee. He said he thought that had been settled. (Of course it never was laid before the Works Committee. M.M.G.) I am much encouraged by the fact that this morning a Mrs. Cooper called me up. I don't know who she is but she wanted to say she hoped I wasn't going to recall my motion. She lives out in Coogee. (Evidently McCauley has been spreading that statement abroad.) [Note: ==== Beginning of page 68 ====] She is another we can count on not being willing to lie down and be walked over. Must rush this to the Post Office if it is to go on this afternoon's mail. Lovingly, Marion. Snaefell, 25 May, 1915 - Dear Walter. Couldn't get away even in time to see you off, at the railroad station. Got into town at eight ten and caught the eight thirty ferry. Mr. and Mrs. Cooper are both very pleasant and direct people. We met them at that dinner at Mrs. McCauley's when we were at Coogee. They didn't hesitate to express themselves very frankly about the Taylors and the McCauley Hyman bunch. They got right down to business to find out the facts, for as Mrs. Cooper said she didn't carewhat she said. She just wanted to be sure of her ground. She learned what was brewing at the meeting of the delegation of the women for tree planting at Randwick at which meeting the Randwick branch was formed. They were told there that Mrs. Griffin was trying to run them into an American scheme. \"Why,\" said Mrs. Taylor, \"that's a verbatim copy of the Hull House constitution.\" [Note: Handwritten phrase follows:] which I had never seen nor probably had she. As Mrs. Cooper said, \"What if it was!\" Mrs. Hyman told Mrs. Cooper they thought I ought to resign. \"Nonsense,\" said Mrs. Cooper. \"She ought to be president. She's got the brains to wipe up the floor with the rest of that whole bunch.\" Mr. Cooper is going to join the Town Planning Association so that if the matter is referred to a Special Meeting of the members he can be on hand to help his wife. She is entirely ready to bring up the points. She said Mrs. Lee Brown was in sympathy with our attempt toorganize but had told her that she had been told there was going to be a big fight and thought she wouldn't come to this meeting. Mrs. Cooper told her she ought to come if she did nothing more than cast a vote. Said she would try to see that she came. I'll leave this letter open to add a PS, after the meeting this P.M. before I mail it, that you may know I'm still alive. I don't think it will be necessary for me to say a word. Roy got your roll of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 69 ====] drawings from the railroad office. You must be sure to ask your porter if you see him if he was the one who found them. Roy says he saw some clippings about a theatre Brown is going to build. More cause for Clamp's [Note: J. Burcham Clamp's] hurry. From what I could make out over the phone, though it istroublesome, they can fix the Town Hall for a lantern for my lecture. I am to see Miss Valentine at 4 tomorrow to talk it all over. I got the candies you left and devoured most of it before I turned in. Marion. Page 227 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoSnaefell - 25 May [Note: 1915] - Dear Walter, The boat is a day late so we don't get our mail till tomorrow or probably the next morning. In the excitement of this afternoon I forgot to mail my letter to you. Five of us went to the Civil Service for tea after, and then Miss Geach and I went to the quaytogether and just caught a ferry. It is impossible to do justice to this afternoon's meeting and it now only remains to wipe the scandal of the central organization out as completely. I don't know whether the women will want to take the trouble to do that or not. We are going to try them on a motion for a Special meeting of the Central Association. Today it was Mrs. Holman, wife of the Prime Minister [Note: Premier] of New South Wales who brought things to a crisis. Mr. Sulman took the chair, dismissed my case with a word, said Mr. Taylor would explain matters to us. He got up and told us how undesirable it would be to look to Canada or the United States for inspiration in Town Planning questions, told us how many great Town Planning experts there were in the Council, your name not being on the list, and how phenomenally successful was the work of the Women's Committee. When he got through Mrs. Holman rose looking her stunningest and said she really didn't know what kind of an association this was, that she had been asked to preside, and notices to that effect had been sent out, but that when she comes she finds that someone else takes the chair, no explanation is made to her, and she doesn't knew what is going on. That she is a very busy woman, too busy to have her time taken in such a way and that she resigned her office. A deadly silence fell on [Note: ==== Beginning of page 70 ====] the meeting as she left the room. The men, consisting by the way of Sulman, Taylor, O'Carrol and Major Stowe, certainly did look abashed. Could you have imagined they would have been so stupid as to have tried to handle Mrs. Holman so crudely. I immediately rose and said that considering the stand Mrs. Holman had taken I thought the thing to do was for all the officers to resign that an election might take place under circumstances that could beclearly understood so that no misunderstandings could arise. I therefore resigned my office. Taylor and Hyman followed suit. McCauley wasn't there. So what I didn't dream could be accomplished was done and there are no officers of the Town Planning Association women's branch. Several of the ladies were out in the hall with Mrs. Holman. They motioned me to come out. \"What's all this about,\" said Mrs. Holman. \"It's a scandal,\" I said, \"and I'm deeply grateful to you for opening the way out.\" \"Well good,\"she said. I returned and the discussion that followed was lively. After some five minutes Mrs. Milner slipped in at my side and asked if she could propose my name as a member of the Women's National Association. I said I should be proud to have her do so. She said I would be in my proper place there, that \"those people\" were utterly impossible. It would take a long time to report the afternoon's performance but the gist of it was that Mrs. Chris Thomas, Miss Geach and Mrs. Copper asked a lot of very pertinent questions and made a number of direct remarks and if those men felt as foolish as they looked they could not have had a very comfortable time. The ladies made it clear that they did not intend to stand for being pulled around by the nose like a Page 228 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobunch of children as Mrs. Thomas put it, that if they were not a Branch but a Committee as the men put it, saying they could not have Presidents and vice-presidents, that the constitution did not provide for Committees except of Council members and therefore the motion of the Council forming us was out oforder, that to have an organization of two hundred or so members with one hundred women without [Note: ==== Beginning of page 71 ====] representation was not fair and that it was desirable to have some amendment of the Constitution and that it was desirable that the suggestions for organization made should be considered. Before the meeting Sulman came to me and said - Then I am to say that you recall your motion. No, I said, I had told him before that it was the motion of Miss Geach and Mrs. Thomas. When he opened themeeting he said - the notice says there is a motion of Mrs. Griffin's to be considered. Is that the case Mrs. Griffin? I got up and said that the motion I had made had not been seconded nor passed and that therefore I did not have a motion before the meeting. On the spur of the moment, since I knew the facts, I left it there instead of explaining that I had accepted Mrs. Thomas's modification. It later exposed their duplicity but at the time it flabbergasted Mrs. Thomas. But the fact that my suggestion had been informaland that the motion had been made by Mrs. Thomas was stated in the minutes which Mr. Sulman read a little later. Toward the end of the meeting when questioned by the women as to why the matter for which this meeting had been called had not been taken up he said again that I said I had no motion therefore there was no special business. Then I got up and said that was misrepresentation as I had told Mr. Sulman of the status of my motion and of Mrs. Thomas and Miss Geach whose motion as recordedin the minutes was the business of this meeting. I think that cleared me with Mrs. Thomas. Major Stowe made quite a speech saying what valuable work the women were doing in the matter of wash tubs with which he had come to have an appreciative feeling since he had been in military service - at which several ladies snickered - that it was foolish for us to bother our heads with matters of legislation, that was for the future, that he must say that some suggestions that had been made made himsick. Mrs. Thomas after the meeting asked him what it was that had made him sick. She also asked Mr. Sulman if they had had any legal advice and suggested it might be well for them to get a few legal minds on their council. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 72 ====] Dear Walter - Had a good talk with Mrs. Holman yesterday. Apparently she has no intention of rescinding her resignation though Mr. Fitzgerald had been to her and asked that, as a special favor to him, she would. She told him that she couldn't see how, personal feeling aside, she could subject her husband's office (Mr. Holman, Premier of the state of New South Wales) to such hazards whether they arose from malice or ignorance. She approves of taking the matter to a Special Meeting and gave meseveral names to take the requisition to. When I said I thought Mr. Sulman would be relieved if we women pushed the thing through and got the central body out of the rut, she lifted her eyebrow and said \"Do you think so?\" Page 229 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoShe says that they have been full of explanations since, the stories don't sound good to her. Mr. Sulman had profusely apologized but Mrs. Taylor had said to her that coming up on the train she had told Mr. Sulman that Mrs. Holman ought to preside but Mr. Sulman had said no he must preside. They are so stupid they give themselves away ridiculously. This afternoon I am going to see Mrs. D.R. Hall, wife of the attorney general and Mrs. Millner. I have sent the bookcover off to the printers. Lovingly, Marion. Well we got the 20 signatures. A general meeting was called and the society was reorganized. 22 July 1915 - Dear Walter, Received a letter from Mr. Sulman today with the apology of the Town Planning Association council and enclosing apology from Stowe. Could not ask for a nicer letter from Council though it is easy to guess their feelings. I have answered that I was very glad indeed to receive the letter from him and the enclosure from Major Stowe. Thanking him for his courtesy. Mrs. Weston called me up saying she had heard of Stowe's letter. Said she had been talking it all over with her husband who utterly condemned the things they were doing and considered them very serious. Said sheappreciated that if it hadn't been for me they wouldn't have realized the sort of hands they had fallen into. Asked me to [Note: ==== Beginning of page 73 (table of contents) ====] CAFE AUSTRALIA .

I hope not as it interferes with the scheme. Copy of Mr. Sulman's letter and the one of Major Stowe he enclosed:- Dear Mrs. Griffin, By a letter from Mrs. Cooper which I read to the Council of the Association yesterday and by the admission of the Honorary Treasurer, it appears that Major Stowe returned your subscription as a member. In connection therewith the following resolution was carried and I was asked to forward the came to you. \"That this Council conveys to Mrs. Cooper and Mrs. Burley Griffin the apology of the Council for the unauthorized action of the Honorary Treasurer as set out in his letters to them dated July 15th andinforms them that this Association welcomes their membership and regrets exceedingly the pain caused to then by this action.\" The above will show the feeling of the Council on the matter and I trust that any annoyance you may have felt will be allayed and your co-operation in the work of the Association assured. Yours sincerely, John Sulman President. Dear madam, It has been pointed out to me by the Council of the Town Planning Association that in my letter to you of July 15th I had no authority to write as I did, and I therefore apologize to you for the same and for the remarks therein which I much regret. Yours faithfully, F. Ernest Stowe. Yesterday I expected to be a terribly trying day but it turned out to be a very delightful one. I went into it blind. Some days ago Mrs. Wallace, a reporter, told me the man she had introduced me to some weeks age at the Town Planning meeting at the Botanic Gardens would like to further the acquaintance and hadasked her to ask me to take an excursion [Note: ==== Beginning of page 75 (table of contents) ====] CAFE AUSTRALIA . PORT PHILLIP FIG [Note: ==== Beginning of page 76a ====] with them. He is the one who stole a flower for me and I understood at that time that he was a reporter recently out from England and planning to return. So I expected to be quizzed for copy. But nothing of the kind happened. He is an old bachelor and is writing historical accounts of early Australia, etc., and was a very pleasant host. The trip was for all day to Pittwater where he has a lot on which he is postponing building because of the war. He took us about in a launch. A perfectly beautiful body of Page 231 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowater. There were occasional showers with the lights continually changing from mist to sunshine, a really miraculous day to the eye. I know he wants to meet you so I told him I would try to get him over to the house as soon as I could catch you. He suggested several walks which he said he would gladlyguide us on any time we called him up. Must scurry this over to the Post Office. A letter from Byrne [Note: Barry Byrne] with the New Mexico University survey and saying they have to begin building in six months. Am afraid you'll have to quit your slothful ways and get busy. Devotedly, Marion. Melbourne, July [Note: 1915] - Dearest Marion, My session with the Works Committee et al. did not amount to much and I must see them again next Tuesday afternoon. They are seeking some way to haveme cooperate with the Department [Note: of Home Affairs?] which, though I can't say so, I must somehow demonstrate to be impossible as of course we are forced to realize. Tonight I dine with George Elgh (who had helped us with the drafting of the Federal Capital Drawings in Chicago M.M.G.) and his wife (who were now in Australia). I have been driven from pillar to post to keep up with the demands this week and have to keep it up through Saturday to satisfy our Cafe clientswho of course are in an awful hurry whereas the Works Committee is pressing on the other hand. I got your telegram and shall bring the photos which I hope will be in time. I don't dare post them for they may get left altogether. Lovingly yours, Walter. Walter me darlint, Was so relieved to get your telegram.

The town planner made use of this by making its face sightly with rock and plantings and designed thegroup of 3 dwellings to stand on the top of this precipice making this vista from the valley sightly and attractive, harmonious with the rest of the group, and giving the houses a raking view of the valley. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 80 ====] THE OPENING OF THE CAFE AUSTRALIA by a Melbourne paper's reporter The opening of The Australia, Mr. Lucas' [Note: A(ntony) J(ohn) J(ereus) Lucas'] new cafe, the first example in Melbourne of the work of Walter Burley Griffin, the Director of Design and Construction of the Federal Capital, is arousing great interest and is giving people an inkling of the fact that interest in architecture need not be limited to the technically initiated but can give real joy to everyone as music does. It will help the average citizen to realize that his Federal Capital may afford him the same sort of intense personal pleasure as he would get from a concert and be not merely a thing for abstract pridebased on the opinion dictated to him by a cult which he has been taught that he must respect, why he knows not. The problem - a cafe - calls for the arresting of the attention of the passer-by, and this one certainly does it. In the midst of the dull tints of the business buildings of the street, the clear positive tones arrest the eye - green pearl granite, black like the purple grackle's plumage, and in the same way - with iridescenttints - really a porphyry rather than a granite, which more than one passer-by stops to touch wondering just what it is; taking a polish which is permanent as no black marble could be when so exposed; recessed fillets of Delft tile, gold burned on, arched over by a fanciful square arch of white quartz granite whose pointed voussoirs extend through the vaulted vestibule the center one becoming the lighting fixture of the entrance. These materials set the key-note for the color scheme of the whole ingold and ivory, a quiet though rich background for all colors whether in floral decoration or in ladies' costume. Undoubtedly the handsomest cafe in Australia, it calls forth constant expression of pleasure as - \"My word, it is beautiful,\" or \"I feel as if I had rubbed Aladdin's lamp.\" And eyes, instead of being turned to the food before one, are everywhere fixed on [Note: ==== Beginning of page 81 (table of contents) ====] CAFE AUSTRALIA ENTRANCE . BLACK PORPHYRY & DELFT GOLD TILE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 82 ====] Page 233 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosome charming effect before one. Everywhere the question is asked - \"What style is it?\" As the work is not imitative but simply a direct solution of the problem in hand there is, of course, no answer except that it is modern Australian architecture, for style is purely an historical question and cannot bedetermined till after the lapse of time when, looking back, relationship can be established. On entering the luxurious lobby with its comfortable leather couches, the imagination is immediately appealed to by glimpses, through fern room and fountain court, to the main dining room beyond and there is no difficulty whatever in getting patrons through to the farthest tables as always one wants to go on a bit to see more completely an attraction which the eye catches yet further on. The fulfillment of the basic principle of architecture - the conservation of rhythm - is not only met but is sensed by those of an analytical turn of mind:- \"The surprising thing about this place is how big it looks. When you pace it off you find the distances are not great, but it seems so spacious!\" This is accomplished not only by illusiveness of form and scale but by most careful selection of color values, soft ivories to rich ambers glowing yet restful. Mr. Griffin has found most sympathetic assistance in the artists of Melbourne whose mural decorations by Bertha Merfield [Note: 1869-1921] ca. 1861-1930] are delightfully harmonious and exquisite supplements to the architectural treatment. It would be hard to find anywhere more charming unifying of sculpture with architecture than in the three groups forming the great structural piers at the foot of the grand staircase in the central promenade. MissMargaret Baskerville has leaped to her task with a spirit free and alive, with a mastery of her technique that leads her [Note: ==== Beginning of page 83 (table of contents) ====] RESTAURANT STAIRWAY TO BALCONY OF BANQUET HALL [Note: ==== Beginning of page 83b ====] The Cafe Australia occupies the whole ground floor of one of the old buildings of Melbourne which has a light court above the ground floor enabling a considerable part of the Cafe to be illuminated by daylight through patterned glass in the ceiling. All partitions were torn out [Note: of] the superstructure of the upper stories becoming heavy beams resting on huge highly ornamented piers. The result is spectacular. [Note: This page is not in the Art Institute of Chicago copy and is transcribed from the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 84 ====] Page 234 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: Continued from page 82] without a moment's hesitation to destroy her work if it has not met the architectural requirements absolutely, satisfied with nothing short of perfection. She has produced a group of girlish figures -Persephone, Echo and Daphne of exquisite freshness and spirit. Anyway perhaps it takes a woman to model a woman. FOUNTAIN COURT The motif in these piers is illusive again. Under the projecting light shelf of each of these piers is the single figure stepping lightly through a field of grain with a background of tree foliage - the orange, thealmond, the cherry - which foliage is apparently carried through to the opposite side, facing the fountain court where the tree itself becomes the motif of the panel and forms a rich decoration balancing the figures opposite. The architectural motifs carried throughout are the triangle, the circle and the thorny vine. Used in piers where the conventional cap has been entirely abolished, the decoration is carried the full length of thepier - very rich in effect. From Lobby to Fern Room - and in Australia one can use the most superb of all its forms - the tree fern varying in heights from five to fifteen feet - for decoration, invited by the glow of sun-light filtered through the ceiling glass of varying tints of amber, the eye is arrested by two unique sculptured landscapes, high reliefs on either side of a structural pier, the Port Phillip fig tree of the MelbourneHarbor, by Charles Costerman, and the Port Jackson ti-tree of the Sydney Harbor, by Marion M. Griffin, typifying their most characteristic arboreal forms, the Port Phillip fig, a superb tree clinging by its huge roots to the edge of the precipitous bluff, and the Port Jackson ti-tree, wind blown with their curious twisted weird tangle of trunks. On to the Fern room, the ceiling light a continuation of that of the Fountain court but enriched with angular pattern of greens in geometric leaf forms.

It is certainly unique. It introduced Griffin to Australia because it was the first completed work of his over there. It occupied the ground floor of a down town building under the light well of the building and consisted of Page 235 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofive rooms separated not by walls but by great piers which carried the structure of the building above. It is lighted in part by the open vaulted grill under the light well and partly by stained glass ceiling panels screening electric lamps. The tiles used are real gold delft tiles brought from Holland. The sculpture wasdone by Miss Baskerville of Melbourne and the mural decoration by Miss Merfield of Melbourne.] [Note: This page is not in the Art Institute of Chicago copy and is transcribed from the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 86 ====] [Note: Continued from page 84] partitions but piers only, of gold Delft tile this time, enclosing four pools for gold fish with fountain spray lighted by a clever device throwing ever-varying prismatic lights glowing in the water and reflecting in the gold tile, the whole set in boxes of growing flowers and surrounded by greenery. To one side of these rooms is the grand staircase leading to the balcony of the Dining Hall. Here the motive of the piers is used for newel posts surmounted by great bowls of palms and flowers and drooping vines. The day lighting of all the rooms is through ceilings of glazed and molded perforated pattern. The artificial lighting is indirect, concealed in the broad light shelf which forms the strong line connecting all the rooms. In the Dining Hall it is developed into a balcony richly decorated with a series of light standards rising from it forming flamboyant light fixtures pierced just enough to direct light to penetrate and give a jeweled effect. BANQUET HALL A great semi-circular vault formed of open tracery spans the room. This great airy sunny room, cozy in spite of its size because of the balcony with its alcoves below formed by the supporting piers with their gay caps, is by far the most attractive dining room in Melbourne or even Australia. MURALMiss Merfield's mural forms an essential element in the decoration, representing dawn in the Australian bush - tall Eucalyptus trees with their gleaming foliage shimmering against the mists rising in the valley, with the distant mountains - the vivid golden blue sky for which Australia is noted. [Note: This paragraph is entirely handwritten.] The charm of the whole is added to by the remarkable acoustic properties of the rooms. Mr. Lucas'sdaughters themselves, all musicians, see to at that the music itself is attractive and centrally placed. It is heard in all parts with a purity of tone that is very noticeable.

The illustration is not listed in the table of contents.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 88 ====] Griffin's private office was always very busy. He had contractual right with the government to give half his time to his private practice. It seemed the last straw when, although Canberra was absorbing the whole of his days and more, he took on the job of remodeling the interior of one of the city' buildings on Collins Street for Mr. Lucas who afterward became the Greek Consul-General in Australia. Mr. Lucas and his wife were making a good living in the restaurant business but the class of his work was totallytransformed by the Character of this Cafe Australia for the beauty obtained through the dignity and richness of design rather than the expenditure of large sums woke up Melbourne; and the elite of the city, including Dame Melba [Note: Nellie Melba, noted Australian-born soprano], not only came to the opening banquet but became habitues. It was the first step in the transformation of the dingy Australian housing of these daily necessities of life. Thus does architecture influence the whole character of acommunity quite apart from its influence as architect on fellow architects. The other cafes were naturally losing their custom to Mr. Lucas. Mr. Lucas expressed his appreciation by thanking Mr. Griffin and saying he had made a \"gentleman\" of him. A true gentleman Mr. Lucas had always been from the American point of view. The great banquet hall, with balconies supported by gold tile columns terminating six feet above the balcony rail in concrete lanterns for indirect lighting, is a barrel vaulted room the ceiling of which is wholly open plaster screen through the pattern of which the daylight pours and at night the semi-indirect lighting of this room is terminated by a beautiful mural decoration by Bertha Merfield whose motif was the gum trees in the gully with a wonderful mist and cloud effect so characteristic of Australia. The whole room is keyed high with colors of gold and orange so that Miss Baskerville brought into theoffices one day a sprig of the blossom of the Cotyledon so decorative in form and color, sure that she had found the motif on which the design had been based. But a designer does not work directly, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 89 (table of contents)\" shows Daphne and Echo; Persephone will be found on page 87.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 90 ====] imitatively, from nature. From his love of nature he has learned and uses its principles and its luxuriance. She is the sculptress who did the three lovely Greek figures - Daphne, Echo, & Persephone - in full relief on the three heavy piers which one faces as he comes down the grand stairway from the balcony. These could hold their own in any comparison with Greek work of this type, each of these Page 237 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagolovely beings stepping forth from the grains which suggest, the function of the Cafe. I had given her the motifs we desired for these three figures. The Center one was Echo, blowing her horn. When I went over to her studio to see the progress on this one I found to my consternation that she had not moldedher facing directly forward as I had sketched but for the sake of grace had turned her body slightly. The work was so far advanced that I could hardly bring myself to raise objections but since I was responsible to Mr. Griffin in this matter I overcame my shyness and explained how from an architectural point or view this central figure, directly opposite the stairway, must be markedly different from Daphne and Persephone on either side and must be running straight forward toward thedescending patrons. She saw the point and without a qualm ripped out the figure and built her up anew. The way in which these two fine artists worked with the architect and the delight they took in doing so showed what our civilization could accomplish if it were not under the heel of that devil, SECURITY so worshipped by our present cowardly civilization. On the reverse side of these piers, facing the lunch room, Miss Baskerville did three fruit trees in high relief, extremely interesting and charming. This room is lighted through patterned glass in color and is divided from the entrance lounge by a fountain basin, again between two of the heavy gold tile piers, real Dutch gold tile, beyond which is another pier with the Port Jackson fig tree in high relief on one side and the characteristic tree of the Sydney Harbor, on the other side, the Leptospermun, that most picturesque ti-tree whose twisted trunks, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 91 (table of contents) ====] BANQUET HALL .

This latter I did myself and it has always been one of my pet babies. So we were well rewarded for the agonizing days and months when I had to stand as mediator between Mr. Griffin who, as designer, had of course to make all decisions, and the office force. We two couldget together only at night when I could put before him each issue and get his instructions and designs for carrying on the work. And then the task of getting decisions from Mr. Lucas! How could he be expected to understand what was being put before him? I remember the last struggle to get the authority to put the whole thing in hand. We had dinner at his cafe and had talked till after midnight when be said, \"Well go ahead.\" We went home and Mr. Griffin immediately went to the telephone and called up thecontractor, told him to have material on hand and work started early the next morning. The contractor, knowing the nature of some of the struggles for decisions, did as told and materials were being piled up and work was in hand by six o'clock in the morning which was well since by ten o'clock Mr. Lucas was Page 238 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoringing Mr. Griffin to say he did not think he could go on with the work. As you have seen, in the end he was well satisfied. It was in fact his natural temperament to be frightened in the making of a decision. But he was not an Anglo Saxon so was able to appreciate beauty as it developed. He became one of Mr.Griffin's continual clients.

[Note: ==== Beginning of page 95 ====] Page 95 CAPTIONIn Emory Hills [Note: Wheaton, Illinois], a development of 20 acres into nine small farms of various areas, the problem was to afford the maximum opportunity to Chicago commuters at a distance of 28 miles from the city to make use of their limited hours of freedom in a more substantial form of recreation than mere pleasure seeking. Under such conditions farming is properly an intensive craft and not another species of executive distraction to add to those of the organizations with which these commuters Page 239 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoare identified in the city itself. The prime objects in the scheme of this group is then the maximum of convenience for the work of each plot for a minimum of expense in equipment and help, utilizing the various modern public services obtainable from the town with which it is connected. However, healthand enjoyment of mind and body before pecuniary profits are objectives demanding natural rural attractiveness. Broadways are run in easy sweeps with the sharper curvatures concealing the steeper ascents. Tangential intersections permit narrow traffic ways with easy turns at the same time affording frequent wooded park spaces, preserving the rural character, offering shelter, diversifying the views, increasingthe floral variety and adding means for passing or turning vehicles. The plot in the south east corner is given over for children. [Note: ==== Beginning of page [95-2] ====] CAPTION .

The advantages of placing each building in a direction parallel to its lot and park frontage is that this arrangement gives maximum benefit of the best views. Staggering the structures themselves opens prospects still further to the extent of at least one and generally the two additional sides for each house. All will benefit not only from the open campus and courts for rest and recreation free from vehicular traffic and danger but also will enjoy lane approaches which, ample for vehicles, are sequestered and domesticated in relation to the through lines of traffic of the city by terminal parks set off with evergreen plantings and reflecting pool.

HILLSIDE CANBERRA THE PROPOSED NEW FEDERAL CAPITAL OF AUSTRALIAby The Architectural Review - 1913 In the fall of 1910 the Commonwealth of Australia prepared to invite competitive designs for laying out a proposed new Federal Capital City at Canberra, a naturally beautiful site selected in New South Wales, requiring locations for a vice-regal residence, Capitol and Parliamentary buildings, public offices, university, station, citadel and military barracks; residential, municipal, market and manufacturingcenters, and other groups of public and private buildings, as well as possible locations for particular Page 240 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagointerests and trades properly disposed within the city area. The site lies in a valley between three hills of considerable elevation - \"Ainslie,\" \"Black Mountain,\" and \"Mugga-Mugga,\" - with the peak of Bimberi importantly dominating the landscape thirty miles awayand nearly south of the city. A portion of the valley is occupied by waterways that have been partially formalized and adapted to the purposes of Mr. Griffin's plan by some retaining dikes, used also as avenues of connection. Reference to the detailed plan shows how the series of hexagonal and octagonal units give convenient relation between the various parts of the city. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 97 (table of contents) ====] A MAJOR HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT . GOVERNMENT GROUP [Note: The illustration represents part of the plan for Canberra.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 98 ====] The long vista of government and municipal buildings is on the axis established by Mount Ainslie at the north east and Bimberi Peak at the southwest. The vista along the waterway cuts across this axis at rightangles - from Black Mountain at the northwest to Lake Park on the southeast. To the north are located the agricultural suburbs, with a market center and military group east of the central basin - which, on its northern side, is bordered by the museums and Public Gardens - to balance the university and municipal centers in a corresponding location on the west. Directly north are the manufacturing suburbs and railway yards; and the principal residential center is between Mugga-Mugga and Black Mountain, at thewest of the Capitol building. It is easy to realize how well the plan has been adapted to the natural features of the site. The forested ranges and distant snow-covered peaks to the south and west provide a panoramic background; the three local mountains within the city, which have been retained in their natural state, as well as the lesser hills, utilized as sites for the important groups, all end thoroughfare vistas, - while the needed waterways have been utilized to increase the architectural effect of theprincipal groups - and the flatter valleys or plateaus have been retained for industrial or residential purposes. The principal water-basin, the \"Molonglo,\" near Black Mountain Reservation, remains in its present wild state; the more formal basins being shut off by the dam and roadway that flood the large central basin, utilized for equalizing the conditions of humidity in the city, and for architectural effect. The plan is dominated by those considerations of space that rendered Paris and Washington so impressively effective, and were also peculiarly adaptable to the large scale and natural grandeur of the selected site; while permitting the more important buildings to be correspondingly large in scale in the areas they cover - thus providing adequate floor space without extending the buildings to an undue and disproportionate height.

The Parliamentary buildings occupy a lower-lying plateau, below which may still be seen the next lower terrace, with the water-front along the Public Gardens and the vista along the broad plaisanceto the Casino and Ainslie at its opposite end. The Parliament plateau is 40 feet above the courtyard below, which in turn lies 25 feet above the lowest terrace, along the water frontage. Adopting the adjacent mountains as focal points of the plan makes them inversely the best positions from which to view the city; as in the general perspective view of the site looking from Ainslie directly southward towards the Capitol building along the more important axis.

Otherwise the texts of the two copies are comparable.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 100 ====] PLANNING FOR ECONOMY WALTER BURLEY GRIFFIN Of course, all planning being such, this paper can only direct attention to certain features not always recognized. This subject, however, is not so trite as it should be, and would be, were it not for very many persistent and prevailing notions set arbitrarily by general governmental practice and immediately by the dominant military standards superimposed upon the already heavy load of habits and fixed ideasthat have extended unsuitable and obsolete practice from generation to generation. The present cry for economy, if made and taken seriously, and understood, would not, to a town planner's mind, be a matter for regret, but of promise, and would point the way to sloughing off many impediments that otherwise are likely to bring us down in the end. Really it cannot then mean general parsimony, but a launching out in new and greater undertakings than ever, when we begin to realizewhat superfluous and futile effort has so far engaged us and absorbed the investment of our stupendous output and prevented our benefiting from the technical knowledge and mechanical powers we have been so busily accumulating, and as busily applying blindly with no comprehensive sense of economy and, therefore, little or no ultimate or tangible good in time of peace, and only infinite harm in war. In civil work, as opposed to military operation, what could be the alternative to planning for economy in its broadest sense? Our duty was once said to be to direct the great sources of power in nature to the use and convenience of man, but it has since been pointed that it is now fully as much our function as planners, as engineers, to determine what not to do, what not to construct, in order best to meet the use and convenience of man; that is to relieve him of the burdens of improper or superadaption [Note: improper superadaptation?] of nature, that a civilization may be making worse even than theunder-development of primitive and simple life. The expenditures at Canberra were an instance of exceptional precocity in painting the lily. Page 242 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 101 ====] When we find the civilized world now able to throw away each day \u00a325,000,000 of current earnings (not past or future) in working the destruction of its own life and previously accrued properties, and when we realize how hard it has been for the average man to earn comfort, is it not evident that realeconomy is to be sought, not in the old ways of investment of such sums in adding more and still more gain to the waste, but rather to find how, in peace, to stop frittering away such possible surplus without tangible benefit in ways that do not make living better or easier on the whole; to learn how hereafter the possible benefits from such an output may be adapted to secure real welfare? In the narrow fields of industrial competitive enterprises the quantitative mind is already demonstrating ascendancy over the qualitative - as, for instance, in economizing effort in certain phases of industrial management, shop practice; yet the ultimate result may be nil if the thing accomplished is not a means to the general betterment. I am convinced that half that study applied to the simple workshop of every house would release half humanity of half its burdens; but time is lacking to get into that study here. There is as yet, however, little evidence of any definite progress toward deliberately conserving effortsor resources in systematizing such comprehensive undertakings as our communities, cities or countries which comprise and control the whole of modern investment. We should be aware that, at the root of the many fundamental difficulties of distribution - such as, for instance, the wasteful distances over idle valuable areas to a remote and difficult margin of cultivation - lie in the current conceptions of political economy and the scope of the state; but these must be passedover, for the proper concern of this Conference is only in an intermediate physical stage of development; as a body we progress through object lessons. The examples of greatest value, because of widest application, can be sought perhaps in the disposition of and accommodation for our [Note: ==== Beginning of page 102 ====] every enterprise and service, all rapidly expanding, and chiefly in the cities. This is town planning. Of pictures, of literary enthusiasms, of theories, we have heard a great deal in the town planning movement, but with very small resultant improvement, partly because we are habitually floating, more or less, in nebulous, if delightful, discussions over emotions, esthetics, tastes and distastes - the innumerableabstractions and glittering generalities that will not permit of quantitative comparisons or demonstration of actual relative values for given expenditures on the land for definite purposes. If this were not so we would be little distracted over \"classic,\" \"medieval,\" or for that matter \"modern\" obsolete practices in Europe, which cannot possibly serve as direct criteria of present town possibilities here or elsewhere. Disputations in the initial stages along lines apart from economic in such a time as ours have, I fear, already postponed actual progress; and the coming generation will have to learn that preparedness for meeting the new community problems can no more grow out of general and erudite consideration than could sculpture arise out of literary critiques. It must arise out of experiments and progressive Page 243 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoaccomplishments in the art itself and their demonstrated effectiveness - greater or less - and their mistakes. Criticism can no better anticipate Creation than multiplicity of council can effect it. I take it as accepted in the modern educational system that we learn to do by doing. Advance is, consequently, to beexpected only where greatest freedom and scope to individual initiative are offered. Coming to earth - say to give a piece of land for the smallest but most general purpose, the dwelling, comprising as a class, three-quarters of the city - we first of all find restrictions for the lot in its size, shape, slopes, aspect, prospect, available materials, and the location and appearance of the neighbors' nearest buildings; also the character and position of their prospective improvements or detriments; andthe more definitely these are known, and the freer we are to plan, the better can we avoid loss of space or works. Obviously, we [Note: ==== Beginning of page 103 ====] will be in a much better position to design for economy when one or more of the adjoining elements can be planned, not to say carried out, at the same time. Progressively, in multiplying ratio, the co-ordinate consideration of the various elements in the community, even in the country, would eliminate waste andloss - to what proportion of the \u00a325,000,0000 a day no man can measure now, for the first steps have scarcely yet been seriously attempted. It has been computed that ten years necessary corrections of intolerable evils, due to the lack of town planning in England, cost \u00a330,000,000. Some years attempting to build satisfactorily on single inside lots, under various limitations, have led me to suggest that 60 feet width is a suitable minimum for single or double houses; but such ageneralization is only a makeshift as compared with the sort of grouping which, I submit, should obtain when the location of each residence and outbuilding is determined by the physical conditions of the sites in a group to secure the maximum advantage to everyone. For example: in this pair of houses on two lots of 50 feet (Itte) and of 60 feet (Comstock (See Vol. IV)) the object of screening and protecting the whole from the incongruous neighbors is accomplished in thefirst case by a \"T\" and in the second by a \"U\" arrangement; and I can assure you, for pictures cannot be conclusive, that in the midst of streets of houses on the same uniform allotment areas and ordinarily lined up, these and similar experiments have produced essentially the results of greatly augmented space in every case, and created oases out of nothing in a desert of unmitigated constriction. Certainly with three units, then four, and so on the openness is not only extended to the larger group but furtheraugmented by the permutations and combinations then made possible. I show, for example, groups of alternately projecting and recessed pairs at the same time alternately opposed across the street and blocks: Trier Center (Units) 60 feet x 150 feet (see vol. IV) Leeton (units) 60 feet x 160 feet (see No. 19) In other words the same conditions of maximum utilization of space Page 244 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 104 ====] for light, air and beauty may be obtained for individual houses that would be required for arrangement of the subdivisions in a single parallel enterprise, such as for education at theUniversity of Canberra - No. 10 University of New Mexico - Vol. IV University of Sydney - No. 11 Normal School of Milwaukee - Vol. IV though the differentiation of functions is less and the organization not so complex. As to business premises we might well now also conclude that a whole city frontage between two street intersections is properly a single unit for development; and in the most modern practice this has become the fact, requiring no illustration, from the many department stores, public markets, exhibition and industrial buildings and largest office buildings, as well as public administration buildings. These with their immense scale and powerful repetition have advanced far enough now as to point the way to adignified city whose architecture need not be lost in a maze of contradictory fragments - for single fronts cannot accomplish architecture if it is an art of three dimensions. Concentration of facilities and services, adequate light courts, repetition of standard forms, avoiding bulky and often duplicated duplication division walls, and securing convenience of internal communication, have made such development so attractive that splendid monumental modern skyscraping buildings, on one or several allotments, havefrequently been scrapped, after less than 15 years' life, to permit larger and more profitable ones of no greater height. Before it is possible to provide for all business in such units it is certainly practicable that the shop front and canopied portion be forthwith designed and carried out as a single feature for a block, in order to overcome the very worst disfigurement that pervades Australian towns - the tawdry, sheet-metalawnings that effectively divorce architecture from the street. The paradox of effectively carrying massive walls of superstructure on an uninterrupted base of sheet glass has only been overcome by the arcade scheme such as the Parisian Rue de Rivoli, or the Grand Piazza at Venice, where the most profitable [Note: ==== Beginning of page 105 ====] shops of all are to be found. Some object lessons of proper individual occupancy are available; but as to neighborhood, or village, or town co-operative preparation for common needs, they are awaiting the development of a practical common sense of common responsibilities. Nevertheless it is possible, within the range of feasible individual land development, for new communities to compare the costs of current practice with the alternative cost of carefully planned improvement, and thus to show, as a corollary of the future general benefits, positive increased profit that, when known to investors, will suffice to insure the proper coursefor future undertakings. In the case of Clark's re-subdivision of Janey's addition to Grinnell, Iowa, No. 8, a glance at the rolling character of the ground shows how the money-absorbing drainage problems arise out of a simple specimen of the usual automatic extension of the gridiron plan of a city; and a comparison of the Page 245 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoalternatives also shows the simple means required to avoid all the difficulties, by conforming the features to the natural topography for proper grades without earthwork, producing sites everywhere high in respect to their frontages and outlooks, yet all in strict order, in a parklike, informal environment,and with routes accentuated with parks, but direct and without barren deserts of pavements or objectiveless treadmill inclined planes. There is, in addition, a neighborly system of inter-communication. The most striking point, however, is that in the original subdivision there were only 57 lots - thirty averaging 50 feet wide and 29 averaging 75 feet wide - whilst as revised there are 66 lots of the same average depth but with 64 of 75 feet width and only 2 of 50 feet width, the resultantarea in salable lots at the same rate representing an increase in value of $10,500.00 - an increase in saleable frontage of 30.6 per cent over the previously adopted ordinary subdivision. The case of another Iowa neighborhood, \"Rock Glen\" at Mason City, the character of whose development can be illustrated by the finest type of residences in that city, is one of a piece of land which, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 106 ====] because it was very low in part and rough in part, had been left for a generation behind the growth of the town that was built out miles beyond; whilst no one would risk any but industrial investment here, because of the threat inherent in the essential exposure to the remainder of the tract. In this case, the few owners, by combining and agreeing upon a single scheme of development, under the landscape architect's control, were able to translate the difficulty into the supreme advantage of a uniquely beautifulpark, available to all, and the highest values in the city for residential land because of the joint benefits. In a recent scheme for a tract in Baton Rouge, the capital of Louisiana, I am able to submit the tables of data as to relative values with an adjoining area previously completed of the size and character to afford a \"standard\" of required lot frontage. As such an intensity as the 40 feet by 120 feet lots of Roseland-terrace was considered too great for the location and character of the Kugler tract the standardhas been corrected for units corresponding to the new subdivision lots averaging 60 feet by 140 feet.

The area certainly looked thoroughly occupied, but the replanned group of 97 houses of the same size on lots of the same width but 100 feet deep gained, besides four attractive streetintersection parks, two interior [Note: ==== Beginning of page 107 ====] parks of an acre each and one of about 5 acres as commons for the 800 residents, added to all the conveniences belonging to a single-apartment house - a smokeless heating plant, with piped and wired services, all carried through contiguous basements, eliminating entirely the need for street supplies and the multiplicity of connections. Vanderhoof B.C. [Note: British Columbia?] as laid out by the promoter, in an attempt to secure the greatest salable land on an irregular site for a whole city, offers a similar illustration when compared with an arrangement on more liberal but systematic lines. The Newton Center (No. 23) competition offers an interesting comparison and lesson in the universal extension of municipal areas. The Canberra equivalent to the Gridiron Quarter Sections takes an entirely different form as exhibited for instance in the various districts of Northbourne - the North boundary industrial extension. When we finally reach the point of economically locating our cities and connections, or allowing economic forces to do so, a still further chapter of planning for economy will be opened up; and that it is inevitable may be appreciated from the fact that under such conditions it should at present be as cheap toreach from the Southern Ocean [Note: between Australia and Antarctica] any point in the continent to the Arafura Sea [Note: between Australia and Indonesia] as it is actually to serve the State of Victoria from its port metropolis.

A comparison The informality of the rolling disposition is accentuated by the parklike character of the roadways, paths and terminal parkings; all of which are in contrast with the brutal mutilation of the natural advantages by the typical rectangular extension, its expensive lots to be filled or graded down with abrupt and steepgrades and barren deserts of pavements, ungainly slopes to descend or treadmill inclined plane to climb with no stimulus to the imagination in prospect, monotonous views and staccato repetition. Page 247 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThat the differences in economy of equipment are real and very great no one will deny. They were the inducements to this resubdivision; but also the less tangible values accruing from the aesthetic attractions and the natural adaptation of groups to the beautiful hill and vale which will induce an influx to thisproperty as the most desirable in Grinnell, disregarding both these factors and merely looking at the proposition as a real estate man wanting the greatest quantity of salable plots on paper, a comparison between the two schemes is still startling as to the primitive, inexcusable deficiency in our regulation procedure in property subdivision. We find a total increase in the salable land area of Clark's Resubdivision aggregating $10,500 as compared with the valuation of the rectangular subdivision. In other words, the total increase in lots of the same average depth as compared with the previous subdivision of the same tract amounts to 30.6%, the lots increased from 57 to 66 while minimum frontage is 75 feet throughout whereas formerly half the lots approximated 50 feet frontage. The houses drawn are to scale of houses built. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 109b ====] captionGRINNELL RAVINES - IOWA The resubdivision of Janey's addition to Grinnell, Iowa, was brought about when, after some 8 lots had been sold, it became apparent that the sewer problem of the old rectangular arrangement was about to involve an expenditure entirely disproportionate to the whole undertaking. The original plat consisted in a purely mechanical extension of the typical layout that comprises the whole of the city which, although a rolling prairie, has not in general quite the same degree of accentuation of the hill and vale that characterizes this twenty acre tract. For the purpose of comparison of the two methods of platting we may disregard the very obvious advantages of following the ravines with roadways by which the excavation for the underground service equipment is merely a matter of frost line; of lots uniformly high relative to the street and its outlooks;and of that treatment whereby the informality of the rolling disposition is accentuated by the parklike character of the roadways, paths and terminal parkings all of which are in contrast with the brutal mutilation of the natural advantages by the typical rectangular extension, its expensive lots to be filled or graded down with abrupt and steep grades and barren deserts of pavements, monotonous views and staccato buildings repetition, ungainly slopes to descend or treadmill inclined plane to climb with nostimulus to the imagination in prospect. That the differences in economy of equipment are real and very great no one will deny. They were the inducements to the undertaking of this resubdivision; but disregarding not only these very obvious items but also the less tangible values accruing from the aesthetic attractions and the natural adaptation of groups to the beautiful hill and vale which will induce the influx to this property [Note: This page is not in the New-York Historical Society copy.] Page 248 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 109c ====] as the most desirable in Grinnell, disregarding both these features and looking to the proposition merely as a real estate man wanting the greatest quantity of salable plots on paper, a comparison between the two schemes is still startling as to the primitive inexcusable deficiency in our regulation procedure inproperty subdivision. For instance taking the prices given to the original 57 lots at which rate 8 of them had been sold and had to be bought back in order to permit the resubdivision to proceed, applying these values to the lots in the corresponding location of the 66 parcels of the new resubdivision, we find a total increase in the salable land area of Clark's Resubdivision aggregating $10,500 as compared with the valuation of Janey'ssubdivision. In other words, the total increase in lots of the same average depth of the Clark resubdivision as compared with the previous Janey subdivision of the same tract amounts to 30.6%. This latter frontage is so distributed as to increase the total number of lots from 57 to 66 while the minimum frontage is 75 feet throughout (except two 50 foot lots) whereas formerly half the lots approximated only 50 feet frontage each and only the remaining 29 averaged 75 feet frontage. The houses indicated on the plat are to illustrate its scale. Though not intended for execution in this site, for construction is beyond the present scope of this project, they are in fact plans of buildings erected elsewhere in the practice of the architect, one instance being the house of Mr. B.J. Ricker bordering the subdivision, a type for the upper level. Flat roofed houses are eminently the right thing for the lower levels in order not to obstruct the views of neighbors as well as for the use of the occupant for wide views. [Note: This page is not in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 110 ====] THE MENACE OF GOVERNMENTS - Walter Burley GriffinModern governments, those of historical times, have come about in one way only - by the imposition of power of arms by a warlike minority on a peace-loving majority, and always with the object of making the industrious hand over to the predacious all but the means of keeping on with their labor. Franz Oppenheimer [Note: sociologist and political economist], among others, has taken the pains tofind this out from facts after we have been some thousands of years accepting mere theory andspeculation as to the State and its functions. This has given rise to such false ideas as the \"Republic of Plato,\" the \"Social Contract\" of Rousseau, of Jefferson, the \"Of the People\" of Lincoln, the \"Right of the Majority,\" \"The Greatest Benefit of the Largest Numbers\" and similar shibboleths. These now will all have to be discarded in the Light of Science and the Facts of History. POWER OF POLITICIANS, - Welfare by government means, in the end, only dictation by politicians , who in turn are the agents of the actual privileged classes whom governments serve. Knowing Page 249 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagopoliticians and officials and their habits, character and means of place holding should be sufficient to forever preclude anything but grave suspicion as to any real human welfare from such a source or under such control. John Stuart [Note: Mill] says, - \"The free development of individuality is one of the leading essentials of well being..... it is not only a co-ordinate element in all that is designated by the terms civilization, instruction, education, culture, but it is itself a necessary part and condition of all those things.\" Samuel Butler says, - \"I will live as I like living, not as other people would like me to live.\" Mr. Bertrand Russell says, - \"The greatest possible amount of free development of individuals is, to mymind, the goal at which a social system ought to aim.\" POSSIBILITIES OF INDIVIDUALS, - Now every human spirit is actuated [Note: ==== Beginning of page 111 (table of contents) ====] HILLSIDE DWELLING [Note: The structure is the GSDA [Greater Development Association] Manager's Quarters, Castlecrag.] TWO-FAMILY the Wearne & Finlay House.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 112 ====] to some degree by social motives in three directions - 1, Economic; 2, Ethic; 3, Aesthetic. But for suppression from without, each one normally is born with a bent and capacity for specializing and excelling to the point of \"genius\" in one or more of these directions, in which alone are the highest satisfactions of human life to be found. On the other hand no one of us could exist long without (1) some usefulness or productivity; (2) some fairness, co-operation; and (3) some relaxation through the five senses in expression of ease or grace inform or expression. These are all fundamental elements of life, and consequently in \"Society.\" The State, on the other hand, has no concern whatever for these fundamental elements of Society . In fact it must of necessity, and through every avenue of its ramifications, oppose them in order to preserve its own existence and serve its fundamental purpose which is anti-social , anti-economic , and anti-aesthetic . Where would the state come in, for instance, if economic forces were allowed natural scope? No, indeed, the economic efforts of its subjects must be curbed and cramped and twisted for \"National \" benefit, for the welfare, in fact, of a class or clique in each nationality or group. Page 250 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoWhere, indeed, is there a State that could survive free play of ethical ideas or the practice of ethical relations between all men? These must, therefore, be and are of necessity opposed with all the forces of political propaganda, public education and penal codes in the power of the government. I would not say that the instrumentality of the State is consciously opposed to aesthetics. It would be giving too much credit, in the democratic state at any rate, to assume that the authorities so selected would know enough of this high form of human endeavor to be conscious of its potency, scarcely even conscious of its existence. Even the Czarist Government of Russia overlooked this agency and suffered the death penalty for its oversight. For, though it oppressed the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 113 ====] underlying population economically to the limits of its ability and bound its intellect wisely in chains of ignorance and prisons of ethical orthodoxy, it was insufficiently knowing to counter or circumvent a wonderful creative spirit in its people in the fields of art, most particularly literature, which finally effectively turned the minds of the people against it. Here is the great lesson for us with regard to propaganda of reform. Few men can or will listen to reason. Controversy will always divide them and is, for that reason, the mainstay of the politicians and parties. Preaching is offensive to \"amour propre\" and, consequently, penetrates but slightly. Only the subtleties - art, the sensual satisfaction in form or expression, is capable of getting under the protective armor of the average ego to affect his ideas or ideals. Make no mistake, the elimination of the pernicious power of the State to coerce and mold the people will come only through the ablest writers, story-tellers,playwrights, scenario makers and picture designers! DISTINGUISHING MARKS OF GOVERNMENTS,- Governments are all distinguished by one feature - the existence of a possessing and a dispossessed class with regard to the economic basis of existence - access to the earth. This classification is what supports the governments as they are and it is idle to expect, therefore, that any of these governments will abandon its foundation on privilegedinterests. Changing the form, the representation, the personal have all been tried and always failed to effect the fundamental change. THE ROAD TO FREEDOM,- Now, however, that we have actual knowledge of the essential function of government as it is, that operates to stifle the development of the individual and, consequently, the advance of society and mankind, it will only suffice to give that knowledge to the underlying population.I have tried to show, too, the only way, in the face of the difficulties of this situation, that a new idea may be implanted under the skin of the ego. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 114a ====] Nevertheless I will bluntly state it here knowing well that only the minds that have already worked it out will accept it; the others will oppose it from psychological reasons of \"amour propre.\" Political movements are of no avail. ONLY PUBLIC OPINION COUNTS. The powers of government should Page 251 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobe eliminated except for one function - that of maintaining EQUITY among men and primarily as to the natural resources of the earth. Beyond that absolute freedom of the individual and par consequent [Note: i.e., in consequence], opportunity for natural growth of society.

ROCK CREST & ROCK GLEN [Note: Rock Crest-Rock Glen is located in Mason City, Iowa.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 116a ====] CAPTION The site of 18 acres, severed by a creek, and contiguous to Mason City, was originally regarded as suitable for common-place building sites only. Walter Burley Griffin, however, converted it into a center with ideal possibilities for domestic architecture. The creek is dammed to generate electric current.By the relegation of the houses to the perimeter the area of gentle slope to the river will be preserved indefinitely for open view very much as nature designed it and for those purposes of retreat and recreation to which nature has so well adapted it. The endless fascinating possibilities for domestic architecture with the unrepeated variations of view, soil, ruggedness, luxuriance, prominence and seclusion, need only the due attitude of appreciation towork themselves out in structures as unique as their sites, out into rock or perched on the crest or nestled in the cove as the case may be. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 116b ====] ROCK CREST & ROCK GLEN Rock Crest and Rock Glen occupy the two sides of the valley which Willow Creek has carved out of the rocks within three blocks of the central square of Mason City, Iowa. In common with many suchbeautiful pieces of nature it had been neglected during the growth of the community in favor of the commonplace building sites all around it, awaiting the day which seems to be approaching when the imagination of the people is sufficiently stimulated by opportunity for unique development where long abuse has not been, as is generally the case, coincident with the neglect. This example comprises 18 acres of the creek frontage between two bridges. That at the north is a permanent masonry arch carryingan important thoroughfare route and fixes definitely the boundary in that direction but the western foot Page 252 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobridge is merely a temporary structure and its removal in the near future is promised for the opening up of another 5 acres up-stream of a territory where rock and dell have still different forms of expression to be preserved and respected. The vertical bluffs of Willow Creek alternate from side to side of its sinuous course. In the portion illustrated they comprise the south and west banks, opposed by a gentle slope of meadow and open woods extending gradually up to almost equal elevation north and west within the limits of the tract.

Europe has tried one experiment after another which we have looked upon as attempts to solve the social problem of our time. We are tempted to copy them. But failure would meet us as it has them over there. We are faced with a critical testing time and situation. Are we going to try Europe's methods or are going to do as the founders of this country did and achieve real creative thinking? In those days an independent America was established on an entirely new concept, the concept that the function ofgovernment, political government, was to maintain equity. Nowhere else is that the case for the establishment of government to maintain the welfare of the people is the diametric opposite of this and always leads to war. The founders also put the choice of the executive in the hands of the people. Nowhere else is that the case. The parliamentary form of government gives no possibility of popular control and the powers ofimperialism rest secure behind this screen set up between the people and the permanent bureaucracy, civil and military, and imperialism continues. No screened power can throw out of office a president of the United States. We are now witnessing in Europe a rebirth on modern lines of the same old imperial sway which, always based on the liaison of political and economic institutions, now recognizes the necessity ofaccepting modernism in economic affairs. The liaison continues. Only the emphasis has altered. The uniting of the conduct of economic affairs with the military, the police (necessary for the maintenance of equity as the traffic policeman) spells ruthless power. There is an alternative. If Americans can grasp the correct concept of the founders of this unique country, they will realize that the segregation of activities according to function is necessary for health. If America Page 253 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 118 (table of contents) ====] JUDICIAL COURTS . SYDNEY . E.M. NICHOLLS . ARCHITECT [Note: ==== Beginning of page 119 ====] or the United States in unison with the whole of the Americas would accept this basic idea and would segregate the functions of a community as the functions of a human entity are segregated and build up appropriate instruments for their functioning we could spread health and could attain tremendous prosperity which could by its example facilitate establishing health in the world. It is not impossible for a being to function in health whether an individual or a community. There can be no difference of opinion as to what are the functions of a human community - Liberty, Equity, Mutuality - as in an individual we have the needs of the Spirit, of the Soul and of the Body. As in the human being these function through the mind, the heart and the stomach so in a human community we need an organ for each. Any attempt to make one of these organs do the work of another will result in illness in the human individual and as inevitably in disaster in a community. We are already beginning to see the necessity for an Economic Organization and it is already apparent that this organ will naturally become a World Economic Organization if we can keep the political organizations from meddling in it except to maintain equity which is their function. Since America has experienced a national organ based on Equity she is in a strategic position to supply the initiative for a World Economic Organization. The only alternative is totalitarianism, which ends all hope for liberty. With an Economic Organization functioning in America the principle of modern economics - division of labor - could be made effective. With the organization of all the groups and associations and elements of economic life, producer and consumer, employer and employee, the problems of America or the Americas could be so handled that prosperity would reach every element, and an efficiency obtained not yet seen even in the United States, and the world could be convinced of its necessity. Where the price of a commodity is too high, too high for the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 120 (table of contents) ====] JUDICIAL COURTS . PLANS [Note: ==== Beginning of page 121 ====] whole community to make use of it men, laborers, machines, could be poured into this field until the price came into balance with those of other commodities. These laborers could be brought from thoseindustries where prices are too low, where there isn't enough demand to place its production on a level with other commodities circulating in the community. They could be trained if necessary in community Page 254 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoinstitutions. Through a complete economic organ this transition would be made simply whereas with our present confusion it is impossible. A while ago when one looked for a job it was a farmer's son who went out toopen land, a man who already knew something about farming, and so elsewhere. That is no longer the case, but with a complete organization the transitions could be made, the education and training supplied as the needs for change arose. Our purchasers within our boundaries would increase by leaps and bounds, and other communities would follow our lead till we had a World Economic Organization and in the world as many real democracies as there were groups of people who met the moral standard ofbelieving in Equity in the realm of Rights. Should the Americas build up an Economic Organization of the Western Hemisphere they could effect movements of people from the overcrowded fields of labor without too great speed and without overriding individual preferences and abilities, without anything in the nature of dictatorship or oppression. See how the masses of America moved during the war time as great new industries weredeveloped. And what opportunities are offered in the balancing of the now rival agricultures of the United States and Argentina. With the offer of special training and higher wages offered many of these could be diverted to fields less crowded where prices should be lowered. With such an equitable system America need not fear a Nazi rival organization for the former would continually increase in efficiency whereas the latter resting on a bureaucratic system, though it might bevery spectacular at first, for during the early period it would draw into itself men trained in private business with energy [Note: ==== Beginning of page 122 ====] and enthusiasm for efficiency, it would continually become less and less efficient for that is the very nature of bureaucracy. Even in the intermediate period, if the Americas should readopt the wide-open door policy, since wealth is a function of population, many individuals would make their escape from the enslaved European districts to join the planned economy which, when not planned and when controlled by the political organ, would not be destructive of democracy. For democracy belongs in the political realm whose task is to maintain Equity in the realm of Rights whereas democracy, decisions made by a majority, is an absurdity in the economic realm where under a system based on the division of labor all labor isspecialized. With our T.V.A. [Note: Tennessee Valley Authority?] supplemented by a M.V.A. and an A.V.A. and a St.L.V.A., etc., we could easily and profitably absorb the whole population of Europe.

Should the people of 1922 try to plan more artistically for the people of 1970? The question was suggested the other day when the chief engineer of Water Supply for the metropolitan board of works, Mr. Ritchie,drew a picture of Melbourne populated by 3,000,000 people in fifty years time. With the growth of interest in town planning, the average man perhaps with his sons will live in a finer and more majestic Melbourne than he himself inhabits today. An interesting, but gloomier view however is taken by Mr. W.B. Griffin the designer of the Federal Capital at Canberra. When asked for his view of the future Mr. Griffin said:- Personally I do not like to look forward to a tremendous increase of population in this city, for one gets less out of life in a very large city then in a comparatively smaller one. The main thing, after all, is to make Melbourne a better city. As the years go on it will certainly grow bigger and perhaps handsomer as far as the center of the metropolis is concerned. But I do not think that it will be more comfortable to live in than it is at present. Even with the electricity scheme in operation there must still be more dirt,though. I think the city will be a commercial, social and political nucleus rather than a huge industrial center. Its development will be, perhaps, along lines of trade and of light manufacture rather than of huge plants and extensive works. Of course, with increase of population, larger buildings will have to be erected, doubtless taller and more substantial, but I am not sure they will necessarily be improved in appearance. It can hardly be saidthat the buildings erected by the present generation are any improvement, artistically, upon those put up by previous generations. Considerations of expediency and quick return have been taking the place of pride and satisfaction in expressing civic ideals, and so only in utilitarian respects, I imagine, will the buildings of the near future be better than those of today. As regards the type of structure, it is evident that the trend of opinion here today favors the reinforced concrete building, recent [Note: ==== Beginning of page 124 ====] examples of which may be seen in various parts of the city. The general character of such buildings is likely to change very little in the course of 50 years, except in respect to scale and size which are artificially restricted just now by arbitrary tax graduations. It must be remembered too that the state and municipal building regulations put a very strict limit upon any variation in design. To a great extent they crystallize previous practice and attempt to put the new wine of the future as far as possible into the old bottles of the past. Such attempted rigidity can only tend to a greater and greater monotony and similarity, and less and less individuality and experiment in the case of Melbourne buildings during the next 50 years. From the artistic point of view there can be no change for the better except as a result of a change in the minds of the great bulk of the people themselves and, candidly, I think there is insufficient indication at present that the people are taking any interest in the matter, and of leaders in thought on architectural and Page 256 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoartistic development. I do not wish to pose as a prophet but I do want to show the need for thinking in advance if people want a beautiful city 50 years hence. To achieve such an object they should be doing creative thinking even if not planning today. The community is rather devoting its attention to thedevelopment of the individual advantage and power, and does not take seriously the fact of any real aesthetic needs, private or public. Indeed, at the moment anyway, the influences making for beautification are growing rather fewer, not only here but in most places afflicted with our present political and industrial agencies for coercion and standardization. I would like to see a better Melbourne in the future if not a very much larger Melbourne. I would like to see many of the smaller buildings pulled down, and more economic and efficient buildings erected in their place. But I do not look with great favor upon the growing domination of government and municipal authorities where [Note: ==== Beginning of page 125a ====] building or other creative activities are concerned. The past score of years witnesses distinct retrogression in public works and a tendency to stereotyped design in every class. So the Melbourne of the next half century may be only somewhat similar to the city of today, possibly if not probably worse because more crowded and more monotonous. This is only because the city and architecture are a reflex of the life of the people. In modern life there is a growing tendency for men to become, more and more, employers and place holders rather than self dependent entities andindependent citizens. Hence fewer minds are at work upon the problem of improving conditions for the community. The very inertia of bigness too makes the individual's effort so seemingly hopeless. The result already apparent is that less and less active interest is taken in the beautification or in any affairs that seem a long way ahead. Sense of the beautiful, appreciation of finish and nicety in all things are not compatible with continuous struggle of individuals or classes for security from poverty, nor scramble for dominance, government billets or monopoly, because all these efforts are too feverish, too impatient, too anxious, too exhausting. So while they prevail the material expression of our era will continue more and more to be the sort of thing we see about us already. Anyway, fifty years is a short time under modern conditions for aesthetic revolution on a very large scale. Not much more than enough to make general the accomplishment of things already worked out by individuals. Yet who now has reached the stage of a constructive, comprehensive architectural ideal for Melbourne? Such ideals in the mind of the far-seeing public-spirited few, where they can be proven practicable, even profitable, will take on eventually and it may be hoped that the next 50 years will see the foundation at any rate of a really different and not merely greater Melbourne for the time to follow. Melbourne has a better opportunity than any other city in the Page 257 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 125b ====] world to prepare for the growth of population. It has the widest streets, with space for recreation grounds around the center that can scarcely be matched. Altogether, apart from the aspect ofbeautification, if foresight is exercised, there is no reason why Melbourne should not escape in the future much of the dangers and discomfort associated in other great cities with crowded thoroughfares and dense and squalid slums. Frequent suggestions for improvement along town-planning lines indicate that civic spirit is not dead but has only been sleeping. The proposal of Mr. James Alexander Smith before the Victorian Institute ofEngineers to build municipal buildings in the center of the city over the massed railroads which come into Melbourne's only railway station has shown that the way to the creation of a much needed nucleus of Civic Development without delay or cost or disturbance of the rights or interests of any part of the public is practical and only awaits the awakening of public spirit. Of course there will be a tendency for the city to spread out with the growth of new suburbs; and in this respect we are fortunate in possessing such magnificent beach frontages. Many suburbs will spring into existence along the bay. On the other hand, the natural beauties of ti tree groves as well as of the hills inland will hardly be greatly enhanced by increase of population. The opposite is likely to be the case, especially through the week-end habit, which is steadily growing and curtailing the attractiveness of much of nature among the gullies and bush covered hills.

Of these two features, the University and Military Groups, the former is recognised as of a more appropriately dominant character, and is aligned with the terminus of the water axis at the foot of BlackMountain. The situation of gentle undulation largely under the mount's lee having wide scope, surrounded by the inherently most attractive region of the City, is intersected by a little lagoon arm, bordered by the lowest lake, and at the same time overlooks the entire length of the other four of the chain. This site is also in a position to utilize the botanical gardens and mountain with its forestry reserve.

Fundamental sciences, descriptive of nature, lead directly to the theoretical sciences dependent upon them along lines of derivation and through these, in appropriate combination, into the lines along which they are applied to the work of civilization. Some such arrangement is necessary to permit proper expansion in ever-changing fields, with convenience to students. Moreover, it is endeavoured to direct these lines on the site to such openings for actual application as are most available to them. Thus fromPhysiology, the gymnasia give on to the broad flat athletic grounds and the water areas. And the hospital, of itself in a most suitably isolated location with most equable temperature and favorable atmospheric conditions, is adjoined by the Medical, Surgical, and Pharmaceutic Schools. Thus Agriculture adjoins the Botanical Gardens and the Forestry Reserve. Into the base of Black Mountain extends Mining, while Engineering lies between it and Architecture \u2014 both of which it serves \u2014 andhas maximum of room for expansion; Pedagogy, Law, and Commerce approach the Civic centre of people, courts, and offices.

GENERAL. Unity essential to the city requires for so complex a problem a simple organism. The factors consist in the advantages of the location on the one hand and the civic necessities on the other. For Canberra, an equation thus of the conditions of the site (1) with the functions, (2) to which they are to be adapted, is indicated in the following abstract, the numerals indexing the subsequent elaboration:- [Note: Supplied title: Abstract of the conditions of the site with functions] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 129 ====]1. SITE CHARACTERISTICS. The peculiar advantages of Canberra lie principally in the following characteristics, with each of which is indicated the chief adaptability recognised: Page 259 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago1.1. MOUNTAIN RANGES Beautiful blue and snow-capped peaks of the Australian Alps, counted among the leading natural features of Australia, lie to the south and west, properly sunlit for the scenic background. 1.2. LOCAL MOUNTS Ainslie, Black Mountain, Mugga Mugga, rising almost 700 feet (too lofty and too exposed for building purposes), afford objective points of prospect to terminate great garden and water vistas, with conspicuous positions for future commemorative monuments, and conversely offer points of outlook over a city arranged in an orderly way with reference to them. The isolated conical aspect of Ainslie and its alignment with two central eminences on the opposite side of the Molonglo suggested the lesser one of these vistas. The apposition of Black Mountain, with the general direction of the waterway and the broad prospect of the Queanbeyan Plains to the eastward, suggest its transverse and more marked vista opening or axis. 1.3. HILLS AND SPURSEminences rising to 200 feet furnish most appropriate public building sites to terminate main thoroughfares disposed with reference to them and often in apposition with the mountains also. The natural contribution of elevated foundations that may be treated in a variety of ways, formal and informal, is an asset for architectural impressiveness not to be wasted. These hills, however, are not considered to dictate either the public buildings, sites, or main thoroughfare lines, except in the light ofother determining factors. 1.4. MOLONGLO RIVER AND FLOOD BASIN. The considerable central flats are unavailable for building purposes, but eminently suitable for a waterway of the largest extent that would be consistent with a location in the heart of the city, where only, on the other hand, a water feature of the restricted size procurable at Canberra can maintain adignity in keeping with its purpose. The practicability of maintaining a surface of 5 square miles of water is verified by all known data, provided proper precautions are taken in the head waters of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers. Moreover, there are additional river supplies available within the limits of expense proportionate to any unprecedented or possible need. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 130 ====] 1.5. VALLEYS The open alluvial fields, flat or undulating, are most suitable for ordinary purposes of industry and habitation. Within the site these areas are practically all swept by the dominant winter westerly winds, since only Page 260 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoheights of the scale and abruptness of Ainslie, Pleasant Hill, Black Mountain, Mugga Mugga, or Red Hill afford appreciable protection to narrow skirtings, which occur in no considerable case within the city limits. Not more than one-sixth of the official site can be considered so protected, and that ininstances too scattered and too rugged for development for general purposes. Such protection can only be accommodated in suburban extensions to be provided north and south as illustrated in the original premiated plan. However, experiment with winds of the ordinary winter velocity on the Australian plateau indicates that a moderate amount of easily effected tree growth will afford sufficient protection for situations such aseven the most exposed on this site, a fact further attested by the generally acknowledged attractiveness for habitation of the tops of spurs extending west from Capitol Hill. As an initial deterrent to occupation, the wind may be discounted by the present local experience, wherein temporary settlement has been created in an area \u2014 possibly the most wind-swept of all \u2014 with very slight or no tree protection. Here the first permanent residence has been located after tenmonths' residential experience in a tent on one of the most exposed points, commanding, however, the mountain view. The slopes north of the river basin comprising the flat areas having the finest prospect of the mountain background, and of central dominating sites for the most important public architectural group offer the greatest scenic advantages, and are to be given preference for the most general industrial and domesticfunctions for the democratic purpose of \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\" Taken altogether, the site may be considered as an irregular amphitheatre \u2014 with Ainslie at the north-east in the rear, flanked on either side by Black Mountain and Pleasant Hill, all forming the top galleries; with the slopes to the water, the auditorium; with the waterway and flood basin, the arena; with the southern slopes reflected in the basin, the terraced stage and setting of monumental Governmentstructures sharply defined rising tier on tier to the culminating highest internal forested hill of the Capitol; and with Mugga Mugga, Red Hill, and the blue distant mountain ranges, sun reflecting, forming the back scene of the theatrical whole. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 131 ====] 2. FUNCTIONS. The importance of classifying the purposes of the city lies in the fact that only by proceeding from generals to particulars, from the more essential to the lesser essential, and from the ends desired to the means for obtaining them are natural relationships established. The generalizations are derivable from tendencies of actual growth in modern cities. 2.1. OCCUPATION. The advantages the city offers to the various classes of occupants who will reside in and utilize its spaces constitute its reason for being. The various kinds of occupation have divers needs to be met as to Page 261 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoarea, position, and environment. Secondly, their accommodation requires a communication system \u2014 the social means of linking up these elements. 2.11. PUBLIC GROUPS.From the stand-point not only of general interest, but also of effective control, the character of fixed occupancy divides primarily into two branches \u2014 public and private. In the Capital City the former takes precedence, and is treated in a very broad way, because extension of functions may easily go beyond any present basis of expectation. Simplest possible arrangement on the most general lines of classification are adopted at the start to ensure both room for expansion and a constant coherence. The general arrangement of Public Functions in this plan is illustrated in the accompanying scheme, in which they are first separated into those appurtaining [Note: appertaining?] to the Federation as a whole, and those concerning the City merely. DIAGRAM [Note: Public Groups] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 132 and 133 ====] 2.111. FEDERAL GROUP.Because of unity of control all Federal improvements can be made to contribute to a single dominating group, and since these buildings and spaces can be assorted into four distinct classes, Governmental, Recreational, Educational, and Military, these four are established to form the structural bounds and terminals of two co-ordinate axes. The unmistakable pre-eminence of Ainslie and Black Mountains ordained them for apposition with such axes, to which the site contributed further opportunity in the general direction of the Waterway, extending towards Black Mountain at right angles to a line joining Ainslie with the most prominent spur of the opposite range, \"Kurrajong,\" and with a lesser eminence between, \"Canberra Hill,\" directly at its front. The co-ordinate axes disposed accordingly are not with the cardinal points of the compass, which would entail 25 per cent. building frontage without beneficial sunlight, nor with the diagonal points where, for part of the day, no shade could be found; but they lie midway between these extremes. They are not primarily thoroughfares, but give a connected park or garden frontage for all the important structures, and can be developed, as in the case of the Mall at Washington, with scope for artistic expression, little hampered by utilitarian limitations, affording the greatest ease and comfort forobservation of the capital. In general, this arrangement of all the Federal buildings on heights about two co-ordinate axes, their individual groups, set off and connected by formal water basins, forms one combination of parallel set buildings, to which the possible confusion of other enterprises must ever remain subordinate. 2.1111. PRIMARY DIVISION. Page 262 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe two more general and earlier developed functions of the Federal Group will be Government and Recreation. 2.11111. GOVERNMENT.Representative Government in all its ordinary functions is to be classed as deliberative and limited, and is properly stationed, in a Capital, in an accessible but still quiet area. On the basis of the two lines hereinafter designated \"Water Axis\" and \"Land Axis,\" it is a simple matter to allot to the commanding Capitol the highest spur on the land axis mentioned as suitable for building purposes, \"Kurrajong,\" and to locate the Parliament Houses on the lower offshoot, \"Canberra Hill,\" on the same line towardsAinslie. Other Departmental buildings bounding a water court of the next lower terrace extend to a solid terrace front of buildings and to still lower boulevarded embankments along the central basin of the co-ordinate water axis. Centrally located, the Capitol is focused in an extensive hill park, and at that has a limited function, either as a general administration structure for popular reception and ceremonial, or for housing archives andcommemorating Australian achievements rather than for deliberation or counsel; at any rate representing the sentimental and spiritual head, if not the actual working mechanism of the Government of the Federation. \"Kurrajong\" is deemed too large and too high for a convenient working organization of Parliament, but, being the only conspicuous internal eminence that has a skyline visible from practically every portion of the city, it lends itself to an architectural treatment that need comprise little more than inthe necessary ramps, stairs, and terraces for outlook to make it, by its natural bulk, the dominating architectural feature. Moreover, the views command not only the entire city, but, through gaps, the Yarralumla Valley and mountain chains of the Murrumbidgee watershed, the most spectacular features of the landscape, and the irregularity and variety of the hill slopes afford ideal surroundings for an isolated Capitol structure, andmost appropriate setting for the two official residences, those of the Governor-General and the Prime Minister. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 134 ====] However, the possibilities of the site are not limited to this recommendation as to the Governor-General for immediate adoption, and though a large park may be connected by private unintersected low level open passage-way from the central position, and extend as far as may be into the hills to the west,forming a domain, it is entirely practicable to locate the Government House itself in the latter area, as alternately provided for, still maintaining parallel, axial, architectural affiliation with the Capitol. The whole group of Government buildings is directed out from the one popular point along lines of sequence in function. The fact that Parliament is in two \"Houses\" is an incident in addition to the topographical situation that precludes making of that structure a focal feature. The plateau stretching between Kurrajong and Canberra Hill provides sufficient foreground from the former to set off the Parliament House on the latter, over which, however, the court of the Departmental Buildings on the next terrace below may yet be seen, while the view beyond is uninterrupted across the Page 263 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoBasin, and the water front of the Public Gardens and along a broad plaisance to Ainslie. Parliament Building, on the edge of Canberra Hill, has an elevation of 50 feet above the succeeding plateau, and is approached therefrom by wide ramps around the fountain end of a terrace reservoir. From this terracecourt of the reservoir the Parliament edifice has thus a lofty setting, stopping the long axis of the reservoir, crowned by the lofty Capitol behind, and supported on the flanks by the lower Departmental Buildings. The ensemble presents excellent opportunity for cumulative massing. The central terrace court of the Government Group lies 35 feet above the lowest terrace, from which it is separated by the buildings along the waterway frontage, but to which access is given by ramps at ends and flights of steps between the structures. The court terrace, however, is carried on the roof of a central building of the waterway embankment, which projects into the Basin, crowned toward the water by an open colonnade, surmounting a slight bank of steps to afford an open forum, beneath which the structure serves as a launch entrance or\"Water-gate.\" DIAGRAM [Note: Government Group] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 135 ====] 2.11112. RECREATION. The Governmental Group silhouetted against the dark forested hills is best seen from the other arm of the land axis, where most appropriately may be located the public gardens, essentially the show placesof the City. This recreational function of the Commonwealth Capital will appurtain [Note: appertain?] to the people directly as distinguished from their representatives or agents or servants. It is, therefore, to be situated rather directly in communication with the congregation centres, and tributary to the homes of the people, than connected with any other Federal Group. The Circular Pools and connecting Basin of the waterway essentially belong to this group, and are adapted, by their continuous boulevardedembankments, for a continuous motor route, and for water sports, pageants, and bathing, the central Basin incidentally forming a rowing-course of 1 mile between terminal bridges. The Stadium for general assembly faces the waterway, and is recessed into the slope of the bank, where it does not interrupt the continuous vista along the land axis. The Theatre and Opera House, on either side, are reached from the municipal avenue on one hand, and from the boulevard of the water frontgarden on the other, for maximum accessibility from the residential districts. Farther to each side of the land axis are paired Galleries of the graphic and plastic arts; the Museums for natural history and archeology; the Zoological Gardens and the Baths, and Gymnasia; all together affording for the business and residential districts an appropriate front to correspond with the governmental aggregation on the other long side of the central Basin. Recreation comprehends, also, a formal plaisance 600 feet wide, all the way to the Casino, a park feature, at the foot of Mt. Ainslie, with ramp drives to points of vantage on the slopes overlooking the Page 264 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowhole city and surrounding country, and setting off such commemorative national monuments as may be appropriately most conspicuous. Maximum effectiveness for the waters is attained by widening as much as possible between the necessary bridges. The Molonglo is left in its present state in the lower channelled reaches, where it forms a feature of the botanical gardens and forest reserve continuous with Black Mountain, incidentally perpetuating there the only remnant of primeval luxuriance on the city site. Here, a dam, so located as to combine with one of the road crossings, impounds at 1825 elevation the lower outlying lake, and the triple internal architectural lagoons bounding on three sides the Governmental Group, reflecting the buildings, augmenting humidity and aiding equability of atmosphere in the heart of the city. Another weir, with locks, on the line where the railway and a main traffic route pass around the Government Reservation, inundates the extensive upper bottom lands for a naturalistic lake at 1835level, practically coincident with the highest recorded flood. The circular pools and their connecting basin provide three lagoons, each complete in itself, and all located in spaces between the direct lines of communication joining focal centres. At the same time, because of their largeness of scale and severe simplicity, the lagoons conform to the architectural character of the centre of the City, where any informal pond would be ineffective. Stepped and gently sloping embankments at slight comparative expense offer better architectural possibilities and greater utility than the more ordinary vertical revetments. The two irregular lakes located as is the case of the formal lagoons without intersecting the direct lines of communication have an informal treatment that corresponds with the park-like, irregular character of the City's first suburban zone and of the more spacious recreation grounds facing them. [Note: ==== Beginning of page [135-2] ====] DIAGRAM [Note: Recreation Group] 2.1112. SECONDARY DIVISION. Realization of the Secondary Part of the Federal Group may only follow long after the other has materialized, for its functions are of a more special and less imperative nature.

In the pamphlet itself this diagram (pamphletpagination page 9) has been crossed out.] 2.11122. MILITARY. The upper reach of the water axis has no commanding terminal short of the blue hills of the Dividing Range, bounding the outlook from the City over the Queanbeyan Plains, where a spacious public park is allotted to one side of the upper lake, and on the other are the grounds of the present Military College,with the steep bald knoll of Pleasant Hill \u2014 the highest crest within the City \u2014 their most conspicuous feature. This may be crowned either by a future development of the Military College, or, citadel like, given over, together with the adjacent slopes, to the Military Post, with its armories, arsenals, drill-halls, and barracks, commanding the railway lines, overlooking the entire City, and flanking the gap eastward towards the sea. 2.112. MUNICIPAL GROUPS. Buildings of the Municipality, those public edifices of utility to the people of Canberra as a whole, afford further opportunity for extending the harmonious public grouping of the parallel-set system of the Federal Groups, by establishing a subordinate axis adjoining the Recreation Group, which is most nearly analogous to the general community functions. Two separate characteristics distinguish these municipal utilities \u2014 first, that of the official, clerical, and administrative class; second, that of the material handling, transportation, and merchandising class; and it would tend to congestion to concentrate such conflicting though equally important general functions in one centre. Two centres, therefore, are fixed as the terminals of a municipal axis in the form of an avenue, north of and parallel with the water axis, each terminus connected with the garden and waterfeature of the latter axis, by short park arms leading from the circular pools. The essentially city functions are not only tributary to all the inhabitants, as is the Recreation Group, but are to serve handily the great Federal enterprises, which are here located in close proximity in three cases, whereas connexion with the great [Note: ==== Beginning of page 136 and 137 ====] Government focus is direct, and access to its Departmental Groups reasonably close. The two sites made use of for the Municipal Centres are the important and isolated hill \"Vernon\" and the slopes of like elevation lying between two terminating hills a mile and a half to the eastward, and equi-distant with \"Vernon\" from the great land and water axes. These two sites afford for comprehensive treatment very different, but equally unusual, architectural opportunities to develop large structure groups, rising in pyramid and amphitheatre formations respectively. 2.1121. MUNICIPAL OFFICES CENTRE. Page 266 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe former of these points is assigned to the administration of urban affairs, public and private, where, grouped around the City Hall or Administration Block, are the General Post Office, Criminal and Civil Courts, Banks, and allied institutions. 2.1122. MUNICIPAL MARKET CENTRE. The interval to the second of the municipal centres is considerable, to allow for indefinite expansion of both, which are equally accessible from the railway, from the Capitol, from the residential sections, and especially from the agricultural and industrial suburbs. At this second point are the Central Station and the Public Produce Markets. 2.12. PRIVATE GROUPS. As we have learned through some phases of the generally baneful \"gridiron,\" there are advantages in rectangular plots, and in orderly alignment of private, as well as of public, building groups. The remarkable parallel in the respective needs of industry demanding publicity; and of habitation requiring seclusion from the stand-point of occupancy; with the needs of circulation for business and ofdistribution only for access to retired districts, from the stand-point of communication, makes feasible an harmonious organic arrangement without conflict between street and plot requirements. Between the arms of the grand axes of public groups, private buildings are allotted separate systems of co-ordinate axes, determined by as many different base lines as are needed to interconnect directly the main public features and all lesser specialized centres. Though these axes are routes and governed largely by circulation considerations, each line commands a view of terminal objectives, either natural or artificial, and each system of co-ordinates offers rectangular sites for all buildings up to a point of junction with the next similar system, while even at these intersections no acute angles are permitted, for triangular buildings are as expensive as they are irredeemably ugly. But the allowed obtuse intersections afford a quadrilateral site disposition, aseconomical as the rectangular type, with two long prospects at each sweep of the cross connecting or ring streets. The angle blocks are, as a rule, less adapted for formal than for informal and picturesque treatment, and excepting immediately around the focal centres, were the completed plan figure is manifest, they occur at the very points of least communication and formality, and of greatest areas and cheapest land, where aninformal treatment is easiest and most appropriate. 2.121. INDUSTRY. The industries of this Capital City, aside from those institutions which have been provided for in the Public Functions which are the primary purposes of the Capital may be considered to be relatively simple in requirements, because the character of the location does not indicate very large or specialindustrial growth. The principal operations are assumed to concern the internal demands of the population, and they will be either general for the whole community or for its main subdivisions, or local for the immediate needs of Page 267 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoresidents. 2.1211. FOCAL INDUSTRY. The former class can be referred to as Focal. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 138 ====]2.12111. URBAN UNITS The more central focal units will naturally be the urban ones, whose influence will extend over the entire city area, but the disparity in the kind of traffic, as well as housing, between the two principal urban functions distinguishes one as administrative, and another as mercantile, a difference which has been recognised in the separation of the two public, official, and marked centres. The line of demarcationbetween governmental and private control of these urban activities will tend to be indefinite and variable, with changing standards of community consciousness so they naturally, together, form single groups. 2.121111. THE ADMINISTRATIVE FOCUS. Contiguous with the Municipal Official Centre may, therefore, be found the private offices and financial institutions, stock and insurance exchanges, chambers for corporate enterprises, and the professions. 2.121112. THE MERCANTILE FOCUS. To the Railway Station and Produce Market Centre will naturally be attracted private general mercantile establishments in the larger units, particularly wholesale, together with \"goods clearing,\" transfer systems, warehousing, and light manufacturing. 2.12112. SUBURBAN UNITS.Suburban centres, situated at points topographically most available, but at some distance from the heart of the city, are established to help fix the internal routes and give some idea of the extensive application of principles of planning, with specialized direct connected centres, and with building sites, rectangular so far as possible, varying in utility from a maximum to a minimum of accessibility. It is advisable to determine lines of extension as far ahead as possible, as has been done in many German cities, generations in advance of occupancy, to prevent ultimate obstruction of orderly growth through misdirected improvements. Five of these suburbs were indicated in the first premiated competitive plan, one to be devoted to society congregation, three to agricultural pursuits, and one to manufacturing. In this preliminary draft of the internal city site the originally suggested lines of approach to outlying suburbs have been maintained. Considerable elasticity must necessarily be allowed for in the designation of outlying centres, because of the remoteness of the anticipated period of occupancy. Page 268 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago2.121121. INITIAL TOWN. To meet special conditions imposed by the necessity of occupancy south of the Molonglo, in advance of construction of bridges, or the extension of the railway across to Yass, there are introduced three localnuclei tributary to a preliminary railway line already laid down. It is estimated that there will be a population of 10,000 or 12,000 before the advent of Parliament, and it is possible that the extension of the railway may not come until after that time. Therefore, these initial centres will permit of a completely organized small town, not merely for construction forces, but for a variety of interests. This district is plotted to correlate intimately with the Public Groups, its central co-ordinate axes being parallel, securing the same advantages of sun exposure, and disposed to benefit fully from the upper circular basin water frontage through opposition with the ultimate Urban Mercantile Centre on the north side. 2.121122. SOCIETY SUBURBS.To meet the objection of wind exposure on the bare western side of the City the residential area is contracted into the valley lying inside that bounding range of hills, dominated by \"Shale,\" which are to be given over to an afforestation park. Two points of congregation accentuate the two natural topographic outlets west of the Capitol. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 139 and 140 ====] These residential centres might well be characterized by society, clubs, and church assemblages for that large social group of special character peculiar to a national capital. The conformation of the land tributary to them is irregular and most advantageously divided into the larger estates, while the Yarralumla Valley to the west, unintersected by railway and least in demand for industry, and the informal lake at the north, afford open areas for a maximum of outdoor life. The proximity of the University may also be counted to afford an attraction, as exemplified in university towns andintellectual centres throughout the world. 2.121123. AGRICULTURAL SUBURBS. Outlying village centres to the southward, or possibly to the northward, in either case in the lee of the only protective mountains of the site may be devoted, at least in some transitional stages of the City's growth, to horticultural and intensive agricultural uses, truck gardens, nurseries, poultry raising, &c.,occupying alluvial plains adaptable to sewage irrigation from the higher inhabited regions, and being directly tributary by rail transportation, and by road, to the Markets. At their centres facilities for creameries, abattoirs, and allied operations are to be found. 2.121124. MANUFACTURING SUBURB. The centre lying to the northward of the City was originally designated \"Manufactures,\" but conditions Page 269 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoin the early growth, with the railroad facilities limited to the south of the Molonglo, may necessitate that such activities be concentrated in one of the southern suburbs. Furthermore, it is possible that the summer northerly winds may render the northern point less acceptable than a southern one for thispurpose. 2.1212. LOCAL INDUSTRY. In addition to general business in the immediate neighbourhood of the specialized Urban and Suburban Industrial Foci there can be anticipated a development of business for more local distribution to, and accommodation of, the intermediate areas generally utilized by residents. Such business, necessarilyattracted by easiest accessibility will tend to align itself on the most direct of the avenues connecting the focal centres. These industrial alignments may be assumed to include in some instances, not only the wide main thoroughfare frontages, but also, as an elastic limit, the frontages of the first and longest parallel avenue on either side. The unit blocks on the long connecting avenues are narrowed by the amount of increase in front traffic accommodation, these avenues being at least twice as wide as others, and also by the introduction of a rear alley shipping way 30 feet wide. It is contended that modern and prospective means of street transportation in the tramway and fast vehicular traffic, and of which the great progress up to the present is hardly a beginning towards speed,safety, noiselessness and reliability in sight for the near future, mean a very different and far more general lineal distribution of ordinary retail trade than where a walking range has been the determining influence. During the transformation period congestion has resulted in cities, and the lift or elevator pressed into service for relief. An equally well administered tram service, perhaps supported financially in the sameway out of rents, would assure a more convenient, as well as far better horizontal, alignment. 2.122. RESIDENTIAL SECTIONS. With the Federal needs provided for in their special districts, and with the general industries amply accommodated at focal points, and along the direct lines connecting them, the remaining portion of the city site is available for domestic life, which demands privacy, quiet, and stability, with freedom fromeither interference or encroachment of business life. Because of the triangular or rhombic arrangement of their traffic-line business boundaries, these internal areas, while secluded, may yet be but a few steps from the industries and communication lines serving them. Equitably distributed throughout the city these quiet sections allow domiciles to be everywhere handy to industrial employment. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 141 ====] 2.1221. DOMESTIC COMMUNITIES.Comprising the proportionately large share of the city area required for habitation, the segregated Page 270 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosections, formed and separated by the general traffic lines, furnish not only suitable individual home sites, but comprise social units for that larger family the neighbourhood group, with one handy district school or more for the children, and with local playground, game fields, church, club, and socialamenities accessible without crossing traffic tracks, or encountering the disturbing elements or temptations of business streets, since these family activities may best be directed internally toward the geographical centres of their groups for their special congregation. In other words, the adult and independent industrial social activities may be considered typically directed centrifugally, whilst the domestic social efforts are assembled centripetally for effective control and co-operation. The innermost unit block may be varied to form considerable areas for such special purpose, including also sanatoria, residence hotels, parks, ornamental or industrial horticultural gardens, even to the extent of agricultural fields, farms, or wilds in earlier stages of settlement, all with the minimum of interference with the traffic of the city as exemplified in the lakes and parks of large groups, occupying the whole of similar areas which are devoted to special Capital uses. 2.1222. HOMES. The desirability of rectangular blocks and parallel-set buildings, in the interests of economy of construction and restfulness and simplicity in architectural treatment, is scarcely less in the case of residences than for public or industrial groups, so where topography permits a system of rectangular blocks is preferable, especially where, as in this plan, it is by no means an expression of the \"gridiron,\"because of its universal closed vistas and innumerable street terminal sites. The reduction in the repetition of unit blocks in one line marks here their independence and seclusion, also permitting a graduated increase in the proportion of land used individually to that demanded by communication. The internal blocks, typically large, in many cases forming considerable undivided areas, leave opportunity for private development or small-community initiative to evolve pretty schemes of drivewaysubdivision, recessed courts, closes, quadrangles, terraces, common gardens, irregular hill garden subdivisions, and a host of similar possibilities, adding incident and variety to a consistent whole. For the sites among the hills, while an informal regularity or block arrangement might, in some cases, be possible, it is not deemed so necessary, since where allotments are large and houses are on different levels, more picturesque juxtaposition is permissible. It is regarded as generally desirable, however, thatthe occupied sites be higher than their communication lines for enhancing their appearance, their utility, privacy, and individuality. 2.2 COMMUNICATION. The general communication system, finally, often irrespective of merely aesthetic conditions, accomplishes the industrial success or failure of a city. But this does not imply the attaining of amaximum of communicating lines so much as their thorough correlation and suitable allocation. The scheme must be simple and flexible, available with varying conditions of expansion and the changes of condition with time; it must be detrimental to the shape or orderly relationships of buildings, or to the natural beauty of the landscape in no case that is avoidable. 2.21. EXTERNAL ROUTES. Page 271 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago2.211. RAILWAYS. The line of railroad approaching from either way, all junctions being external, is directed toward the Capitol as it comes into view, and then diverted in passing the Public Buildings Group, to avoidbisection of the internal traffic. The railway is, however, in immediate contact throughout with all the industrial and general habitation areas, with frequent local stations for freight or passenger accommodation. It is to be noted that the regions not in direct touch are those of the specialized characters preferably least intruded by the disagreeable features of dirt, noise, and sight, incidental to railway operation, and in general are those prepared to utilize the private motor car for rapidcommunication. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 142 ====] Gradient is the easiest possible, being virtually a level throughout, with an appropriate 1/2 per cent. rise to the main station, facilitating starting and stopping. Trackway in general is straight, with but four slight turns of three degree curvature, suitable to long train traction. Thoroughfare through flat districts is maintained by open depression about 12 feet deep, the excavated materials forming embankments of 6feet in height, an elevation requiring but slight incline for crossing streets, and used by the parallel roads where adjacent. Through industrial regions the railway is conducted between occupied blocks, for switching, warehousing, &c., utilizing a flattish valley on the outskirts for freight marshaling and car storage yards for which a considerable area is to be set aside where interfering least with through street lines. The line, approaching the Urban Administrative Centre from the north, turns at a local station there, and is directed toward a cathedral-crowned hill, into the lowest slope of which it passes as it turns and enters the Mercantile Centre through a subway beneath the open square in front of the Main Station. Spurs here afford stub-terminal train tracks for each direction at the sides of the station not served by the through tracks. The Main Station, of hexagonal shape, commands the place, but lies at one side of the city traffic currents, and is beautifully ensconced, owing to the hilly conformation at the rear. It is disposed to be conspicuous from distant points, and to offer a dignified commanding prospect of the City for the arrival's first impression. To minimize the difficulty of early completing so ambitious a station centre the street arrangement is designed to permit diversion of the approaching avenues at greater distances fromthe focal point than intended ultimately. Due south from the station, the railway emerges from the subway, and follows a direct line from Ainslie and the Cathedral, crossing the waterway at junction of basin and lake, continuing between wide avenues to the southern Suburban Station, finally turning out of the city with the Capitol and Black Mountain in its wake. In general, this external communication line is treated with the dignity accorded to internal lines, has its well-marked objective at every turn, and is afforded the finest view points where crossing each of the Page 272 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoaxes of the dominant architectural ensemble . Because this through traffic line may be some years in eventuating, and in order to effect a saving, at the outset, of the long weir bridge, it is considered that possibly the local branch from Queanbeyan, servingas a constructional line during the creative period, may be so plotted as to serve ultimately as a rapid transit adjunct to the main railroad route, linking in the Government centre with the northern and southern suburbs. This, however, can only be suitably accomplished by a line that can be concealed in the steeper slope of the hills approaching the Capital, crossing the river in a specially designed bridge with the track level beneath the roadway, with still enough room below the latter to clear the boulevardedriver embankment. This branch, necessarily largely in tunnels, and with its limited ultimate functions permitting of relatively sharp curvature, affords access to Parliament House and the Industrial Centre of the initial City so close as to obviate any need for street vehicles to eke out the journey. Perhaps such additional rapid transit facility with a clear way, independent of the street traffic, might ultimately play part in the healthful dissemination of the Capital settlement. Though not indicated, a feasible route can be laid down for the extension of lower level railway facilities to the west and south should seemingly improbable conditions ever demand such. The isolated Yarralumla Valley will scarcely justify a long distance rail connexion. 2.212. ROADWAYS. Existent external roadways are relatively unimportant, but are accommodated by through routes connecting with all the outlet gaps. 2.22. INTERNAL ROUTES. With regard to the internal system in general, it is unnecessary to elaborate here the provision for storm water disposal and drainage equipment, further than to note that the grades and the general utilization of the depressions for thoroughfare simplify the reticulation problem. The transverse interception of stormwater at various levels is also facilitated. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 143 and 144 ====] The Molonglo banks and bed afford an apparently economical route for final outfall lines. A complete local pipe and wire service at the street building line, obviating stubs or pavement interference, is attainable with the roadway system of control advocated. For tramway equipment elasticity is a first requisite, guaranteed by the integral system of arterial thoroughfares wherein there is allowance for ultimately depressing in open channels an economical sub-surface scheme of rapid transit. 2.221. CIRCULATION SYSTEM. Considering our problem from the stand-point of \"Occupancy,\" there has been noted modern tendency to supplement largely, if not to supplant the spot concentration of older towns with long alignments of Page 273 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagotraffic and trade. The maximum facility for uninterrupted rapid transportation and an adequate equipment with services in the arterial system accentuates the tendency, while a strictly subordinate arrangement of feeder streetsdeters traffic diversion, cutting off competitive inducement to traffic and trade as well, for trade must be where the people are. The direction of the main routes is involved in selecting their terminals, those points of natural or functional eminence, which must be inter-connected as directly as is compatible with the possibility of following easy and uniform gradients, never greater than 2 1/2 per cent., without excavation unduly expensive in proportion to the advantage sought. The desirability of straightness canhardly be over-estimated, but with it no convex profile is permissible. Whereas, however, these long lines are but few in the aggregate, because of the concentration of the circulative function, the value of their proper uniform grade and alignment for safety of operation, directness, and view of their important and attractive objectives, in the organic city, constitute an operative economy at least comparable with the demands of ordinary railroad lines, having infinitely less traffic burden, and infinitely greater distancesand difficulties. The basic circulation system comprises the triangle connecting simultaneously the three business centres of Government activity (Government, University, Military) and the two urban centres of local business (Administration and Merchandising). On this framework the City can develop all its functions from the beginning of its maturity with ample latitude for variation in each phase of activity, maintaining the finalscale of a Capital City from the outset. Increments of gradual growth may be definitely, little by little, incorporated without confusion, congestion, or scattering along later extensions of the arterial systems, followed by corresponding distribution tributaries as required. Never less than triple roadways can be considered sufficient to handle avenue traffic ultimately, with tramways, fast and slow vehicles in both directions; but, in the early projection of these avenues, it willbe well to substitute park treatment or even to permit temporary private garden occupancy of the portions not immediately needed for traffic. The street area, if reduced to three roadways, is a desert, dangerous and unpleasant to traverse, so in a sunny country of stately open-branched broad-leaf evergreen avenue trees, additional space is required for a final arboreal accompaniment of at least quadruple rows and supplemental shrubbery parkways forshade and shelter, wind and dust arresting. From considerations also of architectural setting, ventilation, fire stop, command of crossings, and eventual rapid transit, a uniform width of 200 feet is adopted. 2.222. DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. A system of distribution at right angles to the circulation thoroughfares gives minimum of distance from either side of such thoroughfare. For access to public transfer lines, trams, &c., this is the prime object.With a frequency of the circulation ways the distances are short; indeed, a point five blocks back in the triangular interspaces of this plan is a rarity. The rectangular form of block most generally adapted to improvements, and straight roadways most simply kept and patrolled, can, in these purely distribution routes, be readily maintained with very slight modification for a considerable undulation in site since these streets essentially short in any one directionpermit obstructions to remain or to be compassed by diverting ramps without loss of utility, while general and frequent variations in rate of slope can be accomplished at angles without rendering the Page 274 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoirregularity apparent or disagreeable. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 145 ====] The very liberty and topographic adaptability permissible to these minor distributing streets demands a contrasting dignity and severity in the connecting avenues that form the backbone of the system, and forthat dignity the economy of the former easily contributes the requisite funds. The streets parallel to business avenues decreasing in length, in accessibility, and in importance in direct ratio with their distances from their main axial artery, approach by degrees an ultimate of enclosed courts best adapted for privacy and quiet, tending naturally to maintain themselves for residential and similar purposes against any possible intrusion of business, especially since they are only reached from themain travel routes by ring cross streets that neither connect important points nor ever run directly in any one way for sufficient distance to attract active traffic. There are, however, no \"dead ends\" nor \"cul de sac\" streets expensive to serve. The gradual reduction of the proportion of thoroughfare area to private grounds in residence sections adds materially to the site space available for use as well as to economy in service equipment pipes andwire lines, pavements, and their maintenance. One suburban town observed, where alternate cross roads as laid out were omitted, leaving blocks 1,200 feet long, may be cited as having been able to perfect its street improvements, many years ahead of other places of similar conditions otherwise, but with the greater multiplicity of streets. In the hilly sections the distribution lines take the form of sweeping ramps, confined, as far as possible, to the depressions for reasons heretofore explained, as well as for economy in the grading pipe service, drainage, shelter, and in the utilization of land that is of minimum value for other purposes. This way is also the simplest and least conspicuous in mutilation of natural rugged types of scenery. Effort has been directed towards securing arcs of the minimum curvature needed to compensate an appearance of varying and convex grades for economy as compared with straight lines in such locations, and fordirectness, safety, and ease of control as compared with short curves. A uniform width of 100 feet for distribution ways is established as a suitable minimum interval between building fronts for light, air, privacy, and fore-garden embellishment. It is by no means a determinant of the desirable thoroughfare space in roadway, walk, or public parking, which should be graduated to a minimum requirement of possibly a 12-foot driveway alone in the farthest backset, short streets, orravine climbs. There is no reason why the balance of the potential right of way should not be granted for fullest use to the private occupants and considered in all but reserved jurisdiction as belonging to individual abutting allotments, withholding an easement for direct service lines adjacent to the buildings, and retaining the exercise of considerable public control as to appearances. This is not an uncommon arrangement and one here allowing variable increase in the proportion of private sites to actual publicways directly corresponding to lesser unit values of the areas for fixed occupancy and their lesser demand for access.

By Authority: Albert J. Mullett, Government Printer, Melbourne. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 146 (table of contents) ====] No. 11. SYDNEY UNIVERSITY GROUP PLAN [Note: ==== Beginning of page 147 ====] UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY GENERAL PLANThe consideration governing a scheme for extension, indefinite both as to time and magnitude, must be most general, and primarily concerned with co-ordinating two phases of unity; the abstract functional relationship, and its physical expression; otherwise:- The Educational Organization, and the Architectural Ensemble. 1. EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATION The conception behind the modern university comprehends a complete laboratory of the farthest advanced and most fundamental scientific knowledge that we possess wherein that knowledge is not merely being systematized and taught, but where it is constantly widened and extended by the efforts or both faculty and students into the practical work of our civilization. Such an ideal excludes nothing from the curricula, except purely speculative and dogmatic fields, and can be bound neither by historical norarbitrary limitations as to the things that are properly cultural, professional, artistic or merely practical, for no phase of life in this era may be permitted long to lie outside the pale, or be simply subject to rule of thumb. Primarily then the schematic basis of the University must be some general arrangement of all our activities. To illustrate, I append an attempted gradation from generals to particulars as suggested for aNational University at the Capital. Some such system, taking no account of relative proportions and little of physical disposition, must be our sole guide prior to the definite determination of the physical possibilities and limitations of any University and should not be lost sight of amidst all the confusing details and modifications that must be continually admitted. Otherwise unity, elasticity and undiminished convenience, which are the very ends aimed at, will be jeopardized. In the Capital instance, wherein not only the University but the entire environment might be deemed flexible, a fundamental scheme is quite fully applicable not merely in the restricted area of the University itself but to obtain correlation with appropriate natural features surrounding Page 276 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 148 ====] the site and, as well, co-operation with important allied functions of the city. In Sydney the environment is, to all intents and purposes, established, and firmly located and the direction of their dependentfeatures, if not finally fixed, at least narrowly restricted, but the principle of successive zones from General to Descriptive, thence to theoretical and finally to Practical Work, can be observed in regard to the allocation of each line. GENERAL WORK In the main building we have now a splendid center on the highest point of the site appropriate to house for a long period all the strictly general work:- Administration, Assembly, Library, Museum and the comprehensive collective studies, such as Geography and History. Already the groundwork of Practical Science - Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, has been properly allowed for in an addition to west as planned for by the late Col. W.L. Vernon to replace the present obsolete accommodations on the indicated location. PRIMARY DIVISIONS Presumably Astronomy in the absence of suitable atmospheric conditions for observation will have to be supplied with its equipment at some separate locality and the phases of that study required here will be of the nature of General University work associated with Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. Premising a main division of Science into four branches of which Astronomy is the first, it is most practicable on this site to allocate the three remaining great groups around the general point of origin as follows:- Geology to the West, Biology to the South, and Anthropology to the East, a disposition conforming so far as major buildings are concerned to present actual operation. GEOLOGICAL GROUP The earth science in its first or descriptive phase, Geology, must of course be located in as close touch as possible with the general studies and, in advanced stages even, this is not of less use to allied [Note: ==== Beginning of page 149 ====] technical branches than to Engineering which, strictly, may be taken to be the adaptation of terrestrial materials and forces to man's use. Again, Geology is most intimately related as to data and facilities with another general division of science - Biology, hence both fundamental studies should be brought in together toward the radial centerfrom their present isolated and circumscribed locations. Geology with its phases of Physiography and Meteorology, is thus available to all the Biologic groups as for instance Agriculture, as well as Medicine. Engineering in its many branches and particularly because of operations using power requires the most extensive scope and considerable segregation for which the westerly direction in which its Page 277 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoaccommodation and its work are already tending is the most suitable because of traffic facilities from Parramatta Road and by reason of being the lowest point of the whole University. BIOLOGIC GROUP The Medical School is, by far, the most definitely determined of the now scattered phases of the study of Physical Life, and lying on the Eastern boundary of the grounds of the University, it is not inappropriately adapted to its relation, as one of the most specialized of the applied practical sciences, for with the Fisher Library as the focus for all, there is intermedial room for the more fundamental general students' work. Physiology just to the south of the library furnishes thus a point of demarcation for thePathologic work to the east, and the, yet to be established, Hygienic branches with central Gymnasium and Stadium to the south, where is found the most eligible natural amphitheatre for Athletics, directly accessible to the public by tram, and appropriately associated, on the one hand, with Victoria Park, which is expressly reserved for recreation, and on the other with the Colleges, wherein many of the students are quartered for their leisure time. A great central campus for ordinary individual games, as well as for general drills and outdoor pageant and ceremonial, is also directly [Note: ==== Beginning of page 150 ====] tributary and in position to utilize the dressing rooms, baths and paraphernalia of the Gymnasia. The relation of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital to the Pathologic center, hardly close enough, is improved by a direct connecting avenue. The remainder of the available vacant land inside the University block lying south of the central open area may be utilized as required by the agricultural branches extending to the West as far as is compatible with the needs of Engineering, either branch of technology utilizing the wider latitude as time and circumstances, impossible to forecast, may determine. In case of all the technological branches those operations, which, in fact, approach the actual practice, and in which the students may concentrate in long periods, or even whole days, are to be located farthest from the general center. If Military Science is to be treated at the University in its technical aspects, its equipment properly will be placed at the west of the campus connected with the Biological group and in contact with Engineering. ANTHROPOLOGIC GROUP For a concentration of the studies related to humanity the eastern arm of the site may be adapted as gradually as the specialities outgrow their accommodation in the present main Administration Building, or as they may be brought in for the greater advantage of co-operation from the outlying situations more expedient on the present scale. Page 278 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoPhilosophy, Psychology, and Sociology are quite fundamental to all science and art and may be indefinitely left in the Academic center whence the aesthetic, ethic and economic branches should be elaborated in future separate schools for Literature and Art, Law, Business and Education. This last forwhich a large Teachers' Training School is now under construction will be advantageously transferred to the more suitable site in the Eastern group where also it will be convenient to actual local practice schools both common and technical at a distance of a few hundred feet to the north. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 151 ====] Central location for the common club quarters and study rooms for the women as well as the men is essential to maintain usefulness. Particularly for the women this accommodation should be immediatelyaccessible from the tramway, and space for the Women's Union immediately north, similar to that accorded to the present Men's Union, is indicated. Residence quarters and religious headquarters for various groups of students are most properly reserved on the perimeter of the University as has been the policy from the outset, but the excessive area granted in many cases have too greatly restricted the number of these groups and encroached on the room nowobviously needed for University expansion. Since, however, the overlapping interests lie almost wholly in unused portions of the lands for which any imperative need can only develop on the part of the parent institution, it is less real than nominal and capable of adjustment to a mutually satisfactory resumption. II. AGRICULTURAL ENSEMBLE Architecturally the prime object in the scheme is conservation of (a) the site characteristics, (b) the architectural resources. This implies making to count as a part of a coherent whole each element of construction, each bit of space. SITE CHARACTERISTICS The chief advantage of the whole property lies in the beautiful central valley, flat for some twenty odd acres, surrounded by heights rising from 60' to 70' on all sides except a rather narrow outlet diagonally to the north-west and two flattish branch vales on the south side one, low, at the western and one, higher, at the eastern end with a 60 foot hill between them. The highest spot of the grounds, just north-east of the main flat is occupied by the first and most important University quadrangle building of which the lofty Fisher Library is the conspicuous elementtoward the valley. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 152 ====] The other large buildings, one the Medical School, the other the Teachers' Training College under construction, give directly onto the low lying area and, due to the central positions, east and north Page 279 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagorespectively, determine its longitudinal and transverse axes. ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT OPEN SPACES The preservation of the deep valley as open as possible in the form of a \"Campus\" is necessary to secure an adequate spaciousness for the final plan consistent with a full and compact building development on the basis of fire-proof construction. Encumbrance of the bottom land with buildings, except on the edges, would be as subvertive of health and of comfort as of aesthetic attractiveness. Onto this large area of lawn and bordering shrubs, flowers and water gardens, all the other open spaces are planned to look as terrace, like gallery loges. Indeed the chief motive in the grouping throughout is a system of interdependent but distinctly individual ample outdoor rooms:- cloisters, slopes, quadrangles, courts or squares whose encompassing buildings, where not prevented by previous constructions, are each accorded four broad quiet outlooks, the successive rises as the sites recede from the campus foreground serve to form these groups into aterrace-stepped cumulative architectural composition, complete and impressive from many view points. On the same principle Victoria Park is planned with an open center securing much greater utility in unintersected recreation space as well as a dignified and spacious appearance, giving most effective lawn setting for the beautifully silhouetted English Gothic Buildings of the eastern front of the University. AXES Except for architectural considerations especially determining individual features such as vista objectives or the necessary correctives of otherwise awkward juxtapositions, all proposed buildings are [Note: ==== Beginning of page 153 ====] indicated merely as rectangular sites of areas deemed ample for the assigned functions. To assure however the preservation of the simplest relationships between all buildings and building groups whose precise dimensions and disposition must remain for a long time undetermined and subject toconsiderable elasticity, their locations are fixed in each case on the general plan by intersecting axes. MAIN AXES The major axis of the whole open terraced arrangement extends clear through the University from the central tower of the Medical School to the middle of St. John's College at the top of the western hill side, also fixing the center of the simplified Victoria Park directly opposite the Medical Building to theirreciprocal advantage. Intermediate to the lofty structures at the ends, three other building sites are reserved on the long axis where, at lower elevations successively toward the campus, flat roofed buildings, not too high in themselves, may set off and enhance the effectiveness of these terminals. Page 280 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe fine hill to the south of the campus is opposite the large Teachers' Training School structure each bound for all time to be the dominating features respectively of the south and north sides. The Training School set parallel to the Engineering Building, is unfortunately at a perceptibly divergent angle with therest of the main buildings, but by forming the north frontage of the campus into an arc of terraces it is possible to rectify in effect the variance from a proper minor axis at right angles with the major. ENGINEERING EXTENSION Colonel Vernon's arrangement of the proposed Physics and Chemistry group skillfully overcomes the original deviated alignment of the Engineering group with the basic Central Buildings, and permits of anindependent development of a series of courts on an Engineering Axis whose adjustment elsewhere to the main system and another irregularly placed recent building (present Veterinary School) is easily effected by means [Note: ==== Beginning of page 154 ====] of a few rounded walls imposed on future individual building plans in harmony, however, with the informal style already fixed for this portion of the University. It will be highly desirable on account ofthe irregularity of the slopes to divert the present straight west main avenue of this group to an easy curve, horizontal as well as vertical, westward from the point of marked change in grade, and this turning point provides a most suitable terminal site for the Russell monument where it may signalize that portion of the University with which the benefactor's name will always be associated. The higher portions of the north Technology groups are already set on natural undulating slopes, but the lower frontages toward the campus are adapted, for other reasons than the necessary arc base line, to regular terracing. For instance, the towering Fisher Library is a marked objective worthy of maximum emphasis which can be obtained by a formal avenue directed toward its west bay. Three permanent buildings within the area necessary for the ultimate expansion of the Mining and Engineering Schools will need to be transformed from their now designated uses. Of these, the NewTraining College seems to be eminently adapted by its large light rooms to the general lecture and drafting work which constitute the basis of much of the Engineering students' activities, and may well house entirely a School of Architecture. AGRICULTURE EXTENSION The southern side of the campus affords the only sufficient area available for the many branches of Agricultural practice and investigation that must play an increasingly important part in the highest educational institution, State supported. The opportunity for a splendid mass effect of simple structures exists in the steep slopes terraced in three building levels below a crowning central hall. The Veterinary College and Hospital can find freedom and scope Page 281 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 155 ====] equal to their previous allotted position at the north western point in the corresponding south western corner. EVENTUAL TECHNOLOGY EXTENSION The western front of the campus is treated as a court group of character similar to the Engineering and cultural branches of Technology and will be available for any ultimate outgrowth from either or both of these Departments or other specialized practical technical branches. Enough room is left here for a development that will cover a transition to the heterogeneous hospital and diagonally disposed featuresin the direction of the Missenden Road and ensure repose in the final ensemble. PATHOLOGY EXTENSION The present Medical School building is evidently designed to be extended southward with an addition similar to the northern annex, rendering the whole symmetrical as a focal feature. Should still further growth demand, there is a space south and south east for separate flanking buildings which will improveits setting though encroaching somewhat on the margin of Victoria Park, but for which land an equivalent may equitably be granted from the University's holdings along the north park boundary. HYGIENE EXTENSION The intimate relation between Physiology, Hygiene and Pathology indicate the effective point for the placing of the Gymnasia, indoor and outdoor, but the determining factor is the little valley perfectlyadapted for a stadium large enough for all exhibition playing, as well as recreative practice. The expansive lawn thus afforded will serve to set off from the third side the principal architectural features of the University and will serve to connect the otherwise independent open areas of Victoria and the Campus, each of which must be considered tributary also to its useful purposes. The central building for administration and instruction is connected by colonnaded observation stands to flanking buildings for the separate [Note: ==== Beginning of page 156 ====] special men's and women's accommodations and swimming baths. PROFESSIONAL EXTENSION The approach from the city to the main building will be much improved by the provision of a terrace forecourt, not only to form the historical setting association with its Tudor character, but to afford thenecessary frame for the picture, as it were, and set the measure of its scale. The eastern protruding arm of buildings, aligned with the Great Hall and successively rising, in stages, 50' to its base, will serve to magnify its elevation and emphasize the crowning characteristic which its Page 282 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagodegree of enrichment and grace merits. The dividing of the upper part of the main avenue, at present a single line, is imposed by the hitherto disagreeable change in character as between the sloping and flat portions. The final terminating feature at the end of the approach avenue is architecturally necessary to the completion of the eastern extension to provide an object from the terrace worthy of their commanding fusion of the industrial city prospect beyond. STUDENT LIFE GENERAL CONGREGATION The central club feature for men students is very appropriately located with space for considerable growth, of which a duplicate wing is indicated. The requirements as to location for the women students' meeting center are very similar, and are to be met best by the largest vacant space north of the main building to be reached by another special entrance on Parramatta Road, and most convenient to the general Scientific, Cultural, and Arts branches whereinlie the major portion of women students' work. The site and disposition recommended serve to furnish a low lying counter facade to the side of the Great Hall; to screen and minimize much of the bareness of Macleay Museum; and to introduce an [Note: ==== Beginning of page 157 ====] integral feature into the crude retaining wall of Parramatta Road which irregular mass may be articulated and rendered subordinate as a base by, say, an arched portal combined with a well-proportioned Unionbuilding of similar concrete finish with terrace and lofty balconies commanding the roadway for a great distance. No misgivings need be entertained as to the more massive yet cheaper material of such a building necessarily detracting from the dignity of the flanking wall of the Great Hall, for here the similar size and lower mass, one story less than toward the road, may be kept as subordinate as any outlying merelyterrace feature of the Fountain Court. RESIDENCE ACCOMMODATION The various colleges providing for residence students' life are augmented by allowing for less than double present capacity and by provision definitely for two, and provisionally for still another additional institution, the last to the south of the Stadium. All these structures are disposed with reference toaesthetic requirements, neutralizing awkward relative positions and creating, so far as possible, sequestered enclosures within each, and open quadrangular commons between the individual groups. Large provision is made for the increasing of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in a manner to harmonize with the University to the east, and screen off the cluttered effect now so evident in that direction. The central element of an enriched chapel, the vista stop of a main campus avenue, set off by long severe Page 283 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowards, offers an architectural opportunity to accomplish economically the desired harmony with University architecture. THOROUGHFARES To maintain a free garden-like character throughout the University a uniform system of narrow driveways (about 18') and paths (about 8') without gutters except as formed in conjunction with bordering turf is recommended and, for material, Portland cement concrete [Note: ==== Beginning of page 158 ====] pavement offers the least obtrusive and probably the most easily maintained construction. ARCHITECTURE It is regrettable that the same Pyrmont sandstone employed throughout the earliest and most stately edifice has not been adhered to as a veneer facing, at least, for the later buildings, but the effort to establish more or less segregated courts is a means to reduce the incongruity of varied materials. At any rate, the eastern extensions can be carried out through the future in the same manner and material as the original. There is no question, moreover, that the Engineering group which is particularly isolated and will be effectively screened by the future campus development, should be carried out as stated, primarily in brickwork and with its own simplified Gothic treatment. But for the central campus whose elements are undetermined except in the case of the Teachers' College, lately commenced, it should be feasible to approximate more closely to the original type of Universitydesign. Even if brickwork must be admitted generally, still it is possible that a very simple treatment, on the order of St. Paul's College, for instance, would make practicable the continuance of the stone facing for at least the inner tier of buildings only the eastern most of which will be actually required for some years. VEGETATION Evergreen vines in this locality afford a peace making medium as between otherwise unavoidable incongruities in materials and color if not as between conflicting scales and proportions of buildings, and their use should be systematically encouraged toward obtaining a domestic atmosphere as distinguished from the institutional. Continuing the same functions where the vines leave off, some of the other architectural shortcomings may be mitigated by the large use of evergreen trees of which the native angophora, eucalyptus and Melaleuca contribute about the richest and most delicate architectural [Note: ==== Beginning of page 159 ====] Page 284 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoembellishment accorded by nature anywhere in the world. Their distinguishing characteristics of open lacelike foliage colors constitute at the same time, their most practical and hygienic value, as well as that of adding decoration, rather than absolutely obliterating the buildings. Shrubbery, to whose obtainable variety and interest there is almost no limit, supplies the final complement necessary to the proper screening and subdivision of architectural groups. It flourishes and blooms with a minimum of care, and must not be stinted in irregular massing for the purpose of framing buildings and enclosing individual units of open space, at the same time stimulating the imagination to exaggerate the extent and interest of the whole to a degree impossible with expensive walls or hedges orfences, which may well be ruled out from within the boundaries of the University.

SYDNEY UNIVERSITY GROUP [Note: These words are crossed out in the New-York Historical Society copy.] DISTINGUISHED AMERICANS What distinguishes Americans from other people?Not nationality, that is not birthplace though the Earth itself places its mark on the physique and physiognomy of man as well as other creatures and if Americans let themselves be dominated by these earth forces they will gradually become the American - the American Indian - type. We can see this here and there if we are observant of these things. Not race - that is folk characteristics - for America is the meeting place of all folk of the world who through the social institutions established by our fore-fathers rapidly form friendly and even closer relationships, which means that Americans swiftly become human beings, individualized entities, no longer under bondage to any folk spirit. Not eccentricity, that is peculiarities that pick him out as conspicuously different from his associates, in contradistinction [Note: Spelling taken from the N-YHS copy] to free will used to take the responsibilityof making one's own decisions in all realms of life and blaming no one but oneself for the consequences, that Freedom which makes man alone capable of choosing what he does not want. But taken on the whole Americans, by and large, are distinguished by their interest in achievement as versus accumulation of property. They are even gamblers willing to lose and to lose heavily in the game of achievement versus profit. Let us be sure that this flaming interest in achievement is passed on to our descendants. The scope for achievement is endless, in America, in the Americas, in the world, in the worlds of matter and soul and spirit. Let us make it the job of our institutions to see to it that opportunities in all these realms are wide open to every individual American. We need not fear, if we do it all humanity will do it for human beings are inspired by the achievements of human beings.

ILLINOIS [Note: ==== Beginning of page [163-2] ====] Sect II T.E. WILDER GROUP - DEVELOPMENT OF ONE BLOCK - ELMHURST ILLINOISONE HALF PLAN In Mr. Wilder's development we have one block of practically level land in one of the western suburbs of Chicago not so close to the city as to make it advisable to make lots smaller than 100 feet by 150 feet keeping it a high class residential group. The property is the size of two ordinary blocks of the town, one street coming to a dead end at the property. The four surrounding streets are the usual residentialroadways. With the customary alley omitted we get an interior park 300 feet wide and 1200 feet long under the control of the citizenry of the residences surrounding it, 26 families, its equipment - tennis courts, ball fields, wading pools with their sand beaches and so on. Maximum garden feeling is attained by arranging the houses in pairs or staggering them to make effective ensembles. The interior park is more or less screened by borderline plantings. MR.

In a small town the shorter block which was a stub-end street is eliminated, doing away with one thoroughfare. The subdivision is in larger lots appropriate to the less crowded district in an outlying town. The interior space becomes useful as play space for young and old. With no fixed building line every house can have outlook in all four directions. [Note: The last two paragraphs on this page are handwritten.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 165 ====] INITIAL - WILDER GROUP . ELMHURST [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.] TENSE YEARS On his first visit to Canberra (1913) Griffin noticed [Note: The phrase \"without use of instruments\" has been crossed out.] that there was an error in the location of the trigonometric bases which affected the main land axis of his plan and consequently made the location of the corner stone laid at the dedication incorrect. The location of this monument off the axis did not bother him as he preferred a doublemonument, one on each side of the axis, as a town planning feature and plenty of occasions would offer for a second monument. But it was important that the surveys on which the plan was based and on which all working drawings would be made should be correct so he called the attention of the chief surveyor, Mr. [Note: Charles] Scrivener, to this error. Griffin was appointed as Director of Design and Construction of the Federal Capital in 1913 and took over his duties in May 1914. Before leaving for his 6 months absence he requested the Minister [Note: of Home Affairs?] that surveys should be made of the outer districts encircling the Capital so that the avenues of the city might be made properly to connect with their extensions into and across the rural districts. On his return he asked for these surveys which he found out unofficially had been completed, but it was months beforehe got them. The Minister's repeated requests and instructions for immediate delivery of the surveys were of no avail so that actual working drawings, street locations and grading could not be done at this time. After working for some time on working drawings he became convinced by comparing various surveys Page 287 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothat there was something wrong and on investigation found that the datum co-ordinates on the two sets of surveys were different though there was no indication of this on the lithographs. This meant great loss of time, entire revision of drawings and calculations. In spite of such handicaps however the workof making drawings at a scale of 200 feet to the inch was continuing in Griffin's office. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 166 ====] Now a new Ministry - [Note: Andrew Fisher, Prime Minister; William Oliver Archibald, Minister of Home Affairs] Among the officials' schemes launched during the first days of Mr. Archibald's Ministry (for the party which had appointed Griffin had been thrown out of office as the Party which awarded him the prizehad previously been thrown out) was the demand for a complete working plan at 400 feet to the inch, a scale neither sufficiently small to work on as a whole nor sufficiently large for the development of works. The following is a summary of the history of this demand of which the public got the barest glimpses, only such as suited official purposes and of which Parliament knew practically nothing until Griffinsucceeding in getting the correspondence laid on the table shortly before the end of Mr. Archibald's Ministry; and much of which was unknown even to Griffin since he knew nothing of the officer's letters and reports to the Minister except as he could surmise it by the course of events. The officers refused to recognize that the Griffin plan had been accepted by Parliament. ROYAL COMMISSION ON FEDERAL CAPITAL ADMINISTRATIONIn the evidence of the Royal Commission Mr. [Note: W.H.] Kelly (former Minister of Home Affairs) states:- (August 1916) 6564 - Did you authorize the publication of the accepted plan? Yes. 6565 - When you included the fact in Digest No. 17 did you regard it as an intimation of the acceptance of that plan? Yes. 6566 - On the 6th Dec. 1913 Mr. Bingle wrote to the Administrator as follows:- The Minister said I could forward copies to Mr. Scrivener and yourself. I understand they are to be published shortly. On the 12 Dec. the Administrator replied - Many thanks. Two copies received one of which has beenhanded to the Director of Commonwealth Lands and Surveys. Would those letters refer to the copies of the accepted plan? I think so. 6567 - I suppose that you hardly thought there was room for doubt after the publication in the Digest as Page 288 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoto the acceptance of that plan? There was no room for doubt as to the fact of my having accepted the plan. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 167 ====] The document which Mr. Bingle stated there was no record was disclosed by the Royal Commission in 1917. It is included on page 12 of the papers No. 346 presented by Mr. [Note: King] O'Malley in 1917 containing copies of the documents omitted from the papers presented to Parliament by Mr. Archibald at the request of Mr. Kelley in 1915 (i.e., suppressed by the officials when Parliament demanded the documents). The Minister, Mr. Archibald, also stated during the interview in regard to a question raised by Mr. Griffin as to his duties, that he wished first to receive his plan as above mentioned, and afterconsidering same he would than define Mr. Griffin's duties. (No misunderstanding the nature of this threat.) In Digest No. 20, 1st March, 1915 Mr. Archibald said:- Further action awaits submission by Mr. Griffin of a plan on such a scale and with necessary information as will enable the Minister to consider its adoption for the purpose of the layout . (This 17 months after Griffin's appointment.) Griffin made the following protest on the whole question on 11 May, 1915:- In justice to yourself and myself I would ask that the House, before proceeding to consider the issues in relation to the Federal Capital, be made cognizant of the entire inaccuracy of the statements which have been put into circulation to the detriment of the interests of the Commonwealth, myself and my staff. Endless months were thus spent in writing and following up every clue from Press comments or the official parliamentary Gazette and endless chasing of this man and that. Well I remember the final race that I took with Mr. Griffin (so that I might help out as errand boy if required) to place the documents he had gathered together before the Prime Minister, Mr. [Note: Joseph] Cook. Way out in the far distance we went for the surrounding municipalities of Sydney are all one-story buildings and so on the level, soSydney stretches on endlessly the most desolate of all forms of desert, no vestige of beauty anywhere not even street plantings. And frantically back to the city to catch the train [Note: ==== Beginning of page 168 ====] for Melbourne, to place these documents, after Mr. Cook's approval, in the hands of his assistant Minister, Dr. Kelly, who was ready to demand of Parliament that it place the whole correspondence and documents in connection with the Federal Capital on the table, a proceeding which brings it out of the secret places and makes it available. He caught the train. In the course of the years he became renowned among the railroad people for these last second arrivals for he was perpetually taking this trip between Sydney and Melbourne. It was the one place where he could catch the Ministers. I remember one time when he had disappeared beyond the ken of either of his offices, private or Page 289 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoFederal, when we knew the importance of his catching the train for Sydney. I had packed his suitcase; one draftsman was sent to the station with it; one was placed at the foot of the elevator and another on the street corner to forestall his losing a moment by getting off the tram or coming up the lift. When hearrived at the last moment at the station, grabbing his suitcase himself and catching the train because of our precautions, the porter turned to the draftsman with disgust saying, \"I never would have waited if I had known it was that guy.\" Mr. Griffin always preferred to carry his burdens himself. The next day the papers were tabled. This made history. It led the Labor Party to replace Mr. Archibald by Mr. O'Malley in the Home Affairs Ministry, who with Mr. [Note: William] Webster of the Post Office Department later brought off the Royal Commission. One of the fights during this period was on the case of building an arsenal. It was a clever scheme to destroy the Capital City sooner or later by locating the arsenal within the boundaries of Canberra. Washington had had the experience of such a catastrophe early in its history. Griffin had opposed this in every way he could think of, accumulating data and informing members of Parliament and writingarguments for them against such procedure, but finally the definite instruction had come from Archibald to lay out plans for the location [Note: ==== Beginning of page 169 ====] and construction of buildings and industrial housing for this work. There could be no answer to such a precise instruction except acquiescence or resignation. That night looked dark indeed. I can't remember now whether we went to a moving picture show or just kept on with the drive of office work but wearrived home about midnight to find a note pinned on our pillow, for one of the Cabinet Ministers was lodging in the same residence. The documents laid on the table had worked. The standing of the whole Labor Party then in power was jeopardized by the character of the facts revealed in them, and they had called a meeting, and by election by the party members had shuffled a couple of the Ministers, one of them Mr. Archibald, and replaced him by Mr. O'Malley now again in the Home Affairs Ministry. It was a new lease of life. Two of the Ministers were sympathetic with the movement, really important to the Labor Party (important to the people of Australia) of establishing a Federal Capital. It was they who had called for an international competition. But the fight continued. Griffin would never have lived through these years of fight with the Civil Service if it hadn't been for the advice and assistance of Mr. James Alexander Smith, an engineer ofworld renown. Griffin soon learned to put none of his letters through until he had taken them to Mr. Smith for advice. Griffin was a very able thinker and letter writer but he put things from a rational point of view and reason is no element of bureaucracy. Mr. Smith from his experience within officialdom and from without, for he had refused to continue in the Service, would tell Griffin to leave the letter overnight and the next morning would frequently give him a totally different letter for he was able to seejust how the officials would answer the points brought up. He always put the letter in such a form as to forestall the possibility of their putting forth such answers. The combination of Griffin's town planning knowledge and Smith's scientific knowledge and diplomacy prevented disaster. Page 290 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 170 ====] Now with the new Ministers, the fight of the officials had to start from a new angle. This sort of thing went on till in 1916 this remarkable thing happened. A Royal Commission was demanded by two Ministers of the Crown, the Minister of Home Affairs permitting the Minister of the Post Office to call for a Royal Commission on the Home Affairs Department, and nine solid months of evidence piled up such a case against the officials that Griffin was able to work effectively in the development of Canberra for three years at the end of which time the plan was Gazetted which meant there could be no deviation from it without an act of Parliament. Only one other Royal Commission in the British Empire has ever given a verdict against the officialdom. [Note: WBG won the Canberra design competition in 1912 under the Andrew Fisher government (King O'Malley, Minister of Home Affairs). But he first came to Australia and was appointed Director of Design and Construction under the Joseph Cook government (June 1913 to September 1914; W.H.Kelly, acting Minister of Home Affairs). This administration was replaced by a new Fisher government (September 1914 to October 1915; W.O. Archibald, Minister of Home Affairs). In October 1915 came the first of four successive William Morris Hughes governments (O'Malley, Minister of Home Affairs, and William Webster, Postmaster-General, in the first government). In the summer of 1916 a Royal Commission, headed by Wilfred Blacket, was appointed to review the planning for the Federal Capital.The Commissioner reported his findings in the spring of 1917.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 171 ====] IN ROYAL COMMISSIONS In Royal Commissions we find a most curious state of affairs. The Government is helpless before the Judiciary and this in the affairs that are supposed to be of most vital concern to the community. There is no court or judge before whom they can take their cases so they have to go from pillar to post askingthis judge and that if they will be so kind as to take on this case. Frequently every one of the supreme judges will refuse to take on a Royal Commission. Then sometimes no State judge will act. Then the Government goes hunting about for a barrister who will be willing to act. Naturally in a case that looks bad for the officials it will be extremely difficult to find anyone willing to take it on as, if a judgment against the officials is rendered, it means the end of that judge's career and if the truth is plain to thepublic it may be very trying to have to render a judgment in their favor. The system is one which presupposes that one will not be inclined to accept the position unless it has been made worth his while by one side or the other. As a rule all the favors are in the hands of the bureaucrats. Again the system is one that promotes corruption.

August 3, 1939 Mr. James Alexander Smith, one of the greatest engineers Australia has produced, whose visitors in years gone by have included nearly every outstanding man of science and engineering who has come toAustralia. When he left the Railways he went into private practice as a consultant and his fame gradually spread all over Australia and beyond. There is not an engineer in Melbourne today who does not speak of him with immense respect. As a consulting engineer he was responsible for works of considerable magnitude in Victoria and beyond. Thirty years ago the Government appointed him engineer member of a committee of engineer, architect and surveyor, who selected W.B. Griffin's prize winning plan for the city of Canberra from a number of plans received from all over the world. Early in the century he was president for four years or the Victorian Institute of Engineers. The last paper he read before the Institute revealed his celebrated plan for roofing over the Flinders Street railwayyards. There are many in Melbourne who believe that his plan will one day be carried out. Mr. Blacket [Note: Wilfred Blacket, Royal Commissioner] should be held in high honor in the history of his country.

The fundamental requirements are:- 1st - How to facilitate FREE ENTERPRISE 2nd - How to arouse and implement ENTHUSIASM for production, always increasing enthusiasm in individuals while preventing their taking unfair advantage of others. The METHOD is to search out the obstacles in the way of attaining the above. 1st - What form of GOVERNMENT facilitates these ends. 2nd - What steps other than political should the community take.The two elements upon which increased employment and production of wealth depend are HUMAN ABILITIES and ACCESS TO NATURE These two offer endless opportunities for employment if access to them is not shut off by some MONOPOLISTIC POWER. Our problem is to show how to get maximum from these 2 without menace to the future. What form of SOCIAL ORGANIZATION most facilitates the maximum employment without menace to future humanity, menace such as devastation of the wilds of the United States during the past.What measures must we take to attain our ends. Page 293 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe Economic system is really running ahead in this realm for it has established the system of DIVISION OF LABOR which gives maximum and cheapest production. This is about the only up to date element in our communities. Here, with no intrusion of morals, Altruism has established itself forin this system each one produces for someone else. Humanity becomes an inter-dependent Unity. Morals, as we shall see, belong in the Political Realm, in the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 176 ====] maintenance of Equity, and as yet only in America has the Political Organ written that into its constitution. EMPLOYMENT IS A WORLD ISSUE. The question of its attainment must go beyond the borders of the nations or we shall be faced with wars which will continue with increasing ferocity so long as mechanical genius continues to develop unless - Therefore our first question, the urgent issue of the present moment is:- 1st- What changes in community organization should be made in this the best form, the Congressional, found only in the United States? This is urgent since there seems to be a subterranean influence working for the perpetuation of the worst of all forms of government since all kinds of tyranny can screen themselves behind it - the Parliamentary form, the froth of which comes up even in our American Universities. It took a war of Revolution for the United States to free itself from that form. It is dust in the eye to say that it was a King from which we were escaping. The writers of Our Constitution knew the evils of the Parliamentary System of theirown experience. This is the most urgent question in the reconstruction of the world at the close of this war. It is urgent also since now the Oriental peoples (whose numbers reach the billion mark) are quite equal to the Occidentals (who number but a few million) in intellectual, scientific and mechanical ability. The present war has thoroughly awakened them to the issue of EMPLOYMENT. A quarter of a century of life under each form, the Congressional and the Parliamentary, has made clear the radical difference between the two which is understood by almost no one, yet is the chief issue today as it was in our first war. It is the basic issue of employment [Note: ==== Beginning of page 177 (table of contents) ====] LEONARD CHAMBERS & DRYGOODS BUILDING . MELBOURNE [Note: Adjacent to the Leonard House is the White Sales Building.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 178 ====] Page 294 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoas it is the issue between concentrated Power and Democracy. 1st- Only under the Congressional form do the people have the opportunity, if they choose to use it, of selecting their Executive. The electoral system [Note: US Electoral College?], a hang-over from the past, should be ended. The power of amending the constitution puts that in the reach of the masses of the people. 2nd- Under the Parliamentary system the powers behind the scenes can determine the Executive from the start or at any time after the election by throwing out the elected party whenever they want to which gives then a powerful influence over them even without overthrowing them. They vote as they are toldto vote or out they go. And the whole complicated and expensive business of election has to be gone through again. No wonder the people are dejected. I know one man who was under 7 different ministers during the 7 years of his employment by the Government, partly through changes forced on the Cabinet, several through the throwing out of the whole majority party. This means that after the war Americans should use every possible means to direct the reorganization of Europe toward the Congressional form, and the basic principle should be laid down as the maintenance of Equity. Nowhere but in America is this the intention of government. The next step should be to eliminate the power of granting monopolies from the Political realm. Whatever is done in this realm should be by the Abilities Organ. The Political - the central organ - would have the task and the power of preventing inequity. The power to throw out Congressmen who fail to do what they are elected to do could be attained in the Congressional form by an amendment giving the right of recall. This would not be advisable in the case of the President as his function is executive which requires [Note: ==== Beginning of page 179 ====] continuity. A fixed term and the reward of re-election if he has served well will meet the requirements in this case. He is not a law maker though he has advisory functions. With the form of the Political government correct and its function simply to maintain EQUITY we turn to the ABILITIES ORGAN:- With local groups - somewhat of the nature of parent and teacher organizations - and inter-organized to meet various wider needs than only the control of education, purposes could be effected which would center neither on making warriors nor serfs out of the mass of the people.Capacities could be highly developed and efficiency enormously increased and the whole field of education broadened and extended to meet the requirements of men throughout their lives . The collection of the unearned increment in land values in the hands of these groups (the Political safeguarding Equity)would provide education throughout the lifetime of the citizenry so that any changes in employment due to new inventions or other factors could be provided for by opening opportunities for education in allfields throughout man's life instead of his being thrown out of work or reduced to lower standards of living. Page 295 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoHaving recognized that in the Political Realm the idea of Equity is the opposite of Welfare which but leads to war since it rests on the idea that might is right and that conquering a country is a benefit to the citizens of the conquering country, we look at the realm of:- ECONOMICS:- and having recognized the Community's obligation to free the obstacles from the way of every man's developing his own abilities in his own way we turn our attention to the ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION of the Community which has to function in a totally different realm to meet the bodily needs of men. In this everyone in the community must be included as he is concerned either as [Note: ==== Beginning of page 180 ====] producer or consumer, as manager or worker, agriculturist or technician.The period following the founding of America has developed an ECONOMIC life which is essentially a community affair since it is based on division of labor. It is now plain that economic problems cannot be solved as individual concerns. To meet the bodily needs is now a community affair and requires a Community organization. This can function wholesomely only if it is independent of the Political organ.Its laws are entirely different. Business cannot be run democratically. There can be no efficiency inbusiness run by majority votes. Its law is MUTUALITY not Equity. An ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION should consist of the total citizenry, not organized democratically but consisting of representatives of all types of economic associations and with the exact knowledge which comes from experience in economic affairs. With the liaison of the Political and Economic organizations broken down, the Political organ can function freely in the maintenance of Equity as it does in the problem of the traffic on our streets. The concept of a united States of Europe or of the World is purely fantastic at present since different groups of people do not have the same moral standards. But that they could function together in an Economic Organ for mutual advantage is a sound principle in business dealings. It can start in a Nation. Where is the easiest place in the world to put that concept into practice? America should take theinitiative. Though we must have different Political units, when it comes to the Economic Organ we can, without confusion, have units either corresponding to National boundaries or consisting of several units, say the Americas and China, or a WORLD ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION [Note: ==== Beginning of page 181 ====] which would be the soundest of all for then we should have that type of organization where things are made and sold within one and the same boundary of which the U.S. as an example (in contradiction [Note: contradistinction?] to Britain) one where the manufacturer sells to his employees, which of itself tends to the maximum wages, lowest cost and highest standard of living in the community as a whole. To effect the separation of these two - the political and the economic - would not be difficult here, at Page 296 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoleast comparatively speaking. Organization is the peculiar genius of the American people. There should of course be no trying to bring this about by political means. We cannot expect a King to cut off his own head. Economics is the realm of buying and selling - I sell to you because it is to my advantage to get rid of a thing. You buy because it is to your advantage to have it. The advantage is MUTUAL. So MONEY, the implement of EXCHANGE, should be in the control of the ECONOMIC ORGAN where it would be made to measure real values so that inflation would be as impossible as in the barter system. These three functions cannot be fulfilled by one organ without disease, the evidence of which we certainly see in our present communities, It is as impossible as it would be for the individual human being to carry out his three functions of digesting, circulation and thinking without the three organizations of the stomach, the heart and the brain.

He was one of the group of creative thinkers which 20th century science would lead us to expect to arise from a region ruled by that Ether from which all new forms arise - the chemical ether. Warmth & Light are centrifugal forces. Sound & Magnetism are condensing forces. I myself was well described by a friend of Mother's into whose charge I had been placed when a child for a bit of art instruction. A friend asked her if I were an artist. She said, \"No but if she makes up her mind to be one she will be one.\" When I was born Venus followed the Sun. My destiny evidently was to prepare myself in all those fields of art which would make me a good slave to my husband in his creative work. Since the creative forces in a woman naturally turn to sacrifice it was my great joy to the end to fulfill this function as best I could. The general verdict seemed to be that I did it well. When, afterGriffin's death in India, I returned to Australia and called on Mr. James Alexander Smith he said, \"No one can replace Mr. Griffin,\" then after a pause, \"unless it is you,\" and I replied, \"No I could not replace him but I was a very useful slave to him in his work.\" Griffin's appointment as Federal Director was for 3 years. Those years were a perpetual battle, one might say against an Empire. During those years it was continual warfare always with the subtleassistance of Mr. Smith, battling with the Works Committee and finally with the Royal Commission, the second one of the only two ever to condemn the officialdom. During these years and the succeeding years Griffin carried on a successful private business with a group of loyal, capable and devoted young people. Life was never dull. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 187 ====] Dear Mother - Mr. Anderson is the engineer Walt is using at Canberra who was a tremendous help to Walt and to Mr. [Note: William] Webster (Member of the Cabinet) who carried through the Royal Commission on Canberra - only one other in history where the verdict was given against the officials. Mr. Anderson though a surveyor for many years in England is debarred from practicing his profession in this country till he has served a full time of apprenticeship for 3 years in some surveyor's office here in Australia! In such petty ways, lacking in reality, do they try to make themselves believe they are anindependent people. After their visit with us we sent some snap shots of the infants to Mrs. Anderson and the following is a copy of the answer she sent us which I thought might amuse you. For fear you might not catch it I'll inform you that she is referring to me and the impromptu dinner I gave them. Oh! Alstan and Miriam:- Cherubic and Seraphic imps. Ye alone were powerful enough to rouse me from a drowsy wousy afternoon bye-bye just 15 minutes ago, and make the kindred spirit that lies like a Page 301 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoforgotten germ in an old carcass, spring to life and smile. Alstan (Lippincott), you are a perfect Lippincott and if you do not set the Thames, I mean the Mississippi, on fire some day I shall be disappointed. Miriam (Elgh), set your face toward the stars and you will draw all men to you, and youhave it in you to be ambitious to gain either souls or hearts. Which will it be I wonder. Anyway I am the happier this day for knowing there are Lippincotts and Elghs in the world so you have begun to make good. But above you, surrounding you, floating ever and again before my vision is an enchanting wraith of which I must try to tell you. It is a Spirit and Body. It cannot be seen and ever forgotten. Did you everlook into a lake that had formed in a crater, trying vainly to see the bottom, or gazed piercingly up into the \"Coal Sack\" for a beyond? I see not what the soul in me yearns for there, but I have almost caught it in those Eyes. Life is too full of living to look [Note: ==== Beginning of page 188 ====] often into the Heights and Depths; so I veil those things which I have seen there, and talk of pots and pans and cabbages and kings. As I saw her - flitting, darting, flashing from barrow (Australian for fruit stand) to barrow in Collins Street - the only seeable thing in Collins Street, garbed in restful blue, a saffron scarf waving and curving round her head in the evening sunset breeze;- in the seething 6 o'clock cauldron of Collins Street her form alone alluring, obliterating the ruck and muck drew our gaze. She invited us to feast with her, and the magic of her tongue together with the verve and abandon with which she entered into the game,made us dizzy and oblivious of our numbers and the trouble we would give and she would take to make us enjoy the game. Oh that all dinners were as enjoyable in the making and the taking as that one. (This was when we were living in the Doll house \"Pholiota\" in the same yard with the Lippincotts M.M.G.) Almost thou persuadest me to be a socialist. We should not eat that which we do not work for or prepare, or at leastlook on at the preparation, and into the fires slumberous in Those Eyes of which there were fitful glimpses. The powers of that Witch Goddess! We each smile with pleasant memories in our eyes when we think of the evening with our Director and Directress. And even the real Socialist present (referring to the chauffeur) had, by the time our hostess had graciously bowed him out, learned somewhat of culturefrom the atmosphere of an Aristocrat-Socialist. This was apparent to the woman who sees but cannot do. (You see it is hard to get away from the class idea. Democracy is a word of which Australians - Europeans - do not know the meaning. M.M.G.) Alstan and Miriam, dear infants, you have something to climb to. Laugh and grow fat and enjoy your little day. Happiness within and without to you all - Griffins and Lippincotts and Elghs. Faithfully yours Ellen M. Anderson. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 189 ====] Page 302 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoCollins Street, Melbourne - 10 January, 1917 - Beloved Clarmyra [Note: daughter of MMG's sister, Georgine], Well I went over to Uncle Walter's Federal office after writing Mama Gene's letter and found him busy dictating. I suggested that it was fifteen minutes till train time. No! he said and pulled out hiswatch which had stopped. He still thought it was about two. You can see where we would have been if I had waited for him to come for me. We got our train and were met at the station by the Russels who took us up in their car to their house on the mount, a lovely place on the side of a gully, their yard going down a hundred feet to a running stream, and a fine view across to Melbourne whose lights we could see at night. A three hour walk next morning, two little girls along, nine years old, and a long one the next morning climbing to the top of the mount, this time only grown ups, not nearly so much fun; and the third day all day in the auto, the little girls and three other guests. A very jolly day going through some of the old mining districts. I felt that I had got quite a glimpse of Australia. I had great fun picking blackberries on the place and kept the family supplied, also raspberries and currants and great big delicious gooseberries, and lettuce and peas and onions from the garden. We had a very homey time and it was a great rest. I have just been over to the station to meet Walter who was to come home from Canberra this noon but he didn't come gosh darn him. If he comes tomorrow he'll probably have to go back the very next day yet there are things he'll probably have to come back for. He is going up with the Minister of HomeAffairs. That's the fourth change in Ministry he has had and we are wondering when the next change will happen. He sort of has to begin over at the beginning with each new Minister. However to each three steps backward we are still hoping there is one forward to the good. Only time will tell. Who cares. It's exceedingly funny at times, \"But for God's sake don't smile,\" one friend tells us; \"These people are British.\" [Note: ==== Beginning of page 190 ====] I don't suppose you remember that when you were a little tot your Mother used to tell you you couldn't cry, that crying wasn't allowed in flats, and you were quite obedient. But really that isn't half so bad as not being allowed to laugh. But even that isn't so bad as the fate of a little girl I passed on the street some time ago. She was sitting beside a beggar and I heard him tell her \"Now cry,\" and she had to start crying so that people would give him money. A pretty hard way for that tiny girl to earn money for the grownups wasn't it. Much love from Auntie. 1917 - January, 12. Dear Mother, I am taking things very easy at the office now, and not hurrying with the breakfast dishes to come down town with Walter, though his toilet takes so much longer than mine that it is not a serious task for me to get up and get breakfast and wash the dishes while he is getting ready to leave the house. And I am either taking a nap in the middle of the afternoon or leaving early andgoing home instead of waiting here at the office to dine at uncertain hours with Walter. He has to spend practically all his evenings as well as all day on his Federal work, frequently in consultations, instead of at his private office, so that my staying down gives me only a half hour with him as a rule to go over the private office work. Page 303 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoI am no longer trying to get an occasional lunch with him but am joining the family party in the office. We all of us get so sick of lunching out, especially in fly time, as no pains are taken at any of the restaurants to keep them out which makes the physical exercise of driving away the flies from your foodtoo strenuous for restfulness to say nothing of the damaging effect it had on one's appetite. This sounds almost like a family quarrel with my husband, but it's just an interlude of rational living for one half the family, in spite of the fact that the other half of the family cannot indulge. (The completion of the Cafe Australia for Mr. Lucas started a revolution in community services of this kind as did the plumbing of Newman College [Note: ==== Beginning of page 191 ====] of the sanitary methods and the Capitol Theatre in the theatrical world.) 1917 - February, 1 - Dear Mother, We think Mr. Wilson's [Note: President Woodrow Wilson's] speech to the Senate is magnificent. Our hope is that his motive is to be able to say to the European nations, \"You see that we are ready to give up just as much as you would have to do in disarming,\" as he could also say in internationalizing the Panama Canal along with the other canals of the world. Walter has beenaway all this week, the Royal Commission is still sitting on Canberra. We hope it is nearly over now. Though the Taylors [Note: Florence M. and George A. Taylor] are frantically libeling the Cafe Australia, thinking no doubt that if they make it disagreeable enough for each of our clients people will be afraid to employ us and since the whole population of this country is about that of a good sized city in the U.S. and everybody knows about everybody it is of course a fruitful field for gossip, but notbeing particularly cowardly ourselves we are not disturbing ourselves in the least about these things. They may know their public and then again they may not. Walter is just as peaceful and well and cheerful and energetic as ever and some very important things have been accomplished. We call him \"Protected of Heaven\" as he certainly seems to be in his bucking up against an Empire. I wish Mrs. [Note: Mary?] Wilmarth would come over with you to visit us. I think we could make her comfortablesimple as our quarters are. Oceans of love from your daughter. 1917 - February, 12 - Melbourne, Herald - clipping - Mr. [Note: William] Webster, the Post Master General, explained the connection of Mr. W.B. Griffin with the designing of the new automatic telephone exchange in Sydney, and of his charge against the Commonwealth of \u00a3192 of plans, etc. Mr. Webster stated that after inspection of the original design (of the Department officials) [Note: handwritten parenthetical note by MMG] he found it to be extravagant and lacking in co-ordination. He asked Mr. Griffin to look into the matter. He did so, and drew up a plan saving a floor and a half, representing \u00a37500. He was also assured by Mr. Griffin that the General Post Office could be remodeled giving much additional space at a comparatively small cost. Mr. Griffin's [Note: In the first paragraph MMG is probably referring to President Wilson's speech severing diplomatic relations with Germany over that country's decision to begin unrestricted submarine warfare.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 192 ====] Page 304 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoadvice had been most valuable, and he was rightly entitled to one and a quarter percent commission on the original building. The charge was moderate and the money was well spent. (I should have included the revolutionizing of Post Offices as he did with the Post Offices of Sydney and Melbourne, and ofoffice buildings in general with the Capitol Theatre building which was the first tall building over there though it did go only to the height of ten stories.) 22 February 1917 - Dearest Clarmyra, Washington's birthday and tomorrow is Mama Gene's [Note: Georgine Mahony Smith's]. I wish I could help decorate her table with a great bunch of Amaryllis lilies such as we are getting here now. I had a surprise party on my birthday. Genevieve [Note: Lippincott], when she was leaving Sunday evening said, \"You and Walter come over to dinner with us Wednesday.\" I thought she was crazy to expect Walter but said I would get him to come if I could. Afterward it dawned on me that it would be the 14th, my birthday. Well Walter managed it though he had to skip away right after dinner. It's a pleasant boarding house where they are and they arranged for a private room for the party so it was very jolly. Genevieve hadbeen down to our flat the day before and had made a cake and had so removed all her traces that I didn't know she had been there and they had also made ice cream and candy. Tell Mrs. Raftis I did get her Christmas letter and nonsense book about us and we did have a good laugh and it did feel good. First I laughed by myself and afterward I laughed to see Walter laugh as he read it. I shall get around to writing to her as soon as I can. The Royal Commission ended yesterday. So thankful to have it over with - nine months on the witness stand. The Commissioner's report will not be in for a while yet so we can tell nothing about results till then. The few moments of relief in the tension we are going to make use of in returning some of our social obligations. We have made some wonderful friendships, Mr. and Mrs. Moore and her [Note: ==== Beginning of page 193 (table of contents) ====] 2 STORY DWELLING . KNITLOCK WALL & ROOF TILES [Note: The structure is the Paling House in Toorak (Malvern), Victoria.] [Note: ==== Beginning family the Palings, little Adela Pankhurst, etc., etc. Are going calling tonight and tomorrow, and the next night we are going to invite some people to the house. The great difficulty with that is that it isimpossible to invite any two families at the same time. They are all either enemies or of different classes or something or other. Such a country. However our flat wouldn't hold many so that relieves the queer look of it a little. We had no bowl and pitcher in our house so last week I decided I wouldn't put off any longer getting something a guest could wash in. Plumbing is unknown in Australia even in Sydney and Melbourne.We had made up our minds we simply would not have an ordinary bedroom set. They are so ugly. So I looked about and found something I thought would do - a large flat flower bowl and two water bottles Page 305 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoto match. So I went up to the Federal Office and made Walter go over to see if it suited him. But he went me one better and we got a lovely bronze bowl and a big bronze flower vase for a slop jar and two blue china water bottles. It makes a very handsome set and really cost but very little more than the ordinaryugly things for which they charge three to five pounds for the very cheapest. Now we are going to get a couch cover for the bed in that room which will make it look quite pretty. Lovingly, Aunt. 23 February, 1917. - Dearest Gene [Note: Georgine, MMG's sister], Many happy returns of the day. As I have been thinking back we must be just about the age of Mother when she was plugging for the principal's exam with Mrs. Young at which time a new career began for her and for Chicago schoolsunder her influence with her whole school an art gallery and the music unbelievable to the Superintendents and her continued courses with her teachers, initiating what afterward became University Extension courses. She certainly has done a splendid life's work since then so after I get a good rest I am going to start to emulate her. There has been another change of ministry, the fifth Walt has been under. Talk about the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 195 ====] unstable governments of South America! I am however obliged to confess that Walt has been the chief cause of the overthrows. There is to be an election in October so there may be still another change then. We are thankful that Mr. [Note: William] Webster is still in the Cabinet. He is a splendid man, a tremendous worker and one of our main stays. Last night instead of starting on our social rounds we had a quiet evening, a leisurely dinner and just sat around and read - most satisfying. We are vegetarians when we dine chez nous. I can hardly say with propriety that I am delighted at the prospect of inheriting Alice's three little girls since that would entail the death of Alice and Clara, but I certainly would be delighted to have the girls. Love to my dear sister. 1917 - February, 26 - Mother Darling, Saturday Walter and I did have a sensation. He had promised the afternoon to me to go over the planting plans for the Newman College or perhaps even to take a walkthrough the Botanic Gardens, so I went for him at lunch time, waited around while he finished one thing and another. Then after lunch he said he must still see his Minister who was leaving for Adelaide that afternoon at four. We tried to get to his hotel but were blocked by a Win the War parade. Then we aimed for the station but did not know the route of the Parade and every turn we took we found ourselves blocked. Finally at twenty to four I said let's try breaking through which we succeeded in doing thougha woman said \"shame\" to me at my irreverence. Well we made the train though breathless. Then as trams were crowded we walked home through the Botanic Gardens, always a treat, got and ate supper and scooted back to town for a movie and it was a sensation. How the Censor ever allowed it I don't see as it was a most powerful pacifist sermon though of course there's no telling whether the audience took it that way. It was \"Intolerance,\" a magnificent spectacle which you certainly must see when it comesyour way. It shows four episodes - Babylon - Jerusalem at the time of Christ - Massacre of St. Bartholomew - and Modern. Certainly no one could ever call ours [Note: ==== Beginning of page 196 ====] Page 306 of 923 Supplement to America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoa civilization after that comparison, with nothing but grime and ugliness to show. Cyrus with his \"Kill, kill, kill,\" and Catherine de Medici with her \"We must destroy them or we will be destroyed,\" as shown in the play slapped you in the face after the spectacle in the afternoon with the enthusiasm of the crowdson the streets and lined up on Parliament House steps - the little wizened Minister of Defense and the big fat Minister of the Navy sitting there and clapping their hands over the sending off of all the young men of the community to \"Kill, kill, kill.\" The picture went even so far as to show a bit of modern warfare. It doesn't seem possible that the point wasn't plain. But when one once gets the beam in his eye that it is virtuous to kill rather than be killed there doesn't seem to be any vision left to see anything. It isamazing to see how quickly the cloak of assumption of Christianity drops off and the real religion of the people shows itself which is hate your enemy and destroy anything or anybody if it is to your advantage to do so, and certainly destroy anything you are afraid of and be afraid of most everything. Walter has been at home to dinner every night for a week and I am going to skip along now and get a meal for him. I do think you should resign and see no reason why life shouldn't be just as full of interestand enjoyment out of school as in it. I certainly could keep you busy if you were over here, and know the thousand things you will be interested in if you stay where you are. The letters sound as if you had got along without serious colds at least through the early winter. Hope the winter will pass without catching you. Your devoted daughter, Marion. 12 March, 1917 - Dear Mrs. Griffin, You've no idea, I'm sure, how desperately I'm in need of your slender, but capable and sustaining shoulder, to keep on during these days of uncertainty. I think war, war, war morning noon and night and consequently I row all day long with the Australians on the subject, and have developed into such a termagant that I will be an outcast in my native land when I reach [Note: ==== Beginning of page 197 ====] it. None of my erstwhile friends will have anything to do with me. I have had bitter and hostile words with Miss Elsie Simpson who has come out here from New York to be the Secretary of Professor Irvine of the Sydney University. She thinks (and so does Prof. Irvine) that in the sleekness of our prosperity we have lost our souls, in fact that the day will come \"When the people will cry for Wilson's blood because he has not helped England spread the doctrine of humanity .\" She is sure that it is a sign of our degeneracy when a man like [Note: Theodore] Roosevelt the mighty is not called upon to take the reins of government over this desperate period. She thinks England is fighting for Belgium and defends the shooting of the Irish rebels - an act that even the English government repudiated. She says frankly that the mothers of the \"lower\" classes on the whole do not mind giving up their sons and that they have children after the fashion of a cat having kittens. Unfortunately she seems to believe that I will wield some influence when I get home and has undertaken to convert me, pressing Prof. Irvine and Mr.Adams, editor of the Red Page of the Bulletin, into her service to help with my conversion. She pursues me with invitations which always end in insult, and finally the 100% Irish in me sloughed off its pretense to civilization and I let go. If she only wouldn't call herself an American. When she says she's an aristocrat I always think of your definition of \"something that comes to the top.\" Aren't I awful? I am going home Mrs. Griffin on the next boat which is the Sierra sailing March 21st, and I'm going to do my bit to the best of my ability in the interests of peace, disarmament and freedom of our Beloved (I Page 307 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoguess I should say my Beloved, shouldn't I) from entangling alliances. That sounds like a mighty big order but you know every little bit helps, and unless I have a moral awakening between now and then I'm going to be helpin' any way that comes to hand and if, by using some of these nasty newspapercuttings that I have gathered [Note: ==== Beginning of page 198 ====] STONE DWELLING . KITCHEN SIDE OF GRIFFIN DWELLING AT CASTLECRAG [Note: The structure is the Grant House.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 199 ====] during my stay here, in communities where the people are obsessed with Anglo-mania, I can further the cause I'm afraid I'm not above doing so. I wish you would tell me how to specialize along this line. I've good instincts which suit me fine but won't hold water in an argument, you know. I'm studying the two books you recommended and am reading, reading, and trying to think - the latter with discouraging results. I am sending along under separate cover the Canberra story and I will be grateful if you willlook it over for me. At Manly I had a lovely room right over the surf. How the Creator must have loved humanity when he conceived the harbor of Sydney, I have just been to see \"Intolerance\" which you must see when it comes to Melbourne. I do not know, however, why I should recommend it to you because you are all tolerance and it will break your heart. Most sincerely yours, Margaret Murphy 1917 - March 14, Dear Miss Murphy, Don't get discouraged. I met Miss Simpson myself. I couldn't talk to her because she was so hopelessly superficial but Prof. Irvine I have a respect for as he did stand up for the right - my side of course - in an issue I was fighting in Sydney with the Town Planning Association though our points of view were far apart in many things but it was at his house that several University professors in the very early days of the war insisted that physical prowess was the proof ofthe superiority of a people (in the course of condemning the U.S. for not coming in of course) and when I asked if they meant that if Germany won in the war that would prove the superiority of the German people they said \"yes.\" I must impress upon you that it is not undemocratic to object to seeing a lovely prospect defiled by a lot of chairs which stupid humans clutter a place up with. Democracy, the \"highest ideal the human mindhas ever climbed to\" requires nothing ugly nor destructive nor mean. As to information about Australian flora, it is almost impossible to get it. I will send you a little book on Acacias which will confirm this statement of mine. There are botanical books of course but it is not possible to get much for landscape work from [Note: ==== Beginning of page 200 ====] Page 308 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothem. Just as Mr. Griffin was one of the pioneers in the use of native plants in the U.S. which has since become so popular, so here he has had to gather most all of the data necessary for native planting himself. Ever since his arrival we have used every possible opportunity for learning the points of thewonderfully beautiful native flora, decorative, soil requirements, seasons of blooming, etc. I wish I had shown you the volume we have compiled, 8 inches by 16 inches by 4 inches thick. It has been some task but lots of fun. We have got mostly from direct observation assisted, when we first came over, by Miss Leplastrier in weekend walks, and other botanists from whose knowledge of plants Mr. Griffin's landscape questions piled up information that they would not include in their written works. Also fromconstant watching of the very fine Botanical gardens of Sydney and Melbourne through all seasons aided by such botanical reference books as those of Guilfoile and Miss Sulman who have written popular botanies, Cambage and others. I don't know whether I gave you a copy of a talk I gave in Sydney on Citizenship. One page of that takes up a hurried summary of the points of some of the lovely avenue trees and I'll write a bit on the decorative plantings for Canberra. The little I have seen of you has been a great pleasure but I am not sorry you are hurrying home. A little inside glimpse of the system which is universal among white folks outside of the States may help to keep them from falling into some of the pitfalls. I do love my folks even if I have no patriotism and I do hope they will assist in preventing the destruction of democratic movement in the world. Please tell President Wilson when you see him not to renege on his principles that we have been so proud of, thatslurs and insults have meant nothing to us any more than they would coming from any mad man. Affectionately, Marion Mahony Griffin 1917 - May, 18 - Dear Clarmyra [Note: MMG's niece], Your letter came yesterday while I was in the midst of making a chocolate cake to celebrate Genevieve's [Note: Genevieve Lippincott's] birthday. As it came to the office I had Miss Ullyatt bring it out to [Note: ==== Beginning of page 201 ====] me and fed her on cake and frosting too thin to have set yet while I sat down to read my letters from you and Gene [Note: Georgine Mahony Smith]. I hope she enjoyed the cake as much as I enjoyed your letters. I realize now that I can no longer call you dear babe, since you are now entering High School. Remember to take manual training even if you are the only girl in the class. I am glad you have had achance to hear both your Uncle Jerome's point of view and mine. There are always two points of view - one right. It is of vital importance that one should familiarize oneself with both and take upon himself the responsibility of deciding which is right. I am sending you a pamphlet Roy's [Note: Roy Lippincott's] mother sent him speaking of their \"adventurous belief in the Christian principle of human brotherhood.\" Undertaking to live according to that principle is a great and thrilling adventure in whichthe Quakers have often proved, in the most surprising circumstances, its absolute efficiency. Yesterday a birthday party. Roy [Note: Lippincott] come home at about half past four and made the strawberry ice cream. One can't buy decent ice cream in Australia. Walter as usual came in the last minute after the guests had arrived and when all the work was done. He has enough good excuses for us to let him off the domestic work. When I have guests now I have my Mrs. McEwan come in to wash Page 309 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoup the dishes. As there is only one entrance which opens right into the living room, we put a stool outside out bedroom window and she crawls in so that she reaches the kitchen without anyone knowing she is there. She is as pleasant and cute about this as in other ways wanting to make everything run assmoothly as possible. She is a pretty woman and her name is Kathleen, anyway she is all right. We call her our domestic engineer and in applying for jobs as a charwoman she tells folks that that is what her present employers call her. Good wishes on your graduation and birthday month. Aunt. 1917 - October, 29 - Melbourne - Dear Gene [Note: Georgine Mahony Smith], Adelaide is a pretty city and I was glad to get a glimpse of it. If they had had sense enough [Note: ==== Beginning of page 202 ====] to do the same stunt with Melbourne it would have been beautiful - set it back at the foot of the hills leaving the port itself to the flat strip of coast. You have to take a train from Adelaide to Port Adelaide. Its like Los Angeles and its sea port town. I had implored Walter not to attend this conference. We know the men who were running it and I hate to have him soil his skirts by having anything to do with them or lend their assemblies the dignity of his name. However he isn't so particular about the skirts of hiscoat and refuses to foresee evil intent. If anyone ever lived up to the principle of hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil it is he. It was a disgraceful business all right and carried with a high hand. They are trying to pass a law which will grant a huge monopoly, destroying all private or local enterprise in architecture or town-planning. Walter did what he could to stem the tide and get some semblance of democratic principle instilled intothe resolutions or into the consciousness of the assembly but nobody in this community believes in those lines. People love to put their necks under a yoke. No argument was allowed. It was absurd to call it a conference. It was a Sunday school picnic with nice little kindergarten talks all arranged for the supposed experts to listen to. The only democratic suggestion that was made was by the Governor General whose speech closed the conference - the only one with a grain of sense in it. 1917 - October, 29 - Dear Robins - Delighted to get the Round Robin (a letter which circled the world between 8 of us Boston M.I.T. [Note: Massachusetts Institute of Technology] girls from 1894 and still does in 1945). For the first time I am not sending it back on the same boat leaving within a week. This time it has to wait for the next boat probably delaying it three weeks. In the first place the Censor delayed it and then I went to Adelaide for a week where it was sent to me. This is the third of Australia'scities I have had a chance to visit. Walter had to go down as a delegate to a Town Planning conference so I tagged along for a lark. If the conference hadn't been [Note: ==== Beginning of page 203a ====] such a scandalous piece of business we should have had a very pleasant time. City lovely, entertainment most hospitable but it leaves a horrible taste in one's mouth to see things being put over the poor innocents. It's a city of flowers all right and a perfect climate - nestled at the foot of lovely hills from whose slopes your look over the city on to the port town in the shore, and the Harbor. The last day we Page 310 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoran away from the conference and took a long walk over the hills getting close to the wild flowers and getting photographs of some most exquisitely beautiful, superb trees. The courts of this community have decided that no clients of mine need pay for my services (a part of the game of course) so I am notbothering my head in my accustomed architectural field, i.e., the practice of architecture in my own name) but am amusing myself with the flora than which there is none more interesting nor beautiful. It is still impossible to write of our experiences here. We are sheep marked for the slaughter but go on cheerfully bleating and they haven't found our bare heel yet. When they do we'll hop into some other field. I hope you girls are all reading history. I started in the minute the war began and I've learned a fewthings I can tell you. From what I hear the people of the U.S. are the most ignorant in the world in that field. One book was by a Maori of New Zealand. [Note: This last sentence is handwritten.] Walt's sister [Note: Genevieve] and her husband Roy Lippincott and two year old little girl, Alstan, have just finished building a toy of a house in the prettiest suburb of Melbourne - Heidelberg - on the bank of the River Yarra and looking down and out over the hills to the mountains, and we are now tucking inplants as fast as we can. In the next letter I shall be able to send photos of the Catholic College at the Melbourne University which is now drawing close to completion. It is sure a stately building. We are planting the shrubbery there too, ten acres of it, as the grading is now in shape. One doesn't have to wait long here either for results so in a year or so it will be looking very lovely. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 203b ====] We are trying to encourage the folks to use more of the native plants. They do so hang on to things grown \"at home\" which most of them are no good here compared with the natives. Bushels of love, Marion Mahony Griffin 1917 - December, 20 - Heidelberg - Dearest Clarmyra, Walter (the gentleman with the pink hair as you used to call him) and I are staying at the Lippincotts for a few weeks now - until Genevieve gets a girl, and until the planting is done. We have all been digging to beat the band. I myself put in 83 geraniumslips one day, and Walter and George Elgh who was here over Sunday put in a lot of shrubs, etc., all Saturday and Sunday. Walt has started a seed bed which will keep us busy for a long time if all goes well. Roy spends his time mostly on a vegetable garden of which Walt is very scornful but which the rest of us thoroughly approve. We're putting in lemon and orange and grape fruit trees and almonds and passion fruit and logan berries. Fortunately things grow for Walt so we're likely to have some garden. I have had an attack of the colly-wabbles [Note: collywobbles, gastrointestinal upset] and Walt has been away for ten days and won't be back for four more and I want my mama and my sister and my baby child. However I don't want them enough to risk their being mined [Note: their ship hitting a submarine mine, a submerged explosive?] so we'll have to make the best of it. But the days don't go swiftly when one has been sick and is alone and has been terribly disappointed. My what a lugubrious letter I amwriting. Was sorry Mr. King O'Malley (Minister of Home affairs in charge of Canberra) didn't see you all but he slipped across the States very quietly satisfied to see his brother and to eat ice cream and I am sure was glad to get back here which is really home to him now. He has been a Member of Parliament ever since there was a parliament and enjoys the game. If they could prove he is an American they could collect all his 15 years' salary. He says he was born in Canada though they lived in the U.S. just across Page 311 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright The Art Institute of Chicagothe line . [Note: ==== Beginning of page 204 (table of contents) ====] No. 14. THE TOWN OF HARVEY . ILLINOIS [Note: ==== Beginning of page 205 ====]SUBDIVISION OF 109 ACRES - WEST CHICAGO GEORGE V. HARVEY, GROVELAND AVENUE.By now we are beginning to realize the importance, the necessity, of unified control of large areas of land. This is one of the major problems we shall have so solve if our civilization is to remain healthy.Nothing short of the correct threefold organization of our communities can meet this requirement. There was such control in the days of the hill cities of Italy which are such outstandingly beautiful things. But that type cannot satisfy people who have once tasted this so very modern dish called \"equity.\" Nor can the other extreme which enabled the Political Organization to collect the total unearned increment solve this problem since that would make the Nation the owner of the land and the land valueswould be spent either in building up a powerful military organ or in pauperizing certain groups by doling out these moneys to those who on small acreages cannot compete in the market with those who handle great areas by mechanization. Only by adding two other organizations, one to effect Mutuality and one to effect Liberty, to the political whose only function is to effect Equity, can the management of our communities become so flexible asto be able to place large areas of land or large sums of money, unearned increment, in the hands of individuals of ability to give them control for designing and bringing about planned areas to meet the expanding needs of growing communities. We show you various attempts to bring about such important results but too often the weight thrown on the shoulders of individual owners has been too great for fruition, and splendid beginnings have cometo naught or dragged at an impossibly slow pace. Only in Canberra has the goal been reached and there only in one of the two branches, that of the layout of the system of circulation itself and here as [Note: ==== Beginning of page 206 ====] everywhere else lies the threat of consummated totalitarianism. The Harvey subdivision consists of 109 acres of land, 292 lots, 60 by 160 feet, the land varying from approximately level to rolling hills. This calls for curved streets to take full advantage of simpleconstruction of roads on easy grades and of the natural charm for the grouping of buildings. A church Page 312 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoand a Community House are at the top of the hill strategically approached from the station. All the blocks have interior parks and play fields, and all the street intersections have the silent cops [Note: policemen?] of park triangles making traffic safe. On the whole straight roads are a crime onsloping country just as on the whole curved roads are silly and confusing on flat land. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 207 ====] INITIAL . PLAN OF LEETON [Note: See Section II, No. 20 (below).] ROYAL COMMISSION In connection with the Federal Capital, Canberra, (accent on the Can) there were three major time and energy absorbing incidents. 1 - from 1914 - For months and years a Minister and Parliamentary Works Committee completely obstructive. 2 - in 1917 - A Royal Commission absorbing for 9 months the time and energy of two Ministers, of Mr. Griffin, andof the Home Affairs Officials. 3 - The next 3 years - Reappointment of the Director of Design and Construction, a drive to establish the road system and the focal centers. Then Mr. Griffin's resignation, Mr. [Note: William Morris] Hughes gazetting the plan which meant that nothing could be altered except by an act of Parliament. The only acts were for the removal of one or two roads the officials had introduced on the pretext that they were necessary for construction. On the 24th of June 1915, Mr. [Note: William Oliver] Archibald, Minister of Home Affairs, obtained Parliamentary authority to refer the City Railway and Dams for Ornamental Waters to the Public Works Committee. This meant endless months on the witness stand for Griffin. His amazing knowledge of allthe sciences connected with community planning, and they are endless, now served him well, for through all these years of quizzing by Officials and Experts they never caught him in an error though he made no pretense of infallibility nor of being expert in these various technical realms. What he asked for was to be allowed to employ certain experts to carry out the sewage system, etc. The system the officials put in later proved to be no good - a sewage farm method for which the soil was not proper. During the 3rd Ministry [Note: Cook, 1913-14; Fisher, 1914-15, Hughes, 1915- ] that Griffin was under a very astonishing thing happened. One of the Cabinet Ministers - Mr. [Note: King] O'Malley of the Home Affairs Department permitted one of the other Ministers to attack his Department, so a Royal Commission was called for by Mr. [Note: William] Webster, Page 313 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 208 ====] the Postmaster General, to investigate Mr. O'Malley's Department, the Home Affairs Department which was the one which had charge of the Federal Capital. The perfection of the ingenuity for deviltry of thewhole British machinery is again evidenced in the fact that no High Court Judge is required to take on the function of judge in a Royal Commission. Since the Federal Capital had been going on for some two years now, everyone knew it would not be easy to give the officials a clean slate and only once in the history of the Empire had a Royal Commission condemned the Civil Service. Those in the game knew also that life would no longer be easy for anyone who put himself wrong with Officialdom so every oneof the national Chief Justices refused to serve. Finally a barrister of Sydney [Note: Wilfred Blacket] was persuaded to take on the task. We ourselves are inclined to think that his failure to achieve conspicuous success later was probably due to the antipathies he doubtless aroused in giving judgments against the officials. Mr. Webster refused to have legal assistance to which he was entitled in carrying on the attack. He was one of those remarkable men whose personal qualities tend to blind our eyes to the nefarious nature of the British system. As a child in England, he had worked in the mines harnessed to a cart and on his hands and knees in the low channels he had dragged out the coal carts. He came to Australia in his youth and forewarned his prospective bride that the time would come when it might be hard for her to adjust her life to his when he became a Minister of the Crown which was his intention. He had achievedthat at just this critical time of Griffin's hitherto single handed fight (not that for there was always James Alexander Smith) against an Empire. For nine solid months Mr. Webster called up the officials and pounded at them until they had all exposed themselves so completely that no one who followed the evidence could come to any other conclusion than that expressed by Mr. Blacket in his report condemning all of the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 209 ====] heads concerned in the work of the Federal Capital. As a result of this achievement and under a sympathetic Minister of the Department, Griffin was able to get actual work done in the construction of the Capital City. For the first two years he had been up against a stone wall fighting, as he recognized, not individuals, but an institution. My purpose in presenting these dry chapters is to give my fellow citizens firsthand information of how Bureaucracy, established Bureaucracy, no matter how desirable it may seem in its early stages, really works. Great credit is due to this outstanding Britisher, Mr. Wilfred Blacket, for taking on this unwelcome and dangerous task. Upwards of 40,000 questions were put and answered and nearly 400 Exhibits, some very voluminous, were tendered in the evidence. The public, of course, got only such glimpses as were afforded by press quotations as evidence was given. The matter of the 400 foot planwas scarcely commented on. In fact I find no comments in the press except those officially inspired a year before the Commission began. In an interview with Mr. Archibald on the 9th December 1914, Griffin had informed him as follows:- Royal Commission on Federal Capital Administration, W.B. Griffin evidence:- Page 314 of 923 Supplement to of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoTo Mr. Archibald - I informed you that I had already worked out the railway levels, and that these were available to you, as also were the levels of the lakes and other features to which you then specifically referred. There was ready, I also notified you, you may remember, all the necessary information toenable the effective work to be proceeded with at once. Possibly consideration of these items involving, of course, the features directly dependent thereon, may be helpful to you at this juncture; if so they are at your disposal. Griffin - That letter conveyed the portion of what I put before the Minister which was omitted from the notes of the officers . The following letter from the Minister to me states that fact:- [Note: ==== Beginning of page 210 ====] From Mr. [Note: William Oliver] Archibald - Melbourne, 1st March, 1915 Dear Sir, Your communication of the 25th February is at hand pointing out that you intimated on 9th December last that you had available the levels of the Railway, Lakes and other features specially referred to in your design for the Federal Capital City. I cannot find any record in the correspondence of such an intimation, and so far as the notes made at the time and my recollection and that of the officerspresent are concerned you do not appear to have made such information clear at the interview I had with you on 9th December last. (Yet for a year following he refused to accept this information and continually called for a 400 foot to the inch plan which would be unnecessary whereas the 200 feet to the inch plan was already prepared sufficiently for various works. In fact the premiated plan was on the scale of 400 feet to the inch so theyalready had it.) Question number 230 - Walter Burley Griffin to Mr. [Note: William] Webster - It was repeatedly urged that the Minister was waiting for levels from me. The statement was made in Parliament and in the press in such a way as to create the impression that I was delinquent. My friends and people on the street were asking me, \"Why do you not meet the requirements of your Minister?\" All the time I was pressing onwith the work as fast as I could. The information which I was asked to supply involved a great deal more work than the Minister evidently realized, despite my repeated explanations as to the amount of work involved. If I had had a clear course this work would not have been interpolated [Note: interpellated?] at that time. It was unnecessary work and involved unnecessary delay. It was not my fault that delay occurred. I asked for assistance for this work and it was authorized in November.... That isthe only time when assistance was readily given (i.e., when it was on unnecessary work). It was specifically granted for the purpose of developing the plan which I said was not necessary. The effect of this assistance was only to perform a work which would have the result of delaying my work. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 211 ====] 1202 - Archibald to Griffin - Surely you could form the opinion that if a layman asked for a plan of the place, it was not essential for him to have all the drawings. That would be a matter for an engineer, not for me. Did you think that I was going through all the drawings? Page 315 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago(Contradiction. First wants one [Note: i.e., plan] engineers could work from but now says be wanted one that would simply satisfy the curiosity of a layman.) Griffin - But you asked me for a revised design, a complete plan which embraced all the works - works which could not be determined without the necessary investigations which would occupy a considerable time. 1203 - Archibald - And it took you six months? Griffin - You finally limited your request to work which I could supply to you within three or four months. 1204 - Archibald - After your letter of the 14th December, 1914, which I described as a bluff the other day I replied on the 19th December and asked for some levels of the major works - bridges, main avenues, railways, lakes, etc. Was I doing you an injustice when I said that you were anxious to give me information but in homeopathic doses? Griffin - I do not like the term \"homeopathic doses.\" I said that I could prepare the works individually for presentation to you but I could not prepare a plan showing the whole of them. 1205 - By the Commissioner [Note: Blacket] - The question is whether you withheld the full information you possessed and gave only inconsiderable parts of it? Griffin - I say emphatically that I did not withhold information. I was giving it as fast as it could be prepared. I was anxious to do so in order to facilitate the work. What I objected to was having to holdback the work pending the receipt of all these things which would take an unreasonable amount of time and occasion considerable expense and preliminary investigation. 1210 - Archibald - Then you could have given me a plan without going to Canberra? Griffin - I had the plans ready for you when you came into office. 1213 - Archibald - I have called your attention to the bluffing letter I received from you which appears on page 50 of the Parliamentary paper, and my [Note: ==== Beginning of page 212 ====] reply of the 19 December in which I asked for levels. To what should I attribute the long delay, from October to March in answering the simple request I made? Griffin - There was no delay. 1214 - Archibald - It took six months to get the levels?Griffin - Yes. The information that I had was at your disposal at any time. I offered my services at any time and offered to expedite any portion of the work which you wished to have expedited and you did Page 316 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagonot avail yourself of my offer. 1230 - Archibald - Would you be surprised to learn that it was the industrial situation which confronted the Government and myself that led me to ask you for this plan? Griffin - I did realize the situation and I strongly urged upon you that works in the City should be developed without any delay. 1232 - Archibald - Do you seriously contend that they could have been gone on with unless the Government had a plan of them. Griffin - I knew, as a matter of fact, that the Government had a plan of the city and what I was endeavoring to do was to prepare plans of works as rapidly as possible with the object of having them put in hand. 1232 - Archibald - You have already admitted that the Government had no plan with the levels, although the situation I have described was confronting them at that time? Griffin - You finally resolved your requests to me into a plan for levels generally extended over the city which I expedited to the utmost. I had to point out at the same time that that was not necessary to the putting in hand of works. The Government had a plan of the Capital before them and plans of any or all of the works that they desired should be gone on with, could be prepared for them. Any particular work could be investigated and worked out without delay but to hold up particular works, pending the completion of the designs of all and the determination of structural levels throughout, would seriouslydelay the progress of the Capital. 1234 - Archibald - Do you think I wanted the plan I asked for for any but the practical purpose of pushing on with the city? Griffin - You stated that, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 213 ====] I believe, to me; but I tried to point out that, in my opinion, that was not the most practical way in which to push on with the city. 1235 - Archibald - Did not the action which I took when I got the plans indicate the reason why I wanted it and had wanted it for months? Griffin - I understood that when you got the plan of levels you were going to put the works in hand. As a matter of fact you did not put the works in hand. 1236 - Archibald - When I received the report from Colonel [Note: Percy Thomas] Owen about the lakes did not that convey to your mind that I was anxious to get on? Griffin - It seemed to me that it was raising issues and questions tending to discourage the assumption Page 317 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoof works. 1237 - Archibald - Did it ever strike you that as a Minister of the Crown responsible to the Cabinet and the country, I had to explain to Parliament what the lakes were? Griffin - Yes and I was pressing upon you all the time for an opportunity to explain the works to you. 1238 - Archibald - When I received the report from Colonel Owen about the lakes did not that indicate to you that I wanted the plan for which I had asked in order to get on with the work? Griffin - It did not impress me that that would be the result of the procedure. 1239 - Archibald - I am under the impression that I instructed that action should be taken within a week after I got the plan because as a layman I did not think that there would be enough water to fill the lakes? Griffin - I am surprised that you as a layman concluded that there was not enough water to fill the lakes. (To get the real flavor of this evidence one needs to know Griffin personally, his always quiet, courteous, gentle ways. As one of his worst enemies said, \"You could never make Mr. Griffin angry.\") 1240 - Archibald - Have you gone into the question of evaporation in the dry parts of Australia?Griffin - I have consulted with those who have made a close study of this matter. 1241 - Archibald - Would you be surprised to learn that engineers of the different States have never been able to satisfy the public concerning [Note: ==== Beginning of page 214 ====] the data regarding evaporation? Griffin - I know that many elements enter into this problem and that it is one of these highly specialized matters that require a great deal of experience before an opinion can be given. But may I suggest that while you were asking me for this plan of the levels, that on the 9th December I gave you the levels of the lakes, and I should have thought that you might have been utilizing that period to make the investigations if you wanted to get on with the work. 1247 - Archibald - Where was there any lack of courtesy on my part in submitting these proposals to the Public Works Committee. Griffin - The plans submitted to the Public Works Committee were not of my design and you had not consulted me about then at all or given me an opportunity to explain the features of my design.1248 - Archibald - Do you not think that if I had consulted you it would have led to further delay? Griffin - No, I think it would have facilitated the work very such. Had you consulted me we might have had a definite proposal to make to the Public Works Committee and as part of my plan it could have Page 318 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobeen gone on with. 1249 - Archibald - Did it not strike you that in referring this matter to the Public Works Committee you would have had an opportunity of submitting your plan? Griffin - Certainly but it would have taken over a year to discuss the various questions connected with the matter before the works Committee. 1250 - By the Commissioner [Note: Blacket] - Have Members of the Public Works Committee seen it? Griffin - They have had the matter before them for a year and they are not through with it yet. They have not yet taken the whole of the evidence. 1251 - Archibald - Do you think it would have expedited matters if I had consulted you on the subject? Griffin - Certainly I do think so. The determining of these matters before they went to the Public Works Committee would, by defining the scope of the inquiry, have given that body a definite understanding as to what they were to report upon. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 215 ====] 1253 - Archibald - Did it ever strike you that I had a strong public reason in asking for the plan, and that I was acting within my rights? Griffin - I never questioned whether you were acting within your rights or not in asking for the level plans. I supplied the information. 1254 - Archibald - Do you not think that a Government should be careful not to create more circumlocution? Griffin - Yes decidedly. In Government work there is a general tendency to circumlocution. 1255 - Archibald - Was it not desirable that, in order not to duplicate reports, I should get them from the departmental engineers direct and without coming through your office? Griffin - The result had been that reports prepared without my advice have all had to be recast when my advice has been given. If the officers had obtained their information from me it would have been correctas to the requirements of the city plan. 1256 - Archibald - Do you contend that Cabinet and Parliament have no right to modify this plan? Griffin - I have said repeatedly that I do not contend that. 2356 - Mr. [Note: William] Webster - What use was ever made of the 400 foot to the inch plan afterwards? Griffin - No use was ever made of it. In my office I have gone on developing levels to a greater extent, Page 319 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoand designing, elaborating and estimating works accordingly. 2357 - Webster - After the plan was completed do you know of any work that was carried out or designed in consequence of the Minister having the fuller information that it supplied? Griffin - I do not. Reports on the Railway and bridges were prepared by the departmental officers on these levels. 2358 - Webster - Do you know of any works initiated or carried out as the result of that plan? Griffin - No. Mr. Webster to Mr. [Note: Thomas?] Hill:-21983 - Webster - Will you read your answer to question 20588? Hill - Yes. Webster - You see that the Minister (Mr. [Note: W.H.] Kelly) in his minutes of the 31st July says that Mr. Griffin is to lay out the Federal City; Do you suggest that his direction could not be carried out? [Note: ==== Beginning of page 216 ====] Hill - I think if Mr. Griffin had laid it out he would have worked not from it but from larger plans, and his instructions would have been issued from those larger scale plans. I have some recollection of his mentioning in that interview with Mr. Archibald that they thought a portion of the city should be developed from a 200 feet to the inch plan at the time. My recollection is that he stated he had some plan of 200 feet to the inch ready to proceed with. (Elsewhere denied he ever heard anything about a 200 foot plan.)21984 - Webster - What you said then was correct? Hill - It is not correct there. I have some recollection of his mentioning in that interview that he had plans 200 feet to the inch to go on with. 21985 - Webster - Mr. Griffin said at the interview that he had a plan of 200 feet to the inch for some portion of the work? Hill - On p. 48 (Exhibit \"A1\") it is stated that Mr. Griffin said that he was proceeding with the planning on the lines of the levels and sections. 21988 - Webster - Do you remember that he said he had worked out a 200 feet to the inch plan then? Hill - I remember just a remark that he had some of it at 200 feet to the inch. (admission) 21991 - Webster - Did Mr. Griffin mention that he had a plan of 800 [Note: sic, possibly 400?] feet to Page 320 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe inch? Hill - I have some recollection of some plan but whether it was 800 [Note: sic, possibly 400?] feet to the inch exactly or not I would not definitely say. 21992 - Webster - Was that put in your report? Hill - It is so mentioned in my report, and I am prepared to say to the best of my recollection that that plan was not mentioned on that definite scale number at that interview. 22002 - Webster - Did you hear the Minister indicate that he wanted those levels? Hill - I heard the Minister say that he wanted the levels of the railways.22003 - Webster - Mr. Griffin having those levels developed on a 200 feet to the inch basis do you ask me to believe that Mr. Griffin would not inform the minister of that fact? Hill - Any reference to the 200 feet plan was purely in regard to road work. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 217 ====] 22004 - Webster - When the Minister [Note: W.O. Archibald] had told Mr. Griffin that he wanted the railway levels, did you hear Mr. Griffin say that he already had those developed on a 200 feet to the inchplan? Hill - No. (Mr. Griffin's letter read shortly after is conclusive evidence that they know he had these levels and was offering them to the Minister who refused them.) Mr. Webster to Mr. [Note: Charles] Scrivener (surveyor).34970 - Webster - If the city could have been plotted from the basic plans could it not have been plotted from the photographic reproductions? Scrivener - I think it has been made clear that I never knew of the existence of the basic plan. (Nonsense. The fact of the photographic plan is proof of the existence of an original from which the photograph is taken.) 34971 - By the Commissioner [Note: Blacket] - Do you say the city could have been plotted from the basic plan of 800 [Note: sic, possibly 400?] feet to the inch? Scrivener - I think it could, but I think it would have been necessary even with that to make a larger plan. 34972 - Commissioner [Note: Blacket] - If it could have been plotted from the basic plan, could it have Page 321 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobeen plotted from the photographic reproduction? Scrivener - No, you have to have the scale. (Quibbling. Scale of no importance. Layout is done from figures.)Mr. Webster to Mr. Scrivener. - 20722 - Webster - Did you ever hear of such work being laid out in any other way than by figures? Scrivener - Yes; and plenty without any figures. 20723 - Webster - Would you consider that a possible way for the arrangement of streets where there are curves? Scrivener - It depends on the class of information you have on the plan. 20724 - Webster - Would any scale enable you to lay out accurately on the ground a plan which contains tangent lines of curves? Scrivener - Yes, it may be done if the plan is very accurately drawn. 20733 - [Note: Webster?] - Would you expect anybody to go about an important scheme like this with a protractor? Scrivener - I do not know. I have seen people do funny things; but it is not a reasonable thing to do. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 218 ====] (Yes it would be a funny thing to do but quite likely was done by officials. When in hilly districts Griffin in his private practice made curved roads we had to do the calculations in our private office and pay the surveyors as if they had done them. They tried to get a law passed making curved roads againstthe law, and this in this in hilly country.) 20734 - Webster - Previously you remember you forwarded the lithographed extended plan? Scrivener - Yes. 20736 - [Note: Webster?] - And that the coordinates were by no means square? Scrivener - Some of those were very peculiar.20736 - By the Commissioner [Note: Blacket] - The co-ordinates were by no means square, is that so? Scrivener - I do not know; but I think it very probable. I know some of those were not square because some of them were drawn laterally and they were in alternate directions. I say again that within an individual square you allow for that expansion, and you can get a co-ordinate even from a distorted plan Page 322 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowith quite reasonable accuracy if you use it the right way. But that has nothing to do with me and Mr. Griffin must know the trouble we took to try to get them. 20737 - By Mr. Griffin - Will you read the last clause or my request of 14th December, 1914?[Note: Scrivener] - Yes. - (Witness read same, Exhibit \"B188\") 20738 - Griffin - That is a request for reference original drawing plan where lithographs were in error? Scrivener - Yes, I see that, but I know nothing further about it. 20739 - Griffin - Your answer in your letter of the 19th December, 1914. Will you read the last clause? Scrivener - Yes, it reads, \"The maps sent are not much inferior in accuracy to the original plan, and distances between stations may be obtained by scale within quite reasonable limits.\" I say in my letter, \"These copies have been selected from others, and are as nearly accurate as any that are likely to be produced.\" This refers to the Whatman plans; it does not refer to any city plan so far as I know. 20740 - Griffin - If that applies to these maps produced, then you did not answer my request in my previous letter? Scrivener - I do not know, I can [Note: ==== Beginning of page 219 ====] not give that evidence. (That was the case however.) 20743 - Griffin - When you gave these bearings you were aware the drawings I was working on showed co-ordinates with the meridian at [Note: Mount] Ainslie? Scrivener - If I recollect aright we drew two sets of co-ordinates: We drew sets of co-ordinates with [Note: Mount] Stromlo, and we advised that the co-ordinates in blue had their origin at Stromlo and were on the Stromlo meridian. 20744 - Griffin - These being co-ordinates from Ainslie, it would be perfectly impossible to plot from the co-ordinates from Ainslie any bearings depending on the Stromlo meridian? Scrivener - You would want to know the variation between the meridian of Stromlo and of Ainslie - what the convergence of meridians between those two stations was. 20745 - Griffin - That is a function of the latitude? Scrivener - It is a function of both latitude and longitude, principally longitude. 20746 - Griffin - For any latitude it varies a certain angle? Page 323 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoScrivener - Yes. 20747 - Griffin - If we had to correct the bearings of the meridian of Stromlo you are aware that the whole design was in error? Scrivener - No, I am not; I know nothing about it. 20748 - Griffin - What would be the divergence between the meridians of Stromlo and of Ainslie - the actual divergence? Scrivener - It is about six minutes of arc I should say. 20749 - Griffin - In my letter to you of the 24th December, I pointed out to you that the actual convergence was about fifteen minutes and not six minutes as calculated on which we were trying to lay out the city? Scrivener - But the meridian of Ainslie was not the meridian of Ainslie; it is the adopted meridian of Ainslie, not the true meridian. My recollection is that the convergence should have been from the end of the south base. We have the correct meridian no doubt; but I do not remember the circumstances. (Shows how impossible it was to work from data supplied by officials.) (\"Daily Telegraph\" - 23 February 1915) Who is responsible for that protracted delay in settling the plans for the Federal Capital? Away back near the beginning of the century [Note: ==== Beginning of page 220 ====] designs were called for and one was accepted. As the years revolved the acceptor was invited to Australia to supervise the lay-out on the basis of the ....adopted scheme. (The officials continually spoke of the revised plan but there was none such. The original plan was adopted.) By the slow process sanctioned by immemorial official usage the plans have gone back to the original designer for another revision. While the difference which has arisen between Mr. Griffin and the Minister may be left till time had thrown light on the curiously tortuous methods through which the plans ....have had to pass,there is quite enough evidence available to show that a settlement ought to have been arrived at many months ago. The country is entitled to a plain statement of the facts, and of the departmental reasons for the unaccountable block that has occurred. If the fixed and dominant purpose was to postpone indefinitely the creation of Canberra into the actual seat of Government, it could not have succeeded better. (This of course was what London desired.) (Responsibility - All this re their insistence that the minister did not get his advice on these matters from the officials. Archibald on one side swearing that he considered the advice of his officials as all sufficient - the officers swearing that none of them advised the Minister in any of these matters.) (In the general scramble to shuffle responsibility we find the following statements. All officers of course Page 324 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagodeny all responsibility for any Ministerial act no matter how they may have misinterpreted facts to him. It did actually delay the work in Griffin's office by turning his attention and time and that of his office to useless work and at the same time the demands on time and strength to such an extent and in such a wayas would break down the physical strength of some men and the mental powers of others.) 155 - To Mr. Webster - Griffin - My premiated design was on a scale of 400 feet to the inch. So was that of the Department. Both were based on [Note: ==== Beginning of page 221 ====] the same surveys. The contour surveys were lithographed on that scale, and the conditions of the competition required the plan to be drawn on those lithographs. My basic plan was drawn on a scale of800 [Note: sic, possibly 200?] feet to the inch (the one including the surrounding districts) because that was the scale on which the original contour surveys had been reproduced when I came here. This was a much more convenient size to work on. That was done by the Department. The original plottings had been reproduced in the smaller scale as well as in the larger. I used the smaller scale as much more easily worked and showing the same facts. All the figures were legible on that scale. To produce a plan on the400 ft scale on the lines of my basic plan would involve replotting and redrawing the whole, but the draughting would not take a great deal of time. Merely to reproduce a plan on the 400 ft scale would mean four or five weeks' drafting. I could see no advantage in the larger scale for the purpose required then, and it is a more unwieldy size. 156 - To the Commissioner [Note: Blacket] - Griffin - Presumably the premiated design was required on the larger scale for purposes of exhibition. 157 - To Mr. Webster - Griffin - There were no advantages to be gained by the continuous requests for a 400 ft to the inch plan. The scale was quite immaterial. 20593 - To Mr. Thomas Hill - Griffin - What particular engineering work was intended or desired to be put in hand at that time? Hill - I am not aware of any. There was no proposition to do any work in the city that time. (Admission) 20594 - Griffin - After this 400 foot to the inch plan was prepared, did it enable any work to be proceeded with that had been before then delayed? Hill - No. I am not aware that any work on that plan has yet been put in hand, except Adelaide Avenue, which has been in course of construction during the last few months. (After endless questioning Mr. Webster gets these admissions from Mr. Hill [Note: ==== Beginning of page 222 ====] Page 325 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothat the 400 foot plan was desired for no constructive purpose. (Notice this was the 20,594th question.) Mr. Webster to Mr. Hill - On page 70 of the printed papers (Exhibit \"A1\") there is reference to referring to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for their report, city railways and dams for ornamental waters, incident to the schematic plan of Canberra prepared by Mr. Griffin. That has been delayed 18 months through reference to the Public Works Committee. 22028 - Mr. Webster - That is the first reference to the Public Works' delaying of the carrying out of the works at Canberra for months and months? Mr. Hill. - I could only say that that work has not been proceeded with in the city since reference was made. (Admission) 22029 - Webster - And so, on this 400 feet to the inch plan, you presented to the Public Works Committee your estimate of the cost was \u00a3405,000? Hill - I used a plan of 400 feet to the inch as a basis in preparing the these figures. 24992 - Webster - Will you read paragraph 18, page 12 or the Parliamentary Supplementary papers, to Exhibit \"A1\", from the word \"Survey\"? Hill - Yes. It reads:- \"The survey that Scrivener has completed is awaited by Mr. Griffin to enable a general design to be fixed and the workmen's location made out. Kindly expedite.\" That was on the 30thJuly, 1914. 24933 - Webster - Was it at this time when Mr. Griffin was engaged on this work that the idea of getting him on the 400 ft. plan occurred? Hill - No. (Contradiction paragraph 25000.) 24994 - Webster - Do you notice paragraph (a) on page 48 of Exhibit \"A1\"?Hill - Yes. 24995 - Webster - Is not that an indication that Mr. Griffin was constantly pressing forward preparations for workmen's cottages? Hill - His purpose is stated in that memorandum. 24996 - Webster - Is that what you read the purport of the paragraph to mean, that he was pressing for preparations for providing homes for the workmen? Hill - Yes, that is what one would read the purport to be. Page 326 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 223 ====] 24997 - Webster - On page 18 of the supplementary papers to Exhibit \"A1\" you see that Mr. Kelly is taking a hand to try to get the general design fixed and the workmen's location laid out? Hill - That is an instruction to the Administrator that his desire is to enable a design to be fixed, and the workmen's location to be laid out. 24998 - Webster - Are you aware that Mr. Griffin was occupied on these workmen's cottage plans in September, 1914? Hill - Yes. He states that on the 14th September, he had draughtsmen at work.24999. - Webster - And that subsequently, on the 9th December , that matter is again referred to? Hill - Yes - Page 48, Exhibit \"A1.\"25000 - Webster - When was it that Mr. Griffin was asked to proceed with the 400 ft to the inch plan? Hill - On the 9th December 1914 . 6163 - Mr. Webster to Mr. Kelly - What was your object in bringing out Mr. Griffin? Mr. Kelly - Primarily it was to enable me to look into these criticisms and into the question of the lay-out and completion of the city. Of course, I wanted to see Mr. Griffin before I could come to any definite decision in regard to him. A man might be a brilliant designer and yet be possessed of no practical execution. But as soon as I saw Mr. Griffin I realized that he was a practical man as well as one who is possessed of the gifts with which we know he is endowed. 6183 - Mr. Kelly - In fairness to Mr. Griffin, I must say that he never posed as an actual practicing specialist in sewerage matters. His theory was that, in addition to having the general knowledge that should be acquired before setting out on any plan, one should secure also the very best expert knowledge obtainable. His investigations, therefore, were preliminary and of a very broad character. 6184 - Mr. Kelly - At an early date he made some casual references to the possibility of things in connection with water having been wrong. He did not dogmatize, but he thought that possibly things were wrong in connection with the water scheme. There had never been [Note: ==== Beginning of page 224a ====] suggestion of amendment of his general design which was completed, approved and presented to Parliament . What he was engaged on was the preparation of working drawings. These did involve adaptations to surveys not perfected when the design was prepared. The adaptations would develop as work proceeded and it would be quite impossible for him to submit any general indication of such adaptations as would be required in actual work. Page 327 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago1725 - Mr. Webster to Mr. Griffin - You seriously maintain that 90 per cent of your time has been occupied in what you call defensive operations? Griffin - I maintain that 90 per cent is the very smallest percentage which I could possible estimate.(A similar statement was made by Mr. Meade, an American who was called upon for the New South Wales irrigation projects.) And so on for 9 months. Thus does Parliamentary Government work. The feelings of the officials, condemned on every count, wasting money, falsifying books, etc., were soothed by advancement in position, or salary or titles, but they were out of the Federal Capital. When there is a Royal Commission the law requires that 200 copies of the evidence shall be printed. The day they were printed Mr. Webster got one for himself and one for Mr. Griffin. The next day all the rest were burned up. Thus does parliamentary government work everywhere. [Note: This last sentence is handwritten.] [Note: The formatting of the testimony above has been somewhat altered for clarity.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 224b ====]THE CAUSE OF CONFUSION IN EUROPE NOW Mr. [Note: William] Webster's speech, as he knew might happen, called forth comment from the opposition, that such a situation certainly called for a Royal Commission. After the adjournment, his own party were down on him like a hive of angry bees, fuming at him for putting his own party in such a position, laying them open to public condemnation, and threatened to throw him out of the Ministry.His only answer was that in his judgment it was the thing that had to be done. It was followed by a demand for an investigation by a Royal Commission, the first stop in which was the condemnation [Note: commendation?, i.e., entrusting] of the commissioner in whose hands the investigation should rest. The method of choosing a Royal Commissioner is worth looking into, and the fact that this case was an exception makes it possible to show what the general tendency of the system is mostly becauseof its nature. When a government feels that it is necessary to make an investigation it is helpless in the matter of being able to place it before an impartial judiciary. The judges of the Supreme Court are not required to take on a royal commission unless they wish it, of course their refusal is supposed to be on their having too much else to do, however the position rests with the judges, naturally, as in this case when they scentthe conflict with the bureaucracy in which there is the risk of it being perfectly apparent to the public that the bureaucracy is wrong. They will not be inclined to take upon themselves the onus either of failing to condemn the officials or of condemning then, and thus bringing down upon themselves the enmity of the whole bureaucracy. For not only is it the opening up of opportunities, for promotion rests particularly in the hands of the officials with the whole press to back them, but they have every facilityfor injuring or destroying the standing of any member of the community. Page 328 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoSix of the chief justices refused to act on this Royal Commission. No judge could be found in the community who would accept the post. The system means that as a rule no man will accept the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 224c ====] position unless he has been offered sufficient inducement by one side or the other to render the judgment to its advantage. A system so perfectly arranged for the purpose of corruption will of course be corrupt as a rule in its procedure. Marvelously, either because of the integrity of the barrister who finally accepted the position of royal commissioner or because of the marvelous case made by the Postmaster General, the commission resulted in condemnation of the officials. That there could be no pressure from the other side is apparent from the fact that they had no reward in their hands nor withintheir reach in which they could possibly offer to influence the commissioner. It may be interesting to note the system of another of the judicial departments, the county court, similarly and ingeniously organized to facilitate corruption. Here the judges sit in certain courts in rotation, but at any time one of them may be transferred (by what authority?) to another court and another judge temporarily takes his place. This means that if the officials or their friends wish to have a position madein advance of the trial, all that is necessary is that some one of the group of judges shall be their tool, since any of the other of the judges can be supplanted at any required moment by their tool. Under such circumstances the unwary litigant is helpless in regard to an appeal for the usual procedure of the court is to have no stenographic notes taken of the case. This means that the judge at his desk jots down whatever he feels inclined to which as in the case of our own experience, included none of theevidence against the Civil Service, and would doubtless exclude whatever was deemed advantageous to the other side. The verdict then becomes a thing manufactured out of whole cloth, and, since there is no pleading of the case or questioning of witnesses in the appeal, there is nothing on which the higher court can base any reason for reversing the judgment - a very simple, neat and effective system. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 224d ====] The first point to be decided was whether the officials would be allowed legal counsel for which they were asking permission. Mr. Webster was undertaking to carry the burden of the Government investigation on his own shoulders and felt there was no occasion for the government going to the expense of supplying legal assistance which would only tend to obscure and confuse facts which thegovernment had the right to grant directly from its officials. There the questioning was entirely done by the Postmaster General before whom the various parties gave their evidence. His tremendous task in bringing facts to the surface in spite of the twisting of these officials, with their long experience with this art in the case where practically all the evidence was necessarily on technical matters, was a most marvelous feat. His capacity was instanced in one branch of engineering after another, in getting a statement to its essentials from the engineers with whom Mr. Griffin had been connected and in understanding its bearing on the works that had been executed by the officials, and so mastering it as to be impossible to Page 329 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobe confused, and to be able to hold to essential points against all dodging, diluting and twisting of the officers who were of course assisted by engineers friendly to themselves, resulted in the exposure which showed the officers guilty of insubordination, incompetence, wastefulness and dishonesty. However before the report was out of the printers' hands although the printing itself had been completed, a new election had been forced in which the Minister of Home Affairs lost his seat, the Postmaster General continuing in office only because his belief in the necessity for conscription had led him to join with the opposite party in the formation of a coalition Government. It would therefore still be necessary to hasten another election to get rid of this last stumbling block, although in the meantimeevery effort was made to discredit him and to force him out of the Ministry. This they failed to bring about, so it was not until the following year that they would be able [Note: ==== Beginning of page 224e ====] to sweep the boards clear of the opponents of the Bureaucracy. During the first six years of Mr. Griffin's direction of the Federal Capital construction, he was under 8 different Ministers of Home Affairs. We begin to glimpse the truth that the changes from one party toanother in the Parliamentary System do not signify the sensitiveness of this system to public opinion or control. The public has nothing whatever to do with throwing the Party out of power, nor have they any power at any time to do it, although some subterfuge is always used to make it appear to do so. Their powerlessness to bring this about was illustrated recently in Australia when during a campaign the Prime Minister was caught by the ingenuity of a very conspicuous and able citizen and forced intomaking a promise to the people that he would not introduce conscription without referring it to the vote of the people and that if in this referendum the vote was against conscription he would resign. The vote was against conscription but Mr. [Note: William Morris] Hughes continued to remain in office. The method by which this was brought about was through the safeguard of the colonial system by which in any real emergency the Governor General, who has the final power, makes use of it. In this case sinceHughes was an entirely satisfactory tool of the London interests the game was for him to resign, which he did thus was his pledge to the people supposed to be kept. When however the confirming of a new government was put to the Governor General which is supposed to be a pure formality, he refused to accept the resignation of Mr. Hughes who thereupon went merrily on in his office. These things show how absurd it is to suppose there is a vestige of democracy in the colonial system whether the colony be called crown colonies or dominions. Of course all the rewards for service for a Prime Minister lie in London. The people of his own community have nothing to offer him. Here again we see the impossibility of imperialism's giving up the system of granting titles in the branches, from which Canada at the present moment is trying to escape. A recent instance of the direct control of the Prime Minister from London is the sending of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 224f ====] New Zealand soldiers secretly, though it was discovered before it was accomplished, to Figi [Note: Page 330 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoFiji?] to quell the Indian strikers. No New Zealander sent was in any way concerned with Figi [Note: Fiji?] which is a Crown Colony of England nor could they be sending their soldiers except under direct instructions from London.

The structure has now reached a stage where the Committee in charge are succeeding in their efforts to procure a building thoroughly modern in construction, convenient and admirably adapted to its use, and dignifiedand permanent in character, as befits any building associated with a great institution of learning and the Church. They are accomplishing these objects too at a minimum expenditure for the results attained. Every detail of construction and appurtenance has been subject to the closest scrutiny and nothing has been authorized which will not be necessary to the most economical maintenance of the buildings, while as will be seen every advantage has been taken of modern science to secure ease of utility. In general the plan consists of a central unit, the rotunda, in which are situated all those activities which are common to the whole college as well as its administrative offices, on each side roughly paralleling the boundaries are the wings in which the students live, and as a terminal feature to each wing is a building - that to the west adjoining the University oval being utilized as a recreation center - that to the south being the Education center. On entering the Rotunda the visitor is accommodated in spacious reception rooms to left and right, while directly in front of him is the great Assembly Hall, a stately room whose ceilings, a reinforced concrete dome, is carried on four main and eight subsidiary arches resting on eight heavy reinforced concrete piers. This room is about 45 feet from the floor to the top of the dome and with the gallery encircling it at the second floor level and its projecting balconies forms a most attractive dining and general assemblyhall. In the East and North wings of the building are accommodated the Rector's office and suite. And the servants' Hall and Kitchens on the ground floor, a spacious library, guest rooms, matrons' rooms, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 228 (table of contents) ====] NEWMAN COLLEGE . STREET FRONTAGE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 229 ====]isolated infirmary block, and servants' quarters on the first floor. While the basement provides well lighted and airy space for the Laundry, Machinery, and boiler rooms, the latter accommodating the plants which furnish hot water to heat each room in the entire structure as well as a hot supply to every bath and basin. In addition space is also provided for ample coal and other stores. The South and West students' quarters each furnish accommodation for some twenty eight students and Page 332 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoare arranged to furnish the maximum accommodation and privacy, each man having his own suite of study and bedroom. These suites are arranged to furnish the maximum accommodation and privacy, each man having his own suite of study and bedroom. These suites are arranged in groups of eight, fouron a floor, access being gained from halls and staircases, which are entered from the Cloister. The latter runs the entire length of the students' wings. On each floor one to every four rooms are situated bath and toilet accommodation while in each bedroom are found built in lavatory basins with hot and cold supplies and a large dust proof wardrobe which are an integral part of the structure. Following the Cloister of the South wing, a spacious arcaded walk with open promenade above, which however the visitor must as yet build in his imagination, the Education Building is reached. Here are located comfortable studies and rest room for Extern women students, large lecture rooms, laboratories for Chemistry and Biology students, and, until the much hoped for Chapel materializes, an oratory. Similarly situated in relation to the West wing in [Note: is?] the Recreation buildings [Note: building?] in close proximity to the fields of outdoor sports, it is equipped with lockers and dressing and showerrooms, general recreation and reading room, and billiard room in addition to its two main features, a commodious gymnasium and the great white tiled plunge bath, 60 feet long and 24 feet wide, of ample size for indoor racing meets, water polo, and other aquatic sports, the water of which will always be kept at the proper temperature and of attractive appearance by the heating [Note: ==== Beginning of page 230 ====] and filtration plants.The construction of the building is as nearly fireproof as possible, all ordinary precautions being taken to prevent fires, the main materials being - Barrabool Hills stone, employed for its soft grateful color and splendid quality for the exterior, backed up by walls of brick and concrete. The ground floor is entirely of concrete, largely reinforced, and the second floor of reinforced concrete carried on concrete beans and permasite tiles making it practically sound proof. Interior bearing walls are of brick or reinforcedconcrete and partition walls of permasite tile. The only timber construction in the entire building is the roof of the students' quarter, recreation and education buildings and even here it is only the framing as the ceilings are of metal lath and plaster which is practically fireproof and the covering is of tile. In the interior finish also wooden construction is reduced to a minimum. The Cloister corridor floors as well as the stairs are of tile, while all of the rooms have a coved base course and border of magnesitesurrounding the floor of Cork Carpet which has all the virtue of linoleum added to which it is longer lived, is warmer and more grateful to the feet. The windows and doors with frame of Jarrah, have plaster returns so that the narrow jamb lining is the only wood trim used in the building, the doors themselves being five ply solid flush veneer panels which are practically fireproof as well as the most sanitary construction known. The building will be screened throughout, every window and door as wellas the entire cloister being protected from those carriers of filth and disease, the flies and mosquitoes. In fact throughout the entire structure the most modern hospital practice has been adhered to in the details that make for cleanliness and ease of maintenance. The same spirit is to be observed in the design of the furniture, and the landscape architecture of the grounds which have wisely been entrusted to the architect to ensure a complete and harmonious whole. Page 333 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoIn the furniture the same result has been attained as in the building itself, the ideals of utility, permanence, simplicity, dignity and sanitation being constantly before the designers. The type adopted [Note: ==== Beginning of page 231 (table of contents) ====] NEWMAN COLLEGE . INTERIOR OF DOME [Note: ==== Beginning of page 232 ====] is that of simple built up veneer slabs holding slab tops for tables and book cases, for head and foot boards of absence of cracks and crannies for the harboring of dust or germs while at the same time it shows to the best possible advantage the lovely grain of the wood used, compared to which all manmade decorations are futile mockeries. Genuine Spanish leather and the best of hair [Note: chair?] upholstery guarantee the longest life and utmost comfort to those pieces which require such treatment. The grounds on which the work has just commenced will be so planned as to create the impression of a botanical garden, while at the same time the maintenance charges will be light. This will be accomplished by a close though informal hedge or shrubs, vines and trees which will surround the place but by itsirregular outline will suggest spaciousness rather than confinement and will be composed of native Australian plants which once started will to a large measure take care of themselves, growing naturally more lovely and alluring. These plants will be arranged according to habit of growth, color and time of blossoming so that there will always be some section which is in attractive bloom, and the entire ground will present an ever varying and newly attractive vista to the eye. Unattractive surroundings will bescreened or \"planted out\" and attractive ones enhanced, and the whole set united and balanced by suitable lawns, drives and pathways. From the building as thus far constructed and from the plans of the committee and their Architectural advisers it is apparent that though they are not content with anything but the best procurable they are at the same time getting full value for money spent.

NEW SOUTH WALES [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.] Quotation from Nora Cooper CREATING A NEW TYPE OF SUBURB IN AUSTRALIA In these days of architectural renaissance, when all the world over men are beginning to speak their minds in what is almost a new language in concrete [Note: \"wood\" has been crossed out] and stone, so that the force of new ideas and independent thinking bids fair to outrival the great Gothic upheaval of the Middle Ages - it is interesting to realize that here in Australia, a young country whose architectural Page 334 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagohistory has yet to be written, the seeds of new and revolutionary ideas should be already sown and flourishing. For now that the lamp of revolution has been lit, and Australia is beginning to catch a preliminary reflection from its beams, we are finding that a good deal more has been happening in this direction than we would suppose, and that there has been going on quietly amongst us the development of a new scientific architecture ever since Walter Burley Griffin came to Australia about sixteen years ago. To the Australia public he needs no introduction. His prize-winning plans for the lay-out of the Federal Capital served that purpose. The building of the Capitol Theatre (Melbourne) and Newman College(Melbourne University) made us a little better acquainted with him. Everyone is familiar with the strange and arresting beauty of the Capitol Theatre. Newman College is not generally known; it is doubtful indeed if Melbourne realizes what a precious architectural possession it is. Though so absolutely different in type, these buildings express the same art and the same scientific purpose. While not classical in the conventional sense, Newman has an effect of pure and gracious serenity. Its logicalsimplicity and freedom from architectural platitudes impart to it a thoughtful and appropriate dignity. In its design only the simplest forms have a logical explanation. As the architect says himself, in his introduction to the plans, \"art simply involves co-ordinating all the elements of environment, site, functional forms, facilities, material, texture and color, that can [Note: ==== Beginning of page 234 (table of contents) ====] BALCONY OF DOMED HALL .

QUOTATION FROM PUNCH, MELBOURNE, 12 JUNE 1919. NEWMAN COLLEGE, MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY. The architecture of Newman College, which is the work of Walter Burley Griffin the Great, has been much criticized and is the subject of further disparaging remarks in the latest issue of the University Students' Magazine. One cultured gentleman has said that the building looks like a factory, and another that it has the appearance of a barracks. It certainly does differ from the stately Trinity, the inspiring Ormond and the severe Queen's, but to my eyes it is not inferior to any of these, and when its complete design is fulfilled will look better than the others. Its main feature is that there are no long corridors, buttwo story groups of eight flats, accommodating eight students, each opening off external cloisters. There Page 335 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagois no question that this arrangement makes the students concerned far more comfortable than if the old plan were followed and that, after all, a college is built to suit the comfort of the students. QUOTATION FROM THE ARGUS, MELBOURNE, 25 MARCH 1918DEDICATION CEREMONY Described as the coping stone [Note: cope-stone or capstone] in the educational system of the Roman Catholic Church in Victoria, Newman College at the University was dedicated and formally opened yesterday afternoon in the presence of an attendance estimated at 30,000. The ceremony was performed by the apostolic Delegate Archbishop Cattaneo. There was a large and representative gathering of theclergy including Archbishop Mannix... The work of collecting the funds for the building was commenced by Dr. Mannix shortly after his arrival in Melbourne, the movement being given an impulse by a donation of \u00a330,000 for bursaries [Note: student scholarships?]. The foundation stone was laid by Archbishop Carr in June 1916 and the building was opened free of debt.

Bishop Phelan said that the life of Dr. Mannix was in great danger. (Laughter) He was threatened with internment and transportation.(Laughter) The danger, he said, was that Dr. Mannix would be smothered with the affection of his people. (Cheers) The State police had failed to rescue him from that danger and the Commonwealth police should be tried. (Great laughter) The prime Minster (Mr. Hughes) should wish to protect Dr. Mannix more than anyone else in the Commonwealth. (Great laughter) (Note by M.M.G. This was in reference to the issue of conscription against which the three chief influences in Australia had been Dr.Mannix, little Adela Pankhurst in her teens and W.B.G. who was in close personal touch with cabinet ministers, the issue however is different in a democracy from what it is in a colony even one called a dominion.) Dr. Mannix was received with enthusiastic cheering. He said that the college was the dream and ambition of the late Archbishop Carr and it was a monument to the magnificent work done by Dr. Carrduring 31 years in Melbourne. Mr. Donovan of Sydney had given the endowment for bursaries on Page 336 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocondition that the college was built at once and, in spite of the drought, the war and the attacks on himself, the work had been completed (Cheers) It was necessary that there should be a large endowment fund as it was his aim that the brilliant sons of a poor man should have a full opportunity of a universityeducation. The building is of Barrabool Hills stone. It is equipped and furnished in modern style. The college is taxed to its full accommodation, there being 56 students. The acting rector is the Rev. J. O'Dwyer formerly of St. Xavier's, Kew. The contractor was Mr. B. Moriarty. When Griffin returned from Australia with his appointment as director in hand, his first move was to scoot over to Europe to arrange for four judges for a World competition for Parliament House - oneEnglish, one French [Note: Alfred-Pierre Agache?], one He [Note: Saarinen and Agache had placed second and third, respectively, in the Canberra design competition.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page [239] ====] KITCHEN ELL [Note: This illustration is listed as being on \"page 239\" in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 240 ====] contacted three of those he had in mind personally. His intention was to have one or more of the prize winners in the Capital competition given permanent direction of building design and construction ofbuildings for the whole city under himself as city planner, no building erected except as approved. Within a few months the 1914 war broke out and was used by the officials to defeat these plans. Unfortunately no such plan was ever effected. By the end of the first year our little group was divided, [Note: Roy] Lippincott with his wife who was Griffin's sister [Note: Genevieve] remained to carry on the Sydney office while Elgh, who had helpedus out with the competition drawings in Chicago, and I went down to the Melbourne private office. On the whole Griffin himself spent all his time day and night on Capital affairs (though the arrangement was that half his time was his own) over in his Federal office or with the Ministers, for the fight with officialdom was raging. However we did get hold of him for moments, usually late at night. One day he came in with a sketch, on a usual small sized envelope, which he had made on the train, for only so back and forth between Sydney and Melbourne could he contact the Assistant Prime Minister who was in charge of the Federal Capital. The train was a sort of Members club house. He had been given the job of doing the Newman College of the Melbourne University. The whole thing was there on that envelope plus what he had in his head. It was settled and so it was built, but that was a war to the finish too for everything was totallydifferent from anything anybody had in mind. In the end there was complete satisfaction. Page 337 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThese Colleges are dormitories plus some study facilities. The Catholics had ten acres reserved for this purpose and Dr. Mannix was a power to lean on and could grasp things beyond the customary. Things that have since become customary in the finer buildings in the United States were introduced and noauthority could be pointed to to guarantee [Note: ==== Beginning of page 241 (table of contents) ====] KITCHEN STREET FACADE OF DOME AND CLOISTERS OF DOME [Note: ==== Beginning of page 241b ====] them as being desirable such as flush doors, etc. But nothing could ever move Griffin from the right answer. To him there was nothing but the right answer. The stone of the Barrabool Hills was not considered desirable as there was much evidence of its not weathering satisfactorily. But its use would save a big item in cost over the usual alternative of bringing the stone down from Sydney and this would give Griffin a freer hand in designs so he visited the towns around the Hills and found that where the stone had been laid properly on its bed it had stood agingperfectly. The character of this stone was a determining factor in the design - the flat receding arches leaving no chance for wear by weather. The building is as satisfying as those of Europe of the good old times but is in no sense imitative, the whole determined by the nature of the stone and the problems of its occupancy. Some of the opposition of the chief donor too strong to be taken lightly was amusing. It was chiefly directed against the modernplumbing for he considered the \"thunder Mug\" universal in his experience (for up till some time later there was no sewer system in either Sydney nor Melbourne) and that of his ancestors was quite sufficient and that any expenditure in that line was not to be thought of. But Griffin's arrangement, making a unit of four studies and bedrooms on each floor, eliminated the necessity of even a house maid which the committee considered so advantageous that the plumbing, that is the design of the building,was accepted. The property is a long parallelogram on street corner. From being on level with the street at one end it becomes a six foot high bank at the corner - a grand chance for spectacular planting. The planting was here as always, like Mayan Architecture of Ancient Mexico, a combination of classic dignity and romantic riot of detail to which the incredible variety of evergreen shrubs and trees native to Australialent itself. Many of these have long blossoming seasons - [Note: ==== Beginning of page 242 ====] the Peach-blossom Ti-tree and other like the Acacias, have many species which make the round of the year with their blossoming seasons. Except where used for special purposes his principle in planting was to leave no ground bare anywhere in the accomplishment of which spiritual science lent its aid Page 338 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothrough the knowledge of the four ethers and their control of form so that when one ran across round leaved plants, controlled by the chemical ether, ruled by the Moon, one would be safe in concluding that they were moisture loving plants and would thrive in shaded places whereas sharp leaved ones wouldbe lovers of the sun, the ruler of the light ether. He planted whole banks of terraces to the convolvulus mauritanious which took the place of a lawn in our one-room house in Heidelberg [Note: Melbourne suburb], spreading its sky-blue blossoms over the ground for nine months of the year - a sight so entrancing that each morning as we left for the office we walked backward to revel in its loveliness as long as possible. It saved the trouble of mowing a lawn too. The plan of the whole for the present and for some time to come was a Chapel in the center set somewhat back from the street and free on all four sides. On either side were two oblong buildings for special purposes, scientific laboratories and lecture halls in one; swimming pool, gymnasium, etc. in the other - the recreation building, each connected with the domed building's one the great dining hall, the other the library building - by two stories of dormitories and cloisters. These dormitories extend at rightangles to each other from the domed building and each terminates in one of the service buildings, these again set at right angles - a truly magical conception. When we look from the street toward the dome with its dainty lantern and spires we see the two storied dormitories on the opposite side from the cloisters and balconies above. On the opposite side of the dome from the dormitories is in the one case the entrance and in the other, in duplicate form, the kitchenquarters as shown in the photograph. There are no halls in these buildings. The dormitories on the ground floor are reached from the cloister and on the second story [Note: ==== Beginning of page 243 ====] from the balcony above. These entrances give on either side entrance to a group of four suites of study and bedroom and to one bath and lavatory. The same on both stories. The cloister sweeps around the dome at their internal angle giving entrance to the dining hall and then on down past the other dormitoryarm to the recreation rooms in one case and to the laboratories in the other. The domed dining hall is a most beautiful room in color as well as in form for the various surface patterns formed by this unique construction give opportunity for various color patterns. I suppose strictly speaking this is not a dome. The criss-crossing supporting arches cross so as to form a central lantern at the top and determine the light illumination torches at their bases. These indirect lightingfixtures were beyond the belief of the building committee till the oculist among then found that he cold read the finest print on his eye-testing card. At the level of the second floor is the circle of balconies leading to the various surrounding quarters. The whole gives marvelous opportunity for great as well as small occasions and a happy and proud group are the students and all who are centered here.

MAKING A MODEL SUBURB FOR SYDNEY. by \"Naphthali\" City life seems to be inevitable. Man is a gregarious animal and loves his kind. But in this great land of open spaces gregariousness is overdone. One would think there was a limit to Australian soil to judge from our overcrowded and rather ugly cities, products of a tendency to follow in the gouty footsteps of John Bull, and a lack of imagination and artistic temperament which is truly British. When the climateand the open air life, combined with aggressive propaganda by the free spirits of today, have freed this budding Commonwealth from the grip of Mammon and the regime of the Philistine, we will begin to build a new civilization. This, of course, will call for new institutions. But first we must have new ideas. These are the ground-plan of the new Commonwealth, in which life will be lived as a fine art. Sounds Utopian, no doubt, to the matter of fact mind but sooner or later all of us will be Utopians. EvenColumbus, who set out in a boat headed due west to seek the East Indies was utopian. But he arrived. Mr. Walter Burley Griffin, who planned Canberra, is kind of Columbus in his way. He has left the beaten track and launched out on the lonely waters, hoping to reach the city of his dreams some fine day. To drop rather a mixed metaphor, he has started to build a suburb by the shores of Sydney Harbor - out of ideas. It is true he will use solid stone and a certain amount or mortar and wood, and things materialof that nature, but he depends for his effects on ideas. He is a kind of a landscape architect - a painter of effects, in stone, and lime, and elevations. A British painter of genius was once asked how he mixed his paints. He replied - \"With brains, Sir.\" Mr. Griffin builds his model suburb with ideas. The stone and lime and other matters are of the earth, earthy; but the ideas are Mr. Griffin's own. With ideas he can demonstrate the triumph of mind over matter. To achieve the broad effects he aims at, this landscape architect has a canvas of 700 acres, situate on the foreshores of Middle Harbor, one or the finest effects produced by that greatest of landscape artists, Dame Nature. The combination which has resulted in the suburb of Castlecrag is a combination of Nature and Art. The native flora is a thing of beauty, and can be a joy forever. The aim of our builder of beautiful homes is to make human habitations things of beauty, if not eternal joys; and it is certain [Note: \"Naphthali\" - Naphtali (said to derive from a Hebrew term meaning \"to wrestle\" or \"to struggle\") Page 340 of 923 Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowas a son of Jacob and a founder of one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. A similar essay will be found in Section III, No. 9, page 149ff.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 247 ====] that he has done something that stands out as unique in Australian history.The dwellings in this new suburb are designed to harmonize with their natural surroundings. The roads of easy grades sweep along the bluffs, and flow in curves which please the eye. The houses are inconspicuous, in keeping with the natural harmonies. As the natural flora is restored the houses will nestle into place, so that the slopes, as they arise from the water's edge, will be as completely garden as they were before being devastated by the hand of the vandal. The layout of Castlecrag is like that of a theatre. When each allotment is built upon, everyone will have a view of the stage and its setting, and in every direction the eye will encounter a garden, instead of a brick wall or an ugly fence. This effect is brought about also by the houses being placed so that they do not occupy a set building line, but are so placed that they conform to the general plan, which does away with all appearance of crowding, and almost entirely conceals the houses by the trees, shrubs and climbers. The flat roofs add to this garden effect. By degrees the splendid blossoming evergreen climbers, hardy in this climate, will cover or embower roofs as well as walls. Viewed as a town planning effort, Castlecrag not only accepts and makes the most of natural surroundings, but meets all the needs of a human community. The homes are planned for the greatest economy for the occupier and the least inconvenience for the housekeeper, with the utmost in the way ofaids to home life for old and young. Open spaces are reserved for all time, the interior parks giving safe play space for the little ones still calling for care, yet allowing them the intercourse with other children so useful for development. Park paths connect these reserves, so that delightful walks will be possible even after occupation is complete. Foreshores to the extent of some four or five miles are being dedicated to the public. Would that the community could regain those previously subdivided and sold to the water's edge. A natural acropolis, 300 feet above the water, on the central peninsula, is the civic center; a sports field surrounded by public and semipublic buildings entered from the business thoroughfare through a [Note: ==== Beginning of page 248 ====] semicircular colonnaded gateway. This center comprises such buildings as churches, clubs, assembly halls, schools, libraries, hotels and theatres. Two natural amphitheatres are located, the Cove theatre on the water frontage, the Glen theatre at the head of a valley. One hundred acres have been allocated to golf links, and a sheltered cove will be used Page 341 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoas a yachting club. The citizens of Castlecrag are organized for various community purposes. Committees for publicity, education, recreation, town-planning, and the like have been set up, and steps are being taken for theerection of the Castlecrag Community Clubhouse. It is a great work, but it is only a beginning. It points to a new Australian life, based on a new Australian idea. That idea is that it is absurd for Australians to keep following in the gouty footsteps of old John Bull or to ape Uncle Sam. They must think out a new civilization, and begin to draw up the ground plan of the new institutions. The idea may be summed up in a phrase; Life is a fine art. That is really what allthe poets, the seers, the revolutionaries of the ages have seen in their minds' eyes. It was the vision that Moses beheld from the Mount ere he passed behind the veil. Life as a fine art flourished on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea in days long fled; in lands where corn and wine abounded; where song and music and drama made life resplendent; where man surpassed himself and became superman - all this glory that was Greece will be resurrected by the shores of the Pacific. Castlecrag is a step toward theAustralian ideal - a new Civilization, an Australia white in soul.

It is calledthe machine age and it does not meet the requirements of the 20th century. It was not an essential unity and the mesalliance has become more and more apparent till now the divorce of these two realms has Page 342 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobecome an urgent necessity. It expressed itself in the carrying on of relations with conquered and colonial communities and later in dealing with neighboring states. In its later development the same methods are being applied to the citizenry within the boundaries of the central unit and it is nowgenerally designated as totalitarianism>. The word communism no longer has any meaning. It is simply perfected totalitarianism. [Note: The last two sentences are handwritten.] This last step lies in the Government's recognition of its natural advantage over its partner, the business world, which it does everywhere now, and in using its power first in bossing it then in taking business entirely into its own hands. In doing this the community has the strength only of a beam, properly thecommunity should have the strength of a triangle. The government is but one angle of this trinity and fails in its true function which is to maintain Equity which requires that it safeguard the development of individual ability. Failing this the evolution of humanity ends for the aim of evolution is to bring into existence a being who can function in Free Will. It is a saddening spectacle to see great groups of able men sitting back and complaining because someone is doing something they do not like. Why don't they get busy and do something themselves. If they have placed power in someone's hands and find it not pleasant let them not waste time in expecting one not to use it. He is in fact under obligation to use the power we have given him. And if a position carries power let us not think we can remedy such a difficulty by changing the personal. The new individual will use the power the position has been found to supply. Watch any Parliamentarycommunity and you will see that whatever party is elected it always follows in the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 251 ====] footsteps of its predecessor in increasing the power of the government. Totalitarianism unites business and politics. The government controls the economic affairs whereas its task is to watch over the economic affairs to maintain equity comparable to the task of the traffic policeman. The business men of America could so easily rectify that whole position if they would quitasking the government for monopolies the granting of which simply upsets the whole traffic system. With clean hands they could see to it that the Government limited itself to maintaining equity. So let our American people who really have a genius for organization quit fussing and stewing about the political institution and set the world another example as they did in the 18th century with a political organ to maintain equity, established by our forefathers to maintain certain Soul requirements. Let ourgeneration take on the task of building up another organization to take charge of the needs of the body, an Economic Organization. Its requirements are essentially different from those of the soul. We can't blame the political organ for taking this on if there is no other organ in the community to fulfill this need. Nor have we any right to complain if it makes a mess in its attempts. We ourselves are requiring an impossible thing of it. To build up this organ we in America need ask no favors of the politicians nor bureaucracies. We need no change nor supplements to legislation, simply some subtractions. We simply need, every man jack of us, to take part in constructing this Economic Organ in such a way that our economic life can be healthy and in a position to alter and grow and readjust itself to the changes which necessarily arise in a living, Page 343 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoevolving thing \u2014 humanity. Now that the American bureaucracy has been to so great an extent reinstated, which has taken a hundred years to a day almost since our great President [Note: Andrew] Jackson destroyed its power, it will not take long for it to feel its power and use it. In May, 1920, Stead in Australia \u2014 the great editor of war times, in 1915 [Note: \"Stead\" - Perhaps the reference is to Henry Wickham Steed (1871-1956), foreign correspondent and writer, who was an editor at The Times (1919-1922) and of W.T. Stead's \"Review of Reviews\" (1923-1930). William Thomas Stead (1849-1912), journalist and writer who died on the Titanic, founded the noted journal, \"Review of Reviews.\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 252 ====] said:- \"A good idea of the progress of Argentina can be obtained from the census figures. In 1895 the population of Argentina was 3,954,911; that of Australia was 3,491,621. In 1914 the number of people living in Argentina had just about doubled and was 7,885,237. In that year Australia's population was only 4,940,952. That is to say, 25 years ago there were only half a million fewer people in Australia than in Argentina, but seven years ago Argentina had swung almost 3,000,000 ahead and today thepopulation of this progressive South American State is probably twice that of the commonwealth. Not only so, but it is certain to receive vastly more emigrants than we .....Their arrival will inevitably give a tremendous impetus to production, commerce and manufacture.\" The cause of this difference lies largely in the greater perfection of the Civil Service in Australia which prevents the development of individual initiative and of course has none itself as that is a human and not a state faculty. For an American to comprehend the significance of certain things it is necessary for him to know that so long as a bureaucracy exists at all it has the character of immortality. A permanent officialdom never dies. It acts as a unit and any temporary loss it proceeds to make up for. It does not need to accomplish its results in a life time nor in a generation nor during a particular period of office, nor in face of a roused group during a particular period of office, nor in face of a roused group of individuals who havebeen stung into activity, nor in a decade nor in a century. The episode of the revolt in the 18th century of the Americans has no look of permanence to the bureaucracy from which it broke away, and bit by bit they prepare the way to remove the influence threatening their organization. This alone is sufficient to bring about a war of Britain or as it now stands a United Europe (Russia is Asiatic) against America, its (bureaucracy's) natural enemy. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 253 ====] A couple of absurd incidents really do exhibit this attitude of a government based on a thoroughly entrenched Civil Service, and military too of course. En route to our destination - Australia - we spent a day in Roturua, New Zealand. Among the many interesting experiences there, among the Maoris, wasone which included a divorce case in which the whole day was occupied in the conference of the two tribes concerned, with accusations, placations and final adjustment and the conciliation feast. In the evening we went to the theatre for the Maori dancing and singing and were intensely amused with what Page 344 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowe later took much more seriously. Over the Proscenium arch was a picture of George, Rex, [Note: George V] and below a painting of four flags one of them the flag of the United States. (This in 1914.) The second amusing incident was in Melbourne shortly after the outbreak of the war when I went, as required, to the police station to register as an alien. A big husky officer sat at his desk with a huge volume in front of him. I told him what I had come for and to his question as to my nationality, said I was an American. \"Oh,\" he said, pushing the book aside, \"Then you are not an alien.\" \"But I am.\" I said, \"If I don't register I'm likely to get into trouble.\" \"But I mean,\" said he, \"What country do you belong to?\" \"I belong to the United States of America,\" I said. \"Well then you are not an alien,\" he saidsettling back in his chair. \"But yes, I am an alien,\" I said. \"What country do you belong to: like Italy or France or Germany,\" he said. \"Yes,\" I said. \"The country I belong to is not Italy nor France nor Germany, but the United States of America.\" \"Then you're not an alien,\" he said. \"Yes,\" I said, \"It's this way. The Canadians are Americans too but they still belong to the British Empire so they are not aliens but the United States of America does not belong to the British Empire so they are aliens.\" And wideeyed and full of astonishment he said, \"Ohhhhhhh!\" and permitted me to sign the book. An American who lives in a colony, Australia for instance, finds that he has dropped back into the colonial times of his own country [Note: ==== Beginning of page 254 ====] and gets a totally different perspective on the events that have been transpiring before his eyes in his own country. He sees the menace of the gradual development of the Civil Service System, Civil ServiceReform, for which he had been working enthusiastically and which has so nearly reached perfection in the United States that it is becoming safe for the Imperial bureaucracy to take the next step. There has been continuous propaganda carried on in the United States in educational quarters. In the universities it is quite common for professors to advocate the Parliamentary system as versus the Congressional; for students to be impressed with the idea that the British political system, thoughnominally monarchical, is in reality more democratic more directly sensitive to the people, than the American. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The British is an almost inconceivably perfect bureaucratic system and the Parliamentary form of government is a perfect tool for it, and the politicians are powerless to do anything contrary to the wish of officialdom, even Winston Churchill as instanced in the [Note: Sir Stafford] Cripps\u2014Indian event, such a clever camouflage with which to deceive thepublic into thinking it has power and control. But when a civil servant comes to Mr. Churchill and says, \"But Mr. Churchill that can't be done.\" Mr. Churchill sends the cable to India, knowing that he will promptly be thrown out of office if he doesn't. All the major European governments are Fascist Governments. There is no way by which the people can alter that since there is no definite period of office and the initiation of an election does not lie in the hands of the people, nor in a constitutional right.There have been attempts to throw America back into the parliamentary form but as yet the constitution stands - a unique thing in the world, in consequence of which America with 6 per cent of the population of the world consumes 50 per cent of the products of the world. A name is a wonderful screen to hide behind. It is most insidious propaganda to speak of European Empires as democracies and leads to a complete misunderstanding of the facts. Page 345 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 255 ====] Thus it is as much to the interest of the British Empire to influence the United States to exclude certain immigrants and to hamper certain trade as it is to force Australia to strangle herself by similar procedure. If we come down to ultimates it is probably a fact that the real reason why the United States has130,000,000 inhabitants and enormous wealth and Australia only 8,000,000, or only one cityful, and almost no wealth is the independence of the one and the dependence of the other, for the \"Mother\" country is a leech on the dependent communities and you find the wealth of Australia continuously being dumped into the coffers of London. Again Stead (an Englishman) says:- \"Australia found to her cost that when urgent need for wheat arose, Great Britain and France preferred to send ships to Argentina to get it because the journey was so much shorter. For a time it is true Argentine wheat was not shipped to Europe as the Argentines demanded gold and England was not able to send it. Sometime, perhaps, the story of how the needed gold was found and where it came from will be told \u2014 it is an interesting episode, and illustrates how excellently the censor was able to assist a government in deceiving its people.\" We were there. Gold was common currency, was in everyone's pockets. Suddenly nobody was carrying gold, only paper. The gold had all been sent to England to buy Argentine wheat, etc. Result, in Australia there is a technically named \"depression,\" which lasted for years. This was a characteristic use of a colony (and a dominion is no more than that), adopting the policy of forcing her to limit her enterprise to primary products, then when convenient refuses her shipping tocarry wheat and trick her through the banks (London controlled) into supplying the gold to buy the wheat of her greatest rival. The Boer War had similarly been financed by stripping Australia of the gold of her early discoveries, free loans to everybody \u2014 on short terms \u2014 then suddenly foreclosing. The gold had gone to England. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 256 ====] So driving the gold out of circulation and into London during the 1st World War was not the first time Australia had her gold spirited away to fill the coffers of the magnates of London. Before the Boer War the system followed was to start a land boom, to assist the Australian banks in financing speculators and then pulling the strings, calling in all short term loans, taking all the gold to finance the war and leavingAustralia flat as a pancake for a long period of poverty and depression. It also set the population back to primary production. Never would it do to let a colony become sufficiently self-sufficient to feel that it could go alone. The whole system of education is based on training fear and hatred into the souls of the young which forms a chain which few are able to throw off in later years. A member of Parliament who later became Prime Minister was one of those who at the outbreak of the war openly rejoiced that the Germans had been fools enough to go to war (the 1st World War). At that time he doubtless did not know that the initiative had been taken by Russia, assured of the backing of England given it directly by the bureaucracy, i.e., the king, by the Navy, since as Brailsford [Note: Page 346 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoHenry Noel Brailsford?], an Englishman, says:- that assurance (i.e., that if Russia would mobilize England would back her in the war which would be sure to follow. That mobilization was ordered not by the Czar but by the bureaucracy. The answer was war.) was not given by the Minister of ForeignAffairs nor by the Cabinet nor by Parliament but he assures us it was given. This means of course that England started the war. This member doubtless accepted the idea put over by the manufacturers of news that Germany had started the war. He rejoiced, said they were fools, that if they had kept on with their peaceful methods they would before long have had the trade of the world in their hands but now England could destroy her as a trade rival. That is the European system. It is called Maintaining theBalance of Power. These things were known to the Germans then and should be remembered in judging the Germans now in 1945. Then the gag was that Russia was [Note: ==== Beginning of page 257 ====] a menace and until the change of the [Note: Neville] Chamberlain ministry after Munich and even still Germany understood that England would join her in eliminating \"the common enemy.\" Although at this time (the 1st World War) [Note: William Morris] Hughes was a member of the Labor Party we note his imperialistic view which indeed is quite as characteristic of the Laborites as of the conservatives - the Liberal Party. Here was naturally good material for the use of London. Shortly after this Hughes became Prime Minister (Not by an election by the people). [Note: Andrew] Fisher was sent to England as High Commissioner. The same thing happened in the 2nd War when [Note: John] Curtin was called to England. [Note: This last sentence is handwritten and has been inserted into thetypescript.] Soon Hughes went to London and from that time on was supposed to be barracking [Note: i.e., cheering] for Australia noisily and even boldly opposing the policies of the \"Mother Country\" contrary to the fact again. He was throughout merely a smoke screen for Imperial purposes. His loud talk about never trading with Germany served after the war to keep Australia from buying in that market when all the rest of the world, Britain included, was quite ready and most eager to buy and sell. This isentirely contrary to the interests of Australia but according to the interests of Britain since it helps to limit both sales and purchases of Australians to Britain which is made more secure by the recent raising of the tariff to a point almost prohibitive of foreign imports. Hughes undertook to put over conscription and failed because he had not yet realized that the way to do things was to be utterly high handed and he did not realize the strength of certain elements he was upagainst. One was little Adela Pankhurst, and one was Archbishop Mannix. In this connection it is necessary to remember that conscription in Australia as also in Ireland is a totally different issue from what it is in the United States. The interest of the Mother country is like that of a conqueror, by no means the interest of the dominion, frequently quite the opposite. An instance of this was the ghastly Gallipoli affair where Australian boys were deliberately thrown to the cannon to make a show ofconflict where there was no desire nor intention to win, where in fact there was an understanding [Note: ==== Beginning of page 258 ====] between England and Russia that neither would conquer Constantinople. Each wanted this for itself but Page 347 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoleft that point to be settled after Germany had been disposed of. In fact the Australians were not allowed to win. A horrible piece of butchery. Another instance was Singapore in the 2nd World War. [Note: This last sentence is handwritten and has been inserted into the typescript.] Diplomats we mustremember are bureaucrats. We see this conflict of interests in the matter of defense policy of Australia. Australia should have air planes but Britain makes her center on the Navy. None of this means that I am anti-British. Most of my dearest friends are Britishers. But it does mean that I am anti-imperialist. See - The Interstate Commission on the Delaware River Basin.

FLORIDA COMMUNITY CENTER IN A CITRUS ORCHARD DISTRICT Idalia, Lee County, Florida lies on sandy palmetto flats and pine hammocks about 5 feet above the high water level of the Caloosahatchee River and with a maximum average variation in elevation represented by that figure. In its layout the problem was to match in salable lots the showing of the preordained conventional treatment. Such amenities as public fronts on the river front and esplanades were permissible only when obtained without encroachment on that assumed maximum of salable space. Thesite being naturally flat the roads are therefore direct necessarily. The one crossing from east to west is the diverted course of a through roadway. The north and south ways open up the best views of the river's expanse where the water vista is greatest and give access to the water and public park space for the people at the most desirable points. The lagoon terminating the west street is natural. The main esplanade commands the longest sweep of the river. Since at present transportation is mainly from the gulf port of Fort Myer [Note: Fort Myers?], 18 miles by water, the dock is the main station for both freight and passengers. It is placed, however, where its Page 348 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoclutter will not interfere with the prospect or dignity of the water front. The main esplanade as an approach leads where the maximum of passenger traffic will not cross the freight handling space which is directly connected by alley shipping ways to the rears of all the mercantile and industrial sites. Theelectric railroad station eventually will co-ordinate with the water station in its position at the other end of the esplanade and in common with the water gate offers the advantage of comprehensive and most attractive aspect of this little community to the new arrival. Facing the esplanade also will be public buildings and hotel as well as stores and shops and the generous allowance for a setting of tropical verdure and flower gardens may well permit this village to utilize the advantages of its southernsituation. In the first building to be constructed, aside from the temporary [Note: ==== Beginning of page 260 ====] saw mill, is illustrated an informal type of business structure for general store and keeper's flat, emphasizing the residential cottage expression for a community center of an orchard district which should extend through all its various functions.

This is no more true of him than of the king of any other country or anytime. Always and anywhere a king is more or less powerful according to his personality and almost never has a king much power as an official. But the office of king is all powerful in Britain as elsewhere since it is the stronghold of bureaucracy. The offices of the Kingdom may be held sometimes by one group, sometimes by another but always the organization, with the King as the keystone, is the all powerful political and therefore economic and social element in our totalitarian communities and they areall totalitarian since they all have but one community organization. With a king one can give titles, the cheapest way of bribing. [Note: This last sentence is handwritten and has been inserted into the typescript.] The bureaucracy is the master and the others the slaves however manifested. This is but the logical consequence of the system and is inescapable though some are more firmly established than others. Of all screens behind which the Bureaucracy hides itself the most effective is the Parliamentary form of government. Let us analyze the executive office in the parliamentary system. During the 1st World War who chose the Prime Minister of Australia? Who chose the Prime Minister of England? Not the people. Through the exposure of Russian official documents and even before that we have evidence that the 1st World War was started by the Bureaucracies. The final plunge was taken by the Russian Bureaucracyon the assurance of the support of the British (see Brailsford [Note: Henry Noel Brailsford?]). The Kaiser sent a messenger to the Czar imploring him not to mobilize. The Czar so instructed the head of his army who reported this forthwith to the British King's emissary, the head of the British navy who spoke with authority. He said, \"Mobilize anyway and the British Navy will stand back of you.\" The Russian army was mobilized which according to the treaties meant war was declared by the Allies, byBritain. [Note: Herbert Henry] Asquith [Note: ==== Beginning of page 261 ====] was Prime Minister at the time in England. He was anti-war. But mysteriously, by no act of the people, [Note: David] Lloyd George became Prime Minister. We have seen how even in ordinary times the people have nothing to say in the choice of the national executive in a Parliamentary system. They usually have some idea of who it will be to start with, for theman who is leader of the party (which is not decided by the people) at the time of election as member of Parliament is usually, at least temporarily, made Prime Minister. He is made leader of the party not by the people but by the parliamentary members of his party. Really when anything important is on the Prime Minister is nominated by the King, i.e., the Bureaucracy. The day after the election another member than the leader can be substituted and made the Prime Minister in the name of the King.Coercion is effected by the mild phrase - \"It is the King's pleasure\" but if one doesn't conform one is a traitor. How was it that Ramsay MacDonald with his party at last a majority agreed to a coalition party to transform the monetary system of Britain? Was it the King's pleasure? Page 350 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe case of [Note: William Morris] Hughes is one such for shortly after election, [Note: Andrew] Fisher, the Prime Minister, was sent to England as Commissioner and Hughes was chosen by the members. (This is the method of the Labor Party in Australia.) The people had nothing to say about this.If the step can't be brought about within the party then it is brought about as we recently saw in France with Monsieur [Note: Edouard] Daladier. Or when the party members think the Ministers have been drawing the larger salary long enough they put them out and others in. Asquith remained Prime Minister for a while after the outbreak of the war and then what happened? Lloyd George became Prime Minister. It was not Asquith's wish nor the choice of the Liberal Partywhich had been elected by the people. His cabinet was made up largely of the opposing party, so if it was by common consent of the two parties this but removes it one step further from the expressed wish of the people. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 262 ====] Gradually practically the whole of the government unit with Lloyd George was made up of the Tory Party, so that we have the direct opposite of the will of the people as expressed in the election. LloydGeorge and a Tory cabinet suited someone or some power for war purposes and the reins were put in their hands. The power - the Bureaucracy, was satisfied so the arrangement continued. The essence of the bureaucratic system under the parliamentary screen is secrecy. The officials claim no glory. They get their rewards from within. Shortly after becoming Prime Minister, Mr. Hughes visited London and served them there by voicing the \"Destroy German Trade\" and the economic boycott idea, perhaps the chief cause of the present war. He enabled London to seem mild and open minded at the Paris Conference and very democratic in the \"We must grant our dominions some say in Imperial questions.\" He had returned from his first visit with instructions to put over conscription in Australia. He overestimated his powers of persuasion and so made a fatal error in his first step. This error saved Australia from conscription. We pause to say thatconscription in an empire is a totally different thing from in a democracy where Equity is the foundation stone of the Political Organ. Instead of himself announcing conscription and setting the bureaucratic machinery rolling as he could have done, he preferred to get the decision of the Cabinet as authority to act on. He failed to get that by the barest thread, one vote which was held, by one of those curious chances, to the cause of the people(in this case it was the personal influence of Griffin with a minister with whom he was lodging) for just long enough to prevent conscription from becoming an executive measure, the man having this casting vote going over shortly after entirely to the Tory side when a coalition party was formed. Hughes then took the matter to Parliament which refused to authorize conscription but voted that it be referred to the people. So an election was called for votes from former constituents (knowing he could get the Toryvote) [Note: ==== Beginning of page 263 ====] Page 351 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoby giving out that he would not establish conscription without referring it to the people. He was made by Dr. Mannix of the Catholic Church to make a definite promise to this effect. Now for a few months he was Prime Minister as the choice of the people so far as it can be expressed in the Parliamentary system. This election encouraged him to believe that the majority was with him and he put the conscription issue to the people and in electioneering said it was an absolutely necessary policy which the government must have, that he would refuse to be responsible for the government of Australia without conscription, and he made a definite promise that he would look upon this as a vote of confidence of the people direct and would resign if the vote failed to carry. It failed and the weeks andmonths passed but no resignation was forthcoming. The majority of the people were looking for and demanding his resignation and though their feelings were not those with which the press concerned themselves yet, after all, the Australian Tories did not care for Hughes. There were the old issues on which they had fought and condemned him when he was a Labor Member. They would rather have one of their own men as leader of the Party so some of thisdemand for resignation crept into the press. He finally, no doubt after consultation with the inner circles, the holy of holies, gave his resignation to the Governor General [Note: Ronald Munro-Ferguson] doubtless knowing in advance what would happen. The Governor General is the direct agent of the London Bureaucracy, in other words of the Crown, so in a final emergency can act and did so here (Just as it is in India really). Hughes was a proved trusty of the Imperial Interests. His resignation was notaccepted by the Governor General, of course on the parliamentary basis that he saw no other way of establishing a stable Government with the parties as they stood in Parliament (though the leader of the opposition party went to the governor with the statement that he was convinced that the Labor Party could carry on - in other words could hold a majority of members in [Note: \"Trusty\" can mean a trusted individual as well as a convict deemed trustworthy enough to be granted special privileges.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 264 ====] votes put to the house. So Hughes from that time on remained Prime Minister in spite of a majority against him in the community. He was satisfactory to imperial interests and that ended it. Having technically kept his promise Hughes continued to hold his job as Prime Minister. We get at this time another glimpse of the method of operation of the Parliamentary system for there was a considerable number of members of his own party who were much dissatisfied with the things Hughes was doing and the way he was doing them, and they were ready and eager to break away and join the Labor members to form a new government but Hughes's threat that he would dissolve Parliament was sufficient to keep them from taking the step since dissolution means a new election which means for every member strenuous electioneering work and risk of losing his seat. This was alsocoupled with another enlightening element of the system. There was a real danger in the break away if they could get John Forrest, an old and popular politician, to head the Labor Party, so the Imperial forces took the precaution of giving John Forrest the title of Lord (limited to his lifetime to be sure), never before given to an Australian. This satisfied the old man's ambition and he no longer menaced Hughes. Having a King gives this almost irresistible power to the Bureaucracy. The cheapest form of Page 352 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobribery. Tagore learned this and handed back his title saying he had not understood its significance when he accepted it. This is not democratic government. It is Bureaucratic government pure and simple but not an open and honest Bureaucratic government such as the Russian. In fact at present there are no governments anywhere that are not bureaucratic. It cannot be otherwise with totalitarian governments (i.e., one organ for three functions - i.e., liberty, equity, fraternity) and there is no other form of government at present. It is time there was. With the present system, having a King makes bribery the simplest and cheapest thing in the world. The possibility even, of a title, is sufficient to keep most in line. Hughes never gothis. [Note: This last sentence is handwritten.] We all realize that corruption forms a part of all systems that [Note: \"Tagore\" - The Bengali poet and writer Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was awarded a knighthood in 1915. He repudiated it in 1919 in protest to the Massacre of Amritsar when British troops had fired on a crowd of unarmed Indian protesters.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 265a ====] have but one organization to do the work of the community. It could not be otherwise in so unwholesome an arrangement. One method that can be used was explained to us by a member of Parliament. With the secret ballot and the printing in the hands of the bureaucrats one ballot form is enough to buy and secure a whole line of votes. The one ballot paper is made out as desired, given to avoter, he gets his blank form at the voting place and brings out the blank form after having deposited theform given to him and brings it back to the boss, which checks his having voted as desired or not at all and the chain goes on. Naturally all the advantages in this game would be on the side of the officials as the forms are printed in Government offices. You see the King is a power in exactly the same sense that Parliament is a power. Both are perfect instruments for Bureaucracy. In America one flaw is the two thirds requirement in the Senate which caused the catastrophe of [Note: President Woodrow] Wilson's so called failure in Paris. [Note: Georges] Clemenceau and [Note: David] Lloyd George knew that Wilson had no \"power\" so they utterly ignored him after they had attained secrecy of sessions. As [Note: Antonio de Oliveira] Salazar of Portugal said in 1923 - \"Politics must bring economics into line with moral interests.\" That is its one function - to maintain Equity. There is at present a hopeful sign in the World Organization which speaks not only of Security (Equity) but also of an Economic Organand a Social Organ (Abilities) It is our job - America's job - to see to it that it works out that way. Russia is the least to be feared of all European governments since it is an honest and open Bureaucratic government. There is a strong possibility through the changes going on in Russia that it will be the first to build up an Economic Organization and to add a Political Organ limited to maintaining Equity. America's task is to facilitate this trend in Russia and to join with her in making it a World EconomicOrganization and to clean our own house by limiting our government to maintaining Equity.

And now the matter of Railroads should be brought before the public. As you travel over the mountains going from Sydney to Melbourne you look down below to the old wagon road making the crossing at a much better grade. Governments quite deliberately always choose the wrong way first. People graduallyrealize that another way is better so it becomes easy to scrap the old and do another way, thus maintaining their force, still not choosing the right way if it can be avoided as in the Railway to Canberra where Griffin, learning that a change was contemplated, laid out a route with a comfortable gradient but they chose a half way between his and the old road thus keeping the way open for another tear down and rebuild. Australia suffers from the disadvantage of having had the railroads in the control of the government from the beginning. A comparison with America shows the consequences for individual initiative has brought about continental development in the United States. The railroads have been undertaken and pushed far and wide ahead of and encouraging settlement and development. The government control in Australia has made that impossible from the beginning and it is hard to see how there can be any escapefrom a system firmly established where the preponderating vote of the city population makes it always to the advantage of the population to cater to the apparent advantage of urban interests rather than the advantage of the whole and the need of the future. So on the whole, the railroads are simply links connecting the established cities which continually frustrates any hopes or plans of increasing the population of the rural districts. The problem ofdecentralization will probably never be solved until the radical step has been taken of breaking the liaison between political [Note: \"and economic\" inserted in the N-YHS copy] affairs through [Note: ==== Beginning of page 265c ====] the establishment of an Economic Organ. This is the more difficult perhaps because in Australia the Labor party is by no means a Labor party but an industrial organization whose interests are with the manufacturing element as versus the primary producers. Professor Meyers [Note: Hugo RichardMeyer?], a student of railroading, has shown that the history of the railroads is the history of Australia. From the other angle, Mr. Valentine, an official of the Railroad Department but one of those whose mentality had not been perverted through that fact, made a comparative study of nationally owned and privately owned railroads. A particular thing to be done in a definite time required 8 men in the privately owned railroad; in the government owned railroad it took 247. Our own experience would lead us totake this as a typical example in the expense to the community of the Government owned utilities. [Note: written by?]Walter Burley Griffin An electrician in chinning [Note: i.e., talking, chatting] with Griffin on their personal experiences told Page 354 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe following tale:- As sometimes happens, though rarely, and only as a Temporary Official, he had been called to take charge of the undergrounding of the wires of the center district of Sydney. As the work approached completion he called the attention of his superior officer to the necessity of placing themen in some other work as of course it is practically impossible to dismiss Civil Servants. The chief, not wanting to bother, told him to find something for them to do. He replied that he couldn't and got the answer, \"Well, then tear out the work and do it over again.\" Of course in Australia there is always the added pressure from England's wanting to lend money and never wanting the principal to be repaid. In the tramways for instance - the most awful, uncomfortable,miserable things imaginable. In Melbourne they ran the buses off by increasing the taxation. In Sydney the case is worse yet for with constant and often very steep slopes the grinding noise of the cable trams is unendurable and the old board seats intolerable. The buses came in, on the whole simply supplementing the trams [Note: ==== Beginning of page 265d ====] in districts where trams were often more than a mile away. For why should a bureaucracy bother to meet the needs of a community? Much better to hold back as much of the income as possible for munition makers and other pals who will help to pull off a war any time the Imperial Center wants one as it does every time an economic rival appears on the horizon, the present rival of course being the United States. The buses were comfortable, fast, safe (for they pulled in to curbs for passengers). When the tramway department began the fight against them they offered to buy the tramways and pay off the wholeindebtedness in 15 years (and they could easily have done so) but no, the government bit by bit increased the tax till they could no longer meet the expense and had to quit. In some cases the tram fares were then increased and the years roll on with no decrease in their very heavy rates. In the course of time however with increasing popular demands for buses they put on a few but first, seeing that buses would have to come they replaced the old tram cars with new heavily built ones, still uncomfortable andnoisy and dangerous, so that they could spend that much more money before coming to the only suitable transportation for hilly Sydney \u2014 the buses. Moreover the perpetual deputizing of the government to obtain some long and urgently required service helps maintain the \"morale,\" helps to keep the people, all the people, properly subservient. I had a bit of experience in the endless and practically always futile deputizing the first year I was in Australia, but itkeeps the people busy and feeling important. I thought a pleasant way to enter into the life of Sydney would be to join some of the women's organizations. I soon withdrew from most of them so large a part of their efforts consisted in deputizing the government to get assistance in something they had at heart, which seemed shocking business to me who had been accustomed to a community where no one looked to the government for any sort of charity or for assistance in any personal undertakings.

This hillside opens out to charming views of Mount Chocorua and the surrounding ranges. The hill slopes from a level of 800 to 1100 feet above sea level. The streets follow the natural contours so will be nearly level roads with a minimum of grading. On the hillside [Note: roads?] wind around following the contours so that the climb even to the top offers no steep grades, cheapening construction and making motor access easy and safe.

The Fellowship will retain ownership of its organization center on the North extremity of the Estate. The three roads coming into the thoroughfare, Route 16, will naturally establish a business center at this halfway location between two established towns. The estate should retain ownership of this business area renting it at land values rate to business occupants thus facilitating its growth. The interior park of the Community Social Center, midway on the slopes, is so lovely and so interesting that especial pains should be taken to reserve it in its natural state to inspire all the children of the community through the coming generations. The allotments surrounding it are of sufficient area for the educational and other social buildings and for the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 268 ====] CAPTION - b ordinary sports fields without going beyond the 225' feet from the street line.

This circuit is removed from all the speedways thus safe for the children, and when evening comes it will be much pleasanter for the elders who in the morning have to use the highway. So here are located all the cultural activities, schools, libraries, churches, club houses, little theatres, music halls, bowling Page 356 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of etc. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 269 ====] [Note: Pages 269-276, \"World Fellowship Center,\" come second copy of the Art Institute's typescript (AIC2).] WORLD FELLOWSHIP CENTER NEW HAMPSHIRE - UNITED STATES OF AMERICA For Mrs. Lola Lloyd - Winnetka, Illinois Marion M. Griffin - Architect, Landscape Architect The planning of a district requires the investigation of its surroundings. The location of streets must be established so that proper connections will be made not only with the present road systems but with such roads as can be most advantageously laid out in the future in the adjacent properties, for circulation with easy grades and for occupation. Therefore the location of the future streets on adjoining properties has been suggested. In every case they follow the natural contours so will be nearly level roads with minimum grading. On the hill side the roads wind around following the contours so that the climb even to the top offers no steep grades, cheapening the construction and making motor access easy and safe. The interior reserves facilitate attaining this end. And yet the whole has a formality which makes it comprehensible and gives it distinction. The road system is not dependent on any of the roads suggested in adjoining estates but in the end intercommunication will be desirable for both parties. It would probably be years before theresidential district is completed. That is of no importance so long as each thing is done correctly. The district between Old Road and Route 16 has been suggested on correct Town Planning principles for a flat region between two radial thoroughfares, the distributive residential roads coming in at right angles to the thoroughfares so that there will be no acute lots. This is important for both economy and appearance. A portion of the Route 16 frontage belongs to the National Forest Reserve whose chiefextent is on the other side of the road. It contains the head of a valley and is ideal for the location of an open air theatre [Note: Lola Maverick Lloyd (1875-1944) was a noted peace activist, suffragist and advocate for world government.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 270 ====] permission for which could doubtless be obtained as the community grows. It would of course undertake not to injure the natural loveliness of the reservation. The proximity of this reserve and its trails to the top of Mount Chocorua again make this location a natural center for development. For many years it would probably not be desirable to develop the property to the N.W. of Old Road (to Page 357 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe south of the Lodge) any more intensely than shown. If a time comes when the district takes on a more urban character the transverse polygonal roads starting from Route 16 could be extended across the circular arc, diverting on an angle in the center to come in perpendicular to Old Road. The depth ofthe allotments could then be reduced to the normal 200' to make a sufficient interior park. The price to be paid for such repurchase at price originally paid per acre should be written into the original covenanted contract. This repurchase would not decrease the open parklike spaciousness of the allotments themselves but would ultimately prevent its being used for farm purposes. Different functions call for different handling. The requirements of this property are threefold -First :- A sufficient area should be retained in absolute ownership by the Estate to meet present and future requirements for conventions, management, housing, parking of cars, etc. for the World Center functions. The area to the North West of the Old Road is sufficient for these needs. Second :- The area to the South of Old Road and East of Route 16 is sufficient and is advantageously located for a business center with roads already constructed on 3 sides. The Estate should retain the ownership of this district developing and renting it for business purposes. It is in such a district that land values rise and it [Note: ==== Beginning of page 271 ====] should be controlled so that the business shall not be hampered by excessive prices and so that the unearned increment can be used to the benefit of the Organization or for the whole community. Third :- The greater part or the acreage is on the slopes of the hill facing toward the fine view of Mt. Chocorua. The northern boundary skirts the shores of Whitten Pond, a charming lake big enough for boating and lending itself to all the water sports-fishing, swimming, etc. All this is ideal for residential purposes where land values do not become excessive. It is beautifully forested with giant pines interspersed with maples, birch and beech, so it is wonderful in its Autumn display as well as in its allthe year round impressiveness and charm. 1st - Convention Center has sufficient area to have a permanent parklike district around the Lodge, its present charming domicile, or any future building erected for this purpose. In addition there is acreage enough for an outer driveway with a dozen or more allotments permanently held for world Fellowship purposes. All of these open out to Chocorua views. The Lodge, a spaciousand beautiful assembly house, equipped with all the modern conveniences, is already located and functioning here. No more beautiful spot could be found for a summer vacation. There would be no objection to building for rental purposes on the outer drive for uses of not so permanent a nature as those developing in the business center. 2nd - The Business center is at the junction of the North South thoroughfare, Route 16, and of the Old Road coming in from the North East - a short cut traffic route likely to develop more intensely later on Page 358 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoas it connects with Iona Lake where a group of summer outing cottages is already established. A third side of this is bounded by a road running South East. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 272 ====] This district would ultimately include not only commercial business but Hotel, Town Hall, Post Office, Police Station and the housing of such public and semi-public functions as are of a less domestic character. A hostel and an assembly building are already established here. The converging of 3 routes already constructed foreshadows the development of a considerable business center here especially as Chocorua Mountain trail along the Chocorua River and to the peak come in close to this junction. For the present and for some time to come everything east of the Route 16street frontage allotments may well be used as a farm as its neighbors to the north are doing. It could even be rented out at reasonable rates for this purpose, but title should be retained. Throughout the business area the unit of 60 feet has been used as it is a practical one for building construction as well as for occupancy. Half of it - 30 feet is a good unit for shop frontage construction. The first shop for rent should be built with the intention of an ultimate group around an interior court.As it grows the residential quarters could be built across the court, opening up to the Plaza to the East. It is suggested that in the course of time the water of the stream be impounded to form a pool in the Plaza, which in the course of time could become surrounded by attractive and unique shops, restaurants, etc., a wayside drop-in for tourists, with band-stand on the center island. That the property is not on a railroad becomes less and less important for residential centers with the expansion of motor services, surface and air transportation. This property is strategically located for a village which can be self-sufficient and yet retain its character. The finished thoroughfare, Route 16, connects it [Note: ==== Beginning of page 273 ====] with Conway a railroad station 7 miles to the North East. A good road furnishes a short cut for a considerable part of the way and comes into Route 16 only a short distance from an East West road which goes to Madison, railroad station 4 miles to the East. These converging roads determine a natural business district sufficient in area to meet the requirements of World Center and the properties adjacent to it on all sides. The establishing of a shop here at the earliest possible moment would be an importantmove. 3rd - The Residential area. The placing of the houses on the South East side of Old Road well back on the lot would be no disadvantage as they would have the open space of the park back of them. If the same were done with the houses on the North West side of Old Road the same advantage would apply and this would prevent Page 359 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothese two groups of houses from interfering with each others' views. This would be one of the advantages of control by the Estate of both sides of Old Road. All the houses on the Estate should be placed parallel to the Old Road. This orientation is ideal for getting the sunlight on all 4 sides of the house. It also gives maximum view of Mt. Chocorua. Maintaining this orientation throughout the Residential area gives orderliness and dignity to the district. The whole area from the shores of Lake Whitten to the top of Fellowship Hill is enchanting. All parts of it can be made easily accessible by circling roads of easy grade, facilitated by each block's having its interior park reserve. The terraces' rising from 700' to 1100' above sea level means that the view of noresidence need be blocked out by any other. The streets are wide enough to provide ample space for grand avenues of trees. The width also provides for a certain amount of diversion to avoid special land or rock formations. Final surveys [Note: ==== Beginning of page 274 ====] will of course establish diversions to meet more important scenic features. The lower Shore Drive, 175' wide, is ample for a two-way road with central park and considerable parking space for convention times or other community events. Ample spaces for parks can be set aside at no cost since they are placed in the interior of blocks and so occupy no street frontage. These reserves will considerably increase the values of the lots which surround them since they give a feeling of elegance to the whole district. When every block has its own reserve they do not become the nuisance that they might be if only one park served a larger district. There are 115 allotments of 200' frontage. This should be sold as a covenanted estate which increases its value as each owner knows that others will be required to safeguard the natural beauty and so will have the incentive to safeguard his own portion. Each citizen thus becomes a part of a total police force watching out for the protection of the whole from fires and other forms of devastation. The beauty of this hillside lies not only in its outlook to Mount Chocorua, the Fujiyama [Note: Fuji-san] of the White Mountains, with its ever changing moods through quiet mist to gorgeous sunsets, but quite as much if not more in its majestic forestry. The charm of the view is enhanced if the element of surprise is retained so that clearance for outlook should be local and not general. The covenant should therefore require that no tree more than 6 inches in diameter, say 6 feet above ground, could be cut without permission of the Corporation or its architect. Other interesting and charming features should be similarly safeguarded, island reserves, etc., being set aside and approaches to them as they are discovered, for the property is rich in such charms. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 275 ====] Page 360 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThis requires the company's consent for the location of buildings on the allotments. This is important for giving all residents maximum advantage and assurance of vistas. The 200' frontage of allotments facilitates this as well as the general slope though 100' could be permitted in various places without endangering the value of adjoining properties. LAKE SHORE RESERVE The wide flat land at the Western extremity of the Lake Shore Reserve seems a strategic location for the large sports fields. The whole of the Lake shores are reserved and the picturesque Eastern portion can be charmingly treated with terraced community buildings for water sports, music hall, little theatre inconnection with a valley open air theatre, and other such functions in the early stages of development before the citizenry has occupied the higher terraces. Flat roofs on these structures would prevent their being any obstruction to views later on and could be constructed for use. COMMUNITY CENTER RESERVE The interior park of the Community Center is so lovely and so interesting that special pains should be taken to reserve it in its natural state to inspire all the children of the community through the coming generations. The allotments surrounding it are of sufficient area for the buildings and ordinary sports fields without going beyond the 225 feet from the street lines. In this park is the lovely Haunted Pool and the precipitous bluff to the East of it. Of course the idea is to keep the whole property as natural as possible. It should be a magnet for nature lovers. This circuit is removed from all speedways so safe for the children and when evening comes it will be much pleasanter for the elders who in the morning have to use the highway. So here are located all the cultural activities - schools, libraries, museums, club-houses, little theatres, music halls, churches, bowling alleys, etc., [Note: ==== Beginning of page 276 ====] educational movies, dance halls, gymnasia, aquaria, lecture halls, manual training schools for young and old, art galleries, artists studios, orchestral halls, playgrounds with equipment, etc. The Eastern half of the Circuit may suffice for these public and semi-public structures and the Western half used for residential purposes for there is the outlook to Chocorua. The entrances and exits to all reserves give several ways for pedestrians to take the steeper climbs than the roads afford, to the Peak Reserve. They make charming walks with a thrill at the top where in courseof time a Tower Cafe might be established as a community service. The center height of Pine Peak could be named Fellowship Peak. The something over 100 allotments for sale will provide a fund for construction of country roads and other expenses and functions of the World Center Organization. 100 allotments each with 200 feet frontage makes 20,000 feet of salable frontage. The price could be low to start with and increase as thedevelopment takes place.

THE TOWN OF HARVEY [Note: See the illustration for Section II, No. 14, p. 204 (above).] FEDERAL CAPITAL AS AN ESSENTIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT by WALTER BURLEY GRIFFINI want to lay stress on two points:- the need for decentralization to insure equal opportunity to all Australians - and on the menace to democracy of bureaucracy. It is necessary that I should explain mypoint of view on matters of political principles as that of an American. The American political system differs from the British in that its elements are unified in the form of a federation which means that no one of its units is in any respect superior in authority to another. From the American point of view, the absolute equality of all the units is the fundamental necessity for democracy. Any other system is aristocracy, the essential point of which latter system is that certainindividuals or groups are in a position to take advantage of the others. It is easy to see that the Americans might feel that in the early period after the war for independence it might have been considered in England that the close organization of the various States would increase their strength and from her point of view be undesirable since at that time the theory of business was, and is even up to the present time, that strength and prosperity in another community creates a rival and that this is adisadvantage and a danger. This point of view is, of course, quite contrary to the belief of democrats. Otherwise democracy becomes impossible. Americans have always felt that a most vital step in the unifying of the States was the location of its capital city in a district of its own entirely removed from any of the established cities with their individual State traditions. It may be interesting to consider for a moment what would have been the consequences of control at long distance on national and commercial undertakings at the time of the federation of the United States into a nation. What would have been the prospects of the speedy growth and prosperity of that community if the United States had had to defer to Europe as to the establishment of the city of Washington [Note: ==== Beginning of page 278 ====] or as to the building of its Parliament House. It seems obvious that existing jealousies between New York and Philadelphia might have been used, where direct control could not be enforced, to obstruct and delay the unification of the States. If the question of the manufacture of munitions was a question to be decided from without, it would Page 362 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocertainly have been prevented, or certainly obstructed. Were commercial undertakings of a nature to rival those of the supreme authority in Europe they would naturally have been obstructed. To an American that is the meaning of the word \"colony\" - a community restricted in the lines of development by thesupposed interests of its imperial head. From the democratic point of view, federation, eliminating entirely the ascendance of any particular group, is the only system tolerable, as the only one based on justice. In the theory of the United States organization there is no possible excuse for the supremacy of New York because of its wealth or population, or Texas [Note: \"Massachusetts\" has been crossed out.] because of its great extent, or fortheir having any advantage whatsoever or any control whatsoever over any other unit. With this theory inculcated in him from youth, an American naturally feels that the removal of the National capital of Australia to quarters of its own would be a great step toward loosening the bonds which rendered ministers and parliaments and the people impotent , as they seem to be at the present time, and that its establishment in a district of its own would quickly wipe out community jealousies and develop thebroad national spirit. A United Nation is not easy to exploit. It is generally supposed that the reason why progress at the Federal Capital is being opposed is because of the war or because it is an extravagance. This we feel is not the case. The extravagance is in keeping the capital in an established industrial city which necessitates buying very expensive land if new buildings are to be erected. The whole site of Canberra cost only what the land for one big [Note: ==== Beginning of page 279 ====] building such as Parliament House would cost in Melbourne or Sydney - or paying very high rents as is now being done all over Melbourne for the housing of the various departments. The Government of a country, especially when run on a socialistic plan as it is in Australia, is a very big business. When it is brought forth as an objection to Canberra that it is not advantageously located for the development of industries, that fact is forgotten. The same is true of Berlin which, as well as Washington, offers anexample of sufficiency of the Government, with the addition of its social, scientific and aesthetic appeal, to form a unit quite large and important enough to be an individual city. If someone would gather the facts as to the running cost of the Government rentals and capitalize it - for the Government of the nation is under no necessity of paying constant interest and rent as an individual without capital might be forced to do - we would be made to realize what an enormous extravagance it isto permit the national capital to remain in Melbourne. Single Taxers will understand that, in fact, the whole expense of the construction of Canberra can be met without any taxation of Australia because of the splendid stand taken in the initial steps in nationalizing the land. It is dimly fell that it is to the interest of Melbourne to keep the capital here, again Single Taxers will realize that that means simply that it is to the interest of the land owners, for the crowding of business into one center greatly increases the rentand that is not to the interest of anyone else, but the contrary. The rest of the people have to pay the high rents along with the Government which means that they pay twice over, once in rent, again in taxation. It is only a stupid misuse of the word loyalty - loyalty to your city - loyalty to your state - that blinds the people to their own interests. We are so reluctant to demand explicit statements. Why is it to my interest because I am an inhabitant of Melbourne to keep the Page 363 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 280 (table of contents) ====] FEDERAL CAPITAL . VIEW ALONG EASTERLY SIDE FROM AINSLIE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 281 ====] capital here? In what way do I reap advantage? Very few people realize what a big business a Government is and how it is housed all over Melbourne putting rents into the pockets of private individuals. Big industries are learning, when they have to expand, to get out into virgin country where they can get cheap land. The Government organization has no such pressure on it today because it is not spending its own money but the tax payers'. Why should they bother to watch out for economies? And why is it that other businesses are coming into Melbourne instead of going out into the smaller towns and the country districts? Well, the inhabitants of Bendigo can tell you, and of Geelong. It is because the big interests of Melbourne, with the government close at hand, have been able to put sufficient pressure on it to get the Railroads to grant discriminatory rates in favor of Melbourne. We are accustomed to think this system is one of the evils distinctive of privately owned railroads and in theUnited States the chief reason for advocating Government ownership is to overcome this evil, but we find the same thing is done in Australia and when the Government is the instrument where can we look for redress? One might say if we cannot control our agents when they are directly managing a business how can we when they are merely a court of appeal and a police organ? That brings us to the root of the difficulties,which is the necessity for removing the incentives and for keeping the organization of Governments simple enough to control. If a Government carries on businesses outside the maintenance of equity it must have a tremendous organization which forms a huge mass of voters who can easily hold in their hands the destiny of any politician. Private ownership can never form so huge a monopoly as that of a bureaucracy which also has the power not only of collecting the profits of its business but can pour intothe business the huge sums gathered by taxation in general, thus increasing the number of its [Note: ==== Beginning of page 282 ====] employees indefinitely without increasing the amount of work done or the service rendered to the public. We had a curious illustration of the failure to recognize the value of the decentralizing nature of the Federal Capital enterprise in the Town Planning so called convention in Adelaide. The outer district delegates were strong and even bitter in their desire for decentralization though they had no concretesuggestions to make. But when it came to the question of pressing on with the Federal Capital they either had no conception of it as the first necessary step to accomplish the ends they were futilely struggling for or, as is more probable, were blinded by their long training in the idea that they must be loyal to Victoria. A strange idea that what will benefit another state must therefore injure one's own. It is Page 364 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoa big story I have started on so I can only touch on these points hoping you will be led to investigate how, for example, higher rates are charged for raw material sent to Bendigo than brought to Melbourne and on the other hand lower rates on manufactured goods sent from Melbourne than brought into it. This process of centralization which is pressed and determined by selfish individual interests whose foresight extends at the utmost to the length of those individuals' life time is gradually choking the development of the country, destroying the rural development immediately and will ultimately destroy the development of the few big cities none of which is self-supporting nor reproductive. If it continues much longer the country will indeed fall into the hands of some other peoples who have a more rationalsocial policy. It is of prime importance that the control of these private individuals over the government should be stopped and that the bureaucratic system which has grown up should be scrapped. To make clear the significance of what is to follow I am going to say that the great enemy of liberty and justice in this country [Note: ==== Beginning of page 283 ====] as in every European country including America is the established bureaucracy. That bureaucracy is as autocratic in Australia as it was in Russia before the revolution with the exception that before the war its military branch was not so highly developed. Whoever may be the apparent mischief makers, whether it be a journalist here or a Town Planning Organization somewhere else, they are usually but instruments, often unwittingly, and would in any case be powerless for any great evil were it not for the backing of the bureaucracy which is permanent and continuous and over whom the community has no controlwhatever. The definition of a bureaucracy is a Civil Service organization, with permanent officers. The establishment of that system in Australia was probably an easy matter since the members of the early parliaments, being ignorant of the insidious evils of the system, through pressure from Europe and the pressure of a public opinion (which can easily be blinded by a highly developed publicityorganization to think that the Civil Service means civil service) can fail to realize that Civil Servant means despotic autocrat. The abolishing of the system is extremely difficult. Its existence forms a line of direct control of Australia by England since all the ultimate rewards of officials - titles, etc., emanate from London. The importance of the Federal Capital as a basic issue in the development of the Commonwealth is not generally recognized and has been obscured by the fact that the jealousy of a little group of architects has made the getting rid of a rival paramount to all national issues, so easy is it for a few noisy ones to obscure the issues from the general public. The grim joke back of this is that even were the rival eliminated the work would not fall to the profession for the main obstacle to progress lies in the bureaucracy which permits no interference with its monopoly whether Australian [Note: ==== Beginning of page 284 (table of contents) ====] Page 365 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art of ChicagoFEDERAL CAPITAL . LOOKING TOWARD MOUNT AINSLIE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 285 ====] or non-Australian. In fact at the present time I believe the Federal Capital director is the only outside expert who has not been driven out and the Federal Capital Royal Commission I think will be found tobe the only one that has given a judgment in favor of an outsider. The powerlessness of Parliament and of the Ministry and the absolute power of the bureaucracy is illustrated once again by the fact that the officers found guilty in the serious charges investigated by the Royal Commission were none of them dismissed, but some on the contrary have received increase of salary or promotion. That it is typical of such organizations is illustrated in Lord Northcliffe's [Note: Alfred Charles William Harmsworth's] recent letter refusing to accept the position of Minister of the Air in which he states that he is not willing to put himself in a position which would require loyalty to officers for some of whom he can have no such feeling, stating that there are cases where officers who should have been punished have been retained and even promoted. On the other hand Ministers who in the interests of the Nation opposed themselves to the bureaucracy are thrown out of office as in the caseof Mr. [Note: King] O'Malley and Mr. [Note: William] Webster. The officials' confidence in their power to do this has been illustrated within the last few days. Speaking of the new party in the State of Victoria which contains men sincerely determined to try to achieve some measure of efficiency and economy, an officer - a bureaucrat - said:- \"It doesn't make any difference who are made Ministers. They won't be in more than two months.\" The pernicious power of the bureaucracy in England is suggested also by the recent speech by [Note: David] Lloyd George who used adjectives of such a nature in describing policies followed during his own administration as Minister as it is inconceivable that a man in any way responsible should use if he has not, in fact, found it impossible to fulfill the functions of his position. An exposure of similar conditions in France recently was made by the head of the chamber. Monsieur Duschanel [Note: Paul Deschanel?] who placarded France with an appeal to the people in the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 286 ====] controversy between the parliament and the military bureaucracy. This placard stated that Parliament which was held responsible by the people was being kept in ignorance of facts by the generals andcould not, of course, be responsible if it had to act without knowledge; that the truth was that whatever efficiency or promptness there had been in meeting the necessities of the war had been brought about by the Parliament in opposition to and only by breaking down the routine of the Civil Service. In this emergency when one General after another was refusing to accept the post of Head of the Army he appealed to the people for patience with Parliament since, in fact, Parliament was, he said, the bestinstrument yet devised to oppose bureaucracy. How this contest resulted, whether in victory of Parliament or of the Bureaucracy, is difficult to know at this distance. Apparently the appeal of Lloyd George in his speech arose from similar circumstances. (In fact the congressional form of government is the only one that can be successful.) Page 366 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoWe find that the opposition to the Federal Capital, aside from private interests such as landlords of Melbourne, etc., comes from two sources, England and the Bureaucracy of Australia. One of the methods used to obstruct the development of the Federal Capital was the tremendous effort made toestablish the Arsenal within its boundaries or, when foiled in that, as close as possible to it. The menace to popular government of the juxtaposition of a great military establishment with the Capital is too familiar in history to need comment. The instance of the destruction of Washington is but one among many. Apart from the military danger, the surrounding of Parliament by such an influence would be as disastrous in its way as the surrounding of it by the great financial interests of industrial cities. The fact that the manufacture of munitions for which Australia has ample facilities was stopped in the early stages of the war, is by [Note: ==== Beginning of page 287 ====] no means countered by the encouragement to establish such an arsenal city. In the first place the arsenal committee, taken seriously by some, was not permitted by the British authorities to go to England butwas sent to India where its investigations of an antiquated arsenal could not but be an utter waste of time. Should the arsenal be built on such lines it would be no competitor of European plants but a total waste of the money invested. Further than this the establishment of such an industry at Canberra or anywhere within the Federal District with its entire lack of industrial facilities, even if the design were in accordance with the most modern developments would, because of the high cost of materials andtransportation, prevent its output from ever competing in the World's markets and, if continued, could be a huge burden to Australia. The fact that the Federal District is but a short distance from the coast means also that in case of attack the aeroplane [Note: airplane] offensive naturally directed against the arsenal would easily result in its destruction and in the destruction of the Capital. Persistence in such a method cannot be attributed to ignorance. In addition to these considerations is the fact that the temporary loss of control of the Federal Capital enterprise by the bureaucracy which was accomplished by the efficient management of Mr. O'Malley and Mr. Webster could be made a negligible thing if they were permitted to build up within the city's boundaries, or within a short distance of it, an enormous industry and the community it would necessitate, backed by the huge funds at their disposal while their tremendous publicity organization waspreventing any expenditure on the capital city as such; for were such a city, without the boundary of the capital site, once established it would be easy to plead folly in starting a second one so close at hand and consequently the capital would find itself located on the new, the arsenal, site instead of the original site determined by Parliament. Thus can the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 288 ====] decisions of Parliament be rendered void. The brief summary of the bureaucracy's control of the Federal Capital as made public in the Royal Commission is illuminating. The carrying out of such an undertaking opens the way naturally to jealousies, ambitions and intrigue, and the spending of huge Page 367 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosums upon it would not be at all objectionable to England since the taxpayers of Australia alone have to foot the bill, and the officers could well look forward to distinctions to be granted, such rewards as often accruing to futile as to useful services rendered, and in the case of the Capital the more futile the moreacceptable to England. The British member of the international jury for the adjudication of the Parliament House, after two hundred architects had in all good faith been working for months and spending hundreds of dollars, many having practically completed their drawings, writes out to the Australian Minister that the war offers a good opportunity to break the contract with these competitors which breach of faith would makeit possible to put the work in the hands of some British architect. This was not the breaking of contract with competitors in enemy countries for that had already been provided for, but with those of neutral and allied countries, and even perhaps with those of Australia itself. It is incredible that an individual or private institution with a reputation to guard could make a suggestion of such a nature if he were not conscious of support of an organization which could protect him from consequences. A Minister ofAustralia when deputized by a number of members of Parliament to press on with the work, most important if we are looking for development in Australia, entailing an expenditure absolutely negligible if the truth were told, says he will cable to the architects of England to see if they think it advisable to go on. That such suggestions are not made in good faith is illustrated by the first abandonment of the competition on the advice of the bureaucracy on the plea that the war made it inadvisable [Note: ==== Beginning of page 289 ====] that such expenditure should be made. A week after the Minister acted on their advice they were advising him to launch a competition of their own devising. The exposure of such proceedings has been the Federal Director's chief work during the past three years, and they have been stopped only by their exposure. A permanent officialdom means a monopoly. It means autocracy utterly uncontrolled and uncontrollable. It means subordination of all the rest of the community's need to its own interests. It is both inefficient and tyrannical. A single autocrat may be efficient, a bureaucracy never. Efficiency within its ranks threatens it as much as efficiency outside so will not be tolerated and if by any chance it exists it will never be allowed promotion. It is apparent that the existence, if continued, of such an organization is imperiled by the presence within its fold, or even in the country, of experienced technical or scientific men. The whole strength therefore of the Civil Service would naturally be exerted to minimize education in the country (and therefore we cannot look for proper development of the schools) and to prevent anyone coming in from the outside world. The driving out of any such is of first importance to them and much of their time and of the money of the taxpayers is spent in accomplishing that end. Since they are permanent, there is no limit tothe amount of time they can so spend. Once rid of such experts as are occasionally brought in by some Minister who hopes to accomplish something, they are free again to pour untold sums of money no one knows where. The million pounds which has been utterly wasted at Canberra, finally put a stop to by an independent practitioner whose future career is dependent on his successfully and economically carrying out the undertaking he is entrusted with can, as soon as he is gotten rid of, be doubled and trebledwithout interference. The policy of stopping expenditure on the Federal Capital at present being Page 368 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofollowed would doubtless be immediately reversed could he be gotten rid of, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 290 ====] for if a minister should oppose - he in his turn could be gotten rid of. England would not object to this since futile and wasteful expenditure would ultimately of itself choke the undertaking to death. At any rate since the Federal Capital was stipulated in the Federation of the States the bureaucracies naturally determined to keep control of it. Their first lost battle was when the Minister, Mr. O'Malley, with his foresight and broad vision, insisted that there should be an international competition to determine the plan. Mr. O'Malley considered that the best the world could offer was none too good for Australia. The bureaucracies laid out a program forcompetition and presented it to the Minister. Their second failure to obtain their ends was when in accepting the program for competition, the Minister crossed out the names of the three judges whom they had selected and determined upon the selection of three outside of the direct control of the bureaucracy. This provoked great opposition, with backing from England and through the Institute of Architects. After the prize had been awarded in this competition the department officials suggested to theMinister that a board of themselves should be authorized by him to work out a plan for the city, using such ideas as they saw fit from the premiated plans. Not being a town planner or technical expert as obviously a Minister cannot be, he did not recognize the absurdity from a technical point of view of such a procedure. His officers were supposed to be technical men although the civil service requirements in fact make it impossible that the permanent officials should contain any experts, therequirements that any man beyond a certain age - 21 years - cannot enter the service makes it impossible for any member to have had technical training and experience without both of which a man is not an expert. He accepted the suggestion that a board should gather suggestions from other than the first plan to include in it but stipulated that the design of the city must be that of the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 291 ====] first prize plan. When the Department plan was brought to him he asked if that were the case, and seeing that he was set on that point they said yes although, in fact, it was not in any respect based on the first prize plan. It was, in fact, ridiculed as an absurdity when it came to the attention of the technical press. However, as a consequence of this by no means disinterested advice of the department officers, thework of the competitors and of the judges, themselves technical men, was thrown into the scrap heap. The Minister cabled the King that work was to begin on the Federal Capital in accordance with the premiated plan, and work was begun but on the departmental lines. Shortly after, the attention of the Minister for Home Affairs and the Prime Minister - the opposite party now being in power - was brought to this matter and they invited the designer of the premiated plan tocome to consult with them which he did, the result of which consultation was that the Departmental Board was disbanded and the designer put in charge of the execution of the work. Page 369 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe attitude of the departmental heads has been published in the course of the evidence of the Royal Commission. Mr. Griffin being greeted when he took the first step to fulfill his duties which was a request for data, with - \"I'll be damned if I'll take orders from you.\" When the Minister attempted tobring about a working basis he was told he would precipitate the greatest rumpus the Department had ever known if he persisted. His political future was also threatened by them. He did not discontinue his efforts and shortly after his party was thrown out of office. The case with which the Civil Service organization can throw any politician out of power becomes very apparent when we realize that one in every 12 of the population, men, women and children is a civil servant, so that in fact every two men inthe community have a civil servant to carry on their backs. The voting power of such a body of men is obvious. Also their indirect [Note: ==== Beginning of page 292 ====] power through a publicity organization which can flood the press at the expense of the taxpayers is enormous. The next minister in office accepted the advice of the Bureaucracy, at no time consulting the Federal Capital Director, but the fearful extravagance indulged in at this time, and since exposed by the Royal Commission, was brought to an end through the exposure of the methods being followed, by a movement within the party itself which again changed the personnel of the Home Affairs ministry. The power of the bureaucracy over the career of politicians may perhaps be illustrated by the fact that this Minister who stopped extravagance, placed authority where it belonged by the contract entered intoby the Government, and actually started movement along lines determined by both parties, was soon afterward driven out of Parliament. The politician ambitious for advancement does well not to oppose himself to the bureaucracy. Their power, almost incredible did we not realize that an absolute monopoly is in fact all powerful, is illustrated by the fact that all of the men exposed by the Royal Commission as outrageously extravagant, spending millions of pounds in utterly extravagant or useless ways, keepingbooks in such fashion as to make it impossible for anyone to know how moneys have been spent, misinforming ministers as to facts and ignoring and even going contrary to definite instructions of the Ministers, still retain their positions and in some instances, as I have said, have had salaries raised or rank advanced. In fact no one can dismiss a permanent official no matter what he does. As an illustration of the stand they took, I will cite the amazing statement of the head of these Departments:- When questioned by the Royal Commissioner he said words to this effect that he did not feel called upon to acquiesce in the Minister's decision to put certain work in the hands of an expert employed for a particular [Note: ==== Beginning of page 293 ====] purpose. He had been made head of the Home Affairs Department by appointment of the Executive, that is the Governor General, and therefore did not consider that any of the other rules of Parliament need be heeded. His authority from the crown gave him a monopoly of government work in the Home Affairs Page 370 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoDepartment of Australia and took precedence of any further acts of Parliament however authorized. In other words the provision of the Civil Service Act for employment of temporary men for special purposes the permanent officials do not intend to heed. If this assumption were granted it would meanParliament would have no power. In fact that is the case though not openly understood. I have wished to place before you a few of the facts that have come within our experience. It becomes constantly more evident that if we desire results either in the way of war or of peace our communities at home or abroad must find a substitute for the bureaucratic system which is at present universal in white communities. The control of the government of Australia by the cities has limited the transportation to the coastal districts. This alone is sufficient to manifest the necessity of the Capital's standing on its own foundations since, as the Governor General puts it, \"A country population is so essential to the present prospects and future safety of Australia.\" [Note: ==== Beginning of page 294 (table of contents) ====] No. 19. HILLS CRYSTALS . Marion Mahony Griffin [Note: ==== Beginning of page 295 ====]The general formation of the land hereabouts in Texas gives a unique problem to the occupancy designer. It forms a series of almost flat terraces with quite sudden drops to the terraces below. Hence the form of the layout is the reverse of rectangular, but adjusted to the succession of hilltops and theseries of terraces encircling them down to the river flats. The present thoroughfare from San Antonio to Boerne establishes the location of the business center. The details are laid out only for the property unified under a single ownership. For the most part park reserves follow the rivers. The School Group and encircling grounds however are practically flat.

LOLA LLOYD - MAVERICK RANCH BOERNE TEXAS Page 371 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoMARION M. GRIFFIN LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT 1846 ESTES AVENUE CHICAGO HILL CRYSTALS A basic principle in Community planning is to reverence and preserve nature, fixing the development which may continue through time in such a way as to retain the character of the district, enhancing but never destroying, so that the generations to come may be surrounded by the charms that the creative nature Beings have spent the millenniums in bringing about. In the water molded hills of this lovely spot we find in miniature, but no less effective, the perpetually varying effects of mountain scenery - heights and valleys, plains and gullies, intimate charms and wideviews over the hills to the picturesque horizon. The whole district, which is cretaceous, is already naturally terraced as if by a formal mind to preserve a feeling of grandeur. Let us hope each individual citizen will treat these terraces reverently. They make it easy to set houses so that one tier overlooks another giving all the citizenry unobstructed wide views. Proper consideration for one's neighbor would, in general, keep the roofs flat which gives the occupant an added terrace for use in any of innumerableways - for landing places for the gyroscope planes of the near future, for water reservoirs which would help keep the home cool in the hot season, or for choice gardens so that from the sky the whole will be lovely nature as it is now, or for general outdoor living. An example could be set here which if followed would transform Texas, \"the most important thing which its citizens could do\" for the state in which they take such pride - preserve the water [Note: ==== Beginning of page 297 ====] of the rainfall - which has been tested and found practicable - by establishing a series of dams small or large along every stream. The lay of the land which has been cut into deep gullies by the volumes of rushing torrents lends itself perfectly to this treatment and would add an innumerable variety of lovely features for the delight and education of all its citizenry - pools, caves, open fields, steep precipices, waterfalls, streams flowing throughout the year - to accomplish which the fairies need human help. Thewater supply is adequate but wasted at present. After all it is high time humans changed their policy of destroying nature because of the greed of one generation and made it their task and their joy to save and enhance. Indeed only so can the children of the future be healthy in body and soul or secure an education which will enable them to develop creative thinking which is the essence of spirit. The plan of this community provides its citizenry with all urban advantages and at the same time retains all the rural advantages. The long and varied walks will still be there when occupation has been completed, and the system of parks interfacing with allotment groups makes all the distinctive features permanently available to everybody. Every allotment has its street frontage and its park frontage so one park will not be overcrowded because other districts lack similar advantages. The whole boundary of the property is retained for the community, and park paths connect all the larger open spaces. Adventurewill always be there, hill climbing, waterside rambles, wide open views and the wild life that can be encouraged to take domicile here. The whole gamut of natural features is there and calls for the romantic type of plan. In fact it would be impossible to build the deadly gridiron plan for there are hills and steep gullies, flats and precipices, so there is a touch of gaiety in what formality Page 372 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 298 ====] has been achieved. The general lay of the land of the whole district round about has established main roads on a diagonal to the North and South of the compass, which means that the ideal orientation for residences - at 45degrees to East West so that all the rooms get the sun and all get the shade - is practically parallel to the main thoroughfares which facilitates the establishment of this bit of formality which becomes important as the building increases and adds a pleasant element of the comprehensible especially when viewed from the air. The property, about 2 square miles, cuts diagonally across a 2 mile square district. It is an especially picturesque district the adjoining areas being wide flat ranches with hills and mountains in the distance. Its destiny as a residential center is written in its richly varied topography. The type of development shown here could be followed to advantage by the immediately adjoining properties by extending radial thoroughfares and the town might become a city. San Antonio is about three quarters of an hour's drive to the South East and the town of Boerne some twenty minutes to theNorth West. That is enough for rail service. It would not be desirable to have this lovely district industrialized. The thoroughfare between these two cities crosses a corner of the estate thus establishing the location of the Civic Center. Other radial avenues will be directed to the point where the present road - Lloyd Drive - comes into Boerne Road. Another radial avenue is directed from this center to the South West to meetOld Boerne Road, an established thoroughfare. Another radial Avenue - Bersodi [Note: Borsodi?] Drive - could be established to complete service to the surrounding districts. Along these thoroughfares the business would naturally [Note: ==== Beginning of page 299 ====] gradually develop. The more secluded space between these thoroughfares becomes the residential area. We thus establish the Thoroughfares and the Distributive streets. Such foresight prevents the occurrence later on of blighted districts for it is obvious that business could not maintain itself on the devious roads of the residential areas. The thoroughfares provide indefinity [Note: indefinite?, infinite?] opportunity for the expansion of business. The spaces between the radii offer permanent residential advantages. The junction of Lloyd Drive with Boerne Road having established the location of the Civic Center, we take advantage of being on a thoroughfare to establish there a business district for the pioneer days, the buildings there being on a rental basis so as not to interfere with its transformation later on to some important monumental building such as a Town Hall. At the moment Boerne Road could be widened on the property to form a circle sufficient for 6 shops - A,B,C,D,E,F - 3 on either side of the road. Theshops radiate back to a wider frontage on the great circle to be constructed later. The next step in the years to come would be to get the Council to permit the development of Boerne Road into this circle Page 373 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagodeviating the traffic to encircle these shops forming a plaza. These shops would then make this larger circle their frontage the small inner circle becoming their court - and later on the court of the Town Hall. At present and for some time to come there would be no widening of the road but simply a fixing of theline or the inner circle, to fix the frontage of the shops, and a drive around the future front for present loading. Later on, as the community grows, these primitive shops could be abandoned and the space used for its ultimate purpose - Town Hall, Opera House or what you will. General business would then take its [Note: ==== Beginning of page 300 ====] place on the outer circle and gradually extend along the radial Thoroughfares.It is possible that a water reservoir and power could be developed on the somewhat higher level of the North East corner of the Civic Center to make water, plumbing and power available for the initial buildings. There is a bit of a stream near by in Mr. Borsodi's [Note: Bersodi's?]property. Arrangements might be made with him for the use of this water in return for entrance for the Borsodi [Note: Bersodi?]radial thoroughfare to the Civic Center. ROSARY CRYSTALS A second thoroughfare is already established - Lloyd Drive - extending to the suburb ROSARY CRYSTALS. A little settlement is already established here and here doubtless a suburban community will first develop, purely residential, social and educational, depending on a bit of commuting for its general services though certain services and crafts might well be initiated here and become permanent, ahome bakery, craft shops for weaving, modeling, etc., a community laundry and other such homey services as well as kindergarten, craft schools, library, etc. Services are already established - power, electricity, water. The initial settlement might well be a close one and is so indicated on the plan. To the East of the buildings already established are quite lovely terraces for homesites and below them flat fields which might well be used as small farms - nut groves, vegetable gardens chicken or rabbit raising,etc., and on the terraces above, on Lolaberg way, are fine building sites and a charming terraced spot for an open air theatre the open fields below offering ample space for a good sized audience. The broken country and the beautiful wide views which make thoroughfares undesirable will establish Rosary Crystals as the spacious residential district. The Northwestern part of this suburb has [Note: ==== Beginning of page 301 ====] extensive wide flats for the Air Plane field whose connection with the inner park system - Crystal Park - offers fine opportunities for the Golf Links. The gentle slopes have been made use of for roads giving access to the high spots, the hill tops, around which the groups of allotments are swung so as to give fine wide views to everybody. The crystallinegroups of this suburb district hang like beads on the main circuits of the Rosary. Here fancy is tempted Page 374 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoto run a bit wild. Wide and distant views, steep gullies, lovely natural terraces - as if parked by a civilization of long ago - the work of gnomes and undines and sylphs everywhere in evidence, the nature folk at work and at play, ideal homesites for the children of today and tomorrow. The general characteristics of these Rosary Crystals is that their street frontage is minimized, though ample for building dwellings on these high spots, and then the lots widen as they extend over terrace after terrace so that most of them contain picturesque natural features and all of them have frontages on the reserves surrounding the crystals. On the South West corner of Rosary Crystals are a group of lots with grand views on an already established thoroughfare and a group of some 35 allotments on this highest terrace connect with this Old Boerne Road and so have a short out to Boerne. The opening of an old country road along the South boundary would give the rest of the Rosary Crystals district access to this drive to Boerne. It might be advisable to use the Crystal center parks on the high points as reservoirs from which water could be piped down to each dwelling. This might be a welcome supplementary supply if not sufficientto meet all needs. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 302 ====] HILL CRYSTALS Let us return to the South Western area. The two basic principles of Town Planning are communication and occupation. The radial thoroughfares from one center to another establish the location and development of business. If such are notestablished to begin with the time comes when they have to be driven through at great expense. Since the realtor wants rectangular blocks he gives no consideration to the need for direct communication from point to point and even if such have been established he plunks a gridiron system on top of them, even if he is laying it out on a drawing board. The two problems should be solved at one and the same time. This is done by establishing the radii and then bringing in the distributive streets perpendicular to them.This makes all lots either rectangular or obtuse which is just as satisfactory for building purposes, just as economical. Therefore in the Civic Center we bring in the distributive streets at right angles to the radial streets. Such a system, as it extends further and further from the center, gives greater and greater space for interior parks as should be the case as land becomes cheaper the further it is removed from the closely occupied centers. These parks cost nothing since they take up no street frontage. Terrace Drive illustrates this point. Here just South of the Center are lovely terraces for residential purposes sufficiently high to give all the homes beautiful views of Park Mountain across the River especially if they are built with flat roofs. The terrace drive is kept narrow to make this possible for every house. The whole river and its banks are so interesting and so varied that they have been dedicated as permanent park with one drive along its western side open to this park - the Park Drive. It could bemade narrow and winding if nature calls for that treatment. It is the one park drive. It skirts the River Park with its charming natural Page 375 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 303 ====] features, - springs, waterfalls, pools, caves. On the other side of the River we climb the mountain. The Valley of the River's Western branch forms a grandiose amphitheatre for play and pageant, with a mountain on either side. Park Drive and Mountain View Drive skirting this theatre form a naturalcongregation point for Cafe, Museum, Library, etc. The Western half of this section which, being close to the Civic Center, will naturally develop with a somewhat closer occupation than Rosary Crystals, is the ultimate School Center. Maverick Circuit offers allotments with park as well as street frontages. Its terraced allotments give fine opportunities for terraced houses whose flat roofs become a charming part of the living quarters. There are 2 street and 2 parkway entrances to the school group in the center, its buildings staggered so as to get the maximum outlook from all sides. This method should be followed in the location of all the residences. The schools surround an interior park or pool with a bandstand in the center, and the school circuit is surrounded by playfields for supervised sports, etc. Connecting Hill Crystals and Rosary Crystals is a region of flat land which lends itself to sports fields and larger allotments to be used as small farms. Some of these skirt the river on up to the Spring. The structures so far as possible should be of the local stone, a fine building material. Nothing can give such a feeling of dignity and permanence as stone or concrete. There are approximately 200 residential and 40 business allotments. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 304 ====]INITIAL - COVECRAG [Note: See the second illustration at the beginning of Section II, No. 15, page 225 (above).] AMERICA THE LAND OF ADVENTURERS & AUSTRALIA BEFORE MR. [Note: John] CURTIN Most of the adventurers of the world have come to America. Only here have the doors been open to all who would come. Out of this difference of policy America has developed a different type of character from Australia which has an almost equal area, except for Alaska, of inexhaustible resources, for this talk about desert in Australia is nonsense. She has no more than her share if we speak continentally but like the rest of us she is increasing aridity as fast as possible. I nearly threw a riot in a group of my beloved friends in Casa Bonita when I announced my conclusion that there was this marked difference in the ideals of Australians and Americans; the Australian's ideal aristocracy, the American's democracy; the Australian interest in getting out of doing, the American's in doing. The difference has been encouraged by the fact that on the whole no one has been assisted in Page 376 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocoming to the United States. Each one has taken on his own adventure and no one has helped him after he got over here. He has had his own battle to fight and win, whereas to a large extent Australian immigration has been assisted (even to the remittance men who in a way are paid to stay away fromBritain) and after arrival they look for and demand assistance. They feel the world owes them a living. They have yet to learn that they not only determined their circumstances before birth but even chose their parents and brought them together before their birth. As a consequence in Australia there is little kindliness outside of one's own circle. So little of this is there in Australia that practically everyone who moves digs up the plants he has planted and takes them along to the next place. Usually they die but thatis better than leaving them for the other fellow. I remember the surprised look in a man's face - a highly cultured and nice man too - when I suggested he go ahead with building on a homesite he owned though he might have to leave it later, that he make of it another paradise as he had of one before. \"What for someone else,\" he said. And I said, \"Yes, why not go on making paradises for other people.\" [Note: ==== Beginning of page 305 ====] Of our own experience with young folks we have known, when they come to America they are welcomed, given hospitality, given jobs even in preference to home folks out of the feeling that they are \"a long ways from home.\" Quite the contrary in Australia. This is definitely the result of the differences of the social systems under which they live. Even if immigration lasted for a while, they swiftly put up the barriers against further incomers. This is carried to an absurdity in Australia where the population of a good sized city lays claim to a whole continent nearly as big as the United States. Social relations maybe very pleasant but when one enters the economic realm he finds everyone, individually and collectively against him tooth and claw. The reaction on themselves of this spirit is that within the community itself ability or excellence in any direction is hindered, opposed, prevented from functioning. Brought up with the notion that the farther west one goes the more advanced democracy one will find, and having been inclined to accept Australian propaganda at its face value, an American gets a painfulshock on arriving there where he finds himself in Europe with a vengeance. One suddenly finds out all about Colonial America stripped of the glamour of the distance of a hundred and fifty years. Suddenly he understands why the American revolution took place and begins to comprehend the significance of the American constitution. And gradually one becomes terrified at America's ignorance of European affairs and systems. A transient traveler cannot see inner truths but when one undertakes to live in (I donot mean retire to) a European community he begins to know. Also he begins to lose that joyousness so characteristic of America, for everything he has been in the habit of hanging his hopes to for bettering the future soon shows itself to be futile. Reform movements even fundamental reforms he begins to realize offer no help. And finally be sees that though purporting to be democratic or to be tending toward democracy there has not in [Note: ==== Beginning of page 306 ====] reality been the slightest movement in that direction nor in fact the slightest desire to move in that direction. Page 377 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoAmericans have seen one community after another in Europe forced for one reason or another to alter its form of government, seen them investigate American and European systems and then adopt the parliamentary form. They have been inclined to assume that this was because it was a better, a moredemocratic, system than the congressional. The contrary of the fact. Autocracies that have tormented their lower classes to desperation have assumed this form because they can hide behind it in full strength and the distracted community is like a new visitor to Sydney who searches in vain for the flea that is sucking and poisoning his blood filling his whole body with loathsome disease. We have had the American system analyzed by Europeans. It is high time we had the European system analyzed by Americans. To do this it is necessary to get behind the curtain - no easy matter for all the portals and most cleverly guarded, but for years Griffin was an observer from within the cabinet one might almost say. We must remember that the Americans who wrote the constitution were fresh from their experiences with the evils of the parliamentary system and we should be thankful indeed that they made their great effort center not entirely on escaping from a power over them but also in solving theevils of the system under which they had been living. In taking the stand that corruption was less in Europe either before the war or now, there is a very important element that has been overlooked. Corruption as commonly understood arises only when the underprivileged begin to contest the claims of the privileged. Until that time the generally accepted standard gives a propriety to the lack of fairness necessarily involved in privilege which makes the useof the word corrupt incomprehensible to the general community. This still obtains when the underprivileged begin to object but still have no power to make their point of view effective which is still the case [Note: ==== Beginning of page 307 (table of contents) ====] MAP OF AUSTRALIA VICTORIA'S SHRINE OF REMEMBRANCE [Note: The New-York Historical Society copy also includes a picture of Prime Minister John Curtin captioned, \"Australia's Great Prime Minister.\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 308 ====] in Europe. The Labor Party now in office in England will be able to increase the power of the bureaucracy but that is but removing them one step further from democracy. The privileged element still has full power. It may grant some philanthropy as much or as little as it wishes, but that is not of the nature of justice. As the belief grows that privilege means unfairness favors are granted from caution as well as philanthropy but when the underprivileged reach a point where they have the power to enforce fairness then privilege takes to hiding and corruption begins. In spite of the ugly name this latter stage isfar preferable to the earlier and indicates a higher standard of morality and intelligence in the community. We might say that is where America stood in 1930. Page 378 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe next stage is to clear away all the mental confusions and realize that there is nothing to gain by attacking corruption, which is a result, but only by attacking the cause - privilege - and wiping it out of existence. When that is done attention can then be turned to corruption (which in more personal formsmay still exist) and to minimize it by opening the doors to opportunity for constructive use of ability through a triune organization of the community with an Abilities Organ whose function is to give every opportunity to ability. The cause of corruption has its stronghold in the union of the Political and Economic systems. We should be able to recognize it in its modern guises. It is most encouraging to find the present world movements recognizing the necessity of building up Economical and Social(Ability) organs as well as the Security (Equity) Organ, which is essentially a police (military) organ. The following was written by me in those early days. It has a note of bitterness. That is gone now that I know the way out and know that Americans are the ones who should effect it. No one anywhere has had the chances they have had. There are certain terms whose meanings are unknown in the United States though they are used there more or less freely. Among these are \"foreigner,\" \"class,\"\"government,\" [Note: ==== Beginning of page 309 ====] \"Civil Servant.\" These words when understood eat into your soul and destroy spiritual development. They turn men into beasts. They make then stupid, callous, fiendish. They turn one's mind inward on oneself which as physicians know is the process which develops insanity. They belong to servile communities whose ideals are to cringe to the higher ups, to spit on the lower downs, to get somethingfor nothing, the greatest reverence being offered to the one who has the most and serves the least - the ideals of the dog in the manger. Achievement loses its meaning and stagnation takes its place. A foreigner is a person to be feared, to be hated, to be despised. In the eyes of the law he has no rights, either to collect debts due him nor to sue for libel. But he can be sued for libel whether he says anything or nothing since speaking the truth is considered quite as libelous as speaking falsely. A foreigner is onewhose honesty, intelligence, industry are things to be deadened as establishing bases of comparison threatening established methods of muddling and monopoly. The whole community unites to hound, to cheat, to defame the foreigner wheresoever he may come from. These methods are common to business, professions and unions. The classes divide simply according to self interest. Each class is filled with hatred of the other especially the \"liberals\" who speak with the greatest venom of the \"lower class\" and who can't get away from the subject. From their point of view the laborer is not a human being but a creature with no rights, created solely to work for the upper class and who should be forced to serve his superior class by whatever means are necessary, starvation being the favorite. If they can't be forced to work, as is the case with the aboriginals, then poison them. Privilege is divine and anyone attempting to tamper with itis a traitor. The upper class consequently does not pay its bills. This is not considered dishonest. It is one of their privileges always to be in arrears. It accords with the ideal of getting something for nothing. To work for money as they do in the U.S. so Page 379 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 310 ====] as to be able to pay your bills is degrading - \"so materialistic.\" \"Government\" is a supreme divine thing which when once determined, by no matter what means, has a right to do whatever it divinely - or devilishly - pleases. If at any time it happens that a certain group of \"subjects,\" for there is no such a thing as a citizen, attempts to urge its \"representative,\" it's a scandalous thing talked about ad nauseam in the papers and the community generally and no \"self respecting\" member will pay the slightest attention to the wishes of these constituents - nor do they even in the matters on the platform, for of course a supreme power cannot be bound by platform statements whichare merely used as dust in the eyes. The human creature will talk so give him a platform to talk about if he is a laborer. The Liberals sleeping comfortably, don't require any platform. They merely squirm with disgust when the Laborites talk about theirs. The Civil Servant is the instrument by which Royalty maintains itself and its powers and vice versa. It is a perfect instrument for its purpose and a Civil Servant doesn't hesitate to tell parliament, as [Note: Lieutenant] Colonel [Note: Percy Thomas] Owen did - \"I was chosen by the \"Executive Council\" - the direct agent of the King - \"therefore my powers transcend those of Parliament\" - (chosen merely by the people) - \"and I shall not allow any act of Parliament to interfere with my doing as I see fit.\" Their rewards for flaunting [Note: flouting?] the people and their agents are power and titles and promotions. The more brazen they are the greater the reward. And no one not even a laborite would dream oflessening the power of the Civil Service. Indeed the whole effort of all parties is to increase the strength of this despotic organization. The whole community believes in despotism. The idea of democracy is beyond the reach of the imagination. They have heard the word but it has no meaning. The Bureaucracy strangles the community. Heavy debts are forced on them, education is perverted and prevented. Out of a class of 40 or 50 children only 5 or 6 will be allowed to pass the examinations and so be able to takehigher education. On the boat on which I was [Note: ==== Beginning of page 311 ====] returning from India in 1938 was the wife of the Londoner who had been made the head of the Police Department of Melbourne . [Note: This sentence ends with an exclamation point in the N-YHS copy.] She was joining him there. I read in the newspaper today - in the year 1945 - that England is arranging to permit a few \"lower class\" young folks to go to the higher schools. This is called democracy in Europe. Australia is under the absolute domination of an established bureaucracy which controls not only major but even petty affairs of its citizens. Under its sway talent can't develop. It permeates all fields from the lad who enters a factory to the professional man. The former finds that if he works efficiently he has put himself wrong with the supervisor and that no promotions will come his way and that he will be one ofthe first to lose his job when slack times come. A good example is a certain youth we know who was a real mechanical genius. He had made a beautiful full sized motor boat as perfect in its woodwork as any that comes from the shops. The only part he had to buy was the engine. He got a job in a manufacturing establishment and, having the habit of work, worked well turning out considerably more than his fellow workers. This promptly put him in bad with the foreman who presently made life unendurable for him Page 380 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoand he is now working on a farm. So this young man's particular abilities are lost to the community. This was Unions. Yes, but a reflection of uppers. The architect, for instance, discovers that to design is impossible, that specifications for buildings laid down in ancient times are required, with a few supplements such as requiring window sills 2'6\" from the floor. Early in his practice in Melbourne Griffin designed an office building - the Leonard Chambers - for which he made drawings, at much cost to the office of course, over and over for two solid years and which he finally threw back practically as they were in the beginning and the Council passed them. Probably they got tired of seeing \"the damned Yankee\" around. The building had no window sills for itswhole front, between its two outside piers was glass in pattern with steel bars from the first floor to the top floor. When [Note: ==== Beginning of page 312 ====] it was completed the architects stood around and gasped with astonishment. \"How could he do that? It's against the law!\" They had been cured of the impulse to design by the squelching of any such pernicious efforts in their early youth. Within officialdom the pressure is still greater. A lad came to us from a government office because his moral nature had not yet been broken down and his parents did not exert the usual domination over him to hold onto a life job. He had a permanent job with a raise of salary at certain fixed periods of his life if he played the game but he didn't enjoy being obliged not to work. It didn't take him long to learn that if he had finished the task given him by his superior officer he had only annoyed him if he told him he was ready for the next. If he wanted to keep in his good graces he must, when the supervisor came around, push his pencil around and look busy. Only so can a Civil Servant attain those positions which bring them honor and glory, though of course if they outlive all their contemporaries they will come into them through pure priority. While I was in America I, like all the pious people, was working for Civil Service reform. It took but a short experience under a perfected officialdom to realize the folly of such a movement. It is however one of those things that really cannot be grasped by the rational method of thinking. It is so reasonable, so subtly appealing. It can be comprehended only through experience or through creative, inspirational thinking through which we can perceive that this mixing of the economic with the political can end only in dictatorship which ultimately can have no efficiency. We must realize however that separation is nogood if the political organ continues to grant special privileges such as monopolies, ownership of land or tolerance of private power of any sort. Officialdom has no patriotism. It works together as a unit whenever its power is threatened as instancedin the first world war. From my vantage point in Australia I followed a story then unfolding, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 313 ====] with intense interest. Who else, I wonder, saw that tale unfold? In the very early days of the 1st World Page 381 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoWar I noticed a small paragraph in an obscure part of the paper saying that President Duschanel [Note: Paul Deschanel?; \"Poincare\" crossed out] (and we must remember that he had no such authority as our Congressional President) had placarded the whole of France with an appeal to the people to support theParliament as against the Military Bureaucracy, saying that Parliament and the President were the executives selected by the people and it was not possible for them to function in this capacity unless they were informed as to facts and the Military department was refusing to supply them with facts. He recognized the objection of placing necessarily secret information in too many hands, such as Parliament or even the Cabinet. But this objection could not hold in the case of the President. He stated that in theearly days the French soldiers at the front would have starved, such were the delays through the red tape of officialdom, if Parliament hadn't taken into its own hands the forwarding of provisions. Weeks, sometimes years elapsed in my gathering of information on the sequence of events. The generalissimo of the army refused to give this information and was dismissed by the President. Each general asked refused to accept the conditions. Ultimately Duschanel [Note: Deschanel?; \"Poincare\" crossed out] called upon a general in the Saar district where both Germans and French saw to it that there should be no fighting for without those supplies the war couldn't continue, and General [Note: Ferdinand] Foch accepted the position as head of the French Army. He was a Catholic. Now I am not a Catholic. For a long time I was very anti-Catholic. Australia cured me of that. The bureaucracies are Masonic. When Generalissimo Foch issued his instructions no general obeyed them. The movements ofthe Allied armies stopped, British as well as French. The Germans were welcome to walk into Paris if they wanted to so far as the Allied armies were concerned, but curiously enough the German activities ceased too (Bureaucrats of course). From a high officer in the Australian army who was there we learned personally that there was no battle and defeat at Amiens (if [Note: \"Deschanel,\" \"Poincare\" - Paul Deschanel was President of the French Chamber of Deputies from 1912 to 1920. Raymond Poincare was President of the Third French Republic from 1913 to 1920.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 314 ====] my memory as to the name is correct) but that the chief officers left the front, the subordinate officers followed them and the soldiers, seeing them going, followed after. From an article in the Saturday Evening Post after the war I read that, having volunteered in the early days, an American Aviator - andother aviators in Northern France all ready to go to the front and knowing the urgency of the situation could not conceive why they were not sent forward. Finally they were sent and they saw this, to them, still incomprehensible thing, happening. There were three orderly lines of march; no fear, no excitement. Two were coming away from the front, one marching in. Those coming out were the people of the district carrying their goods; and the soldiers. The one going in was the last reserves of France, the oldmen. They were the only ones who responded to Foch's appeal to save France. Having found a group who would take his orders Duschanel [Note: Deschanel?] court-marshaled several generals for disobeying the orders of their superior and the battle was on again. The British officers were never punished though Roberts was recalled to England, Gish was rewarded later by being given charge of the Army in Russia fighting the revolutionists. Some time after the war was over[Note: Georges] Clemenceau was entertained in London by the higher-ups, official and otherwise, who Page 382 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowere astounded and looked at him with incredulous amazement when he said that the President of France had selected the General of the military forces (a defiance of Parliamentary, that is of bureaucratic procedure). We arrived in Australia in May, 1914. Six months before Mr. James Alexander Smith, a great man and a renowned engineer, had advised Griffin against coming to Australia. He had told him that a war would break out in Europe in 1914. He was like Mr. Henry Stead [Note: Henry Wickham Steed?], the greatest editor of those years, who also foretold - out of his knowledge of underlying things - practically everything that happened during the war even to the failure of President [Note: Woodrow] Wilson at Versailles. We, ourselves, wept tears of anguish when President Wilson yielded to the pressure for secret conferences knowing that meant the end of his power and influence.

NEW SOUTH WALES [Note: ==== Beginning of page 316 ====]CAPTION Leeton already had a small population when Griffin first arrived in Australia. Mr. Wade [Note: L.A.B. Wade?], whose death shortly after was a great loss to Australia, put the planning of this hillsite inGriffin's hands and had him design a crown feature for the water tower already under construction. Griffin advised and Mr. Wade agreed to making this one of an ultimate pair to form a gateway to the Central Plaza of the city. He made the drawings for this on shipboard and sent it back when he landed in America. Mr. Wade's death was WBG's first heartbreak in Australia.

Otherwise thetexts of the two copies are comparable.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 317 ====] ----- LEETON ----- NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA. The Town Plan. GENERAL. Leeton as a town planning undertaking is distinguished first because it is under the centralized control of the State embodied in a single responsible direction (Commissioner) with wide latitude of regulation based on socialized land and socialized public street services, together with an ethic and hygienic authority considerably wider than police power as ordinarily construed. To encourage continuity there is provided in the organization, antecedent to the usual function of the City Surveyor, a permanentLandscape Gardener to bring to bear on the continual development and incidental problems a fundamental conception of their aesthetic aspects. SITE. It is the first located town within the borders of the 1,500,000 acre Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, and starts with inexpensive land occupying a definitely limited site, non-irrigable because slightly elevated,but for the same reason easily drained and commanding the breezes as well as the views. This low-lying elongated hill extends in a north-north-easterly south-south-westerly direction for a length of two miles with its highest and broadest portion at the northern end gently rising from a level plain to 60' elevation and with two off-shoots of just perceptible rise - one extending for a mile to the south and one for a quarter of a mile westward. The slopes are herewith illustrated by contours at onefoot vertical intervals. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 318 ====] FUNCTIONS. The town site reservation provides liberal spaciousness for all the demands of a population that may be forecasted from the distribution radius of a spur-line center within the southern border of the irrigation district, about 5 miles distant from Yanco, a previously established community on that border but served by main line railway connection, the South Western Line of the State System. Page 384 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art of ChicagoThe total acreage reserved is 1125 as bounded by the center line of the surrounding roadway, while for the population, 7000 is assumed thus allowing 1.22 families of five per acre gross. Of the total area 2 per cent is devoted to rights of way for the communicating lines of all kinds and the balance available foroccupancy for special purposes. The proportion of the allocation for the various general purposes is as follows:-- AREAS. Occupation Public Private Building Sites Acres Acres General 17 387 Show Ground 38 Manufactures 70 Parks Main Park 316 Local Park 76 Communication Railway 9Highways 212 ---------- ---------- Totals 668 457 Total 1125 [Note: ==== Beginning of page 319 ====] OCCUPATION. Of the whole town site 40 percent is allotted to private purposes and 40 per cent to communal purposes:- Public buildings, parks, etc., exclusive of the general communication ways. The general lie of the hill facilitates an ideal orientation for the major portion of the town with angles of thirty and sixty degrees about the meridian assuring all sunlit frontages, maintaining however a preponderance of shade on one side or the other of each street at the hottest period of the day. In a community of the size of Leeton where the domestic character predominates the limitations and simplicity of the whole organization permit considerable freedom and informality for a homely coziness and picturesqueness. Flexibility and convertibility in a small place are but minor requirements. Great care has been taken however to avoid confusion or monotony in the cumulative effect by definite subordination of the numerous elements to the few important ones and by restricting the variation oforientation to a very few fixed directions. The intersections between various building groups of diverse directions are concealed or mitigated by special measures in parking or court group arrangements with only obtuse angles in evidence. INDUSTRY. Page 385 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoLeeton, at the time of this plan of extension with about 600 population, occupies chiefly that portion of the site adjoining a main thoroughfare consisting of two avenues 100' wide extending [Note: ==== Beginning of page 320 (table of contents) ====] CENTRAL PLAZA OF LEETON [Note: In this section of the typescript the pagination (but not the content) of the New-York Historical Society copy differs from that of the Art Institute. In the New-York copy this illustration appears on a separate sheet between a page ending with the paragraph \"The retail industry .... for effective architectural composition\" and a page beginning with the paragraph \"Railway passenger and goods stations .... severely plain masses free of awnings.\" In the Art Institute copy these two paragraphs are onthe same page.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 320 ====] across a slight saddle in the hilltop. This main route is already put to several industrial uses - focused in the post office at the obtuse angle intersection of these two avenues. Served now by the connectingroadway from Yanco at the east and leading to the railway station site and to the present creamery and canning factories on the west side this thoroughfare has already fixed the industrial axis of the town for the future. MERCHANDISING. The retail shopping industry may be expected to continue to serve largely a constituency outside the town (an area of intensive culture in small irrigated farms) requiring therefore a maximum of accessibility by rail and external roads. The shops comprising essentially an aggregation of private enterprises in small units are arranged to be defined so far as possible by larger units of nearest analogous use to serve as terminals of the grouping for effective architectural composition. [Note: In the New-York Historical Society copy the illustration \"Central Plaza of Leeton\" appears on a separate page at this point.] Railway passenger and goods stations confine thus the extension on [Note: the] west. Two public garages, convenient to the greatest highway traffic at the east, are given a rather exceptional degree of public control in order, eventually, to effect a strong \"gateway\" impression with their severely plain masses free of awnings. The most general and largest unit of merchandising, The Town Market, is availed of for the central dominant element coupled with a combined store and office building in the other protruding southern corner in the trade route to complete this strong structural frame for more or less heterogeneous minor commercial buildings. Page 386 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 321 ====] MANUFACTURES. Merchandising, storage and wholesale and retail dealing in bulky goods merge as to requirements with such manufactures as are to be provided for working up the produce of this gardening, dairy and pastoral community. Provision for all such industry, notably Public Service Plant, Factories, Freight and Stock Yards, and for Feed Fuel and Building Materials is made contributory to the Mercantile thoroughfare as well as the Railway, at the same time lying beyond the stations, shut off by special screening parkways and removed from the other activities of the town by the intervening railway rightof way. For noonday use especially this flat district is furnished with a local sports field and picnic park. Additional factory space also facing this park and screened and served in exactly the same way as the one provided can be established on the other side [Note: of] the crossing of the business highway over the railway if the need should ever arise. ADMINISTRATION. The administrative phase of business as compared with handling and manipulating merchandise requires a somewhat different degree and kind of traffic accommodation, the heavy traffic being relatively a minor element in the case of the former though easy accessibility is equally imperative. The central square of the town is here arranged to accommodate the Post Office, Banks, Town Hall, Court House and buildings for private offices adjoining the Mercantile Axis to which it is a transverse axis providingamenities not so compatible with the merchandising proper. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 322 ====] GOVERNMENT. The Town Hall crowns the apex of the road viewed from the direction of the stations while a combination of Bank and Post Office constitute a Federal Government Group commanding the extension of the main road in the deviated direction beyond the square. These two dominating publicgroups on the top of the hill serve at the same time to stop and define the upper ends of the miscellaneous mercantile group on the northern side of the commercial highway in a way corresponding with the most important of the business structures on the southern side previously instanced. DOMESTIC INTERESTS. The effort in the planning of Leeton is not only to ameliorate the industrial detractions that tend to make modern towns incongruous but, on the other hand, constructively to enhance here to a maximum, the cultural or, in the largest sense of the term, the Domestic advantages that large cities are so capable of offering and which often are perniciously operating to the depletion of rural areas. COMMUNAL LIFE. In such a town as this the opportunity to obviate country isolation by providing readily accessible comforts and attractions of community life is exceptional for Communal conservation of the community Page 387 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoland values accruing through enhanced attractiveness, and attendant growth tend to make each element foster the other in the development. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 323 ====] RECREATION. For outdoor life which in Australia is continuous there is space far in excess of the necessary requirements of the village to provide for the sports and relaxation of a whole surrounding \"closer settlement\" agricultural group. GENERAL RESERVATIONS. The main park of 316 acres with 36 acres of artificial lake and to be varied with sheltering plantings and open fields is ample to allow the visiting families to combine in their journey to market the pleasures of town company with country freedom and elbow room. This is the place for general seasonal festivals and pageants in which appreciation of the great possibilities of similar climate may sometimes stimulate here a slight emulation of the splendid activities of the citizens of Ancient Greece. The contiguous location of the show grounds for the exhibits of stock, produce and agricultural and horticultural facilities makes it possible to utilize some at least of the buildings to contribute, throughout the year, features of refreshment, convenience and amusement to the general increase of the effectiveness of the whole. The central Town square with refreshing shaded promenades, fountain, pool and music can set a standard that will tend to induce a high plane of attractiveness in private shows and places of amusement and refreshment that must compete where they do not collaborate. Perhaps the good old afternoon band concerts of the [Note: ==== Beginning of page [324] ====] Spanish Towns may be revived here where the environment a well as the temperament of the people are as well suited. The northern end of this esplanade which is the actual summit of Leeton Hill is to be marked by two concrete water towers, plain masses 70 feet high, crested with perforated enrichment. One of these is completed and its twin is arranged to combine with it as a high portal giving on to the Town Square. Between these massive gate posts a glimpse of a facade of a church at the bend of theapproach road is designed to contribute a delicate finial to the outward vista. Facing the plaza is the State Hotel, the sole place where liquors are dispensed or served for drinking, and with meals only. This policy will naturally induce private hostelries and accommodation houses to be contiguous, establishing as it were a transients' centre. Here then is the strategic location for theatres, clubs and lodges for which general purpose the main esplanade frontage is reserved and is to be Page 388 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagorestricted to an harmonious arrangement; preferably fully carried out by the authorities. Adjoining the central square an existent quarry on the brow of the hill, with view of the distant blue ranges to the north east offers a chance to create inexpensively a picturesque general park or naturalhistory garden of 4 acres to be treated informally and to simulate wild nature with profusion of varied flora and native fauna. At least one local school and one club house are to be assured frontage on this choice spot. LOCAL PARKS. Neighborhood parks and playgrounds abound in the residence blocks usually enclosed by the residence allotments excepting for [Note: ==== Beginning of page [324-2] ====] special footway entrances. Secluded from the roads not only are those plots safer for the children and better under the control of parents but they add little or nothing to the street service cost of the town. The playgrounds vary in size but large residence blocks make it possible to have large areas continuous and thus to secure open views for the house as well as accommodate a large variety of games and exerciseswith a minimum of disturbance. The largest of these units are of course distributed in those neighborhoods where the large general parks are least available and where the gentler slopes obviate expense in constructing fields for sports. EDUCATION. GENERAL INSTITUTIONS. The community requires one general educational institution at the least, namely, the academy or high school where the general secondary and the lower technical, particularly domestic and agricultural sciences are taught. Previously one reservation for the State School had been located which is retained in the Extension and accorded a commanding position with reference to one of the main avenues of approach to town. Adjoining it a site similar in all respects is allotted to the Girls' School which is itscomplement and may utilize much of a common staff and equipment. Another Institute or educational building for reference purposes and adult use, terminating the avenue leading into the main square and allowing for future incorporation of Library, Museums, Art Collections, etc., completes the dominant features of a General Educational Centre, which contributes directly - architecturally and [Note: ==== Beginning of page 325 ====] functionally to the Civic Centre. Space contiguous may well be reserved for additional private or religious educational institutions for secondary education in Leeton [Note: and?] will be of service not only to the town but to the primary system of its entire tributary territory. Page 389 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoLOCAL SCHOOLS. A community of ultimately fifteen hundred families can economically be supplied with from five to eight school districts, the smaller divisions being advantageous in handiness to the homes. The sites indicatedare evenly distributed and the lines of segregation are the main avenues so that the paths of the children may be clear and safe. Each site of course requires a large playground area which is cheaply furnished by the largest of the local internal parks. Points giving on to these parks and also commanding approaching streets for accessibility and architectural interest are given the preference and there are many such sites that may be added to those so indicated. RELIGION. Churches are perhaps most effectively neighborhood affairs and may also be distributed generally according to the accommodation in accessibility and architectural command of vistas. Conspicuousness for these buildings is especially to be conserved to the fullest because they usually contribute the richest and most effective features to the local architectural ensemble. Two principal church edifices are locatedwhere they join in the architec- [Note: ==== Beginning of page 326 ====] tural concentration commanding the Town Square. HABITATION Individual home sites held under terms of perpetual lease make up the bulk of the town, 1081 are shown in addition to the ones in occupation before this extension. Many additional plots might be added byemploying the external frontage of the existent boulevard engirdling the whole and by utilizing most of the road frontage of the Main Park. For the houses, only designs meeting the approval of the management and generally as prepared under its direction are admitted. With these a high degree of control in the relative disposition is encouraged, in accordance with which office and service features may be placed in juxtaposition and neutralized for the closest neighbors, whereas the fullest sunshine, largest views, and greatest privacy and freedom from disturbance is secured to each in a measure impossible where everyone in a law unto himself. The successive couplings, alternative recession and advance of building line \"in echelon\" and staggering of pairs in opposition across thoroughfares are among the means adopted to these ends. Placing of entrances at the side, location of living rooms and verandas according to the available prospects in the group, a general favoring of the more quiet outlooks and better aspects for the most general requirements of the family are features of the internal economy of the houses that both affect and are affected by the general house disposition on scientific lines. For cumulative architectural effectiveness general parallelism with as few and as distinct groups as can Page 390 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobe accommodated to the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 327 (table of contents) ====] ONE OF TWO WATER TOWERS FORMING GATEWAY TO PLAZA [Note: ==== Beginning of page 328 ====] Mr. [Note: L.A.B.?] Wade, whose death a year later broke our hearts, made contact with Griffin on that first visit to Australia. The occupation of this irrigation location had already begun and a water tower was partly built. Mr. Wade asked Griffin to design the city and showed him the water tower. Griffin suggested that there should ultimately be a pair of towers as a formal gateway to the city. Griffin made the drawings for the crown of the towers on shipboard and sent them back when he landed in America. [Note: Similar wording to a caption appears on page 316 (above).] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 329 ====] [Note: Continued from page 326] topographic features and other functions of the town, is maintained.Coziness and homeliness are assured through studied informality and harmonies of group composition with fore garden settings required everywhere. Australian sylva is unsurpassed for home embellishment with open lacelike delicacy, half concealing, half revealing in its subtle and quiet colorings of bark and stem as well as foliage and often profuse flowering. For the creation of a truly park-like atmosphere for this garden community palings of wood or metal of any degree of conspicuousness or attempted ornamentation have to be barred out. An infinite variety of always green shrubby vegetation of which growth for hedges and screen plantings obviates the necessity of other fencing except temporary wire work concealed wire reinforcement to which, practically, front, rear, and divisional boundary protection is restricted, mason work being exceptionalbecause expensive here. It is to be hoped that the general character of Leeton may be distinguished ultimately by a preponderance of shrub plantings naturally and informally massed and grouped for harmonies of texture and color of foliage and flower. The native flora, almost exclusively ligneous, indicated the line of least resistance under conditions of strong sunlight and irregular moisture as compared with the countries whence our Page 391 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagohabits of great lawns and herbaceous borders are inherited. The unambiguous scale of Leeton suggested the general informal arrangement which can only be brought out in execution by thoughtful avoidance of hardness or stiffness in the general landscape effect or complexity or pretentiousness in the architectureof its houses and gardens. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 330 ====] Since these desired characteristics are at the same time the cheapest to acquire and most enduring, untrammeled nature freely performing most of the service, it is reasonable to thus impose a general adherence to the common aim and encourage permanent plantings that will produce luxuriant shade and shelter in a addition to diversity in seasonal succession bright blossoms. COMMUNICATION. RAILWAY. Yanco on the main railway line lies to the south but the major part of the tributary irrigation area is in the other directions so that whereas in the early stages the main communication with the outside world is by way of the road leading south from the east side directly to Yanco; the railway to be builtcorrespondingly on the west side will largely supersede this in activity. Interurban tram lines radiating into the irrigated fields may also be expected to pass through here ultimately. The railway line is made to intersect the hill slopes twice in the short length that is in contact with the Town Site, to afford cheapest overhead continuity of the entrance roadways together with their attendant business, and at the same time in the reduction of the disturbance of the quiet of the village. To minimize the necessity of additional points of crossing the direction of the railway conforms to the circulatory roadway system which is, of course, essentially radial. CIRCULATORY HIGHWAYS. [Note: ==== Beginning of page [331] ====]The main avenues of the circulatory system connect the most important of the country roads directly to the town square and are made wide enough in proportion to their length and importance, (maximum 100') to carry all the business traffic. They are given a garden treatment by a central planted space wherein if necessary tram lines may be run with the minimum of dust and obstruction and where trees and shrub growth may be carried right through business districts without affecting the freedom andopenness that are essential to trade. The avenues are accorded dignity by their important objectives and by their uniform concave gradients disposed to emphasize these few resources of the architecture of a modest village. Intersections are at right or obtuse angles, everywhere of course, for economy and simplicity of the abutting buildings. Alley ways for heavy traffic supplement the avenues in the busy regions only. The entrance to this village at each point of contact with the country roads is marked by an entrance Page 392 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoplace to be decoratively planted and duly to impress upon every visitor at the outset the fact that he has come in contact with an unique enterprise. DISTRIBUTION WAYS. No effort has been made to secure directness of access through any great length of minor streets for their function is only contributory to the main avenues and they are designed to conserve seclusion, quiet, safety and freedom from encroachment to individual areas. These roads are reduced to a minimum of width compatible with [Note: ==== Beginning of page [331-2] ====] the occasional traffic that they must accommodate, especially the distribution of supplies to and collection of waste from the domestic work of the town, and are continuously through connected (without dead ends or \"cul de sacs\") for facilitating such operations. The distributing roadways of 18 and 24 feet width according to importance are to be treated so far as possible as park drives with graceful curves and unobtrusive curbing and guttering with border planted parkings separating and protecting narrow well paved footpaths. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 332 ====] INITIAL . PLAN OF LEETON [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.] THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT CONGRESSIONAL VERSUS PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT The United States has the soundest basis for democracy that the world has known and we owe it to thegreat geniuses who conceived it to pass the word along. A democracy defined:- It is a community whose political function is to maintain EQUITY (which is not identical with equality), whose standard of equity is determined by the majority of its citizens and whichis equipped with power to safeguard minorities in the exercise of their rights of life, of liberty of thought and the development of their abilities, and of access to nature. A quarter of a century of adult life under the Congressional rule and another quarter of a century under Parliamentary government have revealed to me personally what was called to my attention by an article in one of the American monthlies shortly before Griffin was called to Australia in 1914 as FederalCapital Director of Design and Construction of Canberra. That article spoke of Parliamentary government as the most successful smoke screen ever devised for concealing the fact that the complete control of affairs was in the hands of the Powers that be as versus the People. This is implemented by a perfected Civil Service from which America was fortunately rescued by [Note: President] Andrew Page 393 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoJackson. It is better to have the Service in the bag of the politicians than to have the politicians in the bag of the bureaucracy. It is not only that the officials have the spending of the funds and so can delay indefinitely whatever they object to, as this article stated, but that in a system of more or less indefinite tenure a party in power can always be thrown out by the officials by a manipulation of the votes of the Members. The ways and means are subtle and so the people mystified (really by threatening loss of jobs of Members' relatives placed on temporary rolls). I have found in my speaking of this matter only one person who was fully conscious of the futility of voting. It was an Australian to whom I was speaking. She said, \"Oh, I know.I can't [Note: ==== Beginning of page 333 ====] afford to pay \u00a35 (the fine for not voting in Australia) every time so I go into the booth and just write on the voting paper \u2014 \"Have it your own way, dearie.\" [Note: Eamon] De Valera knew this when treating with England after the last war but Congressional government had to be cancelled out of his plans when terms were arranged for a new deal for Ireland.The unique conditions there have altered the usual methods but the conditions are not wholesome, not democratic. In Parliamentary government the Executive is not determined by the people \u2014 only the Members. The leader of the Party may or may not become the Prime Minister. For instance at the beginning of the First world war \u2014 who made [Note: David] Lloyd George Prime Minister instead of [Note: Herbert] Asquith or, in Australia, William Hughes instead of Mr. [Note: Andrew] Fisher? Not the people. Nor do the people decide when an Executive's term shall end or a party be thrown out of power though they are supposed to be elected for a particular length of time. It is determined by a manipulation of the votes in Parliament behind the scenes by the powers of the officialdom. The same with the extension of term of office. The officials have all the favors to grant. They can appoint temporary officers and throw themout when they choose, brothers or cousins, etc., of Members. Of course sometimes Members change their opinions and vote against their party but it is not usually so, the case is utterly different from the American where voting against one's party does not throw the party out of power. One does not wish to put oneself out of a job. It is usually pressure; seldom that a Member would vote his party out of control and consequently have to go to the bother, time, expense and risk of a new election. In our experience there was a private citizen who was determined to have the Federal Capital carried through successfully. He was one of those who got it written into the constitution that the site for the Capital must be determined within ten years. Of course, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 334 ====] in any country there may be a great man who will arise to force through some great undertaking but this often means great struggles and even wars. Why make it unnecessarily difficult? None of the influential Page 394 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoones wanted the Capital to become a fact, not the Empire, not the States, not the officials nor the business men. But Mr. James Alexander Smith pressed on. He persuaded the Minister of Home Affairs, an Irishman, Mr. [Note: King] O'Malley, to put out conditions for an international competitionwhich Griffin won. For this, the Labor Party was thrown out of office. This was about the time of the outbreak of the First World War. The Liberal Party was now in power. There was an Associate Prime Minister. He was also an Irishman, Mr. [Note: W.H.] Kelley. Mr. J. A. Smith persuaded him to invite Griffin to Australia. He did so and he was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction. So then the Liberal Party was thrown out of power. Since thereare but two parties in Australia, it is not so easy for the Bureaucracy as when there are several parties and specially in Australia where the Labor Party has established the method of voting their Ministers into office. Each member having ambitions would vote for himself first then second for the one he considered the least likely to win. The unanimity of opinion on this brought the \"Wombat\" [Note: William Oliver Archibald] into the post of Ministers of Home Affairs. He was very subservient to theofficialdom so it was a hard year for Griffin. But the Party felt he was not a credit to them so they held another election among the Members and O'Malley again came into the Home Affairs. Now the war was on between Smith, O'Malley and Griffin on the one side and the whole Bureaucracy on the other. Every possible obstruction, every delay, for another year till finally an amazing thing happened. Great individuals are not determined by race. Indeed it is now true that nothing can be foundthat distinguishes one race from another. A great man may arise anywhere. This was one of the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 335 ====] great Englishmen, Mr. [Note: William] Webster, a member of the Cabinet, who with the consent of Mr. O'Malley called for a Royal Commission which after nine months of testimony condemned on all accounts the head officials of the Home Affairs Department. Such a thing had happened only once before in British history which goes to show that although nothing is impossible, it is certainly wise tochoose a form of government which does not make things that are important to the people almost impossible. The fact that the Prime Minister and the whole Cabinet are selected from the Legislative body means that there is almost never anyone of executive capacity or experience, which again makes them dependent and subservient to the officials of their various departments. They have no knowledge nor experience to enable them to hold out against official advice. The Legislative temperament considers and reconsiders. The Executive temperament decides and acts on his decisions. The head Executive must have the power to choose his assistants and to dismiss them , otherwise he cannot be held responsible. This applies to his Cabinet and to the officials. The remedy forcomplications should be met by limiting the functions of the Political Organ, ultimately, to maintainingEquity. There is much talk about \"the democracies\" but in fact there is, at least among the considerable groups of humanity, but one democracy an organization that has the maintenance of Equity written into its constitution and whose people choose their Executive. That is the United States whose citizens in Page 395 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoconsequence, though but one sixth of humanity, consume fifty percent of the products of the world. In the other so-called democracies the people have no power at all. They get very discouraged but don't know why. If in the conferences to come America realizes the basic reason for her uniqueness among the people of the world and insists on even [Note: ==== Beginning of page 336 ====] one thing \u2014 that Germany (and if possible the liberated countries, certainly Italy) shall be reconstructed on the basis of a Congressional form of government with the maintenance of Equity as its function, the example of a peaceful and successful Germany might wake up the other countries to alter their powercontrolled communities on the same lines. Then with a World Economic Organization established there would be no wars for Economics is based on Mutual Advantage. There are but two natural political divisions \u2014 the continent and the municipality, the latter being really abusiness organization. The American Senate is a hang-over. The power of the States as states is but serving to move the United States backward from being the greatest free trade region in the world toquarreling protective tariff districts. A second house but causes confusion and delay and uncertainty. It is a hang-over from the infancy of democracy when full confidence was lacking. America should use her influence, not power, to bring about the Congressional form of government in China and in every other part of the world. It is the soundest basis for democracy that the world has known and we owe it to the great geniuses who conceived it for us, to pass the word along.

HOW WE SAW THE HEAD OF THE RIVER RACE by Lillian Hamilton Moore, Lyndhurst Crescent, Auburn Page 396 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe boat race on the Yarra, Melbourne The day is over and all the sections of the community that I come across are pleased. I wore different colors for myself but except for a momentary disappointment felt pleased. The best crew won and goodsports got the cup. We went early to pick our places. At 12:30 we owned the river. The East side of the Judge's box we argued was the best. By standing on the edge of the embankment we could get a good view of the approaching boats and decide the finish with the judge, as it were. Having settled this we had our lunch. There were thirteen of us \u2014 no doubt that was the mistake. The day was glorious, warm sunshine and no wind. The lunch was a great success; a man snapped us \"The First Comers.\" A littleafter one o'clock two or three people came along so we got into position. We spread out the rug corner-wise and sat in a row, feet dangling; another two had a cushion and one of the party sat on a little camp stool. Father and the little boys went off to get a boat we had engaged. Everything possible was done to make the day a success. We, the women folk, preferred to sit where we were; it would be more \"fun\" and our country cousins and the friends from America would enjoy the boys' corner. Right up to 2:30 we congratulated ourselves upon our maneuvers, but presently the \"camper\" had to decamp to the lower level, she not being strong and the crowd beginning to press. She took up her seat and stood below. Another two minutes and we others decided to stand for fear our backs might get broken and we got up one at a time to [Note: ==== Beginning of page 339 ====] maintain our positions, because by this time there was a great press and we guessed there was a crowd behind. We got up and saw and then we knew we were in for it. Our folks came over from Scotland in the early days and stuck, and we had it in us. The country cousin was pushed down the embankment twice. She rolled right over but came up again smiling and brave. But it was all right till I was suddenly pulled back and a burley form twisted me about and got in front. It was a policeman, and all at once there were six of them. The first one who was now in front of me doubled his body and butted into me.I felt myself falling and clutched something. It was another policeman who threw off my hands and shouted, \"Don't you hold on to me, move back. Don't push \u2014 her Excellency is here.\" It was all over in a moment \u2014 I mean the parting up with our stand. Our party was pushed back into the swaying, seething mass. To and fro, backwards and forwards, up and down we swayed and ran. Policemen backed and shouted and boys pushed forward. Never did I know anything like it. Once I saw myhusband and the little boys looking anxiously our way and I wished I had not been chosen to be right in the \"fun.\" My hat was ruined, my coat torn, colors gone, best boots beyond description. Then their Excellencies were got into a boat (not having six policemen to guide us we could not get into ours) and things eased a moment. My fight was over though and I fell back and the boats came in and I didn't see. Arrived at 12:30 and didn't see. Now being a sport though 40 (odd) I didn't mind. \"All in the day,\" but I would like to suggest that some other arrangements be made for the policemen next time. No one would mind Their Excellencies' having the best place, and we would not ask them to picnic at 12:30 to get it, but couldn't an enclosure be made in readiness? A railing say 4 feet square would perhaps suffice. Everyone would respect this and be pleased to welcome the occupants at the last minute. I try to Page 397 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 340 (table of contents) ====] GRIFFIN HOME & TWO BIRD COLONIES - ONE FOR SMALL & ONE FOR LARGE BIRDS [Note: The structure is Pholiota in Heidelberg (Melbourne), Victoria.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 341 ====] be fair but was the policeman merely doing his duty when he so rudely displaced me? Still though we deplore our judgment, or our lunch, we voted it a splendid day and all went off to prepare for the theatre where seats were booked and no policeman to butt. \u2014 The early bird that didn't catch the worm. *************************THE YARRA Anyway Walt decided it was time he investigated the Yarra. At about 12 o'clock we started off for our jaunt. We took a train to a slight distance out of Melbourne, got a boat, and of course there was no stopping Walter till we had rowed 26 miles, 13 up against the swift current of the Yarra River and 13 back getting back after 10 and finding the boat-house people quite perturbed for fear something hadhappened to us. They do not know Walter but they did know he was the Federal Capital Director and apparently could not be classed among our \"favorites\" who would have been glad to have his career brought to an end by any means the Lord might provide. Of course he decided on all the locations for dams to hold the waters of a series of lakes to take the place of the swamp reaches the rains bring to large districts making them completely useless. It would make awonderful park system for Melbourne and outlying municipalities. One such lake would be at the foot of Mt. Eagle Estate the laying out of which was one of his early jobs over here and where his sister's home and our Doll House were built. This Mount Eagle district had been a sort of Mecca for the artists of Australia who for years had holidayed and sketched here-abouts. This whole river bottom, impossible for occupation should bemade into a park system \u2014 a lovely outing place for all of the lesser and greater municipalities. MOUNT EAGLE ESTATE In Heidelberg, Victoria, we had the universal experience for [Note: ==== Beginning of page 342 ====] everywhere in Australia too was the gridiron plan being imposed no matter what the nature of the landscape. Griffin had been prepared for what Town Planning was up against by his experience with theFairy Harbor Estate on the coast of Manly \u2014 steep bluffs, craggy rocks, for which impossible roads, Page 398 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagogradients no auto could master, had been determined upon by the conventional subdivider. The client brought his problem to Griffin who suggested the sort of thing he later accomplished in Castlecrag. But before a municipal council would pass a subdivision it had to be okayed by a licensed surveyor and nosurveyor would stamp with his approval what, though it conformed to the laws of nature and the needs of men, defied the established custom of the empire. There is a sort of lese majesty in doing something so different. So that lovely bit was destroyed. Prepared by this experience Griffin used new tactics. He laid out the streets on easy gradients with provision for interior and River Bank parks calculating all the streets and allotments and paid thesurveyors as if they had done the work. PHOLIOTA The mushroom sprang up in the night.When Griffin, always an adventurer, finally succumbed to the homing instinct which he had tried for so many years to break down in his wife, we started to build the doll house on the second lot within thesame enclosure as his sister's home on the Mount Eagle estate which he had laid out several years before in Heidelberg, a municipality some 14 miles from Melbourne. He took for granted that no municipal council in the British Empire (patterned on the Roman Empire down to the details of specifications of buildings) would pass the design he was contemplating. So as doll house it was passed by the Council and him and me and a chicken farmer built it \u2014 the cheapest, the most perfect and charming home in theempire. In those first years in Melbourne where they had no good building stone, sending [Note: ==== Beginning of page 343 ====] to Sydney for the stone for important buildings; and where the bricks as everywhere in Australia were ugly in size, shape, texture and color, he invented a new type of construction, an interlocking, concrete tile, the last word in economy for permanent fireproof residential construction. The structural columns consist of two or four interlocking quadrants spaced on units based on the width required for openings,giving a charming fluted exterior wall and round corners in the interior. The walls between are two and a quarter inches thick with hollow space in which a coating of bitumen or Aquella can be placed. The tiles are one foot square and are staggered horizontally and vertically so there are no through joints. The hollow space between is enough for warmth and sound proofing. The economy in the thickness of the walls gives the space of an extra bed room in an ordinary two bed room house so that in a housecovering the same area one gets three bed rooms instead of two. The surfacing of the tiles can be of different colored sands used while manufacturing them so that the house looks like cut stone and in the sunshine like marble; and in the interior there is no need for plaster nor for decoration though many rich and varied color effects can be obtained by staining the tiles to pattern or otherwise. Thus the knitlock construction undercuts the cost of the cheapest brick buildings,and makes windows as cheap as walls since the tile as laid up form finished sills, heads and jambs so far as the masonry is concerned. Griffin had not yet worked out the knitlock roof tiles when Pholiota was built. So here in the suburb of Heidelberg on the bank of the Yarra River we built this first home of our own, Page 399 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowe two doing most of the erection of the walls which was like building with children's building blocks for no mortar is required, the farmer coming along when the chickens would let him. We ourselves were lucky if we got an occasional week end free, but in a very short time we had the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 344 (table of contents) ====] WALTER BURLEY GRIFFIN . ROMANTIC [Note: ==== Beginning of page 345 ====] cheapest and the most perfect fireproof home in any city anywhere. Like any home it was designed to meet our personal requirements. The floor was brick laid solid on the ground, so cool in summer andwarm in winter. Father and Mother Griffin were visiting the Lippincotts when the time came for the windows. For the time of their visit we were all living together with sister Genevieve's family. One day I saw father prowling around and talking something over with the carpenter farmer and, listening in, I found they had decided that the windows wouldn't work. Of course it was another invention of W.B.G.'s, a pivotedwindow which wouldn't slam in the wind, with the simplest device in the world for opening and shutting without opening the screen. Of course our very elegant father didn't at all like to see his distinguished son doing day labor and on a house which was to become a one room home, and he was equally disgruntled by having a tom-boy daughter-in-law who delighted in taking part in such rough work. Then son-in-law Roy came home \u2014 he also an architect \u2014 and there was another consultation re the windows which the farmer had discontinued installing, and I heard them say \u2014 \"Of course it won't work.\" The pivot was some four inches from the window jamb so you see of course it wouldn't work. I secretly reported this conference to my senor [Note: Walter Burley Griffin] who disgustedly said, \"Of course it will work,\" and out he went and put in a window. Of course it worked. Nobody said anythingto anybody, but I kept an eye on the house and presently saw father go out and look and try. It opened!! And later on I saw Roy go out. Same answer. Nobody said anything to anybody. Soon it was finished. The house had been put to the Council as a doll house (for the little ones for it was in the same yard, a fenced enclosure, as theirs) and so it was for it was never locked and Aunt and Uncle were usually gone early in the morning, and homing [Note: ==== Beginning of page 346 ====] hours were often late, and the children could take possession during the day so long as they promised not to eat the sugar. But our home it was and no one ever had a more perfect house. In the two years we were there before we had to go up to Sydney. I am sure we entertained more people than anyone in Australia except perhaps the Governor General. Everyone wanted to see it and everyone had to show it Page 400 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoto their friends. So they found entertainment there whether we were at home or not. On our return we might find embers still hot in the fireplace, or a bead from a dress on the floor, or a jar of jam on the table. We always taught the young people in the office that they must never be satisfied with anything short of perfection, the correct answer. They all came to Pholiota for a Christmas party, the young folks supplying the eatables. Everyone brought sweets! Such a party! One of our head draftsmen told me he had never been able to comprehend what I meant by saying even the least thing must be perfect, but now he understood. Here this, one might say, costless house and furniture was perfect. The mostconservative man I ever know, whose wife and children wanted us to build a house for them, was finally persuaded by his son to come out and see us. He wandered about the little home, twenty-one feet square all told, smiling and laughing, and finally said \u2014 \"It's too pretty to use.\" Practically it was perfect too a place for everything and everything just naturally dropping into its place. In Pholiota the interior tiles were subdivided by a groove into six inch squares which were colored alternately gold and henna. The room was a cross within a square which when the burlap curtains were extended (from the corners where they usually hung screening the specialized corners) to screen the two divan alcoves or sleeping quarters, became an interior fourteen foot square plus a five by seven piano alcove on one sided and a fire place alcove on the other [Note: ==== Beginning of page 347 ====] side, a circular table in the center which could always accommodate anyone else who came in during a meal by the simple device of each one's pushing back his chair and so increasing the circumference. Over it hung, from the peak of the sloped ceiling, a beautiful fretwork plaster lantern designed for and stolen from the Palais de Dance. By thus drawing the curtains the two alcoves became two private bed rooms. The four corners usually partly screened from the center, each seven by seven, were the entrance and library; the dressing room with its two dressing tables with a window beside each and hangingspace; the bathroom arrangements; and the kitchen from which the hostess, if by chance domestic duties compelled her, could always enter into conversation and arguments taking place in other parts of the room. This was the sine-qua-non for a home for Mrs. W.B.G. Well presently some man was called to book by the municipal council for not having complied with the municipal requirements. Such perpetual petty dictatorship in all details of life! No wonder the spirit ofthe European peoples is so completely broken. And venom being a natural result of frustration this gent reported to the council that the Griffins were living in the doll house. This came near resulting in an international scandal. We were promptly ordered to bring our house into conformity. Now as it happened our house met all their requirements but not in their way. It was larger but it did not have three separate rooms, its average height was greater but its minimum height was less than 9 feet, it hadenormously more ventilation but it didn't have dinky little ventilators in the wall above the window height. There was no wall above the windows. The kitchen was compact and completely equipped but that kitchen corner wasn't the required area. There was no possible way of making the house conform except by tearing it down and building it over again, making it ugly in proportions, impossible for entertainment, wasteful of space, etc., etc. Page 401 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoAfter considerable correspondence and much professional expounding [Note: ==== Beginning of page 348 (table of contents) ====] MARION M. GRIFFIN . ROMANTIC [Note: ==== Beginning of page 349 ====] on the part of the Director of Design and Construction of the Federal Capital, we received a notification that if the house were not made to conform in two weeks they would proceed to pull it down. Whereupon Mrs. G. said to Mr. G. \u2014 \"Well let them pull it down and we'll live in a canvas bag (as we had done in our canoe trips and which in fact would not have been against the law) and cook our mealsover a bonfire. We own this lot. We'll see what they do about that.\" And there it stood. We concerned ourselves no more about it though we know that a townsman had recently been evicted from his home. He was a builder who had taken on a contract for a house and forgotten to include the cost of the roof. The client refused to pay for the roof so he was left without enough money to carry on the construction of his own house. The whole of his house was framed and roofed and most of the exterior wallscompleted but only the kitchen, dining room and bath completely finished, the rest like an open veranda which in that climate is perfectly comfortable to sleep on, which a large part of the people do the year around. But it didn't conform to the requirements so he and his wife were thrown out onto the street. Such is government in the economic realm. When will we wake up to the fact that a human community needs three complete organizations to fulfill the three necessities of human beings in a community. One day our neighbor brought a guest of theirs in to see us. We had a pleasant hour together. That's the trouble, these imperialists are so pleasant one can't believe their system is the last word of ingenuity of Satan himself. However nothing fatal happened. We found out later that this gentleman was the State Architect who had been called upon by the Council and who had advised the Council, under the circumstances, to call it an experimental house and drop the matter, which they did. This is usually thought of as a warm climate but real [Note: ==== Beginning of page 350 ====] discomfort comes not only from the cold during the four months of winter when the whole community, rich and poor, suffer intense discomfort in the houses, but frequently during other seasons. With one voice all who come from other climates say they have never suffered with the cold in their lives as they do in Australia. The solution to this, removing all the discomfort of the climate is the simple device usedby the aboriginals \u2014 to take advantage of the much lesser range of temperature of the ground, at least 20 degrees less than that of the air. This is practically all that is needed in this wonderful climate to make living comfortable summer or winter. With doors and windows closed on nippy days and a solid floor the warmth of the earth comes up and fills the whole house and on coldest days a bit of a fire in the Page 402 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofireplace with the warm floor and the whole house is all right. Such a little thing and a whole civilization can be transformed, but do you suppose a Municipal Council would permit it? By no means. Our brick floor met the issue in Pholiota. Of course we had rugs as well, the aesthetic helping out the practical. Interiors are things unknown to practicing architects because their training in the universities is from pictures and you really can't photograph interiors. Anyway their training consists only in the study of individual expensive buildings. In other fields how could the poor dears make a living. So we moderns live in packing boxes and the genius of our children dies from starvation in their early years. The story of a friend's child is typical. She was sent to a music teacher to learn music. She wept all the time shewas there. When afterward her mother asked her why she didn't sing she said she couldn't, it was so ugly \u2014 the room. Contrary to the general idea of our intelligentsia, the residences are the most important buildings. The very mass of them makes them the dominating factor in every community. This one room house was one of the most perfect houses ever built although it was the least [Note: ==== Beginning of page 351 ====] costly. It nestled far back on its allotment under the spreading branches of two giant gums and was so lovely in the midst of its everblooming garden that Mr. G. and I used to walk backward every morning as we went off to the office so as to delight our hungry eyes as long as possible. A German friend was visiting us, Mr. Hugo Meyer [Note: Hugo Richard Meyer?], formerly a Harvard professor, then writing a history of the Railways of Australia which he said he found to be the historyof Australia and its lack of development. As we sat before the fireplace he said Pholiota reminded him of a castle in Germany. The bringing of the exterior permanent material completely into the interior would do this. And yet with this material and its formal units we were continually getting the most exquisite pictures with the changing lights of the day and the changing floral displays of the seasons framed by our windows. The brass candlesticks which looked silly on the piano were yanked off andlooked handsome on the fire-breast giving it an altar like effect when the morning sun struck across the room giving brilliance and sharp shadows to the great clusters of flowers which stood in a corner of the fireplace alcove. There were so many ancient gum trees on this hill sloped river bank, some in groups, some isolated, that for over half a century the artists of Melbourne had gathered there for their camping outings to enjoyand paint their loveliness. Many were five feet and more in diameter, most of them white barked, not the tall towering species but broad spreading and very picturesque. The owners finally decided to subdivide. They put the work in Griffin's hands. In laying out this Mount Eagle Estate which consists of a beautiful hillside and the flats below extending to the Yarra River, he took great pains to arrange for permanent preservation of these trees arranging the streets and allotments so that almost all of them were in interiorreserves. Such reserves cost practically nothing as they take up no street selling frontage which also meant that they never could Page 403 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 352 ====] be sold. The ownership had to be placed with the municipality otherwise they could be taxed indefinitely and as heavily as the officials wished without the owner's having any possibility of selling. Two of these superb kings of that kingdom which alone can transform rocks into living matter and upon which all other living things are therefore dependent for their sustenance, he had not been able to secure in this way. These worshippers of the Christ, the Sun Being, (for they like men can stand erect and reach up to the Sun) stood in two adjacent allotments. So we bought these two at the original sale. Such a joy they were. And fun too for the small birds had taken possession of one of them. The large birdssettled in the other. And if any large bird ever presumed to alight on the small birds' tree there was a prompt gathering of the clans and, with much clatter and indignation, off he was driven. Our one room house looked like a toy indeed at the foot of our great trees. After our work had taken us to Sydney and some years had passed we saw a paragraph in one of the publications saying that Griffin would be interested to know that the ancient Eucalypts [Note: Eucalyptus] he had taken such pains to preserve had been sold by the Council to a man for a pound apiece to be cut down for firewood. Such is Government ownership. This however forewarned us to make different provision for the interior parks in Castlecrag, Sydney. Community functions which became so broad in their nature in Castlecrag were already begun in Pholiota. Every Sunday became meeting day for a group who individually had concluded decisionsmust be made as to a proper basis for human communities. That meant we were radicals all, weren't satisfied unless we got to the roots. So wild times were had but in the end even the extreme anarchists agreed that a community must take upon itself the task of maintaining Equity and only that. Only in Castlecrag in the later years did we learn that communities require two other organizations, each limited in its functions, one for Mutuality and one for Liberty which, naturally [Note: ==== Beginning of page 353 ====] would require totally different types of organization, as different in their nature as the human body's head, heart and stomach organizations. SUMMARY OF GRIFFIN REVOLUTIONS DURING THE FIRST THREE YEARS. The Federal Capital with empirial consequences The introduction of plumbing with the Newman College Fly proofing restaurants with the Cafe Australia, still one of the world's most beautiful cafes for fly-ridden restaurants found their clients could not resist the sumptuous beauty and cleanliness of Mr. Lucas's real gold tiled, fretted domed, richly sculptured spacious rooms. It made Mr. Lucas an important man in the community. Later he was one of the owners of \u2014 The Capitol Theatre (10 stories high) was the first sky scraper in Australia. Page 404 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe still unrivaled (in the world) theatre caused a similar revolution in this field. The Paramount Picture man said, at its opening, that if it were in New York one wouldn't have to put on pictures, the theatre itself would bring the people. With Mr. [Note: William] Webster [Note: Postmaster-General] as client the Post Offices of Melbourne and Sydney were modernized. Others would naturally follow suit.Both steel and concrete construction were initiated. And in surveying the conservation of nature with streets suitable was introduced.

Fitzgerald \u2014 President of Legislative Council & Executive Council of New South Wales BUILDING THE FEDERAL CAPITAL \u2014 POLICY OF BUNGLING AND STUPIDITY GRIFFIN SHOULD BE SOLE COMMISSIONER. Some three years ago an article of mine appeared in the Sunday Times dealing with the condition of affairs at Canberra. I pointed out that a Departmental Board of disappointed competitors had obtained control of the carrying out of Burley Griffin's splendid plan and while pretending to preserve the \"dominating conception\" of that plan, were really imposing their own crude plan upon his. I took the stand that as Griffin's plan had won the first prize in a worldwide competition in which all the great Page 405 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoexpert town-planners had taken part, if any modification of that plan were necessary it should be carried out not by strangers but by the man whose brain had conceived the original design. At that time there were rapid changes in the personnel of the Ministers who had to deal with Canberra. Of these Mr. W.H. Kelly, in a brief interval of office, appeared to be the only one who rose to the true appreciation of the importance of the plan. His successor \u2014 Mr. [Note: William Oliver] Archibald, a weak man, fell into the hands of this Departmental Board and the whole of the blunders which have followed, and which have been exposed in the masterly report of Mr. Wilfred Blacket, K.C. are the inevitable consequences. AN AMAZING DECISION What struck me as a citizen of the Commonwealth at the time was that public buildings were being erected encroaching on the alignment of main avenues as laid down in the plan of Mr. Griffin. When Mr. Austin Chapman, who deserves great credit in this matter, demanded an explanation of this, he was answered in words which created amazement at the time (but which we were to appreciate better sinceMr. Blacket's report) that \"these buildings could easily be pulled down when the final allotment of the streets became necessary.\" [Note: ==== Beginning of page 357 (table of contents) ====] THE COTTER DAM & WEIR [Note: ==== Beginning of page 358 ====] COTTER RIVER AND DAM The Cotter River and Dam \u2014 source of the city's water supply, and a most delightful picnic spot, must be included in your tours when you visit Canberra. Here there is all the enchantment of the bushland, besides the unforgettable spectacle of the waters falling 60 feet over the wallface of the Cotter Weir \u2014 flashing, scintillating, crashing \u2014 into a rocky cauldron below, like a miniature Niagara Falls. Here alsoare crystal-clear trout streams, picturesque walks and shady swimming pools. Rustic shelter is provided for picnic parties, and there are fireplaces and luncheon huts. The Cotter River and Weir is 15 miles from the city, and is approached by excellent roads through magnificent scenery. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 359 ====] The fatuousness of this was manifested to all those who had visited Washington (U.S.A.) and become conversant with the series of muddles which were associated with the great United States politicalcenter. It is strange how history repeats itself. One of the features of the history of the magnificent Washington plan is the conflict with stupidity which nearly drove the great French engineer, [Note: Pierre Charles] L'Enfant, who planned Washington in conjunction with George Washington (himself a Page 406 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosurveyor) out of his mind and embittered his whole life. One of his successors, [Note: Alexander \"Boss\"?] Shepherd, was also treated in the same way and he too succumbed in the battle with stupidity. To make a long story short, when the people of the United States came to their senses it cost a latergeneration $15,000,000 to restore the plan of L'Enfant. That was the price that was paid by the people of the United States for the bungling which proceeded in regard to their Capital for nearly a century. Such bungling has happily, I hope, been stopped in the bud by the inquiry now concluded and the report of Mr. Blacket. AUSTRALIA'S CHANCEWe understand better now the noble ideals of the town-planner. He is a great artist, a super-architect, super-engineer, super-surveyor. From his brain springs the noble design of a city, not the mere tracings on the ground of what direction the future streets and avenues, parks, playgrounds and trackways shall take; but also it [Note: is?] his to determine what will be the design of its architecture, the convenience of its commercial side, the completeness of its communication, the comfort of its habitable areas and thegeneral relation of all these parts to the whole and to each other. I have seen many planned cities, such as Paris, the new Rome, Dalny [Note: now Dalian in Liaoning Province, China] at Port Arthur, but of these only Dalny [Note: Dalian] was a pre-planned city. The others were carved out of old congested streets and houses. The noble idea of designing a city in advance, such as inspired Kitchner [Note: Horatio Herbert Kitchener?] in the new Omdurman, or thosewho dreamt of a new Indian Capital, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 360 (table of contents) ====] THE COTTER RIVER [Note: ==== Beginning of page 361 ====] can be imitated by us in Australia; and it would be a perversion of the intentions of the big minds of the first crop of Commonwealth statesmen, and an insult to their grandiose ideas, to allow any paltering with the plan of the beautiful design of Burley Griffin. I now suggest that we look to the future. Let us close the book of incompetence and impudent presumptuousness and look to the future, keeping steadily in mind the noble opportunity of creating a magnificent city from this point of view. I want to deal with certain suggestions made as to the futurecontrol of the plan. THE MAN FOR THE TASK A suggestion is made by Mr. [Note: John] Sulman, President of the New South Wales Town Planning Association, that the future control should be by a Commission. In my opinion, and with all respect to Mr. Sulman, the public reposes the utmost confidence in the man at present, though only imperfectly, incharge \u2014 Mr. Walter Burley Griffin. Those who know any of the work that has been done, and have Page 407 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofollowed the whole history of this great enterprise with interest, know that no more competent man could be found to place in control of this work than Mr. Griffin. He should be the sole Commissioner. We now realize, on the personal report of Mr. Blacket, the mighty wall of incompetence and stupidity against which Mr. Griffin has had to struggle. It is to be hoped that the struggle is over now. Mr. Griffin has gained his experience inch by inch; he has confounded his detractors he has vindicated his own capacity, and by that means he has proved himself to be the one and only fit man to be entrusted with the task of carrying out his own design. All that remains to be said is to express the hope that the experience of the incompetency of the last few years will inspire the statesmen in charge of the affairs ofthe Commonwealth to make up their minds to take the advice of the one man in Australia who is competent to advise them upon the design of a great city built upon a virgin site. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 361b ====] ARCHITECTURE ; Walter Burley Griffin We take up now a problem that frequently comes before our big municipal centers. This is not an actual project but an abstract problem taken up for discussion in the City Club of Chicago. A number ofsolutions were considered and are being considered in various districts for actual execution. Chicago's plan like that of so many of our modern cities consists of a quadrilateral plan superimposed on a radial one. It is laid out in quarter mile sections and one such Section was the problem for solution. The method of general layout means that everywhere in Chicago these streets at half mile intervals become the lines of through traffic with trams, and the consequent development into business streets. It alsomeans that there is no occasion for through traffic between them and that no business will develop within them because of the advantage of the boundary streets in being most convenient of access to the stream of people coming home from the city center. Therefore such a Section encircled by neighborhood stores, shops, offices, public service equipment such as fire engine houses, etc., offers opportunity for a complete and secluded domestic unit. The first step therefore is to destroy the temptation of using it as athoroughfare for which there is no need by blocking the center so that it no longer offers a short cut. At last we have the chance to give a fair chance to the domestic life which has suffered so terribly in the rapid development of out great cities. How necessary this is we can get a notion of if we compare the organism humanity to the organism tree. If a tree fails in the perfect development of the blossom \u2014 the reproductive organ \u2014 the tree will soon disappear, or at least degenerate. So with our humancommunities. The industrial and transportation elements form the root and trunk branching out from the centers, but the domestic element is the blossom complete in itself perfect in form, and every community should bear abundantly these beautiful blossoms. This example promises a Town Planning requirement which in this zone shall limit the occupation to [Note: ==== Beginning of page 361c ====] 8 families to the acre. The blocks have their interior open spaces where little children can play with their companions and still be under the Mother's eye and within easy call, where the older children can have their sports without going a half mile or more frequently away from home, where older people can enjoy Page 408 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoout door entertainments without such effort and waste of time as is usually necessary and where all have at all times the joy of looking out on open spaces and beautiful shrubbery. No one has more than 3 blocks to go to reach the community buildings grouped about the center, schools, clubs, theatres, music pavilion, gymnasia, etc. Even little children can go to the center without the danger of crossing a rapid transit rout. In addition there is one of the most peculiar and valuable elements in the uplift of human beings, a neighborhood unit with its own prides, its own standards to maintain, and to compare with other units, and that greatest of all beneficial restraints the knowledge that the eye of your own people is on you to feel pride or shame in your individual standards. In the playgrounds about the schools games can be carried on under direction and pools are provided for aquatic sports. Such an arrangement as this lends itself to an industrial community with factory located in one quarter next to transportation facilities. LEETON Next we will take up the general problem of laying out an entire new community. Here the industrial elements must also be taken into consideration. Leeton from the nature of its location and railroad facilities will undoubtedly remain village like in character. Surrounded by irregular farms it is itself located on a slight rise in the ground which makes it useless for irrigation but very desirable for residence, with the slopes catching the breezes and good for drainage, with such industries as creameries, fruit packing houses, etc. on its railroad, and the axis for retail business serving the outlyingfarms as well as the town. Providing also common play space and Show Grounds and [Note: ==== Beginning of page 361d ====] education facilities for the whole district. The ultimate population is placed at 7000 or about 2 families of 5 to the acre. GRIFFITH & MOSSMAIN Griffith to be the Capital of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation District and Mossmain, Montana, a railroad center of an orchard region, offer as does the Federal Capital of Australia examples of complete civic units. In laying out a city all the elements such as we have been discussing will of course be considered but they must be taken up now not as adjustments to other civic elements already established but with the opportunity of the best possible location of each element for itself and its relation to the other elements. First of course must be considered climate conditions, desirable orientation for utmost advantage of sunlight and shade; character and direction of prevailing winds for refreshment and protection; topography of surface and nature of water supply; natural beauties to be preserved and taken utmost advantage of. Next the nature of the problem itself \u2014 a human community. This when reduced to its simplest elements we find has just two elements \u2014 habitation and communication, and the reason why most of our Page 409 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocommunities are so unsatisfactory in their general arrangement is because one or the other of these has been given consideration to the detriment of the other. Those centers which have gradually developed through the concentration of interests of the outlying regions show a markedly radial basis through the transformation of country roads into city streets. Here the element of convenient transportation has predominated. Where an owner of property has rapidly built up a community by subdivision of land and disposal of it we find the rectangular or gridiron plan. Here occupation has been given consideration and no weight to convenience of intercommunication. As such communities develop we find the one method superimposed upon the other with awkward acute angles resulting and often entailing [Note: ==== Beginning of page 361e ====] great expense. Often in the layout of new cities we find that there has been no attempt to reconcile these two elements but that the results we have grown familiar with in old cities are copied in plans for new. This is a waste of an opportunity, as a radial system is the best solution of direct access from outlying regions to a center of common interest, and the right angle forms the best shape for building purposesthe solution is to use the radial system and bring in the cross streets at right angles to them. This forms no acute angles and the obtuse angles formed at the junction of cross streets are perfectly satisfactory for building and offer advantages for community purposes. With this abstract solution of the municipal problem we have now to adapt it to the local conditions and the individual requirements of the city. A photograph of the model of the site gives an idea of the general topographical conditions though the fact that the vertical dimension is four times that of the horizontal makes it appear much more rugged than it is in reality, the slopes as a whole being very gentle. The flood basin of the Molonglo River which crosses the site suggests the advisability of using it to the utmost possible extent for water surface. The dry season sometimes very severe makes the storage of water imperative and the modifying influence of a considerable water surface much to be desired. There is much talk about proper provisionfor disposal of storm water but in Australia the first consideration should be its preservation. The problem is very simple when one looks at it directly with open eyes. Nature records her maximum floods and all one has to do is to provide channels for that maximum. If in the main channel we arrange to use the whole flood basin for no other purpose but the storage of water the flood water is taken care of. There is ample rainfall to maintain the level of these lakes as guaranteed by the original competitionand borne out by experience since even this year, the worst drought Australia has ever known, there has been excessive flow in the Molonglo. The upper of these lakes originally intended to permit variation of level with circumstances, can with reservoirs in the upper [Note: ==== Beginning of page 361f ====] reaches of the river be maintained constant. The probabilities moreover are that in the course of time Australia will build another such dam as is just completing at Burrinjuck which will hold back too waters to form a lake continuous with these of the Capital and extend some 50 miles length to the West Page 410 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowhich will place the Federal Capital on another such body of water as the Sydney Harbor and make it unsurpassed in natural beauties and advantages by any city in the world. Since the special requirement of this city is the housing of the Government one looks for the most desirable location of the group of Government buildings which shall best meet present requirements and offer ample facility for expansion in the future. The site conditions of this valley are a somewhat extensive level stretch on the north bank of the river enclosed by hills and mountains those in the distance to the South West rising to the summit Bimberri often snow covered. Touching the boundaries of the area determined for the city site are three minor mountains. The most conspicuous peak is theconical Ainslie to the North East. To the North West is Black Mountain, and to the South East is Mugga Mugga with the foothills clustered about it opposite from the mountains to the South West. The plain recommends itself for the business district of the city. There are two possibilities for the location of the Government group, the slopes of Black Mountain looking up the river, or the terraces on the Southern bank rising from the level to Kurrajong, to Red Hill, to Mugga Mugga, to Bimberri. A linedrawn from the peak of Ainslie to Red Hill passes through the peak of Kurrajong, is perpendicular to the river bed and is at an angle of some 15 degrees to the North and South line hence most desirable for orientation of the streets, giving throughout the day good shade on one or the other side and giving sun to all rooms of the buildings. This line was determined upon as the main axis of the city and all the public buildings throughout the city are set on this axis. The importance of such an orderly arrangementis always very great and can be especially appreciated in a city surrounded by heights so [Note: ==== Beginning of page 361g ====] that from a bird's eye view one is repeatedly presented with the a spectacle of the whole city. One of the chief pleasures we get in the contemplation of any work of man is the consciousness that results were intentional. We rejoice in evidence of intelligence. With the local conditions well in hand we turn to the opposite side of the equation, the requirements or this special city. We have to take care not only of the Federal Government group. There is the Municipal group. Also the National University and the Military establishment in addition to the usual municipal requirements of any city. The result of the solving of this equation we will express first diagrammatically. The schedule summarizes the elements. In Town Planning as in Architecture there must be a vision. There must be ascheme which the mind can grasp, and it must be expressed in the simplest terms possible. Just as music depends on simple mathematical relations so do Architecture and Town Planning. In other words it must be comprehensible and the reason for everything done must be clear. In this plan the land axis is made the garden frontage of the city. At its extremity opposite the peak of Ainslie is placed the Capital Building each offering and impressive terminal to the other. Transversely and parallel to the water axis isthe retail business district extending a mile on the level stretch between Mt. Vernon, a low hill on one side on which are placed the municipal buildings and an equal eminence to the East where the railroad station is located. Between this and the water are the Play Grounds of the city of easy access and offering to the population of the whole city the spectacle or the Government group. At the western extremity of the water axis at the foot of Black Mountain lies the University group and at the Eastern is Page 411 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe Military establishment. The Government buildings are arranged according to the functions they fulfill, the capitol at the top is the monumental feature serving for functions for the preservation of national records, the Westminsterof Australia. The Parliament House below with the various connected departments. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 361h ====] Translating diagram into plan, the Parliamentary group, the Municipal group, and the main Railway Station become the chief centers for radiating avenues all of them so located as to give fine vistas with marked terminal. These avenues are all 200' wide, a magnificent system and at the same time a necessity because of the high speed traffic unknown 50 years ago. This insures safety for with a double parkwaythe trams and high speedway in the center can be somewhat depressed so that crossings can be made with a slight ramp. This is the system followed in the Railroads. In colder climates the occasional filling of these trenches with snow is a difficulty but in Australia there is no difficulty, and the method has the added advantage of making the tracks very inconspicuous overcoming the ugliness of this feature which is such an eyesore in most of our communities. The Avenues develop into business lines as throughroutes always do and will serve the local needs of the districts they traverse. It also means that none of the other streets will undergo the transformation from residence to business so common and troublesome in many of our cities, for the other streets are all indirect and a business enterprise located on them would be too greatly handicapped in its competition with those of easier access. Therefore the intraradial spaces become strictly domestic, and can develop in quiet and security counting on the futureas securely as the present, the spaces formed by the obtuse angle in the center of these domestic spaces form a natural location for a system of small parks increasing in size with the increased distance from the centers and the consequent decrease in land values. This matter of land values which has been so disastrous to the orderly development of most cities will be entirely an advantage in Canberra for the Nation has taken the precaution to resume the land of notonly the city site but of the whole Federal District so that instead of going into the pockets or private individuals for the enrichment of a few it is retained by the community and will pay for the whole development of the city eliminating the necessity of taxing for that purpose. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 361i ====] The building of the Federal Capital becomes therefore not an expense to the people of Australia but a paying business bringing increased profits as the population increases. How great is such a source of income in such an enterprise is illustrated by a lost opportunity in Chicago. Here the section one mile square set aside for school use for this district is now the business center of the city. If the schools had retained the ownership of this land the income from it would besufficient to support the schools of the whole state. Unfortunately most of it was sold to individuals who rent it to those who wish to build and the princely income now goes into the pockets of a handful of individuals who absorb the community earnings of the whole district. Page 412 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoIn the city of Washington as a result of withholding of land for speculative purposes the whole city grew in the exact reverse of the plan laid down, the part determined upon for the business being held at such prohibitive prices as to make it impossible. After 75 years of this topsy-turvydom steps were takento remedy the consequences so far as possible though at great expense. Many of the consequences can never be overcome. Since the Barracks and the University do not call for central positions but a certain isolation rather, they are placed on the outskirts, the barracks on the heights beyond the station commanding the city, the incoming railroad, the business avenue, and the avenue to the Federal Group, the slopes beyond to beused for soldiers quarters and the plains to the North East for maneuver. The University, with its buildings also parallel to the main axes of the city is arranged in accordance with the scheme of natural development, the Technical Departments being carefully adjusted to the site conditions. The Legal and Sociological branches being brought into close connection with the Municipal Center with its Court House, banks, etc., the Physiological expending into the Gymnasia and Athleticfields and river sports along the water frontage, and into the medical hospitals located on the peninsula extending into the West Central Lake, where [Note: ==== Beginning of page 361j ====] though directly accessible it still has utmost quiet. The Engineering and Mining Colleges lie at the root of Black Mountain which can thus be used as experiment station. And the Agricultural College expands into the open fields to the North West. Now we shall take up the occupation of the main elements of the city. The Railroad comes into the main station through a subway of a few blocks in length which entirely disposes of it as an obstacle and gives it utmost convenience. Octagonal in shape, it can be used both as a terminal and for through traffic without conflict of either with the other, thus enabling trains to be piled up on the terminal tracks for the crowded hours and to run in onto the through tracks in continuous succession. There can of course beany number of intermediate stations as along the line and a branch can be sent in a subway to the Parliament House. With lifts to the street level the stranger even can immediately determine his way for the Town Hall caps the hill at the further end of the main business street with the chief retail stores and down the other avenue is the conspicuous Federal group. About this center are the markets. The station itself is conspicuous from other parts of the city. Backed by the Barracks in one direction and by thecathedral high on the slopes in the other it forms an impressive terminal to the two avenues which come into it. The residence districts spread out from the various centers the most strictly residence district arising from the attractions of the presence of the National Government is located on the lovely slopes of the hills to the South and West. The more industrial groups will develop in the other directions and thesuburban centers will increase indefinitely in these directions with increasing population. The Railroad yards are placed in the Northern suburb which natural conditions determine as the industrial district. The first question of this nature which has come up is the location of small arms factory. If placed to the East as suggested by the Works Department the prevailing winds would carry the smoke and odors over the most of the city including the Page 413 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 361k ====] Government Group during the greater part of the year, 29% of the winds being from the East during three seasons, 50% during one season, the windiest season, and the major portion of the night winds. A crime in any case, the preciousness of water in Australia would make the location of a factory along theriver bank as suggested such an outrage on the community as it is hard to conceive any but a private monopoly utterly indifferent to the welfare of the people considering. We have an instance of the perpetration of such an outrage in one of the outlying districts of Chicago, where the Union Steel Works have occupied the whole lake frontage cutting the town of Gary [Note: Indiana] entirely off from access to the shore and turning the delightful lake breezes into an ill smelling and filth bearing scourge. Thedevelopment of the various districts is worked out in line with the methods suggested in the early part of this talk. An illustration is the University residence group in convenient juxtaposition to the grounds on slopes of the foothills of Black Mountain forming a series of terraces, the streets following the valleys and the homes on the higher levels. In addition to the small park system and those in the interior of blocks we have the great park system and a lovelier one no city can boast. The three mountains areretained as natural reserves for the preservation of the native fauna and flora. On Ainslie alone are buildings to be placed, memorial buildings to commemorate great deeds and great achievements and always so located and so constructed as to emphasize and not to injure the natural beauties. At its feet begins the great midway garden. Since all art depends on proper consideration of terminals the origin of this great way is marked by the Casino and park accommodation house from which radiate the paths tothe commemoration grounds. From this point the midway extends right through the city opening up the whole to the Government Group on the slopes. When it reaches the river it spreads out into the play grounds of the City. Here parallel to and one block from the retail business district of the city consequently immediately accessible to the whole population are provided recreation of all sorts, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 361l ====] the entrance to it marked by theatre and opera, its slope in the center cut into to form a great stadium which at the same time shall not obstruct the view across, enclosed by such buildings as library, museum, natural history building, and at either end on the water's edge the Zoological Garden and the aviary and natatorium. This Play ground is connected with the other side of the water by a boulevardwhich sweeps under the main bridge on the other forming a high speed promenade commanding but not obstructing the central district of the city. While the upper and lower of the chain of lakes are left informal the banks of the lower lake at the University being used for the Botanical Gardens, the three center lakes have been made formal the shape of the flood banks making this surprisingly easy requiring almost no cutting or filling. This formality adds a touch of dignity to the majestic Federal Group, andoffers a mirror for its reflection. The water way is sufficient for aquatic sports, the center basin being exactly one mile long, and for pageant in time of festival. The city presents itself as an amphitheater the Play Grounds providing gathering place for the audience, the Parliamentary buildings occupying the stage, giving the impression of one great building like some of the superb structures of Indo-China presenting a facade one mile in length and piling up terrace on terrace, the water gate in the center withthe judiciary buildings on the lower level flanking the forum formed by bringing the level of the first Page 414 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoterrace out over the roof of the Water Gate; the next level occupied by various departmental buildings grouped about a central court with its pool giving a stately and charming out door resort to the members of the government. Terminating the court is the Parliament House set on a level 40 feet above that of thecourt at its feet. This whole garden frontage of the main buildings of the city starting with the peak of Ainslie to the North is terminated by the Capitol building itself on the top of Kurrajong some 60 feet above the Parliament House. Thus this stage with its lovely setting of hills and mountains in the distance, the whole reflected in the lakes in the foreground makes of the city itself a National Monument.

THE FUTURE NEW YORK OF AUSTRALIA [Note: ==== Beginning of page 363 ====] PURCHASE & SALE OF PORT STEPHENS PROMONTORY Just as the distinguishing characteristic of animals is wisdom (unconscious but perfect) so is the distinguishing quality of man foresight through the use of which he can attain free will. His course is not determined by the law of cause and effect which rules in nature. He forms a purpose. The effect precedes the cause. When Griffin landed in Australia he immediately started on his quest. He presently made up his mind to two things of preeminent importance;\u2014 1st the ultimate, since it was the correct, location of the FederalCapital. This ultimate can be attained only when the railroads (all continental communication) have been taken out of the hands of the government. Since the voters are all, practically, in the coastal cities it is thumbs down to any politician who suggests spending tax money on any other extensions. The bureaucracy gets its revenge by placing the railroads in the wrong place each time \u2014 climbing high over mountains though better grades are evident as the wagon routes show. When that becomes obvious totoo many they rebuild at a better grade still reserving better ones for a later time. 2nd \u2014 The location of the eastern port of Australia as New York is the Eastern Port of the United States. Like New York, Port Stephens has sea level entrance to the interior of the continent. It is in close contact with vital mineral supplies and Newcastle is an already established industrial center near by. During that first year in Australia Griffin advised clients of the nature of this district between Sydney and Brisbane and they purchased this strategic promontory. He designed the city. It was surveyed, the allotments staked out and the whole was sold from the plan in the Sydney real estate office. This meant contour surveys were made in the course of which he became personally acquainted with Aboriginals.

If the Town Planner had been consulted before the decisions were made by the political organism, the Federal Capital would have been placed centrally in the beautiful McDonald ranges \u2014 a vertical citysince vertical transportation is now as simple as horizontal. There it will doubtless be placed ultimately as Washington in the U.S. will be placed in the Mississippi Valley. The other matters treated in this study would then apply to matters within and without the urban limits. There would be Industrial Centers and Agricultural Centers placed in accordance with the continental conditions and the communication system could be laid out without destroying nature. There would beother ports as at Portsmouth in Victoria located not by pressure on politicians by land owners but scientifically placed and to the mutual advantage of all. A Threefold organization would develop. When we are dealing with continents we are dealing with ultimates. [Note: There is no page 367 in either the Art Institute or New-York Historical Society copies.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 368 (table of contents) ====] PORT STEPHENS LOCATION MAP[Note: There is no page 369 in either the Art Institute or New-York Historical Society copies.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 370a ====] THE BLUE VALLEYS Just as the beauties of the Haven Valley are common to all the Australian coasts, the flats above on this continental plateau may well serve for all sorts of intense occupation, but the unique beauty of the foreshores, their valleys and promontories, should be preserved for all time and residential occupancy can use them but need not destroy any of their beauty. Thus charming and spectacular sites for dwellings are to be found all along the coasts. The flats above them sometimes extend to mountain valleys of equally strange and unique charms. The blueness of the Blue Mountains can be explained I Page 416 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothink only by supersensible knowledge for in this land where we find the Paradise people, and the pre-solid vegetation recorded in the now material forms of nature, so in the blueness or these valleys we find the pre-liquid conditions visible to the ordinary eye though no material name can express it. For theblueness that fills the valleys is no mist. It can be explained as the manifestation without materialization of the 3rd of the 4 Ethers \u2014 the chemical Ether which manifests materially as water. Let us face the future of Port Stephens as the New York of Australia and look at the spectacle of a city completely beautiful, correct in its location, in its design and in its solution of its various types of buildings. There is no reason why the earliest buildings as well as the later ones should not be correctand correctly placed and all beautiful for as we have seen in our preceding studies beauty is not an expense but calls simply for the expenditure of mind and spirit which are not depleted by use but the contrary. In other words it calls for the use of human faculties \u2014 thinking, feeling and will (doing). Along the foreshore reserves would appear dwellings for nothing but artificial land values caused by private ownership of land would keep people from homing in the midst of such beauty. Town Planningincludes a Zoning system. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 370b ====] INITIAL . PORT STEVENS [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.] PORT STEPHENS - A PROPHESY OF THE FUTURE NEW YORK OF AUSTRALIA Port Stephens is an illustration of what the Military department of the bureaucracy can do with the interests of a nation. On arrival in Australia, Burley Griffin immediately made the continent of Australia his concern and found that the Western coast had two natural seaports. Eastern United States has but one which has made New York city the inevitable seaport of the Atlantic coast and the important city that it is. At each of these points there is a splendid harbor and a sea-level entrance to the interior of the continent. In his innocence he interested a client, who was carrying on a considerable real estate business, in the opportunity offered at Port Stephens which must become the seaport of New South Wales, for Sydney which has a fine harbor has to transport all goods going in or coming out over the mountains. If the railroads had not been nationally owned, the settlement of Port Stephens would have taken place long ago for the Port Stephens district not only has these primary necessities for a seaport but is surroundedby a district rich in a great variety of natural resources \u2014 coal, iron, and so on, as well as the magnificent agricultural resources of the district back of it. But National ownership gives the cities control of the politicians and officials through their preponderating vote so Sydney has been able to maintain its interests versus the interests of the continent. Griffin had come from America where the privately made roads had brought about a continental development and was enthusiastic about this opportunity. His client bought this land, a magnificent promontory on this a finer harbor than that of Sydney, and Griffin laid out the plans for a city. It was surveyed and staked out and the allotments rapidly sold \u2014 but the story ends there. For officialdom had its eye on this harbor and the Military Page 417 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 371 (table of contents) ====] BAR BEACH DEVELOPMENT [Note: ==== Beginning of page 372 ====] Bureaucracy was keeping it out of use so that they retain it for purely military purposes. This destructive power won in the conflict of interests over the constructive interests of a continent. Griffin had expected to take up the development of Portland later as a seaport for that is the other opportunity, a harbor with a sea level entrance in Victoria. But since Port Stephens really proved to be a hoax he would not lend his name to another such. Now what is the ultimate consequence of Bureaucratic government? Suppose we accept that truth is stranger than fiction and summarize the events since the first war against Germany. What methods could an ingenuity beyond the belief of the unsophisticated be used to maintain the Balance of Power in the world from the British point of view, i.e., preventing any other nation from becoming as powerful as themselves? How did the world stand at the close of the 1st World War and in the decades following? Who was the chief economic rival of Britain? I think that no one will deny that it was the United States. Then what power could Britain bring into war, for no matter with whom it was Britain could secretly or openly back this opponent of the United States. Now what has been the sequence of events internationally? First in the Dominions the habit of hatred was directed against America and before the war was over it was far stronger, at least in Australia, and more bitter than the hatred of the Germans. Then the Japanese began to work up a case against the United States regarding the treatment of her citizens. Here was a chance and a secret understanding could be entered into. The idea of Japan's initiating a war against the United States was, on the surface, an absurdity but Japan was piling up war supplies, etc. No absurdity if she had Britain back of her. Butamong other setbacks, the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 373 ====] earthquake came and burned up her supply of gasoline, which ki-boshed [Note: i.e., checked or stopped] war for the time being. The next thing cooked up was the attack of Japan on China. America's sympathy for China was well known. Of course America's treatment of the indemnities after the Boxer Rebellion was an affront to allthe imperialisms of Europe. (We must remember that all Parliamentary governments are imperialisms. Officialdom controls affairs as versus the people.) If only America could be caught in any warlike act the trick would be turned and another World War would be on. America's naval vessels were hanging around. Hoover's personal (mining) interests coincided with Britain's, but fortunately the cabinet got Page 418 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowind of the situation and gathered in the middle of the night to confer with the president and insisted that a wireless be sent to the navy not under any circumstances to fire a shot no matter what the provocation. So America kept out and the Chinese drove the Japanese out. In that first attack China won. So Japanbacked by Britain, secretly of course, started the war on China. It is nonsense to think Japan would have done this if she hadn't known England wouldn't object. But again America was a disappointment. She took no overt act to support China so another good chance for a World War and the gathering of the clans to \"Maintain the Balance of Power\" was lost. So then what? Well then the whisperings with Germany began. To be sure Germany had a good many grouches and couldn't be handled quite so easily and brought about a good many complications but yet the main thing was being accomplished. A revived Germany was a threat to Britain if she went into India. So she makes an agreement with her that she can have all central and Eastern Europe if she will keep out of India. So the imperial game goes on with endless twists and turns. Germany was again [Note: ==== Beginning of page 373b ====] at war. But her turn against France frightened England and [Note: Winston] Churchill replaced [Note: Neville] Chamberlain. There is really no answer but a threefold organization. With the beginning of 1946 we seem to have grasped that \u2014 a Security Organ with a police force to maintain Equity. Since moral standards vary in the various communities this will be the slowest to function well: an Economic Organ to attain Mutual Advantage in production and exchange. This should be easy to get functioning swiftly since it is alreadya fact though not consciously organized: and a Social Organ to enable every human being to develop his Abilities to the maximum. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 374 ====] ARCHITECTURE . Walter Burley Griffin In every department of human progress there have been long periods of groping effort, a certain amount of human accomplishment largely attributed to inspiration and a consequent vanity in those supposed to be inspired, and hero worship by the rest, a large amount of imitation on the part of others but no steady progression in the field till finally the underlying principles begin to become apparent, the laws are investigated, the whole is brought within the scope of the intelligence. Then the accomplishments in thisparticular line go ahead with leaps and bounds till we gaze with amazement at the results. We have illustrations of this in music. Human beings in all stages of development have taken satisfaction in music as distinguished from noise but the development of this wonderful field was very limited till the law \u2014 a purely mathematical one \u2014 of the conservation of rhythm \u2014 was understood. When we learned that noise resulted from the interference of sound waves with each other and theconsequent destruction of sound and that the sounds we derived pleasure from were such combinations as reinforced each other so that they went on to infinity, immediately there began a development of the Page 419 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoart of music which is one of the miracles of the present time. A hundred years has done what all the thousand of years proceeding did not begin to do. There is a great moral lesson in this. Let us try to learn this fundamental lesson and in whatever we are doing search out the controlling law. Music is a time art measured by rhythm. To satisfy the human soul these units must be preserved and must be so used as to reinforce each other, for destruction is painful to us but evidence of continuity is a joy and inspiration. Architecture is a space art. Let us search out its basic law. Is it not the conservation of space. As in music we rejoice in being made conscious of time, one of the great fundamental elements in our present creation, and in being made aware of infinity through the preservation of rhythm, so inarchitecture and landscape architecture which are but interdependent elements of one field, we [Note: ==== Beginning of page 375 ====] rejoice in being made conscious of space and can be satisfied only when the space units we use reinforce each other and a feeling of spaciousness is obtained. In a building or in a community a huddle and clutter of unrelated units is as distressing as a harsh sound. Let us illustrate this principle so simple yet so vital capable of so many and so varied results. The first problem in this field is that of the smallest unit in our life of to-day, one family. We take it in its simplest distinct form. We must concentrate our attention on present requirements and conditions for the family lives in a community amply able from its industrial development to provide effective shelter and comfortable living, though from its wasteful handling of community earnings individuals must use utmost economy in their family life. We will illustrate simply the point we are making or theconservation of space. Every family requires provision for the entire isolation of its individual members. This is provided in the bedrooms which should be directly accessible without passing through any other room and all of which should have direct access to the bathroom. Similarly the working quarters should be isolated, and so concentrated as to save as many steps as possible and, for the same economy of labor, in closest possible connection with the dining room. Apart from these private needs the quartersto be used in common should be so arranged as to help each out in as many ways as possible, for increasing floor space, for giving feeling of openness, for charming vistas. Where utmost economy is necessary we can still get a good sized living room by using the floor space that would be required for a small living room and a small dining room as one room, for in fact while a family is using a dining room the living room is empty and vice versa. With a little more leeway putting the two rooms together in theform of an L adds a little bit of mystery. With a house a bit larger a half story level scheme gives opportunity for a large living room with high ceiling which its greater proportions prevent being inharmonious, with dining room and perhaps library opening out from the higher level giving at the same time seclusion to these rooms [Note: ==== Beginning of page 376 ====] and a delightful feeling of openness to the whole. This arrangement is very economical and a very convenient one giving practically the advantages of both a two-story and a one story house, and making possible a variation in the heights of the ceilings of rooms of various sizes eliminating the unpleasant Page 420 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoproportions that sometimes arise from carrying through the same level from large rooms to small rooms and at the same time getting the feeling of openness and distance, and in addition an emphasis as pleasing in building as in any art. From the single house we will go to the problem that arises when we have two families to consider. Advantages to each can be gained if they work together. A striking example of the feeling of spaciousness to be gained by intelligent use of the space at one's command is given by walking down one of the streets of Evanston [Note: Illinois] where the lots and houses of approximately the same size are all placed each the same distance from the other, the only idea being to get the most out of one's ownlot no matter what the consequences to the neighbor. As a consequence they all look crowded and cramped for yard space, till we come to two houses (Comstock Houses) that were built at the same time with the intention of making a bit of music, instead of adding to the noise. Here in spite of the fact that the size of the lots and houses is the same, we suddenly feel that there is ample space for garden and setting, and all because the two houses have thrown their open space together, and have locatedthemselves on the further sides of their respective lots. This means of course that an architectural problem must be solved, so that the living rooms of each house may have equally desirable exposures, but there is no difficulty about this if one is but willing to take the pains. It means of course that the one house cannot as a rule be a duplicate of the other. With this arrangement each house has an open space to look out, twice the size of what it has with the other method. The manner of solving this problemvaries with the size of the lots, and the nature of the buildings to be erected, but there is always an advantage to be gained by working together. The Ravines [Note: Allen Ravines, Decatur, Illinois] was the pleasant problem of a piece of property owned [Note: ==== Beginning of page 377 ====] by a family of brothers (Mueller group of summer houses) who, with their wives and children, wanted cottages for their summer outings, and decided to build on this charmingly picturesque bit or woodland. Each family by this arrangement has its own cabin secluded to be built so as to destroy as little as possible of the wild beauty and so as to get as great a view as possible of the river with trails leading to each cabin from the large building nearer the main road which serves for accommodation house and entertainment quarters for the whole group. Here is the common garage and caretaker's home inconnection with which is the farm for raising vegetables, fruit, etc. for the whole group. Next is the small suburban group far enough out from the city center to make land values low enough to use for garden farming \u2014 a group of five farms (Emory group) [Note: Wheaton, Illinois] with buildings so placed as to bring service portions together making it possible to emphasize the park-like effect of the whole. We are able now to make some comparisons that will in a rather surprising way illustrate the main point we are making. As in the time art, the bringing together of sounds does not consummate the making of music, so in Town Planning the sub-division of space into units cannot be considered as anything but noise, and is not Town Planning at all until these units have all been brought together into harmonious relation to each other, and the law of conservation of space observed as in music the sound wave must Page 421 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobe conserved. Some illustrations will make this point clear. Ridge Quadrangles [Note: Evanston, Illinois] is a really startling example of what a little geometry will do. I shall not blame anyone who refuses to believe what I say because we ourselves could not believeour eyes till we measured and counted over and over again. However we have had similar evidence so often that we are beginning to take it as a matter of course that the more reckless we are in insisting on our ideals the more economical is the result in terms of cold cash. In other words it is only when we work for ideal ends that we achieve practical results. When brought into the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 378 ====] office it had been laid out as shown by the small scale drawing. It is a tract of land about 1500' by 2000' on the outskirts of Chicago, and was better than the usual layout of that region in one respect. It had left the usual depth of block the same but had omitted the alley so unnecessary in a residence district, throwing that extra space into the yards. It was the intention to build two family apartments on all the 50 foot lots and they were placed uniformly as is the common custom. Realizing the great importance of interior parks in districts so closely occupied we started out to do that much. Instead of running thestreet through on the long side it was taken transversely across and a short street brought into it. We had a four acre park. The next question was - How many lots had we. On counting we found we had exactly the same number of lots of the same depth and width as in the other arrangement. Since the streets on either side of the property were ample for through traffic added seclusion was given by this arrangement and while keeping the width between building lines the same, the pavements of the streets could bereduced, decreasing expense and adding to park-like appearance. By a grant of 50 feet from each private lot leaving it still one hundred feet in depth an interior park of one acre was obtained in each of the smaller blocks and a 5 acre park in the larger, ample for sports for the children and young people of the whole neighborhood, and by using one lot for common a neighborhood club can be built. Indeed the increased value given to all the lots by this arrangementwould probably build a comfortable club house. The importance of community instead of individual control is obvious since parks could be destroyed by another cross street. The feeling of spaciousness is also increased by reversing the axis of the buildings and by staggering them as shown. In this way light and air and outlook is given to at least three sides of each house insteadof to only two narrow sides. Trier Center [Note: Winnetka, Illinois] must be considered in connection with the adjacent property for here we have a community which has taken full advantage [Note: ==== Beginning of page 379 ====] of its school for neighborhood purposes. The school building itself contains hall for moving pictures, Page 422 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoetc., gymnasia, swimming pools, library, etc., and the grounds form a lovely park with play ground, and apparatus for small children and big, and with running track. So situated there was no need for space for sports in the interior of the block and this space can be used for purely park purposes or for gardening.The maximum feeling of openness is given by grouping one-family fireproof houses in pairs with the service portions adjacent and the least possible cutting up of the grounds with roadways and staggering these pairs, not only in relation to the lot line, but also with relation to the group on the opposite side of the street. Care is also taken in the grouping of these pairs to give picturesqueness and varying interest, uniting some with low concrete walls to give a feeling of unity, and taking advantage of the material ofwhich they are built \u2014 concrete - to embower them with vines and shrubs and roof gardens. In contrast with this residence subdivision on perfectly flat land is the one at Grinnell [Note: Iowa] where the somewhat rolling ground of the town as a whole becomes ravine like in character. This again offers a striking illustration of the impractical nature of these so called practical ways of doing things which method, fixing the attention on a few immediate issues, fails to see beyond its nose and, curiouslyenough, fails in consequence to accomplish even the ends it is centered on. Another illustration of the fact that a part cannot be right unless the whole is right, the health of the parts being dependent on the health of the whole. The real estate man having decided that the rectangular method of sub-division is the one which gives him best results and being a thoroughly practical man, continued the straight streets across this property, and had actually sold several lots before he realized the difficulty he was gettinginto, for when it came to putting in service, as sewers bumping up hill and down dale with the streets it became evident that it was prohibitively expensive as the pipes for the higher lots would have to be lowered to the lowest point or there would be [Note: ==== Beginning of page 380 ====] backing up of the sewage in the lower houses. So the problem was brought to a technical man for solution. By making the streets follow the bottom of the ravines these difficulties and extravaganceswere entirely overcome. By recognition of the nature of the location which made it essentially and permanently a residence district the waste of alleys and unnecessarily wide pavements was eliminated. When the lots were laid out it was found that instead of 57 lots half of 75' frontage and half of 50' there were 66 that is 9 more and all but two of them having the larger frontage of 75', the average depth being the same as in the previous arrangement. That is there was an increase of 30% in the saleable frontage,which, taking the prices previously set increased the profits of the sale by \u00a33,000 [Note: $3,000?]. In addition all the houses were located on the higher land, none in the hole and the whole took on the look of a park, and became in consequence the most attractive residence district in the town. And so it goes. In Vanderhoof, [Note: British Columbia,] Canada, desiring to squeeze the last penny of profit out of the sale of lots first ignoring and afterward respecting the nature of the ground, they werelaying out the streets with narrow blocks, cutting the property to pieces with cross streets necessitating steep gardens in numerous cases and with no park space. In these days such niggardliness is not to be tolerated, even if the profits are to be increased but again that was not the case. By placing the civic center and municipal centers so that they could be reached directly by a system of radiating streets following the ravines many of the gross streets became entirely unnecessary, easygradients were obtained everywhere, the depths of the blocks were increased till almost without Page 423 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoexception all the blocks had interior parks, while at the same time the private allotments were increased from 130' to 150' in depth, and when the count of lots was made there were still as many as before. So naturally the client would have no objection to the advantages to be offered to buyers, nor to theeconomies in road construction. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 381 ====] Out of another purely real estate proposition on the flat range lands of [Note: Idalia,] Florida, without losing any lots, we squeezed in for the benefit of the community a central park, a civic center with ample grounds, circular gateway park and open vistas down several of the streets, across the widest expanse of the river. We go from this to a problem that is frequently before our big municipal centers.

The narrow interior streets and devious ways make domestic life safe and delightful. Fast traffic is limited to the boundaries. The crime is to do as has recently been suggested by our so called Town Planners, i.e., squeeze out the parks of every quarter of the quarter section as Griffin shows was possibly permissible when one side was adjacent to manufacturing plants. Never should the other six major parks be sacrificed. Single tax would eliminate the urge to commit such crimes.The center circle is the school and major social district.

We realize that when we were in the United States we might easily have had your point of view in this matter, but we feel that our experience here has opened our eyes to what we consider is the greatest menace to democracythreatening the world at present. I would be glad to have you publish if you wish a statement to that effect, perhaps as a reply to your comment. All of us are inclined to regard the Russian Bureaucracy as a tyrannical institution, but most of us have to learn that this is the essential nature of a bureaucracy, in other words of Civil Service, and is quite as true of it in France (concerning which there was an illuminating article in one of last year's Centurys[Note: periodical title?]), in Great Britain and its Dominions, and differs in the United States only in the fact that its completion is imperfect or quite recent. We feel that one of the greatest services ever rendered to democracy in the United States was by President [Note: Andrew] Jackson in his destruction of the Civil Service System however unsatisfactory his substitution for it, the Spoils System, may be. An analysis of the system will show how inevitably an organization of permanent officials must developinto a tyrannical, inefficient organ, just as in the case of placing any individual in complete irresponsible power. To take one case of this appointment of President Wilson's:- An executive to be effective must have the power of choosing his agents, and if such an executive is to be held responsible he must not be limited in such a choice. If we, as individuals, were obliged to choose our physicians according to their age weshould consider it an absurd and pernicious method. Surely it is quite as important that no such [Note: ==== Beginning of page 385 (N-YHS table of contents) ====] MUNICIPAL INCINERATOR [Note: ==== Beginning of page 386 ====] absurd system should be enforced in matters of more general scope such as the President is responsible for. The assumption that men who have been in office longer are quite as efficient as the new comers is not only without any rational foundation but is almost necessarily the contrary of the fact. This is apparent in every department in which we have had the opportunity to observe and is a point on which we have gained much information. It is the logical consequence of irresponsible power. There is, of course, no reason why a permanent official should not react to his circumstances in exactly the same way that any autocrat does and, in communities where the Service has been perfected, I assure Page 425 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoyou they do so react promptly and effectively. Inefficient as the Spoils System is, its inefficiency does not approach that of a Permanent Civil Service organization, for in the Spoils System an individual who temperamentally is inclined to be active andefficient can act in accordance with his impulse. Not so in the Civil Service, since the case and security of his superior officers is best promoted by inefficiency and ignorance in the men about him. Moreover inefficiency makes it easier to increase the numbers in the Service which increases the power of the organization by its command of votes. In our experience, one of the Ministers who was inclined to oppose the inefficiencies of Civil Service was told by the head of one of the Departments that if he did so they would drive him out of Parliament at the next election which was then pending. They have, of course, a powerful publicity organization, constantly using the news papers, and with unlimited funds in the taxes collected. This power means that the nominal responsible agents of the people, the Members of Parliament and the Ministers have, in fact, no power at all for when, as of course sometimes happens, an individual man refuses to beintimidated he is shortly driven out of office. The work is systematically obstructed during his term of office and stopped as soon as he is gotten rid of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 387 (N-YHS table of contents) ====] RESTAURANT [Note: the illustration itself reads: \"Lotus Blossom Restaurant\". This illustration is associated with the United Provinces Exposition in Lucknow, India.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 388 ====] whatever the expense or the waste. When it happens that any individuals in the Service assist the responsible agents of the people they are knifed as soon as that individual is out of office. As the head of one of the Departments told one such officer according to evidence sworn to in the RoyalCommission which has recently been investigating the methods of the officials in connection with the Federal Capital, - \"The Minister and Mr. Griffin are irresponsible parties and here only for a short time. You play the game or we'll attend to you when they are gone.\" That these officials snap their fingers at any attempt to interfere with them is constantly shown as it was recently when the Chief Justice in a Royal Commission exposed the outrageous management of one ofthe Military camps and commended another. The man who was commended was demoted by his superiors in the Department and transferred to a distant and unpleasant location, while the one who was condemned was promoted with an increase of salary. That such must be the consequence of such a system is apparent when we consider that the organization is self-contained, feeding itself only from the youngest members of the community since no one isallowed to enter the permanent service after he is 21 years of age, which thus precludes the possibility of its containing men of education and experience; that their positions are permanent; that no one outside of Page 426 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe Service can promote or demote or dismiss any member of it, for the process of dismissal can be accomplished only by a jury of themselves which, naturally, never dismisses a man, thus safeguarding themselves for future emergencies. For instance, one Prime Minister of Australia recently, new to hisoffice, discharged his office boy for insolence. The Secretary came to him the next day, told him he'd better reconsider that, which he found was good advice since had he persisted the boy would simply have been reinstated after trial by a jury of his fellows officers, and come back to his position with [Note: ==== Beginning of page 389 (N-YHS table of contents) ====] GRIFFIN'S CASTLECRAG HOME [Note. The structure is the Grant House.] TWO FAMILY APARTMENT HOUSE [Note: The structure is the Bovee Two-Flat in Evanston, Illinois.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 390 ====] his insolence so much augmented.It is but one of an endless number of illustrations that we could point out that in this incident of the Federal Capital some 5 million dollars has been spent by the Department officials which has not accomplished anything of permanent benefit, a large part of which has produced no results whatever that any investigation can discover. The Commissioner investigating the Federal Capital finds the Ministers utterly powerless through the fact that they are either kept in ignorance of expenditures or theirinstructions are ignored. To quote from the Commissioner's report:- \"As to finances at Canberra, the evidence discloses that there never has been efficient Parliamentary or Ministerial control and that moneys have been expended by the officers without the authority or knowledge of the Minister and without any proper revision by the officers of the Auditor-General's Department.\" This state of affairs is undoubtedly the case in all established Civil Service Departments wherever they are in this or any other part of the world. As is the case in this country, a bureaucracy is the aristocracy and we are thoroughly convinced that the only reason why its results are not universally apparent in the United States is because it is so recent that it is constituted largely of men brought in from the competitive fields which means that now it may have a considerable body of efficient men but, once established, although the Service by law permits theMinister to appoint outside experts for special work, in fact any such expert, being naturally a menace to the permanent officials because of comparison of results and because of opportunities he must necessarily have for witnessing and exposing inefficiencies in the permanent officialdom, will be interfered with and blocked by the whole Bureaucracy in whose hands are the means to prevent the execution of any or all work. Page 427 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 391 (table of contents) ====] . DWELLING . ==== Beginning of page 392 ====] CAPTIONDoor and window head height is maintained throughout by a picture rail used to conceal electric lamps for direct and indirect lighting throughout. Neither the client nor the electric people could believe that the indirect method would be as cheap as the direct so the client of the first home where this method was installed had both methods installed. The indirect proved the cheaper so Griffin didn't have to go through this with future clients. He thusestablished indirect lighting in the community. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 393 ====] [Note: Continued from page 390] The menace of this institution lies in the fact that it is an autocracy of so large a body that it is in the nature of the control of a minority by a majority which is naturally much more difficult to overthrow than when the reverse is the case. A man who had spent some 7 years in Russia and, while there, thought no other people could be so under the heel of a Bureaucracy found, after the same length of time spent in Australia, that the Bureaucracy was exactly as powerful here. A quotation from one of today's papers offers an illustration of what I mean by that - when we realize that no matter what exposures aremade no remedies are forthcoming: - \"Revelations of the methods of the Defense Department (one of the Bureaucratic Departments of course) made during the trial of the defending military officer in Sydney were of the most disquieting kind. In the earlier stages of the war, when ordinary business precautions were sacrificed to haste, allowance was made for chaos in the Department. But the remark of Judge Scholes who presided showed clearly that a condition of inexcusable muddle was permitted tocontinue. It was disclosed in evidence amongst other things that sixty thousand pounds (\u00a360,000) was passed through the Department for payments to a corps that had long been demobilized. The Defense Department was frequently warned of the hopeless drifting in its financial administration, but the only response to criticism was an assurance in superior tones that all possible safeguards were being adopted. At Victoria Barracks, Sydney, even the most elementary precautions were not taken. The unhappyresults there do not of course imply dishonesty elsewhere but are strong presumptive evidence of deplorably slipshod methods throughout the Department.\" I will quote another newspaper:- \"Everywhere the Australian citizen may look he sees himself surrounded by evidence that the direction of national affairs is in the hands of messers and that, whether it be building a city or running a war or a post office, muddle reigns supreme. In this particular case ofCanberra it is true that [Note: William Oliver] Archibald Page 428 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 394 ====] (Minister) was torn from his place, snarling about the unjust way he had been treated. But his vast capacity for wasting money and making a mess mattered so little that when [Note: William Morris] Hughes formed his Rump Administration, Archibald was given the place of Minister for Trade andCustoms - a job only second in importance to that of Defense Minister.\" But the important thing to note is the succeeding sentence:- \"Is the public never going to wake up and insist upon at least decent administration? Or is it simply going on approving of politicians who plainly say that administrationdoesn't matter?\" The politicians are blamed whereas there have been Ministers who have strained every nerve to administer efficiently but for whom it was impossible there being no way except to break the law - the Civil Service law - and that would by no means be effective unless supported by the people, which it wouldn't be. An administrator to be effective must choose his agents and must be able to promote, demote or dismiss them. A comparison with individual business may help make this clear. Suppose an individual adopts a method similar to the Civil Service. He will first choose an agent but after this he will not be able to dismiss nor demote nor decrease the salary of this or any of the subagents whom his chief agent has employed. Not only will all the profits of his business go directly into the hands of his agent except what is barely necessary for his own living expenses, and perhaps without that exception, but all theincome of his other business, investments and inheritances will go directly into the hands of this agent so that if the business is not kept running on a profitable basis it can be supported by these outside sources of income. How satisfactory would such an arrangement be even during the lifetime of the agent chosen by the business man and how satisfactory in the hands of his successors. Very satisfactory to the agent, ofcourse, and it is he who would be Kow-towed to by the community.

Salter House, Toorak (Malvern), Victoria, Australia.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 396 ====] CAPTION Like most clients these came to us with a quite definite house plan in mind. The sketches showing the rooms enclosing an interior court gave them a great shock. However after studying it they found it met Page 429 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoall their preconceived ideas of convenience, etc. better than they had been able to work them out. The home proved most satisfactory and charming beyond their dreams. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 397 ====] [Note: Continued from page 394]It is indeed important for us to begin to think internationally, and to observe most carefully the results of systems that have been put into practice. For instance, you would not be an advocate of the Single Tax System if you were here in Australia. Our experience has warned us that the Single Tax, adopted by any community under autocratic control, even if it is nominally a democracy, is but the most efficient instrument for impoverishing the people. The things these communities need to work for is not singleTax but for abolition of Bureaucracy and for Popular Control. And in the United States if Single Tax is adopted and the Civil Service left to perfect itself, a generation or two will suffice to put the United States exactly where the countries of Europe are now and bid fair to remain for a long time to come. The political agents of the people, and this applies to all European countries as well as to Australia, have no power whatever except that of apportioning and collecting the taxes. These funds are expended onlyby the Civil Service Bureaucracy. The Bureaucracy is the aristocracy which, hitherto, has worked very quietly, leaving the politicians to get what glory they may from conspicuousness and to take all the blame of any evils evident in affairs. The present situation, however, is enabling them to come out of their hiding, for the demand of the people for Socialism which means putting into the hands of the Government, necessarily therefore into the hands of the Bureaucracy, all the businesses of thecommunity, is a system which has now been accepted by the established aristocracies who, already largely bureaucrats, have seen that by this method they can perfect their powers. Realizing, as Single Taxers do, that the measure is fruitful of good to the community only when the government of that community is in the control of the people, it is only necessary to awaken them to the fact that a Civil Service System is necessarily an autocratic one, in fact the most powerful of all forms ofaristocracy. Probably the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 398 ====] only safeguard against the menace so terribly real at present, is a strict analysis of the proper function of government. The human being has two functions to fulfill, that of an individual, and that of a unit in acommunity. As individual, his duty and his right is to watch out for his own interests. As a Citizen, it is his duty and privilege to see to it that all other individuals have equal opportunity to look out for their interests. This means that the function of Government is the maintenance of justice, and only that. All other undertakings are matters for the individual, which he can carry on either by himself or in combination to any extent, even to that of the whole membership of his community. But always outsideof this should be the governing machinery which should form no part of the other activities of the community. Page 430 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoFor instance, in the question of Single Tax, the Government should go no further than seeing to it that this common property of the community should be enjoyed by all equally, that is it could properly collect the rental values of land but, after paying out of this sum the necessary expenses of its ownmachinery, the rest should not be used by this organization for expenditure for any other purposes whatever but should be divided up among the individuals who, individually or in groups, could then expend it according to their wishes. To unite the profit making machinery with the justice maintaining machinery will cripple or destroy justice in the future as it has always in the past. The theory of government which prevails throughout Europe, that Governments are organized for the benefit of the citizens, has no basis of justice and consequently no element of democracy. And you will scarcely find an individual, search where you will, that does not believe in the benefit theory whether they call themselves democrats or not. With very few exceptions they believe in imperialism in one form or another.

[Note: ==== Beginning of page 401 ====] [Note: Continued from page 398]Service system. But volumes are to be found in the United States if we but wake up and look for them. The recent case of the building of boats by the Navy Department is typical, the officials spending $80,000,000 recently building the same old boats according to their routine, indifferent to the recently formed necessity of armoring them below the water line because of submarines; introducing expensive new toys in the way of electrical devices where it happens to please their fancy in spite of the fact thatthey offer no advantage while tremendously increasing cost, neither extravagance nor efficiency being elements that the Civil Service need to take into account at all. Page 431 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoOr the case of another Department's having decided to build a high power house on the Mall in Washington, only by chance learned of and opposed by citizens who are exerting themselves to prevent this ridiculous catastrophe. Whether this revolution in Russia is of any avail depends upon its effect on the Bureaucracy. If it is merely an ousting of individual members, no more is gained than by the killing of a land owner when his son, or anyone else, inherits his property. Unfortunately there are few in Europe who think they believe in democracy who are not in fact believers in Socialism - the very antithesis of democracy - the strongest of all forms of aristocracy, and necessarily Bureaucratic for business cannot be run without anorgan to run it. We rejoice of course in even a temporary overthrow of the Bureaucrats in Russia and hope Russia may see the fault of the System. One thing they have done which the United States would do well to copy. We have learned how pernicious is the custom of giving titles. It is like a rot in the heart of an apple. The abolition of military titles would be a great help in the control of the military pending its entire abolition.It would puncture much of the element of vanity and consequently much of its appeal to those who are looking, not to render service, but to gain glory. One has to live in a community where titles [Note: ==== Beginning of page 402 ====] are given to realize what an enormous pernicious influence they have. I am not trying in this letter to prove my statements to you but simply to call your attention to this point which we feel is of such vital importance to democracy. I can send you a large amount of evidence ifyou wish it. Volumes have been taken in this one Canberra investigation which is but typical. There have been a number of other exposures since we have been here but one has to have seen this particular cat to get the significance from the scanty statements published.

LUCKNOW UNIVERSITY ENGINEERING EXTENSION [Note: See the illustration on the preceding page.] THE FEDERAL CAPITAL WILL PAY ITS OWN WAY Walter Burley Griffin All recognize the national obligation to complete the Federal Capital, and the Prime Minister has promised that the work will be as vigorously prosecuted as the financial conditions permit. Very well then the financial merits of the project must float it, and rightly, as with any sound business proposition, and must demonstrate that this is the time to do it. The Capital need cost Australia nothing carriedthrough to completion on business lines, though further trifling with the undertaking, as at the start, may prove as costly as the average bureaucratic enterprise. Ordinary cities are profitable propositions, in fact cities exist in modern times only because they pay, yet few cities in the world ever had the prospects of this first and only capital of a continent. Melbourne and Sydney pay handsomely but merely to a single land-holding class. Canberra on the contrary with noland-holding class will be profitable to the whole community. Fifteen hundred municipalities in Germany alone which have from the middle ages controlled their own land have no need to levy rates or taxes to pay their way and many of these towns have been paying annual dividends in cash to their citizens. Neither must a city be primarily industrial in order to pay, in fact such cities pay the least in proportion to their population because the highest values accrue to the lands serving the economically higher classes of residential communities. None of the great Capitals of the Continent of Europe - Paris, Rome, Madrid, Berlin, Vienna, Moscow - possess preponderant commercial or industrial advantages, scarcely even a port. But these cities have their attraction to the popular and political interests which they focus. So does Washington [Note: District of Columbia]; and in fact London and New York, though greatports, are first of all the place of residence and headquarters of the financial authorities who overmatch the political spending power in such essentially [Note: ==== Beginning of page 417 ====] privately organized economic entities as Great Britain and the United States.But in Australia the organization of the Government is the chief factor in running the country and can Page 433 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowe not expect to find in its permanent Seat of Government such power as is already reflected in the, at present, generally recognized authority of the merely temporary Capital, Melbourne? It is not only ultimately that the Capital may be considered an economic factor in Australia for from the moment of itsestablishment 200 miles from the nearest industrial center it will open up for profitable production a tributary area of 200 miles diameter with the deepest of all the ports on the continent and attracting thousands of agricultural settlers tending to loosen a little the strangle-hold of the metropolitan capitals which are centralizing all advantages and forming an artificial development at the expense of the country districts which latter cannot and will not receive their fair share of legislative interest and assistance solong as the propinquity of the great city operates to fill the whole perspective of the people's legislative and executive representatives. Canberra itself will be no mean city to start with because there are at least 4,500 official employees to be transferred forthwith. As a matter of fact the latest Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner's Staff List shows 2,898 permanent employees a year ago on the Central Staffs to which must be added also theParliamentary, Railway and Repatriation, Naval and Military permanent Central Staffs outside the Commission, amounting to 600 more and no less than 1,000 temporary employees in all branches; altogether 5,500. And the employment during ten years has been increasing over 10 per cent per annum. The average pay of these Commonwealth Servants is \u00a3200 per year whereas the average income of wage earners generally is only \u00a3172-13-8. [Note: Much of the text on pages 416-417 (and part of 419) repeats text found on pages 422-423.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 418 ====] With such an industry as a nucleus can anyone question that, with their dependents, with municipal employees, with all the builders, providers and other professional and business agencies there will be less than 25,000 people in Canberra when the Government is established there? Far less promising town-planning projects have been undertaken by private enterprise for single plants of collected factoriesand are paying well. The town of Gary, Indiana, without town-planning advantages and with its one basic industry in the newly established plant of the United States [Note: Steel] Corporation showed a five fold increase in land values in ten years, from \u00a31,250,000 to \u00a36,750,000 with an expenditure of only a little over \u00a31,000,000 all told on administrative expenses, improvements and in taxes, to create this dividend. Investigations by Dr. Murray Craig and others in the United States show that a fair estimate of the increment to the land in communities generally \"after deducting the value which is attributed to all expenditures for local improvements, etc.\" is about \u00a380 to \u00a3100 per capita and according to Thomas Adams the Town Planning Adviser of the Canadian Commission of Conservation the assessment valuations of the Cities of Canada confirm these figures. He states moreover, that in some WesternCities the assessed value of the land alone is \u00a3400 per capita and a particular city of 15,000 population is referred to showing \u00a3270. The average unimproved value of land of all kinds according to the owners' declarations in the Australian \"Wealth\" Census of 1915 was \u00a392 per capita but that may be considered about half the true value as may be seen by comparison with the corresponding assessed value of \u00a3219 in New Zealand for Page 434 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago1926. It is difficult to determine from official returns exactly what are the actual ratios between values of land and improvements or between land and population in most cases because of the discriminatory practices on the part of the assessors as, for instance, in the United States where although [Note: ==== Beginning of page 419 ====] the bare land of Seattle, Washington represents 78% of the total value of real estate; in Newark, New Jersey, it is about 48%, and in Taunton, Virginia, is returned as only 32%. Yet in the absence of more accurate data it has been broadly assumed by authorities that, by and large, the total values of site and all improvements thereon are equal, and the most reliable evidence corroborates New Zealand's methods of assessment in showing a land value over \u00a3200 per capita. InNew York City, possibly the most valuable improved piece of the earth's surface, when all improvements showed \u00a3460,000,000 value the actual land showed \u00a3770,000,000 value, the land representing \u00a3770 per capita. In Washington [Note: District of Columbia] where the Government has contributed its fine buildings the bare land value is correspondingly fifty per cent higher per capita. Now when there are 25,000 people on Canberra the bare land values may according to reasonable expectation increase to \u00a35,000,000 whereas half that amount would recoup the commonwealth for its necessary expenditure on public improvements. These improvements however will in most cases as with water and gas supply, light and power and transport services and building accommodation, bring their own profits and thus pay for themselves independently of the land. In fact in the successful garden city of Letchworth, England, with 13,000 population these services bring twice as great net return as theland rentals. Were the land values at Canberra declared as profit they night, on the basis of figures herein before quoted, capitalize as a 10% dividend on the Commonwealth's investment within the period of five years or so that may be required for the enterprise. Nor will these returns have to await the end of that period since the constructing population may be settled as fast as it accumulates and begin to show its return onthe investment in a very few months, - the first [Note: ==== Beginning of page 420 ====] services have been ready and are now waiting at an annual loss to the country of \u00a3100,000 per year, for interest and maintenance which public economy requires to be wiped out with no further delay. None ofthe work of establishing this community is unnecessary for the Commonwealth nor detrimental to any existing centers. It is a matter of common knowledge and concern that this country is now short of at least 20,000 new houses with which existing agencies are striving ineffectually to cope, but of which the proportion needed at Canberra can be more economically established under the conditions of town planning efficiency and concentration than scattered, as elsewhere, in small or single isolated efforts. Onthe other hand, if the Capital development is postponed, as the vested interests of Melbourne shortsightedly are urging, until after the abnormal shortages are made up it is likely to involve duplication and great loss avoidable by immediate action.

It is a business proposition and on business lines will pay for itself. More, it will pay handsomely! What is the use of talking as the Melbourne provincialists do. They simply refuse to hear the merits of the proposition and hide behind the lie that it is a waste of money and a Bush Capital. The only waste lies in leaving an idle capital representing 1 \u0001 millions already expended. An annual loss of over \u00a3100,000 in interest, maintenance, administrative costs, etc. Instead \u00a330,000 yearly goes into the coffers of Melbourne landlords as rent for office space on lands priced up to a \u00a31,000 per front foot as against \u00a35-0-0 per acre the cost at Canberra. Canberra has been laid down on business lines after most prolonged investigations, discussions and scouring the world. It is not an ordinary matter of bureaucratic routine. Its progress has not been on business lines due to such adverse interests as already referred to. The Government have decided tokeep the bond and honor the contract on which the proposition was really based and go on with the project on business lines. The country has had to find occupations for many thousands of returned soldiers, while this national interest has been lying waiting, just the sort of work, two thirds unskilled, that the average man could take up. The Government has been forced to find thousands of houses for these men and their familiesand by this demand has much increased the cost of building in the metropolitan cities, whereas large idle brickworks, millions of bricks, extensive stores of timber, cement, and building plant have been waiting the resumption of work at Canberra which would help to relieve the over-taxed building industry in Australia. If five thousand houses are erected in Canberra they will relieve to that extent the national shortage of twenty thousand houses, without adding to the government's responsibility or in any wayupsetting the real estate or building market. If this work was left until after a slump the consequences might, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 422 ====] on the contrary, then be serious and to Melbourne in particular. In the meantime there is an idle military internment camp capable of housing all the workers required while the permanent settlement is being prepared for them. No city will exist if it does not pay. Every city is a paying business. Melbourne and Sydney pay without a doubt, though Melbourne and Sydney do not pay the residents as a whole. Canberra also will pay, and Canberra will pay the whole people, because this whole people are the land-owners. The residents willbe freed from taxation, because the rent of business sites will be sufficient to meet all public requirements, as in many of the free cities of Europe, where the citizens instead of being taxed, receive Page 436 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocash dividends. Fifteen hundred municipalities in Germany alone which have from the middle ages controlled their own land have no need to levy rates or taxes to pay their way and many of these towns have been paying annual dividends in cash to their citizens. Neither must a city be primarily industrial in order to pay, in fact such cities pay the least in proportion to their population because the highest values accrue to the lands serving the economically higher classes of residential communities. None of the great Capitals of the Continent of Europe, Paris, Rome, Madrid, Berlin, Vienna, Moscow, possesses preponderant commercial or industrial advantages, scarcely even a port. But these cities owetheir attraction to the popular and political interests which they focus. So does Washington [Note: District of Columbia]; and in fact London and New York, though great ports, are first of all the place of residence and head-quarters of the financial authorities who overmatch the political spending power in such essentially privately organized economic entities as Great Britain and the United States. But in Australia the organization of the Government is the chief factor in running the country and can we not expect to find in its permanent Seat of Government such power as is already reflected in [Note: ==== Beginning of page 423 ====] the, at present, generally recognized authority of the merely temporary Capital, Melbourne? It is not only ultimately that the capital may be considered an economic factor in Australia for from the moment of its establishment 200 miles from the nearest industrial center it will open up for profitable production a tributary area of 200 miles diameter with the deepest of all the ports on the continent andattracting thousands of agricultural settlers to loosen a little the strangle-hold of the metropolitan capitals which are centralizing all advantages and forming an artificial development at the expense of the country districts which latter cannot and will not receive their fair share of legislative interest and assistance so long as the propinquity of the great city operates to fill the whole perspective of the peoples legislative and executive representatives. In New York City, possibly the most valuable improved piece of the earth's surface, when all improvements showed \u00a3460,000,000 values the actual land showed \u00a3770,000,000 value. The land representing \u00a3175 per capita. In Washington [Note: District of Columbia] where the Government has contributed its fine buildings the bare land value is correspondingly fifty per cent higher per capita. Obviously a city of the importance and prospects the Federal Capital of Australia is will realize an enormous income from site values but even in a town no larger for example than Albury with only 6,500 population shows unimproved land values remain after all the values due to government and civic expenditure have been deducted, through the rates and taxes paid on the land which will capitalize doubtless to as much again. Moreover these are war time assessments and do not include thesurrounding areas as in some municipalities as will Canberra. In New Zealand the average is \u00a3216 per head for the whole country.

AUSTRALIA All creative ideas must originate in man's mind. Since there is no such thing as a common brain they must originate in one man's mind. In the case of the capital city of Australia (which is not the center of the British Empire so this could not normally arise in the mind of a Londoner) it was James A. Smith, an engineer of world wide reputation, who conceived and promoted and carried through the Can'brraidea. But as happens so often his name practically never appears in this connection. The idea gradually became a centripetal force uniting the continent. As it happens, naturally guided from the other side, inspired, he chose a moment when a man who had not grown up in this tradition of empire and colonialism but in America was Minister of Home Affairs [Note: King O'Malley]. He was one of a group of men who had been in parliament from its foundationin Australia. Into the constitution at the time of the federation of the Australian States had been written a 10 year limit for the selection of the site of the capital city. At the end of this period the site was chosen and announced in the public press. During this decade a youth at whose request a Town Planning course had been created in the University of Illinois - the first one in the world - had watched the professional magazines for the announcement of the competition for its design since to a logical mindthere was no other way of determining the one to undertake the planning since there were no Town Planners in the modern world. And, mirabile dictu, toward the end of the decade the announcement came - an International Competition for the Capital City. Australia, not having attained unification through a revolution, had adopted the routine type of government, the parliamentary, which puts the politicians in the bag of the Bureaucracy instead of viceversa as in the case of the United States thanks to the great genius of the creators of the Congressional form and to [Note: President] Andrew Jackson. In the United States the elected government can, if it will, dismiss a civil servant. Elsewhere the civil Servants can throw out the government whenever it wants to. In the battle of Canberra this fact must be understood. It was the fight of a single man against, well against on empire if one states it in its Page 438 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 426 ====] simplest terms. Griffin could not have lasted ten minutes in Australia without this man who advised him when he arrived in Australia to return to the United States. Mr. Smith was not a traitor but a remodelerof Empire, a house-cleaner so to speak. Real power if it is not perverted to the advantage of the individual lies in the individual man. Mr. Smith got this wild Irishman, Mr. O'Malley, to publish the terms of the competition. The Labor Party was thrown out of office in consequence but the announcement was out. (Later Smith got the assistant Prime Minister of the other Party to advise the Prime Minister to appoint Griffin as Director ofDesign and Construction of the Federal Capital. Whereupon the Liberal Party was thrown out. So the fight went on.) In the mean time the adjudicators had been selected. They were to be chosen by their official organizations - one by the surveyors, one by the engineers, one by the architects. Mr. Smith was chosen by the engineering-institute. The architects under pressure from \"home\" refused to nominate one so theMinister, Mr. O'Malley, appointed one. However Australian architects entered the competition but not the English. They bided their time but this time it never came. Plans were sent from all around the world. The adjudication went to W.B. Griffin by a 2 to 1 vote - Mr. Smith and the Architect appointed by the Minister. The third voted for an Australian plan. At the official handing of the envelope containing the number of the winning plan to the Minister of Home Affairs bythe head official of this department with the photographers around to record this event, Mr. Smith called his attention to the fact that he was delivering the wrong envelope, the correct one was in his left hand pocket. At that moment the cameras clicked. It made an interesting photograph but the correct one was handed to the Minister. I am telling this story at this late date because it is critically important now in 1947 that Americans should comprehend the difference between the Parliamentary and theCongressional forms of government. Except in the United States and [Note: \"perhaps\" crossed out] Switzerland and possibly in Sweden not only Russia but all other governments are run by the bureaucracies. This particular officer was one of several who were [Note: ==== Beginning of page 427 ====] condemned later on in a Royal Commission re Canberra works. I am told that British history contains only one other case of a Royal Commission going against the officials. Meantime the Labor Party was again thrown out because officialdom can always influence enough votes to throw out a party non-grata to itself. You see Permanent Officialdom has the spending of all the money and has the selecting of Temporary officials. This is one of the essential differences between the Parliamentary form of government and the Congressional, that great work of creative genius of the founders of America. Another is that the Parliamentary cabinet Ministers are legislators withouteconomic or executive experience so dependent on the officials in government undertakings. At least a number of American Presidents have had considerable executive experience. The result is that in America 6 percent of the population of the world consumes 60 percent of the products of the world. You see people are all right all around the world if you give them a chance. The British people are lovely Page 439 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoon the whole like all other people but their form of government is the masterpiece of Satan himself. The consequences will be dire if after the war the institutions of the world are modeled on this pattern. The first thing Mr. Smith did when they began the study of the plans was to have the presentation drawings Griffin had sent in photographed so that they should not be seduced by their beauty. These drawings by the way were made by myself. So they were tucked away among the archives. The second prize went to Mr. [Note: Eliel] Saarinen of Finland and they were beautiful too but these two designs represented two different schools. Saarinen imposed his concept on nature, cutting, terracing, formalizing the district on traditional lines. Griffin touched Australia's native beauty with loving hands.The plan, as an Australian writer puts it, \"fits the location like a glove.\" None of its beauty has been attained at the expense of nature. It is a majestic union of classic and romantic. The judge found that every function of the Capital City was located where it was to its best advantage. As a Scotchman wrote Griffin after the adjudication, \"It is the only comprehensible city plan I have ever seen.\" [Note: ==== Beginning of page 428 ====] Mr. Smith went over it with a fine tooth comb as he did all the plans. The decision was given to Griffin because it was correct, every need of a city met, every function fulfilled and every organ located where it should be in relation to others and where nature would best serve it and enhance it. However the judges had no say in deciding who should have charge of carrying the design into effect. With the unification of the continent the rivalry between individuals for control of the land rents became a rivalry of the States for the location of the government within its boundaries for that meant the housingof officialdom and the continual rise of land values. Victoria won out in the first place but only after it had been written into the constitution that a new city should be built. The bargain was that Melbourne should house it for the first decade but that the city should be built in New South Wales only about 100 miles from Sydney, within one might say not excessive commutation distance from Sydney at any rate for the members of Parliament. It took a decade more for Canberra to grow attractive for New SouthWales members to take residence in Canberra. The proper method would have been for the city planner to determine its location but at that time there was no such thing as a city planner. When Griffin went to Australia he did locate and design the port and capital for the new state of Northern New South Wales when the time comes for that division and he also pointed out the proper place for a transcontinental port in Victoria. Had he been consulted hewould have located Canberra more nearly in the center of Australia, in the McDonald Ranges, safer from the military point of view, a charming location and one that would help to develop Australia continentally. The government controlled railroads have kept Australia from developing continentally as the U.S. did under private ownership for no politician would vote against the wishes of his constituents who objected to having remote Railroads built out of their tax money. If it were not for obstructionsfrom outside its borders there is no reason why Australia [Note: ==== Beginning of page 429 ====] Page 440 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoshould not be as populated and prosperous as the United States whose area it about equals except for Alaska. However, though within his province, this was outside of his jurisdiction as to Canberra. The location had been settled on narrow lines based on personal interests instead of on continental political and economic lines. A district to serve in Australia as the District of Columbia in the United States but some 10 times the area was purchased at the current prices of squatted property in the district instead being just one subdivision of the Nation. This would of course prevent private citizens from reaping the fruit of rising land values in the district. It also prevented in Canberra what happened in Washington - theperversion of the business district where in Washington the high prices charged by current owners diverted the whole business district from its proper location, deadly to the perfection of the development of the city. Of course the right answer is to have no State lines. States are just hangovers of old jealousies which have no meaning now, and consequently act as diseases in the community. Tariffs are already being setup on those lines in the U.S. There are just two natural government entities - the continent and the city. Their nature is different and calls for different types of government. The intermediate state has no proper function. The consequence of this community ownership of the whole area of the city and its suburbs of Canberra has made possible the orderly development of the whole area of Canberra whether it be fast or slow. The first thing Griffin did in Australia was to check the roads, then thoroughfares, of the suburban districts to make them connect most directly and economically with the neighboring towns. A curious thing happened however for Griffin's design is not only for the central city, the area of which was specified in the conditions of competition, but includes the surrounding suburbs. The more or less frequent changes of party control and thus of ministers led each new Minister of Home Affairs to [Note: ==== Beginning of page 430 ====] direct operations away from the suburb laid down by his predecessor to one of the other suburbs as shown in the approved plan so that from quite early days one could climb one or another of the hill slopes and look out upon a whole city with all its suburbs laid out on the ground and occupied to a certain extent while the population was still very small. Naturally there are in consequence some complaints about distances. This premature expenditure was really no extra expense since thegovernment has to pay neither rent nor interest on money spent and it and its consequences have had a very remarkable effect on Australia. It means that while still very young Canberra has become a great show not only for travelers from afar but for the citizenry (even though there still remained different gauges in the railroads of the states) and it has to a considerable extent broken down the state jealousies. Australia now thinks as a unit as has been evidenced by the astounding stands the present [Note: Prime] Minister, Mr. [Note: John] Curtin, has been able to take, breaking down the imperial barriers in a way that was impossible at the time of the last war. Of course London foresaw that, which accounts for the opposition to the competition for the capital city, and previously to the capital city at all. After Griffin's death, a few days before I left Australia, I went with a friend, a newspaper man, to have a Page 441 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofarewell look at Canberra. Now in the early days practically no one wanted Canberra. It meant financial loss to both the big cities, Sydney and Melbourne, because the large and ever growing Civil Service would move away and all their business with them. Their rents and their purchases would be lost. Soland owners and business, sellers and buyers, helped officialdom - that is the whole citizenry - helped to put obstacles in the way of progress of the Capital. But Griffin always felt that \"the people\" really wanted it, really needed it and the flame of his enthusiasm backed by the determination of Mr. Smith kept it keeping on. He knew the people of Australia needed it and would awaken to the need. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 431 ====] This is what happened on a farewell visit I made with Mr. Trinick. We both went incognito. After jaunting around and seeing the sights we stopped in a shop. Casually Mr. Trinick said to a clerk, \"Well we tourists think Canberra is a pretty nice place, but I suppose you people who live here don't feel that way about it.\" \"We certainly do like it very much,\" said the young man. \"Well,\" said Mr. Trinick, \"I asked a man who it was that designed Canberra and he did not know.\" The youth flared, \"There is not anyone in Canberra who does not know that Mr. Burley Griffin designed Canberra. They feel thatthrough his great inspiration the soul of Australia is being developed.\" That was a nice farewell for me his wife and I realized that the old bitter fight was over. Canberra was born undeformed and healthy and would grow on and do her work. We had realized this for some time. At the end of 7 years of service as Director Griffin resigned. His plan was gazetted. That means that no change can be made in it without an act of Parliament. Theconstruction work had by this time established the plan on the ground and Canberra had become an established fact and, with Griffin no longer to fight against, the officials began to realize that carrying on correctly would bring great credit to them. And so it has been. Round-the-world traveling which had become so popular before this war, enabled voyagers to see this really unique sight from Mount Ainslie or Red Hill - a young city and all its suburbs laid out on the ground before them, beautiful scenery witha background of mountains, streets constructed, splendid tree plantings evergreen and ever blooming, with street lights all in, Parliament House and other government buildings, several residential centers fairly occupied, residences, shops, theatres, etc. The one thing lacking to make a truly grandiose scene is that the waters of the Molonglo had not yet been dammed to form the permanent reflecting basin. The plan as one looks down from the heights will not really be comprehensible till this is done. When they take Griffin's suggestion and dam the lower Molonglo with a dam comparable to the Burrinjuck, there will be an environing district for habitation on water frontage comparable to Sydney's miles of foreshore frontage.

CANBERRA & ENVIRONS [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of the \"Preface\" page 1a (above).] CANBERRA - ITS DESIGNER AND ITS PLAN THE SESQUICENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF AUSTRALIA [Note: 1938] Delivered over the radio by Mrs. Walter Burley Griffin It is interesting to realize that Canberra is the only really modern city in the world. Not that that has been made obvious to the casual glance, but structure can be truly modern only when the foundations are properly laid for that particular thing and so it is with Canberra. Its history from the beginning is the history of Town Planning or land planning in modern times, say of the past 300 years. For this science (and science is based on knowledge and not on feeling as in the case of the arts) had died out and was no longer practiced. But some 40 years ago a young man, who in his early teens had at times become inattentive to what was going on in his school classes in order to play with his pencil in scheming layouts of cities, this youth in scouring the catalogue of his State University, saw the title \"Landscape Architecture\" and decided to take that course. On arriving he found there was no such course. However, on his demand and through his persuading two or three others to join him, the course was created in the University of Illinois, lyingin that fertile Mississippi valley. Since then the course has been established in many universities in Europe and America. Indeed the pressing need arising from the growth of big cities in recent times, for up to the latter half of the 19th century there was no such thing as a big city in our modern sense of the word, this need awakened the conception of the necessity of foresight in developmental work; and the increasing death toll arising from the cramming in of modern methods into ancient forms made it clearthat the forming of cities should no longer be left to arise from cow paths nor real estate subdivisions. While still in the University this youth took note of the fact that the Australian States were federating into a continental nation and then and there decided to enter the competition for its capital [Note: ==== Beginning of page 435 ====] city, for to his logical mind it seemed obvious that since there was not as yet an established profession of landscape Architecture the choice of such an Architect could be made only through competition. For ten years he watched the architectural publications and then, sure enough, there was the announcement before his eyes. Owing to a busy practice in 14 states, the months slipped by and nothing was done about it, though doubtless the matter was brewing within, till finally his wife, performing thatvaluable function of the Xanthippes of the world, flew into a rage and told his that if he didn't start on Page 443 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe design that day she wouldn't do a stroke of drafting on the thing. The design was begun that day and, after 9 weeks of driving work, toward midnight of a bitterly cold winter night, the box of drawings, too long to go into a taxi, was rushed with doors open and the men without their coats - no time to go up16 stories to get them - across the city to the last train that could meet the last boat for Australia, the imperturbable Mr. Griffin himself the only one not quite frantic by this time because to his mind if Australia was serious about the matter of their Federal Capital they wouldn't let the moment of the arrival of the plans be the determining factor in their choice and, to his land planning mind they couldn't but be serious in such a matter. A year later the cable came that Walter Burley Griffin had won the prize. His words on receiving the message were: - \"Ah then I shan't be able to see a plan better than mine.\" A year later again he arrived in Australia taking up his duties as Federal Director of Design and Construction and for seven years gave himself to the work. His plan was gazetted which means that it cannot be deviated from except by an act of Parliament. And at the present time Canberra has become acenter of interest to Australia and to the world though few yet realize its potentialities. A few months before his death Mr. Griffin, who kept himself thoroughly posted on matters architectural, said to me that nothing had yet been put forward in [Note: ==== Beginning of page 436 ====] Town Planning that was not already incorporated in the Canberra plan. Cities are growing things, developing during the centuries, but today, after two decades, from the top of Mount Ainslie, one can look down on the layout on the ground of a city with all its suburbs complete. Mr. Griffin did not expect to see these suburbs in his lifetime. It is one of the world's unique sights. You see a government doesn't have to pay interest on its capital investment so can afford to do such things. There, to the knowing eye, is revealed the fact that here at least the two essential factors of a city were considered simultaneously and so solved perfectly, the conditions of occupation which require right angle, or obtuse angle, allotments, and those of distribution which require radiating thoroughfares. City planning, as founded by Mr. Griffin, was not a mechanical drafting board affair later to be imposed upon the earth destroying whatever got in the way of this abstraction which might produce a certain monumental beauty but could only be a dead or dying thing doing its share, not toward keeping theEarth alive but toward killing it entirely as seems to be the only way in which the Egos of our people can express themselves at the present time. However we can keep up our courage knowing that the nature of the Ego, at first destructive, later can become constructive. In planning Canberra every detail of the natural conditions was thoroughly studied in order to preserve them and to make the most of each and everything so that the City can indeed be a living thing, ahealthy, growing thing. Such reverence for our Mother Earth is acutely necessary now for the rate of destruction is increasing so rapidly that even a century or two may make the earth incapable of supporting life, the conclusions of geologists speaking in terms of former long geological periods to the Page 444 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocontrary notwithstanding. Their theories fall down before actual facts. And the continent of Australia would do well to learn this lesson from its Capital. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 437 ====] In the layout of this city alone have the requirements for modern high speed been met in the two hundred feet wide avenues which are the business streets and extend from center to center of the various suburbs making possible the accommodation of high, low and medium speed at different levels and without level crossings which when put into effect will wipe out the heavy death rate of our present highways. The subsidiary distributing domestic roads leading off at right angles from the business avenues are, as they should be, devious and narrow used as they should be only to bring residents andtheir services to the dwellings and domestic community buildings. In addition the whole residential area has central open park and play space off the street frontages in the interior of blocks so that children can reach their destinations in going to school or other community functions without traveling on the roads at all but by following park paths which can dip under even the slow traffic roads by subway paths. And adult population in the evenings can also take these pleasantways to the interior central groups of club rooms, gymnasia, museums, libraries, sport fields and so on. The city is thus dotted with open spaces which are no extravagance because they occupy no street frontage. From the hill tops, though a spectacular sight, the city plan cannot yet be understood because the water axis, a system of waterways which will entail but a trifling expense, has not yet been established. Whenthis is done which will probably be in the near future the delightful water sports will be available for the citizenry, and Canberra will have become a true garden city for a garden is not a garden without water. When in carrying on that most important of Australia's works, the impounding of water, another dam comparable to that of Burrinjuck has been constructed somewhat below the city there will arise a body of water comparable to the Sydney Harbor giving some 50 miles of superbly beautiful residential area. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 438 ====] When the individual citizenry of Canberra realizes that a city can be beautiful only when the buildings are beautiful and when they lose that Anglo Saxon puritanical feeling that it is immoral to express and clothe themselves in beauty, though at the same time they look with envy as well as contempt at beautyexpressed by other peoples, when each one realizes that it is his duty to see to it that his own building, be it residence or shop or office, is beautiful and at the same time contributes to an harmonious ensemble, when he realizes that the flat roof, so appropriate to these climates, doubles the area of his home either for entertainment or garden without any increase of cost, when he realizes that the colors used should not be a shock in the garden but in accord with the colors of nature about him, when herealizes that beauty is a necessity for the health of himself and his children, when he realizes that what each one does should make the city as you look at it from the hill tops look not less but more beautiful, when he realizes that each one can assist not in denuding but in reclothing all the hills not only with soft wood forests but with native loveliness, perhaps taking Mr. Griffin's suggestion to plant each hill with a Page 445 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagodistinctive color, one with reds, another with blues, another with yellow and gold and so on, then what a breath taking thing the heart of Australia will have become.

Perhaps that is a better way to put it than to say that Mr. Griffin started a new era. Then again perhaps we should say James Alexander Smith started a new era in Australia for he not only carried the Federal Capital through but he trained a whole group of young engineers who have done things in these recent decades, climaxing with Mr. [Note: John] Curtin as Prime Minister who did amazing things. His untimely death is a shocking thing. But my story is Griffin's adventure.Shortly before I left Australia, I motored down to Canberra with the Trinick family for the spring show of blossoms for its streets are superbly planted. Mr. Trinick, curious about the feeling in Canberra, said to an attendant in one of the shops: - \"We tourists enjoy Canberra immensely but I suppose you folks who have to live down here feel differently,\" and he suggested that it wasn't even generally known who was the designer. The young man answered with some warmth:- \"We like it down here very much andeveryone here knows that Mr. Griffin designed Canberra and they feel that through that great conception of his the soul of Australia is being developed.\" Hall of Memory [Note: This illustration is not listed in the table of contents of the Art Institute of Chicago's copy.

AT THE CAPITAL - UNSUNG NATAL DAY Amongst all the worries of war and the lingering thrills of Mother's Day a notable anniversary passed last Sunday unhonoured and unsung. It was the 16th anniversary of the opening of Parliament House,Canberra, by the Duke of York, now King George VI. It was also the 42nd anniversary of the opening of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia by a former Duke of York who afterwards graced the throne as King George V (father of the present King). Surely it was a day of great memories. Monday May 9th 1927, \"a day of perfect Australian sunshine\" at the new Federal Capital (see Argus report May 5, 1927) lives in memory among all who are left of the 20,000 or 30,000 people who werethere on that historic occasion, as a day of great splendour and dignity and excitement to say nothing of the noise. You will remember (if you were there) the strange setting for the unique event - the new white House of Parliament away out in the open country, gleaming in the sunshine; other white buildings (including two blocks of administrative offices) at odd places in the wide open spaces round about, some of them still in the making; numbers of marquees and tents scattered about the locality too; the newroads, winding about the landscape, shadeless and bare but for the lines of tree seedlings on either side; piles of building material here and there, and other signs of a new city coming into being. You will remember too the great crowd of expectant visitors and the hundreds of motor cars that carried them there from Sydney, from Melbourne, from Brisbane, Adelaide, Goulburn, Wagga Wagga, and no one knows how many other places. ....... GROWN TO FLAPPERDOM - In contrast to the strange, almost drab scene presented by the Federal Capital 16 years ago, Canberra today in a city of exquisite beauty. The seedlings of 16 years ago are fine trees, and there are not only many thousands of trees, there are [Note: ==== Beginning of page 443 (N-YHS table of contents) ====] Page 447 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoCANBERRA .

The New-York Historical Society's copy does contain this illustration, located at this point in the text.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 444 ====] thousands of varieties. As cities are proclaimed according to population and rating values - or whatever value might be taken into account under local government acts in the distinguishing between towns and cities - Canberra might not be regarded as a city at all. It has only about 2,500 houses, and not a great number of other buildings, and the population of the whole capital territory is little more than 12,000. Yet is not a mere town. It is more like a town than a city. It is a Town Planner's dream come true; anenduring testimonial to the genius of the late Walter Burley Griffin, the Chicago architect who won the Commonwealth Government's prize for the design for the Federal Capital. It is a place of beautiful buildings, beautiful trees, and beautiful flowers, to say nothing about the inhabitants. There are no high buildings, nor ugly buildings, nor slums; no horrible street hordings [Note: hoarding, i.e., temporary board fence around a construction site?], no unsightly fences. Instead of the customary picket fences infront of houses in the residential areas there are low hedges, and these are trimmed and kept in uniform order by the Department of the Interior. Almost every street has a central plantation, and there are plenty of public parks and gardens. Through the trees in many places are to be seen beautiful views of the distant hills and mountain ranges. Beautiful Canberra.

A PHOTOGRAPH OF LIGHTThe smashing of the so called atom has shown that there is no such thing as an atom. When substance is smashed nothing remains but forces - 1 . warmth . 2 . light . 3 . sound 4 . magnetism.20th century science shows that warmth ether manifests in spheres (expanding); light ether manifests in triangles, traveling, see photograph - The diagram shows how it can diverge from the straight line. These two are centrifugal forces. LET THERE BE LIGHT & DIAGRAM [Note: The diagram appears to the right of the paragraph above.] Sound ether manifests in crescent form, liquid, and life ether in rectangles forming solidity, crystals. Snow crystals are a show put on by the fairies - that hexagonal form which cannot make solids. Only in the solid form does life as we know it manifest itself.These two are centripetal forces [Note: This sentence is handwritten.] The high flights are proving that the sequence in the earth realm is from solidity through liquidity (the moist atmosphere which is dark and cold) to gaseous in which is light and are even beginning to experience the warmth which lies beyond the light realm.

His name is all but forgotten although his prize winning solution of a plan for the capital city at Canberra, Australia, in 1913 opened the doors to the new world of Regional City Planning with a project which will not soon be surpassed. One hundred and thirty of the most famous architects from allnations competed. Only Griffin and [Note: Eliel] Saarinen offered a program for a living city - all the rest were dead patterns - graphic designs of fabulous unrealities. I could write at length on this man and his work. He died in India in 1938 [Note: 1937] while directing an All India Exposition in Lucknow, the capital of the great province of Agra and Oudh concerning which not a line was published in any of our Architectural Journals. But I will leave this subject with a bit of grim humor. Of the one hundredand thirty competitors for the Canberra City Plan only Griffin, Saarinen and dear Albert Kelsey [Note: 1870?-1950] of Philadelphia were alert enough to find the significant issues in the program data supplied to all, and one hundred and twenty-seven of these cities, had they been built, would have been inundated under fifteen feet of water every fall! The new aristocracy in architecture are much taken up just now with what is called the international style. They have failed to learn that when anything can be identified as \"style\" it is already dead. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 4 (table of contents) ====] MARY OF CASTLECRAG [Note: ==== Beginning of page 5 ====] PREFACEMARY OF CASTLECRAG THE PINNACLE The Pinnacle was the only building on Castlecrag when we bought the property - three promontories of Middle Harbor. It certainly was strategically located. The lower story, a garage and one room, was built of the local sandstone which again was correct. A narrow stairway led to the attic space from the rear ofwhich a door and a short flight of exterior steps led out onto that spectacular terrace from which you could survey two thirds of the surrounding horizon and the great stretches up and down Middle Harbor and out through the Sydney Heads to the Pacific Ocean. We named it The Pinnacle. Its age is unknown but under loving hands it became not only livable but charming and even elegant in an antique way. Roofing it with concrete tile was revolutionary in Sydneywhose enchanting bluffs had lost their beauty under the plague of red roofs and red brick walls that had crept like a skin disease over all Sydney's promontories. Moreover it became watertight which can't be said of the houses roofed with the Marseilles tile universal over there where the nature of the storms makes it entirely unpractical.

[Note: ==== Beginning of page 8 ====] [Note: Continued from page 5?] The inexpensive concrete Knitlock tiles were used on the gabled roofs, the garage was transformed into a great kitchen-dining room and the narrow room to the east became bedroom, and the studio roomupstairs a sumptuous living room. All this happened by degrees. But it was occupied during the very early days by a brilliant English journalist and her daughter who from her babyhood took over the charge of Castlecrag as well as her mother. The story of Mary of Castlecrag is a wonderful story in itself for she was an outdoor child and wandered over and continually looked out for the interests of Castlecrag, safeguarding the flowers, reporting fires - she was the spirit of the place as if she wereincarnated to watch and guard it, knowing every inlet and crag and flower, as well as tending to her mother's needs for her mother was mostly in town, interviewing, writing and so on.

Among them are the Callistemons and Banksias. This is a Banksia Marginata decorating the edge of a precipice like a grand cap on the top of a majestic column. Like so many of the tropic seas, if not all of them, the water is a vivid blue like azurite or other precious stones. The blossoms of the Banksias stand erect on the stems and, after the blossom time has passed, form a hard wooden cylinder sometimes 8 or 10 inches high. We used such a bush on one of our interior blockreserves, the Ericifolia, for our Christmas tree in our out-door Christmas celebrations in Castlecrag for in the antipodes the Christmas is in the summertime. Picturesque as the dwarf Japanese pines, they droop not at all nor show any signs of being any the worse for the sometimes long dry spells but merely suspend growth till the rain comes and then boom ahead to make up for lost time. Nor do they resort to needle leaves to accomplish this but spread theirrich greens in every form of leaf known to deciduous plants. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 11 ====] No. 1a . BANKSIA ON THE SEACOAST [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.] THE SUMMARY [Note: \"OR PREFACE\" crossed out] - THE UNIT HOUSE COMPETITION & MOST ECONOMICAL CONSTRUCTION A dwelling is the most important unit in a human community. It is the most complicated problem, the one most difficult to solve in the profession of architecture. The range of its possibilities is endless. Other buildings are but incidents in the mass of dwellings. In this unit (Page 15) we present a solution. It is like a life cell in a living body. In a way the health of the community rests on the perfection of the single cell as it does in the body. We ourselves have put this cell to the test. In no point did it fail us - minimum of care, complete beauty, intimate connection with the garden, hospitable beyond the normal. This is one of those surprising forms that give unbelievable results. It meets the requirements of the three problems and suggests a fourth for a perfect finish with a 4 foot unit. With a 3'-6\" unit it meets the competition requirements a little more amply since all four units come within the 1700 square feet limit giving a completely enclosed inner court. The colonnaded cloister feature could be added later. The children could build it. In fact if the knitlock tiles were used the family could build the entire fourth unit.

The smaller exterior with the chimney seat on the roof shows how the whole roof can be utilized for open terrace or veranda. As we used it, it became an important part of stage settings as for the last scenes of Goethe's Faust, Part II, and the angel choruses.

They form the structural supports, and service pipes are invisible within their hollow spaces. With proper designing it has the elegance of stone or marble for a fraction of the cost.

Curtains hung from a rod at doorhead height around the interior square screening any or all parts. We never did cut off the fireplace alcove nor the one opposite it. Usually the curtain was pushed to shut off the corners leaving the living room (witha round table in the center) 13' square plus the fireplace alcove and the three major alcoves. The one opposite the fireplace held the piano and a library table. The other two held couches (bed springs) one single the other double and very comfortable divans they were. We had innumerable big cushions. One corner is the kitchen, one the bath room, one the dressing room, one the library (or entrance as we used it - or nursery as it could be used). The time came when we had to leave the city. We had thought we would never sell it but it became impossible for us to use it so we offered it for sale. It was sold the next day. After the owners had been there a couple of years they had to move across the continent. They offered it for sale and it was sold the next day.

And what a Frenchy touch, holding onto its scarlet berriesstill after next year's lavender flowers have burst out of their great pod. What a shock, and how one is inclined to believe everything Europeans say about Americans, when we learn that in Florida artificial Palm trees are rapidly taking the place of real ones. To one who has seen the spiritual forces that bathe growing things, varying in color with the seasons, it must indeed seem the worshipping of brazen images instead of deity. This exquisite New South Wales palm has a silver gray trunk ringed from the annual fall of its leaves. And its red berried fruit holds over in great bunches till the purple tasseled blossoms of the next season have come and are in full show. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 23 ====] INITIAL . ILLAWARRA PALM [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.] CONTINENTAL PRESERVATION - Walter Burley Griffin WHAT IS TOWN PLANNING is a reasonable question because it concerns a subject for science or literature that is of recent origin. It is of our own lifetime. 40 YEARS AGO NO SUCH THING - In 1897 after five years of experimenting in the design of cities and formulating certain principles therefrom, I searched the library of my university as well as the threemetropolitan libraries in Illinois for comparisons and found only some German contributions of which I had read the English and French periodical abstracts. INAPT DESIGNATIONS - However we have had time now to find out that Town Planning is not precisely Town Planning. TOWN PLANNING - For firstly:- Towns, in the local sense, are generally piecemeal affairs, not entities either in area nor functions. CITY PLANNING - City planning suits better in America where Municipal organizations are single entities and embrace up to a hundred square miles. REGIONAL - But even in America, in this age of rapid transit, Nation, State and Regional planning has to come into vogue. TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING - In New South Wales, a Town and Country Planning Institute has recently been established. NOT HARD AND FAST - And secondly:- That is only one side of the difficulty. Town Planning as a Page 466 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoterm includes everything in the Town, whereas everything is by no means capable of being planned. This has resulted in making of it often a catch phrase and catch-all for establishing some authority over everyone and everything in the community which, in a democracy, must work as more limitation andrestriction on individual initiative. AN IMAGINATIVE FACULTY - ABILITIES ORGANIZATION - Here then is a fatal contradiction, for planning is possible only to an imagination, and imagination is a function of the individual. Of course, only as far as that particular individuality has comprehended all the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 24 (table of contents) ====] CASTLECRAG'S 3 PROMONTORIES will be a MUNICIPALITY [Note: ==== Beginning of page 25 ====] elements entering into a planning problem will the plan be effective. But there are no laws for planning, only human faculties that are derived from knowledge and experience after that knowledge and experience have become absorbed into a complex of human capacities which defy analysis and fromwhich they cannot be abstracted by any intellectual analysis, nor organized into any codes of law. In other words, a plan must be a work of art and works of art cannot be effected by Boards or Bureaucracies. LAWS OF PLANNING - The laws of planning can be derived only from all the finished plans and are always being varied as fresh plans are always being created. If all Towns, Cities, Regions andContinents even are filled with ever changing planners for all their activities and developments, what scope is there then for general planning? FUNDAMENTAL UNITY - Only for that planning which places first things first in the order of their determinability; and this planning will be effective in proportion as its imaginative picture represents a possible unity and as that unity appeals to the people whose creative activities are to co-operate inobtaining and extending it. This is why the scope of effort has so continuously widened. LAND PLANNING - Except where the unique power of single control for use makes possible the complete realization of the landscape and building development within a brief period, Land Planning would be a sufficiently comprehensive term to cover the possibilities - the best use of the land. COUNTENANCE OF THE EARTH BEING - Land however is not just space in two dimensions corresponding to a section on the map but whatever be its state of nature or of human occupation, it is a feature of the countenance of that perfected living-being - the Earth. NATURE'S WORKING - Land planning or site arrangement is therefore concerned in understanding the features and processes of the Earth itself, the relationships of the configuration, the vegetation, the Page 467 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 26 ====] rocks, the soils, the waters, the very winds; and conservation to the maximum of their effectiveness and their irreplaceable perfection and beauty. MAN'S INCIDENCE - Man too is a part of the Earth and there is always room enough for the preservation of the significant results of his strivings where these have expressed either general cultural growth or successful individual achievement. HISTORICAL INCENTIVES - These were the greatest of incentives to continued effort and unique expression of successive times each of which is a different but by no means necessarily a better sort. Inthis regard the old world has a great advantage, and to wherever it has most respected the remnants of the earlier periods of civilization, the man of the newer countries has to make pilgrimages. FIRST AUSTRALIAN BUILDINGS - A much needed lesson in humility in the face of the ostentation, arrogance and individual assertiveness, the very opposite of individual creativeness , shown in most of the buildings of a century, that hundreds of earnest leaders of thought in Sydney today should be exercising themselves to prevent the Government from demolishing such a primitive, even \"barracks\" structure as that of Governor [Note: Lachlan] Macquarie's on the east side of Queen's Square. That lesson will probably not be learned now whether or no this building is saved but it is to be hoped that this outstanding object lesson of the value of sincerity and restraint will be allowed to go on working at least until the community is taught. (The futility of all such attempts is because of the lack of an AbilitiesOrganization consisting of the total citizenry as does the political.) NEW ENGLAND 3 YEARS AGO, 3 CENTURIES AGO, CAPE COD - In 1932 I visited the first settlements of New England to find the original primitive bare wooden Puritanic simplicity so highly prized that no millionaire has dared or would dare to desecrate what has become the most fashionable summer resort of the Atlantic Coast with an intrusion of a different or more [Note: ==== Beginning of page 27 (table of contents) ====] CASTLECOVE . 3rd PROMONTORY DETAIL .

Residential allotments enclosing park reserves all connected by park paths perpetuating for all time the entrancing walks throughout the whole of the three promontories.

[Note: This \"caption\" is not in the New-York Historical Society's copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 29 ====] [Note: Continued from page 26]elaborate architectural character. What a contrast with the corresponding Newport of the last century, the exhibition of rivalry in ostentation that ended in the destruction of all attraction. BOSTON, BEACON HILL MASSACHUSETTS - Beacon Hill in Boston, because of the genuine simplicity of the 18th century homes, is the only fashionable area in any modern city that has not ended in the phenomenon of the \"blighted zone\" degenerated through cheap and disreputable habitation tofactories and workhouses. OUR NATURAL HERITAGE - Because we have so little of historical mementoes left, our land planning must stress their preservation, but it is because we have so much, such great wealth of natural beauty here in Sydney that our land planning is the most urgent necessity. Our natural attraction is not a matter of \"beauty spots\" but of a general character that is unique among great cities of the worldembracing as it does, right at our doors, a combination of all the famous Azure Coasts, Mountain Lakes, Clean Evergreen Forests and rich and delicate flora, with a perennial salubrious climate, and this applies to the coasts to the North including Port Stephens though at that point we have a sealevel entrance to the interior of the continent. DISCRIMINATION IN USE - Of course it is not planning that preserves these advantages, for planning is after all only arrangement, but it is only through forethought in the arrangement of our operations that best use and maximum conservation of our resources are rendered possible. PESSIMISTIC IMPOTENCE - Most of the destruction and wasteful use is unconscious or arises through lack of belief in, or comprehension of, any better alternative practicable for any single perpetrator. SCENIC \"ACCESS\" WARRINGAH [Note: beachside suburb of Sydney] AS HAPPENED IN HUBBARD WOODS - Thus we have just now the spectacle of a road under construction to make more accessible one of our loveliest peninsulas, whose sole value is scenic beauty, desecrating the first palm valley traversed (beyond the twenty miles previously [Note: ==== Beginning of page 30 ====] despoiled of all attractiveness) with a ballast quarry and dump whereas the identical road material was attainable in a secluded quarry in the already despoiliated area - Balgowlah. SEAFORTH - THE DEVASTATION WROUGHT BY POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS Page 469 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoFUNCTIONING OUTSIDE THEIR REALM - Then look at Seaforth, Middle Harbor, where the shire Council has for several years been constructing as relief work a \"Scenic Drive\" at the cost of their chief scenic feature traversed, the unique bluff now disfigured by the huge ugly rock excavation, an openwound across it that will not heal and which has destroyed much of its charm forever. These so-called scenic roads are without plan because a plan implies a comprehensive purpose and not the defeat of the purpose through the means employed. For instance, one way traffic routes would have accomplished at once the access to the scenery and saved the scenery itself though it would not have employed so much relief labor which was the immediate expedient that irreparably defiled the last vestige that is left ofSydney's first PRIDE - the Harbor of unsurpassed beauty. GOLF COURSES - Likewise we have Golf Courses denuding the remnants saved as reserves of ourHarbor front at Mosman and Northbridge in which latter case the twenty-two thousands of pounds already spent would have purchased and completely developed suitable lands with several golf courses, instead of one as here, on sites less valuable as marine bluffs, reminders of what the whole of theHarbor was like in its prime before it became our shame . OIL TANKS - Again at Chowder Bay, the Commonwealth Government is just now contributing hugeoil tanks to the amenity of the park and residential section of the Mosman Promontory hitherto least devastated. MERE INSTANCES - These instances are cited not because they are unique but because they are not unique. All these violations of the principle of conservation of priceless values are happening at this [Note: ==== Beginning of page 31 ====] very moment in one locality but they are very like those that have been happening all over a continent during a century and will continue to happen so long as there is no consciousness of their avoidability. And not only in one but in all continents under the control of Western peoples all of whom are organized in totalitarian states - with but one community organization . HARBOR BIFURCATION - If the Harbor Bridge is accountable for this last sort of thing thus forcingmaritime industry over the foreparts of the harbor, then that fact should have been taken into account in determining upon the bridge transport which is obviously not the outcome of calculated land planning forethought if it industrializes the North Shore which it was generally thought to make accessible as a retreat from industrialization. TRANSPORT TAXATION - If moreover the Railway and Tramway Departmental Policy, on which it purported to be financed, had been a matter of Land Planning would it have deliberately so differentiated values as to force flats into all the stations of the North Shore line and to resuscitate the dismal semi-detached houses in rows along the tram routes? Transport taxation should be determined by the Abilities Realm and executed in the Economic Realm. WALLED TOWN CONDITIONS - RESULT OF POLITICAL CONTROL - For such is the consequence that was pointed out by Town Planners twenty years ago and which is now materializing because of the degradation of bus services and impositions on all competitive transport to the Page 470 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagodiscomfiture of many residents and of all those hopeful of a growing home-loving civilization here in Australia. CHAOS GOVERNS GOVERNMENT - THE MESS RESULTING FROM REQUIRING ONE ORGAN TO DO THREE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS - All matters sited [Note: cited?] have been the palpable perpetrations of our delegated authorities, the governments, in one shape or another; hence the issue of Land Planning does not involve the setting up of any greater degree of governmental authority over the people but rather of establishing for the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 32 ====] various branches of governmental administration, a relationship to the standpoint of the trained and experienced Town Planner, so called. This can be accomplished through the building up of a National Ability Organization. ORDER PROMISED - The State Government has now promised Town and Country legislation and, as no party issues are involved, all political elements can work together in forming an instrument. CENTER OF CONSCIOUSNESS PROPERLY THE FUNCTION OF THE ABILITIES ORGANIZATION - First of all, to focus the interest of the established authorities onto the comprehensive point of view necessary for LAND PLANNING in the activities of most of thedepartments and all the Municipalities and Shires. SCOPE FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE - Secondly to provide legal powers for private initiative to plan for single, joint or voluntary group or district development unfettered by the arbitrary regulations and impositions which prevent the carrying out of such plans at present. RIGIDITY OF STANDARDS INEVITABLE IN A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION FUNCTIONING IN OTHER THAN THE REALM OF EQUITY - All regulations have come out of experience of certain plans and, because the devising of land plans has been acknowledged for such a short period and is constantly bringing in so many changes, the regulations certainly serve to perpetuatebad features of out-dated experience. INSTANCES - Roadways suitable for the contours of a cliff-side topography are outlawed whereas impossible roads up and down are sanctioned through these arbitrary standards. Likewise the orientation of houses to best utilize the sites for sunlight and outlook is thwarted by irrelevant clauses. ADAPTABILITY THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF TOTALITARIANISM - Regulations preclude individual thought or judgment on the part of the administrators as well as all others and excuse the retention of untrained inexperienced officers where the highest kind of foresight, insight and courage are needed to protect the right of the future. Land Planning will not assure [Note: ==== Beginning of page 33 (table of contents) ====] Page 471 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright of ChicagoTERRACE DWELLING .

[Note: ==== Beginning of page 35 ====] [Note: Continued from page 32] proper development but will permit it. DEVELOPMENT PLANS IN DUE TIME - Development of living, growing communities must generally be planned contemporaneously and for those who stand the cost but all these plans are either conscious or unconscious of a comprehensive plan for the fitting utilization of the lands of which they comprise only a part. With no consciousness there ensues the chaos and conflict that we have. CONSIDERATION VERSUS EXPEDIENCY - With such a consciousness, which presumably will have to have a trained sympathetic spokesman, there can evolve that degree of consideration for time andplace beyond the immediate needed actions in which only the expedient has had rein hitherto. ACCOMMODATION POSSIBILITIES - The physical objectives of town planning are not new despite the fact that they are very seldom realized due to such deterrents as already instanced. POLARITY FRATERNITY ECONOMIC (1) - For all areas, it is important to realize that General Accommodation,the realm of the principle of Fraternity, rests on the foundation of two groups of fundamental opposites. EQUALITY POLITICAL (2) - Communication depends upon the political principle of the equality of all men - equity. LIBERTY ABILITIES (3) - Occupation depends upon the cultural principle of freedom of the individual for creative effort. Page 472 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoMAIN WAYS - Again communication may be for facilitating general circulation with direct simple easy continuous routes. BRANCH WAYS - Or for discriminating distribution by means of circuitous or complex discontinuous systems. PUBLICITY - Likewise Occupation may be;- (a) for general service of easiest possible accessibility to everybody, or PRIVACY - (b) for special vocations, avocations or domestic neighborhoods all of distinctive character to meet the choice of their particular occupants. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 36 (table of contents) ====] INCINERATOR IN THE OLD QUARRY OF COVECRAG [Note: Structure is the Woollahra Incinerator.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 37 ====] The old Quarry becomes a pool in a park. The incinerator has no unpleasant qualities so the building housing it can become monumentally attractive. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 38 ====] CANBERRA ANOMALIES - These distinctions allow me to explain for the hundredth time a popular misconception of the Canberra plan due to the facts that confused distributive roads were executed in advance of their counterbalancing system and also that the first business was forced arbitrarily to occupy a district deliberately side-tracked in the plan for the purpose of residential seclusion. EXTREME SEGREGATION - The possibility of planning for differential use can be studied now in actual communities where the pedestrians follow separate routes from the motorists, and the houses connect with the schools through parks and playgrounds rather than through the streets, thus contacting neither business nor traffic. CONSERVATION CASTLECRAG - Castlecrag is planned for mutually exclusive vehicle and pedestrian ways but its primary motive is the conservation of the pristine loveliness of several miles of rock-bound woodland covers of Middle Harbor in such wise that it will be safeguarded, in the measure necessary, by hundreds of appreciative owners and interested rangers for all the future, which has not been found possible for any of the reserves under general public authorities to say nothing of the unrestricted private occupancy which has so completely destroyed the inherent character of the rest ofthis landscape that once was one of the world's rare treasures. Page 473 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoSOCIAL EXPRESSION - There are sociological corollaries, particularly to domestic land planning, which have been evidenced for ten years even in this small nucleus of a community. The greatest social defect of modern metropolitan life is in the obliteration of the individual in the unorganized mass. Immediately surrounding Castlecrag are no less than three thousand inhabitants in a square mile in which there is neither church nor hall, school nor club nor lodge nor social consciousness of any sort, yet in contrast here within this group of but a score or more homes there have been continuously living literary, sociological, dramatic, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 39 ====] philosophic, musical, folk dancing or ballet, as well as social groups, tennis and golf clubs and kindergartens, all independently recruited and carried on independently giving scope to individual expression and activity other than as mere witness. FIRST SCENIC THEATRE - Such things as the Haven Scenic Theatre of which you have heard, whose plays on the natural rocks amidst the trees and flowers of the Cranny Cove have been given each of the four seasons of the past years, seem not to have been possible except in such an atmosphere ofconscious plan. Yet all the wonderful facilities have existed from the beginning all over Sydney and have been allowed to go to destruction beyond recall, one by one, without a sign or a protest. COVENANT HOUSING - An essential part of harmonious development in these eclectic days is the protective building covenant whose function cannot be compassed with any lesser power than ownership, delegated. UNOBTRUSIVENESS - This is particularly the case where the conservation of a primeval nature in occupation is to be insured. That involves the prevention of obstructive or obtrusive erections. With those hundreds who realize the necessity for and understand the effectiveness of these precautions in firmly establishing an unique attractiveness and who have joined in this undertaking there is no question of the ultimate outcome. VALUE OF RESULT - Any who are in doubt can study the results already obtained in comparison with the current practice on all grounds economic, social or aesthetic, to find the justification for the expectation. LAND PLANNING - When there is a general acknowledgement of the patent fact that effective Land Planning is possible, such efforts will find support on all sides. THREEFOLD COMMONWEALTH - These things can be obtained generally in our communities only by the threefold organization of our communities the entire separation of the Abilities organization and the Economic organization from the Political organization, each manned by the total citizenry.

EUCALYPTUS FICIFOLIA [Note: ==== Beginning of page 41 ====] CAPTION EUCALYPTUS FICIFOLIAThe brilliant henna colored blossoms of the Eucalyptus Ficifolia almost bury the foliage of the whole tree. In West Australia the gums run a race with all the other trees and shrubs. They are like Shakespeare's Bottom, they want to be the lion too. They deck themselves out in blossoms now this color, now that, some pink come yellow, they will not be outdone, and the Ficifolia comes out sometimes one shade of red, sometimes another but mostly an indescribable rich henna - a brilliantorange toned red. I can't find a word to describe it. No wonder my husband and I quarrel over the naming of colors. No words fit. In Western Australia blossom time is a riot and the usual white flowers of the Gum Trees turn to every color of the rainbow and many shades that no respectable rainbow ever indulged in. Stately avenue trees too so that the whole streets can be planted to the unbelievable henna flames, or pink or yellow. Notblue. There are Blue Gums but it is the exquisite blue of their young leaves that gives them their name, not the blossoms. Think of the slopes of the Rocky Mountains planted to masses of this color, not too far above frost lines! \"Well why not?

It is 900 miles to St. Paul [Note: Minnesota]; 900 miles to Omaha [Note: Nebraska]; 650 miles to Denver [Note: Colorado]; 225 miles Butte, Helena and Great Falls, Montana; 600 miles to Spokane [Note: Washington] and a 1,000 to Seattle [Note: Washington]from Mossmain. Nature and not man fixed the immutable advantages of this spot. Situated at the entrance to the Clark Fort Valley, embracing the largest and most productive section in natural resources of Montana, it stands a distinctive opportunity. Page 475 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe building of towns in Territorial days was wholly a realm of speculation, of land speculation. Their location was fixed by the trail blazing railway engineers on the level ground at certain intervals. The townsite of Billings [Note: Montana] was laid out in accordance with this policy. But when the countrysettled up and the traffic increased, the Northern Pacific Railway from the standpoint of convenience and economy was forced to move its round house and shops to a point 14 miles West and there establish division terminal facilities. In recent years, James J. Hill, in building the Great Northern Railroad south from Great Falls to a connection with the Burlington system, the control of which he had acquired was forced by thetopography of the country to establish the southern terminus of his line at the point chosen for the city of Mossmain. \"Work is not and was not meant to be the whole of life . The leisure problem equals in importance the labor problem and surpasses it is difficulty. While the cities have grown to unwieldy [Note: ==== Beginning of page 43 ====] proportions, creating great wealth that the few might find leisure for the enjoyment of club life, travel and other diversions, the social conditions of the community have been given little thought, and the social needs of the citizenry as a whole have been entirely neglected. A city is first of all a business enterprise with certain well defined assets, such as its location in regard to trade, its manufacturing possibilities, the natural resources surrounding it, its climate and its desirability as a place in which to live. Shall all these valuable assets be left to the exploitation of the speculator, orshall they be utilized for the benefit of the people who live in the town? We of America have not made a great success of our city building. A town or city can and should be built like any other business enterprise, after a definite plan and with a definite purpose. The man who should build a business block without first securing place and specifications from a competent architect, and without having the site surveyed to ascertain the exact line of his property and the established gradeof the street would be regarded as a fit subject for an asylum. \"Every home with a garden setting.\" Yellowstone Garden City Holding Corporation. This corporation has been formed and is incorporated under the laws of the State of Montana, for the purpose of taking over and developing by altogether new colonization methods, Five Thousand (5,000)acres of irrigated land situated at and adjacent to the junction of the Great Northern and North Pacific Railways near the town of Laurel, Yellowstone County, Montana; and for the further purpose of laying out and building a city or trade center thereat, consonant with the plans prepared by Walter Burley Griffin, architect of Chicago, and now building on virgin ground the new capital City of the Commonwealth of Australia. Page 476 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 44 (table of contents) ====] LOCATION MAP OF MOSSMAIN [Note: ==== Beginning of page 45 ====] For these purposes the Corporation has secured land abutting on the main line tracks and sidings at the junction of the two great transcontinental railroads. The plans provide for suitable terminal warehouse facilities, stock yards, packing house, cold storage and creamery plant, water works, gas works, electric light and power plant, municipal theatre and club houses, administration and store buildings and such other conveniences and essentials of a modern city as shall be essential from time to time. In the furtherance of the objects and aims of the Corporation, the following Declaration of Principles has been adopted as portraying, in brief, the basic or fundamental tenets on which the undertaking is predicated:- 1. To stimulate and make profitable intensive farming and to bring it within the reach of people of small means by co-operative effort and the creation of a market at the farmer's door. 2. To relieve the tedium of agricultural life by providing the tiller of the soil with some of the essential conveniences of the city dweller. 3. To relieve the nerve tension of city life by placing within the reach and enjoyment of every worker and dweller therein some of the attendant delight of the country - every home with a garden setting. 4. To provide sanitary conditions that may be enjoyed by all - a benefit to poor and rich alike. 5. To safeguard the amenities and unearned increment so that every inhabitant, rural and urban, shall share in the ultimate social and financial benefits. First - To have as a nucleus for succeeding construction activities a comprehensive city plan, which shall embody every modern requirement known to science and art for the happiness and well being of the residents thereof and which shall give then beauty of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 46 (table of contents) ====] LIBERTY HALL . SINGLE TAX CLUB HOUSE . MELBOURNE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 47 ====] Melbourne was planned not correctly but on too grand a scale so that what were intended as alleys in the original plan have become minor streets.

It was remodeled to Griffin's design. [Note: The word \"Caption\" is at the top of the page in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 48 ====] [Note: Continued from page 45] surroundings not possible to obtain in any other way; every modern convenience for the economical transaction of business and the handling of merchandise, raw material and agricultural products; and which shall provide for a civic center, parks, playgrounds and open spaces and all other requisites for their enjoyment. Second - To reverse the usual city building methods which have to do with town lot speculation schemes, and to substitute therefore the more modern plan which provides for a long term lease of the lands for both agricultural and business purposes. Third - To subdivide the agricultural land surrounding the townsite into small tracts and by means of co-operative selling plans provide a market at remunerative prices for all products raised. Fourth - To establish a district Agricultural School similar to those operating in Belgium, Holland and Denmark and through which the farm life of those countries has been regenerated by making the small truck farm profitable. To Mr. Preston B. Moss more perhaps than to any other man is due the growth of the city of Billings and the marvelous development of the surrounding country. He was convinced that some better methodthan buying land and reselling it would have to be adopted if actual settlers were to be protected. Mr. Moss secured a site that meets admirably every requirement and need of commerce and trade and ideal social amenities; and in Walter Burley Griffin he found the man of the hour in modern city development. Mr. Griffin after making a personal inspection of the site gave it his unqualified and enthusiastic approval, and undertook the preparation of the plans. Mr. Griffin inspected the site on his return tripfrom Australia where he had just closed a contract with the Federal Government to superintend the construction of the capital city Canberra.

All these things require intelligence though the blind materialists of today are all like Topsy who thought she just growed without any father and mother. The fig foliage is a solid mass. It lets no atmospheric moisture pass it by but makes use of it all. That is where the Undines are at work. In the waterfalls is where they play. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 53 ====] ARCHITECTURE IN ANOTHER 50 YEARS Walter Burley Griffin One would not rashly venture upon prophesy of startling developments in 50 years in the matter of a record line such as architecture if he were to be guided by the relics of this art and the all butgeologically slow transformations distinguishable within the period of any given people or civilization. Nevertheless because architecture is, in a most subtle and accurate way, a reflex of life the prophet may find better grounds for interesting speculation in the thoughts and tenets of his time though he may detect only germinal ideas just seeming to extend tentative rootlets. When as a boy I consulted Herbert Spencer's philosophy for enlightenment and found architecture considered virtually an ecclesiastical appendage, the notion seemed a preposterous limitation and I feel Page 479 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosure that my reaction represents the typical modern attitude toward this art. Just so. But after studying the buildings and noting with astonishment the absence of creative architecture in the western world for half a millennium, in fact since medieval times, the force of Spencer's observation became striking if notconclusive. Moreover in the face of the worldwide testimony of the stones that the religious structures have been the only ones to make lasting contributions to the art of architecture it is meet to give pause as to what architecture is when considered a live, growing thing, not a grave yard. Buildings can tell the story of dead architecture as well as live architecture and we have ample record in the Roman Empire of at least one age before ours where the minds were possibly too much directedtoward superficial ease and comfort to find opportunity for much exercise of the imagination which is undoubtedly the most real satisfaction obtainable from life . When we first reflect upon our own times we may well be flattered to recognize, in the mirror, the Scientific Age. Then our characteristic physiognomy in our buildings constitutes a scientific architecture and that is about the best we can say for it so far. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 54 (table of contents) ====] THEATRE BUILDING . MELBOURNE [Note: The structure is sometimes called Capitol House as well as Capitol Theatre.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 55 ====] We do find economic structural triumphs in vast tunnels and bridges and skyscraping towers and mechanical utensils marvelous beyond all precedents. But these achievements seem to be of short vogue and constantly going out of fashion before something still more economical or \"scientific\" and, though an individual architectural designer, a Louis Sullivan, may now and then attain to considerable flights of creative art, such flights have commanded insufficient sympathy from the public, support from the business men or co-operation from professional colleaguesto bring about any general elevation of standards, which only amounts to another way of stating the case that Architecture is a reflection of the civilization or culture that it houses. This is so because in its broadest sense Architecture is the art not only for the man in the street but by the average man. It alone among the arts denies to \"genius,\" the exception, or the man ahead of his time, the very forces, the colors, the notes, the words with which to express himself or to blaze a path for the masses. The lattermust here painfully and gropingly tread out their own uncertain way. If the ideal of the current culture is personal economic security or, in the last analysis, economic rivalry then we must lack the concord that could express itself in an environment of harmonious forms. If moreover a given culture, in its profound cravings, is devoted to ferreting out practical relationships and working hypotheses among physical phenomena, then that culture cannot be expected to express itselfwith unbounded enthusiasm in the playthings of life, nor to have much concern with the subjective universal mind and the emotional satisfaction of the art and joy of living. Instead our one-eyed intellectual, objective attitude toward life has relegated art to a sort of learned cult with orders and Page 480 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoprecedents sanctioned by rules and regulations which, even when derived from ancient religious expression, do with very poor propriety constitute the authority for referees in a professional game of Architecture. But a practical business world only [Note: ==== Beginning of page 56 (table of contents) ====] INTERIOR OF THEATRE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 57 ====] The whole lighting of the theatre is indirect. The whole ceiling of the auditorium is stepped and illuminated in all colors from concealed lamps, in the highly ornamented steps of the ceiling, which are played like an angel orchestra before the play and at intermissions. [Note: The word \"Caption\" is at the top of the page in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 58 ====] [Note: Continued from page 55] in such wise, measurable and ponderable, can this art bespeak knowledge, \"science,\" as contrasted with a thing so \"irrational\" as instinctive feeling. Even our artisan cannot now acknowledge consciously the faith that is in him which makes him in spite of himself put on the extra touch, the effort toward perfection, for which he is not paid but which alone makes his labor tolerable or his product valuable. As a unit in the army of labor he must, however, prevent any possibility of tribute to the economic enemy. Again as related to the whole of our natural environment, conceived as warfare for survival, what other than extermination of nature could be the end of Man's work. So he has fought to the death the marvels of inorganic and organic creation until the upshot is or will be a quarried world of rank weeds and domestic pests on the one hand with a modicum on the other hand of useful but diseased degenerated plants and animals tamed and cowed. The architectural representation of this state of mind in our times isour cities all alike dirty, monotonous, disorderly and desolate. It will be admitted that the modern age has been useful and productive of the foundation, possibly, for a freer life in succeeding generations. The scope for imagination is a hundred fold greater than at any other time in history when a squad of men with mechanical equipment can perform feats of construction in a year that centuries of legions could not accomplish before. What a contrast with the actuality;- Unhappytimid people with their buildings (the monuments do not lie) a monotonous reiteration of the Page 481 of 923 Supplement to Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocommonplace, the lifeless and the ugly. As soon as we feel that we have attained to something that can be said to stand for general happiness or good fellowship, fraternity, co-operation, then we can look about us to discover that Architecture hasonce more arrived. Although we hardly feel justified now in casting our eyes about with a great degree of expectation yet future improvement comes only out of present dissatisfaction and we have some grounds for [Note: ==== Beginning of page 59 (typescript) / 58 (table of contents) ====] ENTRANCE PROMENADE TO AUDITORIUM & GALLERY CARPET DESIGNED BY W.B.G. .

[Note: The word \"Caption\" is at the top of the page in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 61 ====] [Note: Continued from page 58] suspicion of a generally dissatisfied and disillusioned state of mind. The people of today are uneasy, straining at their limitations whether they realize or not that these limitations are in the restricted direction of their mental activities. Signs of this state are in the hectic sources of recreation and mental relief so largely at present dependent on the external stimuli, spectacles, thrills, jolts, jars, jazz, joy-rides, wagers, \"flickers,\" cabarets, air and water stunts and speedways. All these aim at emotional satisfaction and so far as they serve to achieve enduring pleasure something of creative art will arise out of them but little is in evidence so far of such results. We can judge from ourindividual experiences how little better than intoxicants are the ever-multiplying diversions, and posterity will have ample proof of their futility in our discordant houses. Nevertheless, there is a certain spontaneity in these expedients and so much less hypocrisy than in the puritanical pretensions of only a few years back that I think our materialism has so far advanced as to be no longer comparable to a supernatural counterpart, another external agency, which has been proven in Page 482 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe end a futile evasion of the awful logical consequences to our human desires of the exorable external material automatism now being accepted for better or worse. Better or worse it must soon be, for a hectic state can only bring quick exhaustion. We may concede the interpretation that following the intellectual reversion at long last, some centuries ago, from credulous fear to courageous curiosity we are now at a corresponding psychological turning point from repression to a flaunting exploitation of the feelings, emotions. If the parallel can be maintained the working out of a new common idea will be even more rapid in the coming era than was the unexampled development of the scientific and practical ideal in the past three centuries, and it isinevitable that even half a century will mark definite progress because the factors contributing to development upward or downward are now brought before the whole world immediately [Note: ==== Beginning of page 62a (typescript) / 62 (table of contents) ====] ART GALLERY .

If the growth is already upward it will sprout fast, if not the point of exhaustion of all capacity for excitement through externals cannot be far off. Then, after passive simian curiosity has been satiated by science and the economic strain eased by practical expedients, when the physical senses are become callous to excitement, more men will have to turn their attention inward to the possibilities of co-operation between head and heart, to creative effort. The belief or philosophy which has failed to develop an organic communal life has been inconsistent or in conflict, fundamentally, with life. We have come to recognize an external natural order of things which we see, hear, touch, smell and taste and consider real. But, as such a world of isolated individual intellect supplied no place for such instinctive ideals or desires as beauty or justice, and if the supernatural or divine world once conceived by us to support those ideals has lost its reality, we are notfar removed from the condition of Rossum's Universal Robots. For the beginnings of a fresh life we have to go from the mass opinions to those of the few pioneers Page 483 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowho have, for about a century now, been exploring the complexities of the human mind and soul and the conditions for full-rounded healthy working. From these students a practical religion may be forthcoming compatible with modern objective science but taking into account, without the prop ofexternal agencies, our vaster subjective activities, desires and needs. Then again will the imagination and the creative powers of mankind be unbound and free for an Architecture as far transcendent of historical efforts as is our science of construction and our economic power.

The wattles run them a close second mounting up to some 400. In this eucalyptus diversicolor we have one of the tall fellows which sometimes shoot up a 180 feet before branching. Some of them are as tall as our sequoias in California which has been counted thetallest tree in the world. But they attain no such girth. For huge trunks we have to go to the native beech of Russell Falls, of Tasmania though not limited to this region. The foliage of this Beech is like our maiden hair fern, leaflets the size of your thumb nail with serrated edges, multiple pinnate. This combination of exquisiteness and majesty is breath-taking.

II - THE MUNICIPAL BATTLEBEGINNINGS With the exception of Canberra, the Federal Capital - Tuggeranong, the Arsenal City - Griffith, Capital of the Irrigation District, New South Wales - Leeton, an Irrigation Town - and Port Stephens city plans,Griffin's work brought him into contact with Municipal instead of Federal authorities. Again there was the perpetual fight against bureaucracy. To realize the deadly effect of urban life - all of it really slum life - we shall begin by sketching bits of life in the paradise which is nature, and swing on to recounting at least one man's effort to show that it is not inevitable nor necessary to impose on modern children the restrictions, the filth, the noise andmonotony, the prison life in fact, which characterizes our modern urban civilization bringing conflict and war to adult life. Foresight is requisite. Without it man is not human. He becomes not animal but beast. Foresight means planning. Planning must include a totality, from a continent to the tiniest unit, a single home in relation to its neighbors. Griffin's battle with Municipal autocrats illustrated in Pholiota (settled by favor and prestige) was continuous throughout his quarter of a century adventure in the Eastern Hemisphere. He and his wife began their adult life with the beginning of the 20th century, a century that has indulged in the most dreadful wars the world has ever known. These are the European peoples who in recent times have migrated to all parts of the world, destroying, always destroying. Let us see if in such a world we canfind constructors who point the way out. Both Mr. and Mrs. Griffin were fortunate in having been born in the fertile Mississippi Valley. Mother's notes give a glimpse of our early days. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 68 ====]Mother's notes - After the fire (the Chicago fire 8-10, 1871]) Jere [Note: Jeremiah Mahony, MMG's father] hired a vehicle to take me over the burnt district, for he felt it was a sight I ought not to miss. The desolate picture is as vivid today as then, and it seems as though fairies must have worked to efface every trace of such a desolate field of destruction. I only remember a woman carrying a pan of milk; and Asa Gage saying that after walking quite a distance down Wabash avenue he noticed he was carrying a potted plant. Page 485 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThere were many broken hearts and lost fortunes but the prevailing spirit was, \"We are alive and work will restore.\" Jere for a while wrote a daily column for the Herald; published a magazine for Mr. Barnes of New York; a school magazine for Chicago teachers; edited the Prairie Farmer; and was principal of aschool. A man on top of a bus pointed to Jere who was going over the bridge and said, \"There goes a man who can carry more work on his shoulders than any other man, with never a grumble and always a smile.\" He was a fearless writer and a poet. Christmas Eve - Clara Hamilton Mahony [Note: MMG's mother] The poetry, fun and beauty of our Christmas parties for 30 odd years is not in my power to do justice to. Anna Ickes said she would hurry to cross the continent if necessary to be on time for that evening, and her eldest son Wilmarth who had been a guest from babyhood to business man, even when by deaths and changes the royal old times were past, couldn't feel the old glamour was gone, would plead previous engagement to friends and his lady love when they pleaded for his presence. The only rule made was no presents , and friends kindly observed it. But let me try to describe the Xmas Eve party. The same families all those many years: - Mrs. Ella [Note: Flagg] Young, the 1st woman Superintendent ofChicago Schools, the Wilmarths, the Perkinses, the Mooneys, the Gilmores and ourselves. At first we used to sit at a table for twenty-seven. Our chicken pie was a big dish pan covered with a crust and filled with toys for the tiny ones. I shall [Note: Mary J. (Hawes) and Henry M. Wilmarth were the parents of Anna (Wilmarth) Ickes.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 69 ====]never forgot how little Eleanor kicked and clapped her hands when from a hole in the middle of the crust a jumping jack stuck his head out. The tree was always a beauty with its frost and tinsel, the room gay with lights, berries and evergreens and happy faces. For a few years several children of our eighth grade we would treat to ice-cream up stairs, then, at the proper moment, a [Note: Edward] Burne-Jones picture of juvenile loveliness, they would come marching down the stairs to Aunt Myra's music and standaround the piano singing Christmas carols (breathtaking, the music, for Mother's school was in Chicago's Bohemian district). Sometimes a charade or a little play by the children themselves but, on account of the little ones, an early start home. After guests were gone we hung up our stockings and put a big basket in front of the fireplace for overflows. Our friends were legion for Jere and myself were so long connected with the schools, and he also a writer for magazines and all the papers. One night he was walking with Mr. Hoyne. He said to him, \"Phil how did Howland get in? (as Superintendent of Chicago schools)?\" \"Oh I don't know, I guess it was the press.\" So when Jere reached home he said, \"Clara, what do you think I am?\" Answer - \"The press.\" Then [Note: he?] explained about his interview with Mr. Hoyne upon whose saying [Note: \"the press\" added in N-YHS copy] he had pulled out of his pocket a roll of newspaper clippings every oneof which Jere had written.

Thus the one story dining room is balanced. With the 2nd story windows, central between two heavy piers, grouped with a bit of relief ornamentation extending this central feature from the roof to the wide picturehead and the flowerbox sill treatment in the 1st story, the building becomes as elegant as any classic structure. These things call for the artist's inborn sensitiveness to form in three dimensions added to the mathematician's sense of structural economy. These combined qualities are essential to the architect as distinguished from the artist. [Note: This page is not in the New-York Historical Society copy.

A royal domain it was for us children. Since each human being has a guardian angel who watches over him through life and on through the periods between death and rebirth I am especially grateful to her andglad that my early childhood was spent so completely surrounded by beauty for only so can one in another incarnation himself be physically beautiful. We comprehended this when in India where everyone is surrounded by beauty for there they do not segregate the slums, and even the men are wonderfully beautiful, every type and so beautiful. The other Marion too, my Boston pal, had similar advantages. We are told that the reason why there are so many commonplace people today is because they are taught to read at too early an age, another consequence of which is premature sclerosis. One of the most interesting people of my acquaintance was this mate of mine at Boston Tech. Due to her frailty she had been given no teaching until she was twelve. Entering school then she rapidly put herself on even terms with the other children. At fourteen she passed with the children [Note: \"Boston Tech\" - The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was known as Boston Tech (near Copley Square) from 1865 to 1916, when the Institute was established in Cambridge.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 73 ====] of her age into High School the four years' work of which she completed in three years. At the same time, at her home by herself, she did the first year's work of the University and so entered the second year of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when she was seventeen. She was beautiful, brilliantand charming. Along the shore of the lake [Note: Lake Michigan] between Winnetka and Glencoe is the beginning of the ancient glacial moraine which has been cut by the Undines, the water fairies, into lovely ravines while the bluffs along the lake shore are still high and steep. There were four families who ruled the whole realm, nearly two miles from north to south, and which, west of the track, was occupied by asfew houses and, except for them, empty for the whole extent of two or three miles to the west - the great Skokie which was the head of the North branch of the Chicago river, whose waters should have been controlled but never drained off. What a thrilling and mysterious place this Skokie was of which one heard some dreadful tales! It was a great sea of grass dotted with islands, of trees, but no one could venture there for the surface of the ground had no foundation below it. Jerome once went out with a gunand sank to his shoulders and but for his gun would have been lost. With the support its spread gave him, he worked his way back to real land. Concerning human beings this Xanthippe child can remember no emotion except that of curiosity about grownups - a great wonder as to what they were thinking and doing, a wish she might be invisible and sit in a corner where she might find out what they were about only if they were unconscious of her; butOh! the thrills of all out-doors! Fortunately for these children there was an assistant in the family, a young Irish woman who enjoyed her work and loved to play. Katy [Note: Katie?] Tully took the children on adventure after adventure. In the early spring they went down in the ravine and brushed the snow away to gather the first hepaticas - white and pink and blue and lilac. And there under the snow Page 488 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The of Chicagothe winterberries were found, and sassafras [Note: ==== Beginning of page 74 ====] root and slippery elm bark. They scoured now this part of the woods and now that, as the seasons passed, to gather June berries and choke cherries and huckle berries, wild strawberries, raspberries,black berries and, as fall came, hickory nuts and butternuts and walnuts and off to the Skokie prairies to add hazel nuts to their stores. What fun to climb the young hickories and swing from their tops to the ground, secure in their supple strength! One wintry day when the waves had piled hills over the water and shore right up to the bluff, a group of children on a tour of discovery had found and investigated one of the caves in the ice and peeredthrough holes in the ice floor to see the waters they could hear rushing below. As they came out there was father coming toward them. He said nothing but they all went home together. The idea that little children know their elders' thoughts without words one can well understand because of the vividness of the picture of her father, as they appeared from nowhere before his eyes, still in her memory. He had evidently been searching and frightened but he said nothing to frighten them. That was like her father forshe remembers too how, when he came home from Chicago at night, he used to take her on his knee and let her count the change in his pocket. Each time she used to \"nick\" [Note: i.e., steal, take] something but he never said anything nor did he ever forbid the counting of his change. The game didn't last long, and of course he knew what she was doing, but she has always been grateful that he didn't by any word or look plant in her mind, for it was a sensitive mind like any child's, an idea that she was doing a sinfulthing. It helped her to be able to counsel many a mother later for it was one of those personal experiences which enable one later to comprehend children whereas most grown-ups these days have no understanding at all of what a different thing a child is from a grown-up: that, for instance, a child can't form moral concepts before the time of the change of teeth, when the second of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 75 (table of contents) ====] STONE & KNITLOCK RAVINE DWELLING .

Next the garage on the street level and next the veranda and two bed rooms on the upper terrace. The whole was of course planned from the beginning.[Note: The word \"Caption\" is at the top of the page in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 77 ====] [Note: Continued from page 74] his four bodies, the etheric body, is born so to speak, and that therefore moral teaching before that time perverts them, stunts them. One recognizes that the elders must protect themselves but not by moralizing. There was a similar experience later in life with a five year old niece coming to Aunt who was to be counted on in time of trouble. She had broken a saucer and wanted Aunt to hide it. That was as far as her child cleverness, slyness if you will, could take her. So Aunt said \"All right.\" But after a few moments she said - \"But what if Mother found it? Then she would have to punish you. But, now, if you tell her and say you are sorry she can't punish you, can she?\" She gave the matter cool consideration andaccepted Aunt's advice. It worked. Moreover she grasped the whole working principle and after that not only 'fessed up but heaped such ingenious terms of reproach upon herself that one couldn't scold her, there was nothing left to be said. Children are clever. They should be handled on those lines during those early years. She is the one who wouldn't eat meat after she found that people killed \"tame\" chickens and, \"Why did they kill tame cows?\" Her mother laughed when she announced that herreligion was the vegetable religion so she turned to me with - \"There is such a religion isn't there Aunt?\" \"Yes,\" aunt said, \"in India those of the Buddhist religion eat only vegetables.\" \"Well, that's my religion,\" she said. And she lived up to it which required the family to go far in that direction. The wonder of that life in the open was not only in play - hide and seek as the darkness grew in the evening, taking away all fear of the dark (which is natural in children) - the skating on the ponds - butalso the tasks like gathering chips or fire-wood where trees had been felled and logs piled up, the participation in human life. It is Katie [Note: Katy Tully?], that lovely friend, to whom she owed the fact that she danced in those early years when training of the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 78 ====] whole body to rhythmic movements is of vital importance if one is to function as artist or musician in later life for mother, who had taught before marriage, after the birth of her fifth child was teaching again. There were too the hours and days by the lake whose fine beach was the ideal playground, taking turns on father's shoulders as he swam out and out, father whose ideal of heaven was a great ocean where one swam and floated the duration. Watching father and Mr. Chisholm, the neighbor across the road, one ofthe four families who constituted the charming community in this great and lovely domain which has Page 490 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagonow become the most elegant of Chicago's suburbs, watching these two men's heads way out in the lake as they sat on a sand bar and talked and talked for they were both journalists at that time, father \"the best slinger of the king's English in Chicago.\" Or dimly conscious on another afternoon, the water fairlyrough and father way out, his head barely visible on the wave's crest and then gone from sight, that mother who would never go in swimming was sitting on the sand at the foot of the bluff, very still for a very long time, unobservant of her children (I remember it vividly), with her eyes glued on that distant black speak. For father had got caught in a current. They call the lake treacherous but I refuse to use a word so inappropriate to a superb creature which is but leading its own life in its own perfect way. Andfather was fighting for his life and gradually won his way back, superb swimmer that he was. Again the vividness of the remembrance shows that she read her parent's thoughts as children do in those early years. Or thrilled when father would breeze into the house saying, \"With this East wind there must be a storm on and we'd better go watch it,\" and at an hour most untoward for children all would troop down to thebluff and watch the waves storming over the whole beach and pounding half way up the bluff, such majesty! And once a wrecked ship [Note: ==== Beginning of page 79 (table of contents) ====] RIVER BLUFF DWELLING [Note: The structure is the Melson House, Rock Crest-Rock Glen, Mason City, Iowa.] RAVINE DWELLING [Note: The structure is the Paton Residence (Scheme No. 1), Castlecrag.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 80 ====] Both these houses were built of local stone, the one on the water frontage of lime stone. This frontage was simply a continuation of the vertical old quarry wall. When completed Griffin climbed from theriver bottom to the roof of the house. This is in Mason City, U.S.A. The keystones of the upper windows were carried in stepped form above the roof. Aesthetically it solved the problem of the flat roof. This was the origin of the motif so popular since in city buildings and bridges, etc., in Russia, India, Australia, the United States. An imagination once conceived and executed is reflected in the others and becomes accessible to imaginative thinkers, and of course to theuninspired who follow and often claim. The ravine dwelling in Sydney, Australia, was built of the local stone which there is the old Potsdam sandstone. Both are terraced houses and all windows, except the massive piers emphasized and so making bookcases, cupboards, wardrobes or fireplaces in the interior. Every necessity is taken advantage of toadd beauty to the dwelling. Thus minimum cost dwellings have the beauty and charm of the expensive Page 491 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 The Art Institute of Chicagoones.

Mr. Chisholm, who adored father, in physical appearance was a duplicate of Nathaniel Hawthorne. He was quite as likely to drop in for a chat at two o'clock in the morning as any other time. One night the Chisholm family and guests dressed up as Indians and raided the Mahony house. Another evening we all went over there. Mrs. Chisholm, fat as any prima donna, was a lovely soprano and that night motherwith her \"India rubber face\" as one of her old teachers used to call her, told a funny story of the family with the crooked mouths trying to blow out the candle before going to bed, and father who had never heard her tell a story before because she was not a raconteur, circled round and round through the rooms hating to miss any of it yet unable to endure the agony of his own laughter. And one night mother waked her up early in the morning to see Venus. She is sure she has never seen it so big since. Week ends were apt to be stirring compared with the very quiet week days for guests were continually dropping off at the Lakeside station and Xanthippe, always a tomboy, was usually called upon to climb the tree in front of the porch, branchless to the height of the house, which she alone could climb none of the boys being equal to it. She had a way of her own, bare footed, monkey fashion, soles of her feet planted against the trunk. If her feelings ever got hurt which didn't happen often and of which she hasno recollection, she would slip away (so her aunt told her in later life) and hide herself way down under the bed clothes and was so tiny as to make a hardly perceptible bump. And then one day when there had been a grand clean-up for a weekend party, and mother had oiled the floors and put the rags up in the attic which certainly could run a temperature on a hot day, and the family and the first guest, Ruthven Pike, had all gone to sleep after an all day and evening picnic, thehouse caught fire, spontaneous combustion from those oil rags and burned to the ground. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 82 ====] \"A magnificent bonfire\" said mother. In the hurry and flurry of rescuing as much as possible, it was Katie [Note: Katy Tully?] who remembered Xanthippe, woke her and put the baby in her arms and senther across the street to the Chisholm's. It was Katie who told the tale of how provoked she was to see Mr. Pike deliberately completing a careful toilet even to the perfect tying of his tie, and then seeing that it was he who, coming out of his room, went straight to the barrel of gasoline and rolled it out of the house, quite likely in this way forestalling an explosion. The family had to go to Chicago to live. Xanthippe spending a year with her beloved Aunt Myra, mother's idolized sister, in Tremont, Illinois. But on with our Australian tale - February 1919, Melbourne - Dear Clarmyra [Note: MMG's niece, Page 492 of 923 of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 The Art Institute of Chicagodaughter of MMG's sister, Georgine] I certainly do wish you could have been with me during our holiday in Tasmania. We would have had grand times together. It would have been a fine chance for me to have put you through your paces in drawing and painting. I think I'll make use of the chance of doinga bit of dictating to Miss Ullyatt to send you a general account of this holiday which came in so surprisingly short a time after my September outing in the Grampians [Note: Victoria, Australia] with Uncle Walter, because these holidays are the one thing we can write freely about without any fear of complications because they are so utterly distinct from our routine life, either personal or business, and seem scarcely a part of ourselves that it does not seem like telling personal matters to the general publicin case the letters should be read, as they undoubtedly are, by others than those to whom they are addressed. One of the artists of Melbourne in whose work we have been interested, Bertha Merfield [Note: 1869-1921] (who later did the huge mural of gums in the valley in the Cafe Australia) said to me one day that she was planning to take a vacation in Tasmania and wondered if I would like to go along, towhich I promptly said I would. I was confident that her choice of a location would be satisfactory to me. Moreover it's no earthly use to wait till Walter can go with me if I am to see anything of this country or be able, as I have wanted from the beginning, to make [Note: ==== Beginning of page 83 ====] drawings of the fascinating trees to be found if one can only get away from the habitations of man. It seemed too bad and rather outrageous to run away from home at Christmas time but as it was then or never I decided I could not afford to throw away the opportunity. Had promised candy for Walt to give to some of his favorite ladies but guests came unexpectedly to dinner on the last night so the next morning on his telling me he would lend a hand I undertook to boil up some candy. At the end of about a half hour, he was struck with compunction at not going to the office so my human limitations made it impossible for me to do more than finish the boiling of the batch I had on the stove and lay out materialsrequired and leave him to manage the rest as best he could, which to the amazement of all of us, he did most successfully and proud as a peacock he was over it too. All this meant a wild rush at the last moment to catch the boat which for the next 24 hours I wished I had never caught since the trip on the Loongana, which is never painted in glowing colors, everyone said was the worst ever. The storm was over before we reached Tasmania where we had a wonderful fortnight which enabled me to add anumber of unique trees to my set of Forest Portraits.

Castlecrag,\" at CASTLECRAG HOME IN A CASTLECRAG GULLY The floors solid on the ground keeps the house cool in the summer and warm in the winter, stone walls, hollow concrete roofs. The botanists tell us that this district has a greater variety of blossoms than any other spot in the world. Trees and shrubs are in blossom the whole year round, a constant succession, in endless variety. By planting the proper varieties one can have acacias, the wattles, the golden rod tree, in blossom all the 12 months of the year, great masses of showy clusters of various shades of gold. This high tree too, an Angophora Lanceolata, loving the spectacular, chose the edge of a precipice thus dominating the gully. Humans ignorant of spiritual science might well wonder whence it got its nourishment but indeed the plant has no need of earthly things for its nourishment but only for its support and to maintain its upward position. The trunk of the Angophoras may be round or it swells out in one direction and then narrows up to a slender oval in section at another according to its passing mood, and the branches pay no attention to the laws of gravity, reaching out twisting and contorting as if they were in water, indeed in every way often resembling water animals, this pink barked tree resembling a great octopus with outstretching twisting and contorting tentacles. This is because the vegetation originated in the Lemurian times when the partially solidified parts of the earth were still bathed in heavy mists so that the vegetables as well as theanimals were still sea creatures. The platypus ornithorhynchus [Note: duckbill platypus] is an example in the animal kingdom. In my drawings I did not choose these extremes, being fascinated by the beauty of those of the trees that Page 494 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowere not quite so strange to my western eyes, for our America gives us much later forms for America is dominated by the life ether, the last that has functioned in the evolution of the solar system, the solidifying instead of the liquifying forces.

[Note: ==== Beginning of page 87 ====] THE ARCHITECT'S BURDEN WALTER BURLEY GRIFFIN A TALK TO STUDENTS - 1924 - Sydney, Australia In his treatise on painting, Leonardo da Vinci dealt with art's fundamental values. First he declared that no artist is worthy of praise unless he is universal; that he should acquaint himself with all the phases of life; that he should disdain to make pictures out of other pictures, but should go directly to life and, having mastered all the technical intricacies of his calling, he should use his imagination and build up an art. Certainly this is impregnable doctrine. In the second place he advised close contact with nature. Now I wish to develop this attitude toward the modern field of architecture. You are starting where Ibespeak 30 years experience and hence dwell on what seems the most important issue albeit the most disagreeable of all subjects for us. The subject is not chosen because of its attractiveness. The topic is in fact disagreeable in the extreme for our architecture is only manifestation of the diseased condition ofour society in whose body the faculties of art are all but atrophied. When we come to think of it, no art has nor merits in our day so great popular appeal as music, yet even that appeal means so little that we here cannot afford or find the time of one person in 10,000 for a dozen days out of the 365 for the presentation of the most adequate form of musical expression - that of the symphonic orchestra. If we are able to excuse ourselves in the fact that no community elsewheredoes better, that is so much the worse for the status of music. As to the graphic arts, at the first attempted representative exhibition of current painting that has been heard of here during the ten years of my residence in Australia, I counted a total attendance of four persons apart from my party during the evening I attended. Irrespective of the merit of the paintings, which is another subject, what can be said for the curiosity to say nothing of the interest of the people ofour time in this, one of the supreme avenues of human [Note: There is no page 88 in the typescript.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 89 (table of contents) ====] CHIMNEY OF PYRMONT INCINERATOR Page 495 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page [89-2] ====] CAPTION The Sydney Incinerator erected on the high rock promontory of Pyrmont will stand we think as an historical record of 20th century architecture. It is as beautiful, as majestic, as unique as any of thehistoric records of the past. Historically it records the basic fact of the 19th century civilization later emphasized by the smashing of the atom. The ornament is the record of what remains when matter is destroyed - warmth which manifests in the material world in the spherical form - the only form of matter when the solar system came into material existence, the Saturn period; the triangle when the gaseous condition came in the Sun (see photograph of the Sun's rays); the crescent or wave form of the Moon period when there was the liquid condition of matter; and the rectangle , the controlling form of the solid condition as seen in the human being's blood crystals. When the atom was smashed there remained only warmth, light, sound and magnetism.

It is unnecessary to dwell on the plastic arts for we are right in an epidemic of soldiers' memorials. Though it may be more difficult to ascertain numerically the hold of literature on the people of our time, there is slight evidence in the printed matter in circulation and on the stands that interest in the art of literature is any greater than among illiterate peoples and primitive times. Then where does architecture come in? If it is monuments you would see, look around you. Can anyone here recall a single creative expression of human endeavor or a single idea in this line in the last five hundred years? (At that time Griffin's practice had been in Melbourne only and his influence had not yet spread beyond that city.) By reason of specializing in this search during thirty years, perhaps I might be able to cite an answer but Page 496 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoI don't wish to appear pedantic and then you could easily dispute it. But granting one exception or so in the half millennium where now does architecture stand in our civilization? Where does even the imitative stylistic practice which we may designate architecturesque come in? A view of one of our cities, the physical expression of our civilization, will reveal from an air plane the following fourteen points in approximate order of importance:- (1) Disorderly grouping of desert streets, ways and lump structures. (2) Railway yards and trestles. (3) Denuded wastes and dumps.(4) Gas Holders. (5) Sheet iron and paper roofs. (6) Factories, wharves, sheds, and street verandas. (7) Smoke stacks and roof tanks. (8) Signs - white, blue and yellow.(9) Palings and weatherboards. (10) Brick boxes and out-houses. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 93 (table of contents) ====] MUNICIPAL OFFICE BUILDING MELBOURNE [Note: The structure is the Collins House Extension.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 94 ====] (11) Tiles. (12) White painted trimmings. (13) Stereotyped Town Hall and Post Office towers. (14) Crowded tetrahedronal chunks with one or two sides plastered and dolled up over sheet glass foundations. Item 14 is the concern of the architect. Here in our civic world is the opportunity for the expression of the human soul in more or less enduring form for the satisfaction of the most insistent of spiritual Page 497 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocravings. Now if you are going into architecture you must at least believe that the only vital happiness in this world, the supreme objective of developed human beings, is satisfaction in the results of creativethought - the one new thing under the sun. Each and all seeking such achievement in an environment such as just outlined, must realize the necessity of considering, from every possible point, our disagreeable status. Take the architect's case further when he comes to deal with his two dimension opportunity in the street, right in the middle of a crazy quilt of other facades and also what lies behind. He finds his scope alreadycast in an iron mold largely by uninformed and unsympathetic officials in the guise of policemen, engineers, clerks, lawyers, and agents of vested interests and politicians, to say nothing of the investing client himself who \"knows what the public want,\" notwithstanding that the same public may never have been given the choice in the matter, and finds that the creative efforts of all the professionals who have tried to develop through a lifetime of experience, have been similarly snuffed out by the establishedforces of law, order and subservience. The Architect's fellows in the other fields of art must, as has been aptly claimed, be condemned to one of three states - a parasite, a pander [Note: i.e., panderer] or a recluse. Now, whereas it is possible for a composer or [Note: ==== Beginning of page 95 (table of contents) ====] LANTERNS RESTAURANT .

Lighted at night the openings framing the doors and windows make a spectacular illumination feature from the exterior as they do for the interior during the day.

Nothing much, as you can see, can be said for the status of architecture but the significance of this absence of status to civilization is so appalling and the consequence so inevitably disastrous to society that we may pursue it further. When architecture had a status its scope was nothing less than the harmonizing of man's habitat with his physical environment, external nature. Instinctively the other living things have this faculty and all vegetable and animal structures comprise a congruous whole.Beaver dams, ant hills, beehives, bird nests and bowers exhibit the first essential principal, economy of effort (play), necessary to harmony. All the evidence of historic civilizations among men prior to the Romans exhibit also the second essential - subordination to nature, and indicate something in these civilizations that we lack - a closer relationship of man to nature. Japanese roads, all in cuttings, do no violence to topography. Feudalcastles appear to grow out of the jagged rocks of Europe. The mud houses of the African deserts and the storied adobe cities of the Pueblo Indians in America are as distinctly part and parcel of a homogeneous nature as is the Eskimo Igloo and all these certainly represent more scientific, economic and comfortable housing under their conditions than do our houses constructed now after 2000 years to the specifications of Vitruvius for the Roman army hutments of Augustus Caesar . The relation of the larger architectural efforts of Asia and ancient Africa and America, as well as the African cities is that of a beautiful part of nature's magnificence in which the more artificial graduate to the most unrestricted nature without incongruity. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 98 (table of contents) ====] MODEL OF NEWMAN COLLEGE GROUP [Note: ==== Beginning of page 99 ====]With us here this widest phase of the Architect's work, landscape architecture, is unknown except as a meaningless name. Were the architect a factor in life today this field would supply the motif for all his works and our creations would be designed to serve natural need instead of artificial prejudice. The scope, scale, materials, proportions and the details of embellishment of buildings are naturally only functions of the group with which it must fit and that again of the larger landscape. What sane person sufficiently detached to take an artistic standpoint could find any satisfaction in such a collection of incongruities as this street outside whose only merit is faithfulness to the ostentation, imitation, greed and intolerance, every anti-social force that actuates our civilization. The absence of that disinterested point of view accounting for the lack of architects, and specialization and preoccupation amongst themost of us concerned with esthetic matters, has resulted in the unleashing of the forces of men to destruction. Page 499 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoWithout guidance of ideal constructive imagination we are now witnessing a ruthless invasion of nature on every hand. Even Sydney Harbor will have become a by-word before the fact is realized that it is becoming more and more a catchword. Each year more and more are forests ring-barked, fields erodedand pest-infected, rivers befouled and dredged, factory-invaded and slashed by railways. Cliffs are hacked off for motor tourists with more and more vegetation dust-coated, and disfigured with advertisements and pole lines. Continuously more and more are the flowering shrublands burned off to grassy uniformity and an everlasting sameness substituted for infinite variety. Even the same few gaudy genera of plants are gradually monopolizing all the gardens of every climate in a more common,commonplace and accessible world of less interest, less mystery and less charm. We never stop to think that when we have uprooted a square foot of the soil we have perhaps replaced a score of species brought into stable equilibrium through eons of time by a single frail plant which, the moment it is neglected, will give way to one of a dozen [Note: ==== Beginning of page 100 (table of contents) ====] NEWMAN COLLEGE . KITCHEN CORNER [Note: ==== Beginning of page 101 ====]ubiquitous weeds. We are actually coming within measurable distance of the elimination of all divergent races; all animals except stock and vermin; all uneconomic plants except weeds; and the dissipation of all economicminerals, in fact the spoliation of all our resources to end in an ant-like existence and the elimination of the soul. There is no force now in evidence to stop this tendency and we are safe in assuming that no material force nor government nor economic necessity can overcome a force that has been gaining momentum for four hundred years. Nothing short of the acceptance of a new idea of what we are here for can reverse this current in which man has abandoned his manifold individual faculties to anintellectual authority on the plane of physics, presuming that this authority derived from discoveries in the field of science is sufficient to rival the scheme of nature itself. It is an egoistic and vain presumption which must yield to attack in turn if such attack be made from the vantage point of man's spiritual relationship with nature for there is a perfection, infinity and intelligence in natural phenomena continually eluding the curiosity of the scientist and which therefore it is the proper business of our artto respect. After all, psychology admits that 90 per cent of our mentality is subconscious and it should be easily perceived that where the ant, for instance, can exist in complete ignorance of man's world, there are certainly realities beyond the scope of our conscious intelligence. Once we begin to guide our actions by all our faculties including reverence for the handiwork of nature and that constructive instinct evidenced in most individual endeavor then only will we begin to seewhere and how a minority, by use of political power have for selfish interests been leading us by propaganda and misuse of science and education where they would be unable to drive us by physical force.

Not only have workers in the aesthetic fields the best realization of what is lost in our civilization of monopoly power but they alone have the means to turn the minds of men which are less susceptible to the exhortations of the preachers or the arguments of the debaters that counter their prejudices than to the appeal of the object lessons which art alone can present. The artist in our time knows what it means to be a slave and a drudge if he be not parasite or pander, and must feel, most keenly, all interference with freedom of action. If he applies his intellectual detachment, which is the essence of the aesthetic, to the present day problems he should readily uncover that abuse of the power in our communities which distinguishes them in degrees at least from all civilizations that have produced a real culture where work is volitional, another name for play, and where thereforediversity and individuality express themselves in every function, in every movement, color, garment, utensil or shelter and where all these are beautiful, as with the so-called Barbarians and all other older civilizations.

CALLITRIS COLUMELLARIS & ANGOPHORA SUBVELUTINA [Note: ==== Beginning of page 106 ====] Page 501 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] ANGOPHORA SUBVELUTINA & CALLITRIS COLUMELLARIS I think but two Angophoras, the Lanceolata and the Subvelutina. This latter is a stately tree with a dark rough bark. The only technical difference between the gums and the Angophoras is that the Eucalyptus has a spherical seed pod with a cover, the word eucalyptus means \"I cover thee.\" The Angophora has no cover. The flowers of both are the same, compact bunches of stamens and usually in clusters. I feel that the Archangel who painted Australia was the greatest of them all. Everything is so decorative and to me, an architect, the function of painting is decoration, mural decoration. You don't have to be an artist there, the picture presents itself to you in perfection. You put it down just as it is. Grouped with this in sharp contrast is the Callitris Columellaris , its fine leaves one of the few brilliant greens ever to be found in the landscape of Australia, massed rich and moss-like. It is a wonderful tree for landscaping effects and for stately avenues. It has not been used such yet for it seemed to bear noseed. But a few years ago a group of very ancient trees was found, several with seeds which will be made good use of in botany loving Australia. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 107 ====] SEARCH FOR CASTLECRAG During Alstan's [Note: daughter of WBG's sister, Genevieve, and Roy Lippincott] stay and at other times when \"Uncle\" could get up for the weekend we would go on tours of discovery, rowing in thatmost beautiful, secluded and truly domestic of Sydney's harbors. I remember my brother Jerome's saying what a thrill it was to go on jaunts of discovery on his own property down there in Mexico. Once even, he happened upon the ruins of an ancient city on his own plantation. Well it wasn't just that way with us but those jaunts of discovery on our own property, how beautiful they were. The senor [Note: Walter Burley Griffin] had scarcely arrived in Australia when he made up his mind that he would look about for the best location for developing a high class residential suburb. The first two or three years the pace was too great to do anything about it. But just the same he kept thinking about it and made up his mind that Sydney was the best for such an undertaking. They had accepted single tax there and it was booming ahead of Melbourne and rapidly becoming the Metropolis of the continent. So presently he started a thorough search, motored in every direction, searched the titles officeand finally settled on the Middle Harbor district. Beauty Point looked very attractive so he began negotiations for purchase but he deliberated too long and another man cut in and finalized a purchase. We had not yet sufficiently mastered that other external world - our souls - not to feel the pang of a heart-break. But this was all to the good for now he found out that three of the promontories beyond, which everyone had said were crown land, were really owned in London. He found a Sydney agent who had been connected with this property and asked him to get the owners to quote a price for the first promontory. Page 502 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe whole story of this district is interesting. We often thought of making a moving picture of it. Our middle promontory, Covecrag, as seen from the water, is a perfect cone like Fuji Yama, only a perpetual green and blossoms instead of perpetual snow. On still days it is [Note: ==== Beginning of page 108 (table of contents) ====] MOUNT FUJI YAMA [Note: Fuji-san] COVECRAG FROM MAIN ARM . MIDDLE HARBOR [Note: ==== Beginning of page 109 ====] CAPTIONThough not so big, the Covecrag peninsula viewed from the harbor has the constantly changing and lovely effect of Fuji Yama only it is everblooming. The raking views from it sweep up and down middle Harbor, and from it the water events can be viewed to perfection. When fully occupied it will still look as it does now for the contour streets will be invisible and will enable the residences to nestle in its gardens. On its very top some monumental buildings may be erected. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 110 ====] [Note: Continued from page 107] completely reflected, and on still nights you slip into your canoe for the enchantment. A Governor General, Lord Carrington [Note: Charles Robert Carrington, Governor of New South Wales] had, like Griffin, taken a water trip up Middle Harbor some forty years before and realized what a lovely suburb it would make. He chased down titles, bought in and thus unified the properties, formed a company,sold shares to the Lords and Ladies of England, got the charming suspension bridge started across the first valley, pressed the government to put a tram line across from the occupied suburb to the South, and then the boom burst. That was Australia's big bust. All the gold went to England for the Boer War. The bottom dropped out of everything. The Company went bankrupt and passed into the hands of the bridge contractors. Then they went bankrupt and the property passed into the hands of the debenture holders inLondon and there it lay. They had never seen the property. From descriptions it sounded impossible for occupancy, steep and rocky precipices unfit for habitation. So when nearly half a century later a prospect of sale came they said \"all or nothing\" and Griffin was asked to make an offer. He offered what he had expected to pay for one promontory and got all three. The pity was we didn't keep it all in our own hands for as it turned out we could have handled it andwould have gotten along much better without the trouble makers we got tied up with in the company that was formed. Page 503 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 The Art Institute of ChicagoWe missed our canoe \"Allana,\" our beloved but, though this Harbor was enclosed and quiet in comparison with the others, the row boat was more sensible. Such trips! Way up to the head waters of the harbor though we owned only to Killarney and Echo Farm which was where the first settlers of theSydney district landed and dwelt; slipping by moonlight up our own Crag Cove and Castle Cove under great overhanging rocks beautifully carved by water and wind, and such exquisite tracery of branch and foliage, rich in its varied colors, and still, Oh so still! except for the occasional plunk of a leaping fish! [Note: \"Allana\" was the name of the canoe in which WBG and MMG took trips along the Chicago River. See especially Section IV, No. 12, \"Autobiography of Xanthippe.\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 111 (table of contents) ====] CASTLECRAG BEFORE OCCUPATION . UPPER LEVEL DENUDED [Note: ==== Beginning of page 112 ====] And the incredible beauty of the phosphorescence in the water below us and dripping from our oars, Lucifer lighting the depths. What tramps over the promontories where Griffin established the roads at first go, by instinct apparently, for when the surveys were made the roads went just there where he had led me on those first walks though all the engineers of Sydney had said no roads could be constructed there other than the one on the crest. What bits of subdividing had been done were allotments impossible for comfortable occupation, slivers leaping from precipice to precipice down the 350 feet to the water's edge. And yetthose bluffs proved ideal for occupation when handled with due respect to their natural formation, terrace on terrace like majestic steps of a grandiose theatre. Under Griffin's reverent touch the roads of easy grades, following the contours, but emphasized the charm instead of destroying it as they did practically everywhere else in Sydney. A visitor to Castlecrag said two people had discovered Australia - Captain Cook (to despoil it) and Mr. Griffin (to conserve it). This difference is one we should wake up to if we want to prevent future wars. Renown should go [Note: to?] the conservers. Everywhere the Anglo-Saxon has gone he has left his mark of ugliness and destruction. In America the only beauty is what the Spaniards left, in South Africa what the Dutch did and so on. These promontories became a residential district where each home would have, till the end of time, the unobstructed outlook that the site had from the beginning. As a rule this includes a grand sweeping view of the harbor with the Spit reaching across toward Manly, and on beyond to North Head and the Pacific Ocean to the horizon. Elsewhere in Sydney this has not been the case. Everywhere a drawing had been laid out on the drafting board irrespective of contours. No one was concerned with the fact that Sydney consisted of bluffs and valleys - unbelievable but true. As a consequence of the gridiron plan everyone Page 504 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 113 (table of contents) ====] FIRST HOMES BUILT ON CASTLECRAG [Note: The structures, left to right, are the Moon(?), Grant, and Johnson Houses.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 114 ====] CAPTION On the top levels of these wooded slopes there is no objection to buildings with sloping roofs if the client desires for there they would not increase obstruction to the Harbor views. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 115 (typescript) ====] [Note: Continued from page 112] who bought a lot was hoaxed except those on the very foreshore when the whole community was cheated for all these water frontages should have been retained as community reserves. The others bought a lovely view but by the time the occupation was completed no one, with but a few exceptions, had any outlook at all. Steep dangerous roads ran down the slopes, great scars to the end of time. Eachrow of houses blocked the view of the next row and on the other two sides the views of each house were blocked by the neighboring house because of the absurd established building line. While this is the state of affairs in the rest of Sydney, in Castlecrag all four directions are open garden views for all time. And so - except where the houses are of the local stone and the roofs flat - the red skin disease of bricks and tile creeps across the city and suburban areas and breaks out in every tiny village or resort even farout in the open districts. Evidently materialistic thinking brings hate and fear of beauty wherever it exists, naturally since beauty is manifestation of spirit. From the homes in Castlecrag one can look to the East in the morning and see the sun rise, an ever varying mural decoration on the eastern wall. At times one gets such a superb spectacle as we did that morning when a rosy dawn shone over valleys filled with mists stretching horizontally and curling up atthe ends as the Japanese show them in their prints; veil after veil till you could count ten distinct planes so that North Head looked as if it were many miles away. Or again, at night, the spectacle of the full moon and its wide wake, there in your own house, a permanent but constantly changing living mural decoration. The really strategic points of the estate were all set aside as reserves, accessible to the whole community, where children could climb and play and thrive and grown-ups could gather and entertain their friends. Griffin was the greatest conservationist of his time for he did not merely set aside these beautiful districts but showed how they could be occupied without destroying their natural beauty. Long, long Page 505 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 116 (table of contents) ====] STONE DWELLING ON MIDDLE TERRACE [Note: This illustration is listed as being on \"page 115\" in the table contents, but appears (together with aplan of Castlecrag) on page 116 of the New-York Historical Society copy.

This map shows the interior reserves and their park paths which means that the future as well as the present can have miles of rambles through such beauty as is rarely if ever found in occupied districts. These paths will be used for underground services, piping, etc., so that the paved streets need not periodically be torn up for their replacement or repairs. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 118 ====] [Note: Continued from page 115]walks along the five miles of water frontage are a part of the allotment of everyone who bought a lot on Castlecrag. And in spite of all this open outlook, entire seclusion so that we never drew our curtains from the beginning of the year to the end. No passing person could look in on us, and yet we were only 30 feet from the street and on a level with it. On the other side the street was 40 feet below us. The way of planning the house as well as the planting helped this though there were no formal hedges. Leaving Pholiota I went to Castlecrag. There had been a strange conflict which only a character testing deepening of consciousness brought to an end. After those years together in work and play, breakfast over and the house in order and leaving for the office together, the busy days with its long hours, return together. Then came that apparently perverse requirement of mine that the senor [Note: Walter Burley Griffin] should get down to the officeby nine in the morning. By ten there was always a stream of people. It was almost impossible to get hold of him to get the decisions, which must come from the designer, to facilitate the work of the draftsmen and shorten the often long hours of work at night by means of which I could function as mediary [Note: intermediary] the next day between designer and those carrying out the drawings. Page 506 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoLater I learned that intellectual work belongs to the morning; will (action) to the afternoon; and imaginative work to the evening. It was a necessity of his nature that he should be a night hawk. But nagging made no impression on him. It certainly was no pleasure to me and half in temper, half indesperation, I decided to leave Melbourne and go to Castlecrag in Sydney. After all his sister's home was in the same yard. It became apparent that a real need had been calling me from my unconscious realms and also that my time had come for as general testing of character ultimately developing new faculties. With no ideas at all in my head, I settled into a boat house on the extreme [Note: ==== Beginning of page 119 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . TOP LEVEL . DAY & NIGHT LIGHTING FRETWORK OF GARAGE [Note: The structure is the David Pratten House.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 120 ====] boundary of the estate toward the headwaters of Middle Harbor. It was a rough house built on a floating pier attached to the rocks of a sheer precipice a hundred feet high so there was no way out at the back. Since I had no boat there was no way out for me. But the company engineer lived in a waterside cottage within coo-ee and he brought me victuals and drink. The senor [Note: Walter Burley Griffin] came up the first week and along with the King (the first name of the Minister of Home Affairs at the time) [Note: King O'Malley]. If I remember rightly he slept on the table, the second cot going to the King. Astorm came up in the night and we rocked on the waves. The King was up off and on all through the night, sure we had broken loose, going out the back door to feel the precipice. Neither love nor money could make him stay the second night. But a fortnight's vacation once in five years was enough for me so I moved into one of the company stone houses built at the time of the original subdivision and auction sale. This method was used toestablish values but not resorted to afterwards. The rest of the property is being disposed of by agents in direct touch with individual clients, the only method appropriate to a covenanted estate. A year had passed since the auction sale during which road construction and several stone houses had been built. But the sales had been far from satisfactory, and at this time had practically ceased. We finally figured that there was a conspiracy among the share holders to squeeze Griffin out of the company - a methodnot so unusual as you might think. Now as always there were streams of people going through this property which was in the nature of a National Park to the crowded districts back of it. Its lovely wooded slopes and miles of waterfrontage on the quietest of the Sydney Harbors made it a natural playground. Released from the drafting board for the moment, I decided I would try my hand at selling allotments and, with two or three young folks to lend a hand, I got busy turning my efforts to making contacts with the passers-by or those the young folks brought to me. So many Page 507 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: \"Coo-ee,\" a call, shout, or greeting (sometimes implying a sense of distance), can mean \"in easy reach of\" or \"very near to.\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 121 ====] sales were made in that way that it soon became apparent that there was something not on the surface in the failure of the agents to make hardly any. Later revelations confirmed our suspicions. My success in making sales wiped out the deficit of the proceeding two years so that the books showed a good profit for the whole period during which considerable sums had been expended in road construction, etc. Up to now we have [Note: had] spent some $250,000 on the roads. This achievement of mine brought an end to any effective results from machinations of this type though the warfare against Griffin continued,disagreeable but not dangerous, till they cooked up another scheme. [Note: The above text was typed on a separate piece of paper which was then pasted onto this page.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 122 (table of contents) ====] No. 8. MELALEUCA [Note: ==== Beginning of page 123 ====]CAPTION MELALEUCA - VICTORIA There are two types of ti-trees, the Melaleuca in Victoria and the Leptospermum in New South Wales. Both grow in sandy stretches. It is easy to realize here that the plant kingdom precedes the mineral kingdom, as our own knowledge of coal (and the diamond) shows us, for in many cases the growthgradually adds minerals - iron, etc., to soils formerly lacking them. In contrast to South Africa where there are so many large flowers, which by the way are perfectly adapted to planting in Australia, in this continent on the other side of the Indian Ocean the flowers are almost all small but very showy in their massing. One of these, the Styphelioides, is a stately avenue tree, symmetrical, white barked, densely foliate and in the spring a solid mass of white blossoms thoughsometimes only half the tree decides to blossom. They have their whims in Australia. The trunks of these trees are like a cluster of vines twining about each other, almost completely separated. They can truly resist storms though they bend with judgment to the prevailing winds. This is a Tasmanian tree, the south west coast. There are no soft woods in Australia so not the temptation there is here to build houses of wood. You can't drive a nail into these woods. But many of them are very beautiful for cabinet work.

MELALEUCA [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.] ADVENTURE IN MISGUIDING THE YOUNG WHAT OPEN SPACES MEAN TO THE YOUNG All my life the time I have spent with children, always borrowed since I had none of my own, has been spent in making them \"naughty.\" To me it was an obvious perversion of nature to try to instill moral notions into little children and a very apparent imposition on the part of grown-ups to make life easier for themselves at no matter what cost of loss of character to the young. My instincts were later onconfirmed in this matter when I learned that up to the 7th year, marked by the change of teeth, the life forces are necessary for the task of developing the physical body and only then are freed making it possible for a child to form moral concepts. Precocity here reacts injuriously on the physical body. In our early days in Sydney, we were acquiring the 3 Middle Harbor promontories for the development of a high class residential suburb, Castlecrag. I had not been there long after the office had moved downto Melbourne when news came up from Melbourne that young five year old Alstan [Note: daughter of Roy and Genevieve (WBG's sister) reported by the senor [Note: Walter Burley Griffin] on his weekly visit to Sydney, had turned mischievous, a pest to young and old in the family. I suggested that he bring her up to \"aunt\" for a visit. I was chiefly occupied at this time in making a set of forest portraits on satin of Australia's peculiarly decorative trees. In this bush a child could roam at will.Children should no more be brought up in houses than colts and calves. Knowing her terror of dogs. I spent the time it took to walk from ferry to flat in expounding to Alstan how Murphy, our flat-owner's incredibly ugly dog, was different from ordinary dogs and a special friend of children. Much to my relief, for I have always had a fear of dogs myself, Alstan took me at my word and accepted Murphy from the start. On her arrival, she told me daddy had said she could comehome as soon as she wanted to, to which I said, \"Of course.\" However, at the end of the second day, she told me daddy had said she could stay as [Note: ==== Beginning of page 125 (table of contents) ====] VALLEY FIRE-SWEPT BUT KNITLOCK HOUSE NOT INJURED [Note: The structure is the Creswick House (House of Seven Lanterns).] Page 509 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 126 ====] This knitlock house perched on a rock withstood without injury a fierce fire that swept the valley though its concrete walls are only two and a quarter inches thick. From across the valley this tiny house looks like a veritable castle. The flower boxes extend the corners of the building up to door and windowhead height giving cupboards in the interior rooms and gaiety to the exterior. At the house entrances, front and back, the roofs are lowered to doorhead height and the columns (four quadrants) forming door and window jambs are run up even above the main roof height and are finished with four flaring tangents to form lanterns. This playing with the knitlock tiles adds no expense to the building, gives it charm in a close-up view and makes it look like a great castle from a distance. [Note: The word \"Caption\" is at the top of the page in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 127 ====][Note: Continued from page 124] long as she wanted to, to which I said, \"Of course.\" As it happened, she stayed about two months when \"uncle,\" coming up from Melbourne, unwisely told her that the baby chickens were coming out of their eggs back home. Alstan promptly decided that she must go back to see the chickens and told everybody she met for the next few days that the chickens were coming out and she must go home to see them. Sohome she went. After the first few days, I had been shocked to find that her baby soul was filled with fears. All her games hung on fears. When it rained she ran into the house afraid of the rain. I drove her out saying, \"Go out and play with the water fairies who have come down to dance with you.\" With breakfast over, each morning we packed a lunch and went out for the day, I with my drawing paraphernalia and, walking or rowing, we would find my tree. One day as we followed a path along the hillside, I noticed that Alstan was hopping from one side of me to the other, and I realized that a small stray dog was trailing along with us. I made her choose her side and stay there. Then I made her hold her hand down instead of jerking it up. Later in the day when she stubbed her toe and cried a bit and the dog insisted on licking the tears from her eyes I said, \"Well then stop crying. He is just kissing the tearsaway.\" And finally when she took her nap on the ground at my side, the dog insisted on sleeping close to her cheek. After this day's discipline the fear dropped entirely away from the child. She accepted the statement I made that dogs were friends of people but that they were not always sure people would be friends to them so you had to hold out your hand to show them you were a friend. And I must confess that when I saw her going up and holding out her little hand to dogs that seemed far from amiable to me,I myself was frequently fearsome [Note: i.e., apprehensive, frightened]. But on her return home she Page 510 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagotook the whole family in hand and broke down their fears. Her father wrote me saying, \"What have you done to Alstan? She is a changed child physically, mentally and morally.\" The outdoor life so important to all children had been hers for two months for, as soon as breakfast [Note: ==== Beginning of page 128 (table of contents) ====] THE AUSTRALIA CAFE . MELBOURNE . AFTERNOON TEA ROOM LOOKING TOWARD STAIRWAY TO BALCONY OF BANQUET HALL [Note: ==== Beginning of page 129 ====] was over, we were off, rain or shine, and returned only in time for an evening meal after which both she and I were ready to drop into bed. The child that had come up to see me, a frail little girl, was spoken of by strangers who saw her at the end of eight weeks as a sturdy little boy. Never again did naughtiness appear. Such is the magic of a wholesome and richly imaginative outdoor life for children. At Castlecrag, I noticed at one time that one of the children was inclined to snitch things and I realized then that our suburban children had no orchards to raid, so I improvised a substitute by having alwaysin my kitchen a case of fruit from which the children could help themselves. The doors to my house were never locked and the children had been taught not to knock but always to come right in. The news flew around and shocked mothers came to me to protest. But I insisted that the children in my house could do what I was willing they should do, and naturally the mothers didn't find it easy to keep the children away from my house. This experiment was very interesting, the attitude of no two childrenalike. Some were a bit ruthless at first, some very mannerly. One boy came every day [Note: \"after school\" added in the N-YHS copy] and asked if he might get a drink of water, to which I replied, \"Yes, and help yourself to an apple while you are there.\" Another small boy sent his wee sister in for two apples, but presently I suggested that brother come in for his own. It became an established institution and really was never abused. It satisfied the one in whose behalf I had started it, and never again wasanything found missing from the house, though the children came in flocks like birds alighting on my lawn for pranks as they came and went. One day I came home to find the whole facade of my house (whose walls are rough stone with projecting stones here and there) ornamented with children from the ground to the roof, the babies on the lowest stones and the older children all the way up. 'Twas a great sight. To the children it was a great adventure. I am sure that many mothers' grown-upmisunderstanding of children was [Note: ==== Beginning of page 130 (table of contents) ====] DAPHNE . GODDESS OF NATURE'S GARDENS .

At times Castlecrag children saw the fairies. In our rehearsals of the plays in the valley the children often came with their mothers and played around during the hours of drill. Sometimes a small child would sit a half hour at a time watching and living along with the play. [Note: The word \"Caption\" is at the top of the page in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 132 ====] [Note: Continued from page 129]transformed at Castlecrag. No more than I could endure to see \"good\" children could I endure to see stodgy young folk, industrious from a sense of duty and narrowly limited in their interests. Of course I had not been long established in No. 17 Castlecrag before one of the rooms became a drafting room and soon one of our Melbourne draftsmen, Louisa Lightfoot, was brought up to work in Sydney and for a number of yearsshe lived with me. She was a beautiful blond, a graduate in Architecture of the Melbourne University, a capable worker. I said to her, \"Why don't you young things learn to dance, not just ball-room stuff, but real dancing.\" \"I never thought of it,\" she said, with a faraway look in her eyes. Indeed having had the world for adventure, now a thing of the past, the one obligation of grown-ups to the young is continually to open to them the doors of other types of adventure. This is what is contrary to what weare doing these days. When children are 5 years old we put them in prisons calling them schools, and from that time on their lives are imprisoned within four walls. For the most part these prisons are hopelessly ugly, a fact which in itself is enough to destroy anyone's character. No wonder we find our young people lacking in initiative, sitting back waiting for someone to hand them a job, thinking the world owes them a living, lacking in capacity to create careers for themselves. Materialistic thinkingleads to this too, for they assume that it is their parents who have chosen to bring them into the world whereas it is they who, many centuries back, have chosen their parents and, from the causal realms, brought them together. The physical scientists' reasoning that things just come about is as comical as Topsy's assertion that she had no father nor mother but \"just growed.\" Now, with the dance, Castlecrag came alive, a truly live spot in Australia, and always more and more alive though only a handful of people in the early days. A whole series of public and private activities developed covering the whole range of community life.

We were fortunate in having as one of our citizens Mr. Edgar Herbert, an expert in physical education. He took us on, about a dozen all told, ranging from fourteen to forty, and the Castlecrag ballet was in full swing. Before long he brought along Mr. Burlekov, a stray getting hisliving as best he could by odd jobs of cabinet making, a left over in Sydney from [Note: Anna] Pavlova's troupe of Russian dancers formerly of the Czar's ballet. By the end of the first year we gave our first performance including a little play. I made a great hit dressed in my husband's dress suit. I had my hair cut and dressed man fashion for the occasion. All the ladies fell in love with me. Burlekov and Louisa startled the public with their skill in the Apache dance.From now on Louisa was taking the dance seriously. At our wonderful Castlecrag parties, attended by so many of Sydney's outstanding artists, the young folks arranged delightful programs. I always left the arrangement of the parties entirely in their hands. The combination of natural loveliness and beautiful architectural setting, constantly varied as one hostess after another offered her home, and the ingenuity of the citizenry in costuming, made beautiful and brilliant occasions of these community affairs none ofwhich ever entailed any expensive outlay. Indeed my own knack at costuming was, I am convinced, the only faculty that ever won the real admiration of my husband who was constantly tickled pink to see the sumptuous and charming effects for unexpected guests or ourselves created from our stray sheets, table or couch covers and oddments that are always part of a home's stores. Indeed when Castlecrag, individually or in groups, entered the metropolitan affairs of Sydney, such as the annual ShakespeareBall, they frequently walked off with the prizes. Then a whole series of community festivities began to develop, a Greek party in the \"Temple of Aphrodite,\" the minimum cost home of Elizabeth Guy, another \"burst of genius\" of W.B.'s, really another [Note: ==== Beginning of page 135 (table of contents) ====] TEMPLE OF APHRODITE .

Built of local stone and concrete sewer pipes this house is a minimum cost house but it is a gem, perfect for daily life or for neighborhood gatherings - really a one room home. Perched on a rock on the edge of a precipice it commands the valley.

Every group throughout the evening formed, with the architecture, stately tableaux. A Spanish party at Mrs. Felstead's. This knitlock home was built around an interior patio with its everblossoming flora luxuriant and reflected in the central pool onto which all the rooms opened (so nopassage in the house) all the doors glazed so, whether open or shut, one glimpses ever new and charming pictures. The tapestries of the old world have no such value as these constantly occurring unforgettable living pictures. How wonderful if we all would learn how to live. It costs nothing but activity of heart and head and will. A series of gaieties in 56 The Parapet into which we had moved because of its magnificent view across the harbor through the Heads to the Pacific Ocean. This dwelling, built of the local stone, stretches across the whole lot, vying with the Florentine palaces in dignity and charm. It was so lovely, lit up for the Christmas season, that we made daily walks down to the terrace below to look up to it and love it. Here, at one of the parties, there suddenly appeared at the seven French windows that open out to the lawn, seven Arab sheiks who swept in, took possession of the party and led the gaiety till three o'clockin the morning. Here, as at all the parties, all the arts were represented. Each citizen of Castlecrag, stirred by the opportunities offered for self expression, could find no rest till his particular interest or faculty could take its place in the community life. So the ballet was supplemented by a dramatic club - The Dais - where plays were read, performed and written. This later launched the Haven Scenic Theatre in the valley. And there were other types of interests. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 138 (table of contents) ====] TEMPLE OF APHRODITE .

In the ballet, Louisa found her life work. For a while it merely filled her spare time. She built up a little class, where incidentally I broke my wrist practicing a Russian ballet, then established another in the city, Sydney, and later gave her whole time to it. Under her grew up the Australian Ballet taking a conspicuous place in the Metropolis. Louisa was no longer living with me. I had taken issue with her onone point and for several years our relations were purely formal. After one of her ballet concerts where the bon-ton of Sydney in full dress had rolled up in their cars and packed the hall, I went back stage to congratulate her. She met me as I entered with, \"I owe it all to you, Mrs. Griffin, every bit of it; without you I would have had none of it.\" She knew she was a success and it was very fine of her to express herself so to me. I feel that it is very improper to expect gratitude from young people. This sort offeeling is not appropriate to youth and should not exist in them during their formative years. But it is fine when they look back later on and recognize where opportunities have been opened to them, and take the trouble to express their appreciation. Recently Louisa went to France for a year of study, came back through India where she spent several months studying and teaching in Madras and Adyar where Mrs. Arundale, the wife of BishopArundale, of the Theosophical Society, has established an international school of Arts. She herself an Indian, a radiantly beautiful woman, had danced and sung for us at our Castlecrag Neighborhood Circle giving us a realization of the exquisiteness of Indian art. Louisa returned to Sydney and before long put on a marvelous production of \"Le Dieu Bleu,\" a ceremonial Indian dance. She gave it in Canberra also. But the charm of Indian life had taken hold of her and before the year had [Note: ==== Beginning of page 140 (table of contents) ====] WATERGATE COVE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 141 ====] Unique and spectacular features and all the water's shores were preserved for all time in Castlecrag's reserves and the houses opened their hearts and souls to them transforming the European barbarians ofthe past five hundred years, and founding a truly new civilization bent on preserving the earth instead of destroying it.

Strangely enough but a few years had passed when we found ourselves established in India. India & America have much to gain by close interrelations.

TREE FERNS [Note: ==== Beginning of page 144 ====] CAPTION TREE FERNSMore ancient than the seed plants are those with spores. The forms in Australia have through the millenniums developed into trees growing to 20 or 30 feet in height, Scattered through the forests their fronds often have a spread of 15 or more feet - a number of varieties all exquisitely beautiful. Tree ferns! One of the oldest forms of vegetation and to be found only in Australia, their trunks running up to 30 and more feet in height and their fronds often with a spread of more than 20 feet. To walk entranced down the long aisle flanked with great golden brown columns, eyes lifted to dwell on the open lace work fretted vault through graceful fern fronds to blue sky, to walk, to stand, to listen.

And when a gully is swept by fire and everything destroyed the next year the ferns spread their canopy again unconscious of the devastating forces that have swept through. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 145 ====] THE STATICS AND DYNAMICS OF ARCHITECTURE Walter Burley Griffin The Unity of Life is divided into two phases - The Static and the Dynamic. The Static phase in all pervasive, is universal, is eternal and does not change. The Dynamic phase is likewise universal and eternal but, conjoined with the creative spirit, it changes with every process of nature. The Statics and Dynamics of life, in whatever functions and forms they are manifest, definitely and intimately make up the sum total of the experiences of a life in all its infinite variety, in all its operation through the field of its activity be it years, days, hours or untold aeons of time. They concern its birth, its adolescence, its flowering, its decadence, its death and its immortality. The Statics and Dynamics of an individual life are the quiet changeless mind and the ever-flowering, ever-flowing, ever moving,ever-changing action of the will, the heart, the soul, upon that mind. Let us keep before us this picture for the usual formulae do not as a rule, convey the idea of the stillness of the mind, its sublime quietude, and the ebb and flow of the spirit that is conjoined with it. The Statics and Dynamics of a Life constitute the actual, the everpresent, whatever is heard, said, done, felt or conveyed to others through the operation of the personality in its complete, living equipment. While the Statics of life, considered as the mind, are universal and changeless, the Dynamics of life considered as the will, the heart, the soul, are all pervasive, all inclusive defining all things but quite particular, quite local, quite native, quite personal, and with the ramifications as greatly separated as is the heart of a wayside flower from the heart of man. Amongst our human kind we shall consider that the mind is the common denominator of us all; and that the will, the soul, the heart, is the common differentiator of us all which develops the personality [Note: ==== Beginning of page 146 (table of contents) ====] CASTLECRAG INCINERATOR [Note: The structure is the Willoughby Incinerator.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 147 ====] CAPTION Page 517 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoCastlecrag is a terraced municipality and so its incinerator is terraced.

Wherever we find the soul of one race differing from another, we find the works of its creation differing in just theparticular way that the soul differs; and conversely we may observe in its works what manner of race it is. Consider the Chinese at his ivories, his enamels, his rugs, his verses - what a story is there; consider the Eskimo at his skins and his hunting spear - what a story. The same Statics is there, the same mind, but what a variation in the texture of the heart and soul and impelling will. Consider the medieval monk athis illuminating and our modern multiple press - what a story, what a romance, what a change of circumstance. Consider the trail of the caravan across the sea of sand, the camel with untold story written on his antique head, and then consider the pathway of the modern ocean liner with the concentrated power of the overwhelming turbine; We dream of a long story between these, a fascinating romance of the play and counterplay, foil and counterfoil, intermeshing and blending of the Statics andDynamics of Life, of men and the works of man. Walter Burley Griffin [Note: ==== Beginning of page 149 ====] HOME BUILDING AS AN ART MAKING A MODEL SUBURB FOR SYDNEY by \"Naphthali\" City life seems to be inevitable. Man is a gregarious animal and loves his kind. But in this great land of open spaces gregariousness is overdone. One would think there was a limit to Australian soil to judge from our overcrowded and rather ugly cities, products of a tendency to follow in the gouty footsteps ofJohn Bull, and a lack of imagination and artistic temperament which is truly British. When the climate and the open air life, combined with aggressive propaganda by the free spirits of today, have freed this budding Commonwealth from the grip of Mammon and the regime of the Philistine, we will begin to build a new civilization. This, of course, will call for new institutions. But first we must have new ideas, these are the ground-plan or the new Commonwealth, in which life will be lived as a fine art. SoundsUtopian, no doubt, to the matter-of-fact-mind, but sooner or later all of us will be Utopians. Even Columbus, who set out in a boat headed due west to seek the East Indies, was a utopian. But he arrived. Page 518 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoMr. Walter Burley Griffin, who planned Canberra, is a kind of Columbus in his way. He has left the beaten track and launched out on the lonely waters, hoping to reach the city of his dreams some fine day. To drop the rather mixed metaphor, he has started to build a suburb by the shores of Sydney Harbor -out of ideas. It is true he will use solid stone and a certain amount of mortar and wood, and things material of that nature, but he depends for his effects on ideas. He is a kind of landscape architect - a painter of effects, in stone, and lime, and elevations. A British painter of genius was once asked how he mixed his paints. He replied - \"With brains, sir.\" Mr. Griffin builds his model suburb with ideas. The stone and lime and other matters are of the earth, earthy; but the ideas are Mr. Griffin's own. With ideashe can demonstrate the triumph of mind over matter. To achieve the broad effects he aims at, this landscape architect has a canvas of 700 acres, situate on the foreshores of Middle Harbour, one of the finest effects produced by that greatest of landscape [Note: \"Naphthali\" - Naphtali (said to derive from a Hebrew term meaning \"to wrestle\" or \"to struggle\") was a son of Jacob and a founder of one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel.

Architect [Note: ==== Beginning of page 151 ====] CAPTIONThere is a certain American [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright] who, although he has artistic feeling, is really not an architect at all though he is quick on the uptake. He has never built a swastika building but is now adding that to his claims. If I am not misinformed the swastika has been used in Europe. It is now being used in Australia in a group of tall apartment buildings. But \"I want to be the lion too\" in America is claiming it as his ownand articles are being published to that effect though he has built no such building. He does not wait till he has originated or built a type to claim it. As soon as he learns of it he publishes claims. The public likes scandals. It is his scandals that have given him his public. See his sham imitation of knitlock in California which has none of the structural qualities of knitlock, and his floor on the ground which let the moisture through because it was an imitation of the ideawithout any of the structural knowledge which makes such a method water proof. Griffin's federal enemies have kept this man posted re Griffin's work. Fortunately that generation will soon be dead and gone but the Griffin & Nicholls office will carry on creatively. This dwelling has used the swastika motif charmingly.

The combination which has resulted in the suburb of Castlecrag is a combination of Nature and Art. The native flora is a thing of beauty, and can be a joy forever. The aim of our builder of beautiful homes is to make human habitations things of beauty, if not eternal joys; and it is certain that he has done something that stands out as unique in Australian history. The dwellings in this new suburb are designed to harmonize with their natural surroundings. The roads of easy grade sweep along the bluffs, and flow in curves which please the eye. The houses areinconspicuous, in keeping with the natural harmonies. As the natural flora is restored the houses will nestle into place so that the slopes, as they arise from the water's edge, will be as completely garden as they were before being devastated by the hand of the vandal. The layout of Castlecrag is like that of a theatre. When each allotment is built upon, everyone will have a view of the stage and its setting, and in every direction the eye will encounter a garden, instead of a brickwall or an ugly fence. This effect is brought about also by the houses being placed so that they do not occupy a set building line, but are so placed that they conform to the general plan, which does away with all appearance of crowding, and almost entirely conceals the houses by trees, shrubs and climbers. The flat roofs add to this garden effect. By degrees the splendid blossoming evergreen climbers, hardy in this climate, will cover or embower roofs as well as walls. Viewed as a town planning effort, Castlecrag not only accepts and makes the most of natural surroundings, but meets all the needs of a human community. The homes are planned for the greatest economy for the occupier and the least inconvenience for the housekeeper, with the utmost in the way of aids to home life for old and young. Open spaces are reserved for all time, interior parks giving safe play space for the little ones still calling for care, yet allowing them intercourse with other children, so useful for development. Park [Note: ==== Beginning of page 153 ====] paths connect these reserves, so that delightful walks will be possible even after occupation is complete. Foreshores to the extent of some four or five miles are being dedicated to the public. Would that the community could regain those previously subdivided and sold to the water's edge. A natural acropolis, 300 feet above the water, on the central peninsula, is the civic center; a sports field, surrounded by public and semi-public buildings, entered from the business thoroughfare through a semicircular colonnaded gateway. This center comprises such buildings as churches, clubs, assembly Page 520 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagohalls, schools, libraries, hotels, and theatres. Two natural amphitheatres are located, the Cove theatre on the water frontage, the Glen theatre at the head of a valley. One hundred acres have been allocated to golf links, and a sheltered cove will be usedas a yachting club. The citizens of Castlecrag are organized for various community purposes. Committees for publicity, education, recreation, town-planning, and the like have been set up, and steps are being taken for the erection of the Castlecrag Community Clubhouse. It is a great work, but it is only a beginning. It points to a new Australian life, based upon a new Australian idea. That idea is that it is absurd for Australians to keep following in the gouty footsteps of old John Bull or to ape Uncle Sam. They must think out a new civilization, and begin to draw up the ground plan of the new institutions. The idea may be summed up in a phrase; Life as a fine art. That is really what all the poets, the seers, the sages, the revolutionaries of the ages, have seen in their minds' eyes. It was the vision that Moses beheld from the Mount ere he passed behind the veil. Life as a fine artflourished on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea in days long fled; in lands where corn and wine abounded; where song and music and drama made life resplendent; where man surpassed himself and became superman - all this glory that was Greece will be resurrected by the shores of the Pacific. Castlecrag is a step toward the Australian ideal - a new Civilization white in soul. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 154 (table of contents) ====] No. 10. TASMANIAN EUCALYPTUS .

So back of these a bit we get into the depths of the bush where in spite ofthe fact that Australia has only an eighth as much timber as any other continent we find, as we do wherever white folks go, that they are cutting the heart out of the forest. These trees illustrate a typical and wonderful fact about Australian trees that, though they give ample shade, rarely is the foliage so dense as to conceal the form and structure of the growth. This makes them ideal for architectural embellishment. The sad part is that [Note: the] white man so rarely does his part,has so lost his touch with the spiritual, that he is not even conscious of his obligation to add beauty, destroying none, as his contribution to creation but everywhere what he does these days is hideous.

Land in this sense is accorded the respect due to a highly developed and perfected living organism not to be exterminated nor treated as dead material, nor as a mere section of the map. That part of the Metropolitan Unity which comprises its natural setting, its whole coastal district, has now gone through a metamorphosis from Botany Bay almost to Broken Bay so complete that without the fortunate survival of Castlecrag, one would scarcely be able to picture the Sydney of the last Century with its then justly famous Harbor. In the eighteen-eighties upper Middle Harbor was selected in advance of the Eastern suburbs, now Page 522 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagointensely occupied, for residential development and the monumental Suspension Bridge was to give access. However, the desired tramway facilities or franchises were so effectively withheld by the government that the bulk of this territory was precluded from occupation until the days of the privatemotor cars. Since 1920 the motive of the suburban development of 750 acres in Castlecrag, Covecrag and Castlecove, within five miles [Note: The above text was typed on a separate piece of paper which was then pasted onto this page.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 157 (table of contents) ====] BOTANY BAY .

Town planning is preserving their beauty. It will presently be an independent municipality. The Australian Municipalities are different from ours. What we think of as Sydney is a group of entirely independent municipalities. Sydney happens to be the greatest business center but each of the municipalities of what we call Greater Sydney also has its business center and an entirely independentcouncil and government. Castlecrag is now a part of the Willoughby municipality. It plans to be an independent Municipality when it has the required population.

No control that is not localized in the strictest sense possible, i.e., personal, has so far availed to prevent Page 523 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe disappearance of our wild life before the advancing population. In the present incipient stage of general understanding of nature even the best of our communities suffer their reserves to be \"improved\" which means despoliated [Note: i.e., despoiled], gradually obliterating the natural character. It is only necessary to stand on some lookout such as Covecrag to be able to distinguish, from all the rest, primitive spots that are under the care of considerate resident owners and not indiscriminately accessible to the public. Unfortunately the cases of personal protective interests are exceptional and even for these there are the hazards of bush fires, vandalism, dumping and reckless depredation of flowers, plants, firewood, poles, bee-trees, timber, soil, sand and stone. Notwithstandingthese difficulties and the unsympathetic attitude of the public authorities, the restoration of natural states has already been noticeable in Castlecrag with a resident community of about two dozen families only and, during the survey and construction work, many roads and streets as well as playing areas, baths, tennis courts and golf courses besides the quarrying and housing have been established. These operations have not appreciably silted up the coves because of the general contour alignment of the narrow roads, their early sealing and the drainage precautions taken wherever possible. The placing of the roads and the allocation of the home sites thus required complete contour surveys followed by detail personal feature studies in order to determine and to conserve the distinctive rock formations and flora.

Strangely enough, it has been the last to be exploited, though in other directions Sydney has been extended much further afield. Excepting reserves held by the Government for public purposes, the land along the other shores has been cut into small parcels and utilized without protective covenants or direction; so that in the end we find the capital which is the pride of the State without a single first-class, safeguarded, homogeneous, residential waterside suburb. It is fortunate, however, that the bestopportunity has been left to the last. An Unspoiled Heritage The instinct that has peopled all the shores heretofore, has been the pioneering instinct reckoning the exuberance of nature an obstacle to be overcome, rather than a treasure to be preserved. Now that the treasure has, in fact, become rare it may be valued more highly, conserved with respect and pains, and appreciated by those lucky enough to be able to live in the last suburban water-front area of Sydney - which is also the first to be developed with every possible care to maintain its pristine beauty. The Greater Sydney Development Association, formed for the purpose, has taken over this one considerable area remaining available for settlement. It comprises the major part of three of the four promontories of the western shore of Middle Harbor, and also of the Middle Harbor ward of themunicipality of Willoughby, extending from Northbridge to Roseville, with four miles of water Page 525 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofrontage. The association is undertaking an idealistic development of this new suburb, with driveways, parks and playgrounds complete, and with [Note: ==== Beginning of page 164 ====] the pavements, shops, residences and all other conveniences and services requisite to modern living. Some Of Its Features Castlecrag, four miles from Circular Quay, derives its name from a towering rock which has been called \"Edinburgh Castle\" on the maps, and is included among the numerous reserves established by the association to conserve for the residents all the remarkable natural features of the place - its outlooks,monumental cliffs, caverns, ancient trees, fern glens, wild flower glades, waterfalls and foreshores. No amount of artificial improvement could compensate for the sacrifice of this priceless heritage. The Australians probably spend more time and energy and endure more discomfort than any other people in the world today in trying to enjoy outdoor nature: but holiday outings and week-end humpies comprise the least satisfactory and most extravagant way of gaining necessary respite from the monotony of homeand business life in a metropolis. And these burdensome make-shift extra homes and extra tasks are gradually defeating their very purpose and spreading slumdom over the whole landscape. Mistakes Of The Past Civilized man has never had a greater opportunity to find his home in the midst of a natural paradise than that offered him right in the Australian metropolis. No savages could be capable of making such a mess of this opportunity as Sydney has hitherto made of it. Why? Because nature is a part of the every day, every hour, life of a savage; and he respects it as such, and not merely as an escape. The handiwork of the Creator is hardly a mere after-consideration in the scheme of the universe. Our sordid environment is the consequence of an egotism that hardly even questions wanton sacrifice to immediate and personal - not social - advantage, of every vestige of the harmonious, perfect [Note: \"Humpies\" can mean shelters made from natural materials, e.g., log cabins.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 165 ====]development which on intense evolutionary process through eons has prepared for us. Page 526 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoWith rifle and axe, fire, dynamite, poison and weeds, and pests, are we invading every day more of the choice bits of this earth; even making desolate those portions which we do not actually encumber with our \"necessary\" miscellaneous paraphernalia of factories and shops, verandas and fences, palings,gables, bays and dormers; yards, dumps, sheet iron sheds and tanks, tracks and piers - unassorted, often without use, all without harmony or variety, or beginning or end. Landscape Counterparts It is the object of art to make simple, easy, even playful, the most serious work of man, just as the real most serious work of nature, so perfectly organized and systematic, affords us rest, relief and sheer joy. Castlecrag development is making of the necessary encumbrance, entailed by man's dwelling on the land, a fitting counterpart to the landscape. Since these encumbrances actually amount to only an eighth part of the land occupied, there should be no great difficulty in making them play a correspondingly subordinate part in the scheme already designed and executed by nature. The thoroughfares wind around the slopes and skirt the rocky ledges where they will not disfigure the contours and will attract no more than the amount of traffic which is needed for the particular portions of the locality intended to be served by each driveway. The drives, like those in parks, are smooth enough, wide enough and sheltered enough to accommodate pedestrians and vehicles together, and they also have banks of native trees, shrubs and flowers which, instead of being lost in a preliminary clearance, have been protected, encouraged and supplemented. Grouping The Homes The individual allotments are approached from a drive on one side and on the other side face a spacious playground or park, or extensive [Note: ==== Beginning of page 166 ====] outlook from which and from their neighbors they are screened only by thickets and clumps of verdure to mask preliminary wire fences, rendering them as completely private as may be desired. The interiorneighborhood reserves and playgrounds are primarily for the benefit of the house immediately abutting them, and they are managed in each case by a local council committee of the residents using them, to afford to all the opportunity of individual initiative and neighborhood emulation in their improvement and use for any of the various purposes of recreation, play, child education, training and social gatherings. Large reserves, which face the public ways and waterways, are for the use of the suburbs as a whole, and will embrace sports ovals, golf links, yacht clubs and the like. The organizing of the chief one, the Country Club, is already in hand. Stone Construction The buildings throughout Castlecrag are of the native stone, rough hewn generally, and random set in Page 527 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagomassive walls, with windows in batteries protected with overhanging trellises and climbing plants. Most of the houses have flat concrete roofs which best suit the tiers of cliffs and provide flower terraces of creepers for the prospects from the successive levels above them. Novel standardized construction with solid floors, universal damp insulation, mortis-less joinery, folding windows, pivoted doors, rough wall textures and washable decorations, cool roofs and roof ventilation have been devised to bring the benefits of large-scale operation to supplement those of the comprehensive planning of these groups, which is thus made available to everybody in a position to appreciate. Progress Made Work at Castlecrag has been in progress a year, and the Postern and the Parapet (driveways) and the Cortile and Lookout (reserves) are accommodating new homes, twenty-one of which are already in hand. The construction of the Rampart, the Sortie Port, the Redoubt, the Bastion, and the Outpost ways, and the opening of their corresponding reserves, the Turret, the Keep, the Merlon, the Buttress, theSentry, is nearing completion.

It was especially important in Australia where class feelings create bad feeling and poor workmanship, but its form is equally important though in another way in America. For the transition from draftsman to independent practice is still difficult in America, the employer usually resenting his draftsman's notgiving his full time and strength to his employer, and the breaking into independent practice without an established clientele is a very precarious step for the draftsman to take, frequently with only one client in view. The unusual spirit in Griffin's office was conspicuous even to outsiders. I remember a member of a firm across the hall from us in Melbourne saying to me as I was leaving for home - \"Your draftsmen seemnever to go home.\" I replied, \"Well I do my best to make them.\" \"Yes,\" he said, \"I know.\" In contrast was the remark of Mr. [Note: Roy] Lippincott (a partner in the Griffin office) to a draftsman in an office he was sharing in Sydney in the early months in Australia, one who typically dawdled at his work and whose interest on Saturday was centered on the afternoon off. \"If I had as little interest in my work as you I [Note: The above text was typed on a separate piece of paper which was then pasted onto this page.] Page 528 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 168 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING .

[Note: ==== Beginning of page 170 ====] [Note: Continued from page 167] certainly would certainly get out of architecture.\" Of course in Australia the conditions are worse for there they have the apprentice system which gives the apprentice little hope of any kind. In the Griffin office any draftsman who got a client was treated of a member of the firm. He kept his time card andcontinued to get his salary insofar as he worked for the office. On his own work he got the commission and was completely responsible. If he wished the help in any of the other architects he paid them on the basis of a sum established to meet that situation, a wage the same as his own. This did not affect the normal arrangements made between them as architect and draftsman, but it put younger members on sound ground while still inexperienced. After Griffin's death and when I was returning to America it was at Mr. Nicholls's wish that the firm carries on in the name of Griffin and Nicholls with the name of the founder of the firm first. My complete confidence in my young partner made me very happy to have the Griffin tradition carried on in Australia. Looking back to the days following my graduation in architecture, after a year of drafting with my cousin [Note: Dwight H. Perkins] I went into an informal partnership with another [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright] of the Chicago school of architecture who had just started independent practice though he had in the mean time built several houses of no particular character, one half timber, etc. But now the influence of the Japanese, who had exhibited at Chicago's first World's Fair, was being felt among a number of the young Chicago architects. The first jobs turned out had been a flat building whose distinctivecharacteristic was a frieze almost identical with that of a building of Mr. [Note: Louis H.] Sullivan's the Page 529 of 923 of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofounder of modern architecture. Another flat building was a semi court scheme 2 stories high. Its low hip roof and eaves were of the Japanese type. The third was a dwelling again with the low hip roof, its plan still the colonial parallelogram with center entrance and stairway hall. It did however establish a sillline for the 2nd story windows which carried [Note: ==== Beginning of page 171 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . SECTION THROUGH LIVING & DINING ROOMS & CONSERVATORY . DEN BELOW [Note: In the New-York Historical Society's illustration, the names of Marion Mahony and Herman von Holst appear as the architects.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 172 ====] around the whole house giving it a real dignity worthy of the discipline he had been under with Mr. Sullivan. While this was going on I was told to make sketches for an abstract 2 story 3 bed-room house which I did. This gave me an experience of why the Chinese tipped up the overhanging eaves though expressed in modern scientific terms of forces of gravity instead of demons - a reality in whatever terms expressed. I guess I was never a conformist. Any [Note: Anyway?] it was a cruciform plan. Later on when I had left the office and Griffin was in partnership there an amazing thing happened. He told me one day several years later of his first experience there. A residential job had come into the office and the twomen went into a competition for it. He mentioned the name of the client and I was wide-eyed thinking he was going to say he won it. Why otherwise should a man be telling me about it. But he said he lost, and I laughed and told him that house had been built exactly in accordance with my design - that first one. It was a revolutionary design, abandoning the universal parallelogram, T shaped, and center reception entrance hall dropped to ground level. His losing in that competition was doubtless a unique experiencein that office. His revolutionizing of the work in that office was first expressed in the [Note: Frank W.] Thomas House. Later this architect went abroad. He asked me to take over the office for him. I refused. But after he had gone Mr. [Note: Herman] von Holst who had taken over asked me to join him so I did on a definite arrangement that I should have control of the designing, that suited him. When the absent architect didn'tbother to answer anything that was sent over to him the relations were broken and I entered into a partnership with von Holst and Fyfe. For that period I had great fun designing. While the construction of the home of Henry Ford was being carried on, presentation sketches were made for Mr. [Note: C.H.] Wills. At this period I too followed the Japanese feeling. It was not till a short time afterward, when I entered Griffin's office, that I realized the difference. [Note: The William A. Storrer Catalog Number (3rd edition, 2002) for the Thomas House is S.067.] Page 530 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 173 (table of contents) ====] CORNICE TREATMENT .

The frieze was almost a direct copy from this building of Sullivan's in whose office he had been trained. Throughout his practice it was he who followed others not they him. They were the creative ones. One wouldn't mind his taking up what inspired him but his claiming and publicity (made spicy by his scandals) stunned the movement, founded by Sullivan, in the United States for a quarter of a century. He was quick on the uptake, naturally artistic but never an architect though he claimed the whole Chicago School of architects as his disciples. He spent most of his life writing articles making these claims and really was a blighting influence on the group of enthusiastic creative architects of his generation. Only a quarter of a century later has any creative architecture in the United States escaped the blight of his self-centered publicity. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 175 ====] ARCHITECTURE & TOWN PLANNING INSEPARABLE. IMPORTANCE OF LOCATION ON LOT Our thoughts to be moral must conform to cosmic laws. We must not think personally where causes arecosmic. All forms in matter or thinking derive from the chemical ether which is the manifesting force as compared with the spiritualizing forces of warmth and light. It is the central region of America that is ruled by the chemical ether whose basic manifestation is liquidity with the centralizing force [Note: \"of gravity\" crossed out] forming hemi-spheres - that great Mississippi Valley - and there we find the founders of creative thinking in the arts, the modernists, Lois dance, George Bernard [Note: George Grey Barnard?] in sculpture, Leo Masters [Note: Edgar Lee Masters?] in poetry, Louis Sullivan in architecture, Walter Burley Griffin in Ground planning - town planning or whatever you choose tocall it, and so on. Though all new movements derive from one individual, since ideas arise in a human mind, when that has happened the way is open to all humanity to carry on and develop the work. The foundation has been laid. Louis Sullivan laid the foundation of modern architecture. His influence was felt as early in Europe as in America and even more powerfully there in the early decades.

Personal vanities and claims obstructed it here, especially the widely publicized braggadocio of one who did little but talked much. The necessity of preserving the life of the Earth is a prime duty in every field of life, in every occupation, and taking maximum advantage of its gifts is the task of the designer. The power of a conscientious consideration of all the elements of a problem was brought home to me when I saw the revolution in methods and results that took place when landscape was made a part of architecture. It meant not only a broadening of the view but a positiveness of action arising from the firm foundation of definite facts determining the general scheme before taking up details of internalrequirements. Landscape architecture does not mean gardening as an afterthought to a building but means a consideration of the external [Note: There is no page 176 in the Art Institute copy, though the number 176 appears at the end of the top paragraph on page 179.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 177 (table of contents) ====] DIAGRAMS OF ALTERNATE LOCATIONS OF THOMAS HOUSE [Note: Society's illustration diagrams Griffin's and Wright's \"Town Planning,\" i.e., their different placement of flats and a dwelling.

Not only natural conditions but the character of the surrounding buildings have sometimes to be taken advantage of, sometimes to be overcome. And wemust consider not the mere personal point but must look to the advantage to everyone affected, for it is curiously true that a thing to be a real and permanent advantage to one must be an advantage to Page 532 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoeveryone, just as in the animal or man a sound organ is of vital importance to all the organs. Human society is an organism, and the individual can benefit only from what is of benefit to all since all are interdependent as root, branch, leaf and blossom of tree. My first object lesson was the case of a house the working drawings of which had been completed, and accepted by the owner and the contract let when it was first subjected to the criticism from this fundamental stand-point, when Griffin entered into partnership with the architect [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright]. The lot was one next to a two-story flat building with its porch built close to the sidewalk line. Across the street from the flat building was a beautiful park. The house criticized was being set back onthe lot as if shrinking from an ugly thing of which it was afraid, leaving the greater part of the grounds to the front, allowing the other building to look over it destroying its privacy and shutting off from the client the delightful view opposite, the home garden dominated by this ugly building. A knowledge of the conditions of the surroundings led to the flat criticism that although the design was charming it was not the right answer, this was not the proper plan for the location, words which meantnothing to the designer who was only an architect, to whom town planning was a closed book. Griffin suggested that the living rooms be elevated above the eyes of the passer-by lifting the basement out of the ground, and that the house instead of being a parallelogram should be ell shaped, and that the whole building be [Note: ==== Beginning of page 180 ====] brought forward, one arm parallel to the street the other projecting forward alongside the flat building and so acting as a screen to the ugly mass thereby benefiting the whole avenue. This English basement type would make it high enough to conceal the flat building and would enable the projecting dining room to overlook the charming woods across the street, and also to get from dining room as well as living room windows a view of its own front garden, whilst the veranda and living room would attain privacy and look upon the graceful lines of the house itself instead of the ugly bulk of the adjacentbuilding. Concentration of stair and service portions where no outlook was necessary was without any disadvantage. In other words, the special conditions called for a special type. The new arrangement was worked out, the house built accordingly, and a most charming home it is. At the same time the high class character of the street as a whole was restored by this screening of this blot on the landscape. The benefit to one was a benefit to all. The ell-shaped form of this house established a new type in this office. On the whole in America as well as elsewhere a building, a residence, was a parallelogram. Nothing else was done. The Greek thinking had been back of this, a religious recognition of the 4th period of our present human cycle as the pyramid was the recognition of that 3rd, the Egyptian period. Once established the almost automatic thinking of our times flowed on in the same old groove. After all the mechanical is the idol of thepresent age so why not leave our minds to its tendency to work automatically. But this is the 5th Period. The parallelogram no longer suffices. Now this tradition was broken down. The plan was not necessarily a parallelogram and freer forms developed in this office to be carried on later when Griffin had a free hand in an endless variety of crystalline forms for he conceived of buildings not as facades but as three dimensional. Thus the creator Page 533 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothinks. We learn that there as many universes as there are crystalline forms, each created by a great primal Spirit of Mathematics. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 181 ====] Architecture is little understood at present. In the past it functioned through intuitive thinking guided by the Gods who do such marvelous things in forming nature. But now anyone who does a building is called an architect, [Note: Le] Corbusier, for instance, who is simply an engineer. His packing-box structures are not architecture at all. The engineer considers nothing but the material facts and consequently is bound to the past and never really solves problems. Others are temperamentally painters of pictures as was the other partner in this office, a scene painter who, to get effects, used whatstructural knowledge he had to defy nature rather than to work with it, as extremes of overhanging cornices, etc., often a heavy drain on his client's pocket-books. One might call it clowning, it certainly is not architecture. The solving of such problems, which is the basic temperament of a real architect, accomplishes the graceful effects desired by roofing his building in accordance with the requirements of the plan. He does not limit himself to a particular type, say the hip roof, as was the custom of this officeunder the influence of the Japanese with whose art America was just then becoming acquainted. If conditions of plan call for corner windows, such can be roofed with the hip whose support to the eye is the wall or pier which thus is set far back from the corner of the building taking away the snub nose effect. If the plan develops solid corners the use of the gable, whose thrusts are thus taken in a way satisfactory to the eye, is desirable. The carrying up of the fenestration into the peak of the gable givesthe esthetic satisfaction of purpose and richness. These things cannot, of course, be done by rule of thumb. Creative thinking may at any time find new solutions but one is not an architect unless the problem is solved. [Note: The paragraph below is crossed out in the Art Institute of Chicago's copy. It is very similar to a paragraph found on page 182.] An office building got the same town-planning treatment and made architectural history.

An interior court supplemented the external lighting and the massed exteriorwindows, treated as a unit, became a feature treated with consideration, and what is now called \"modern architecture\" was born. It took hold and swept the country only after the Tribune competition, some decades later, in which two architects who had won the two first prizes for the plan of Canberra, Griffin and [Note: Eliel] Saarinen, presented two designs solving the problem of lighting which is the distinctive requirement of modern times, now perhaps passing with modern inventions in lighting, andwhich includes light for the streets as well as the fenestration of the building.

The Eucalyptus Urnigera is a case, its bark completely red, so fiery that paint cannot reproduce it. It was like a flame shooting up to meet the setting sun. In the nearby gully we see a pure white-barkedHaemastoma called scribbly gum because always in its soft bark you find the writing of the fairies cut out be some slave insect of theirs to bring messages to the children of Australia to many of whom seeing the fairies comes quite naturally as it does to the Irish. It took my mother some time on her visit to Australia to adjust herself so that she could enjoy their beauty. At first they shocked her they looked so naked. I am afraid she was a Mid-Victorian. Seeing this tree at sunset I could not resist painting it so but the color is there in the bark and no reflection of the sun's glow. Of all Lucifer's cohorts who painted this earth so magnificently, the angel who painted Australia was the greatest artist of them all. Not just great bunches of solid green but the rich intermingling of colors in the barks, in the leaves and in the groups, and since it is the trees and shrubs that are the showy blossomersinstead of the herbaceous plants as with us, all through the year the infinitely varied and subtle shades of the flowers add their quota to the rich color.

EUCALYPTUS URNIGERA - TASMANIA [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.] SCENIC MARINE SUBURB OF MIDDLE HARBOR Unique in beauty and design, the scenic marine suburb of Castlecrag, has brought the loveliness of Middle Harbor within easy reach of the City of Sydney. In the early days it was served by fast modern motor buses running at short intervals to and from Wilson's Point. With the completion of the bridge it became only 20 minutes from the heart of the city. Castlecrag, Covecrag and Castlecove are the picked portions of that mighty amphitheatre which stretches down to the rocky shores, wooded coves and charming inlets of Sydney's finest reach of water. Designed to preserve all the remarkable natural features - outlooks, cliffs, waterfalls, fern valleys, foreshores, birds and animals - the covenant under which all lots are sold and homes built enforces town ideals of suburban development entirely novel to Sydney, with landscape architecture which harmonizeswith its exquisite setting. In its unspoiled grandeur Middle Harbor vies with the world-famous Riviera, Italian Lakes and Norwegian fiords. Other branches of Port Jackson have been marred by ugly gridirons of glaring red roofs and scarring streets, and the wonderful foreshores have been alienated and ruined. Seeking the pathway of least resistance, the City of Sydney has pushed its crowded suburban chessboards to the very portals of thegreat stone and wooded heights which look across the Harbor to French's Forest and Manly. Fortunately it has been halted there. Some years ago the genius of Walter Burley Griffin, Architect and Town Planner, saw the amazing possibilities of the three virgin promontories on the Western side of Middle Harbor, with their glorious 5 miles of water frontage. His enthusiasm inspired a group of Australian capitalists amongst hisprofessional clients, and [Note: ==== Beginning of page 185 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . ERIC PRATTEN . SYDNEY .

This building is a partof nature not an irreverent defiance of it. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 187 ====] [Note: Continued from page 184] the magnificent amphitheatres passed into the hands of Greater Sydney Development Association Limited. This is literally a case where the last is the best, for here is the only Harbor frontage free from the threat of commerce and quite out of the field of industrial expansion now in evidence in every otherdirection. It is the only waterside development that can and will be protected against flats. Twice as high as the Sydney observatory and the heights of the South shore of our Harbor, these narrow headlands rise above the mists and possess the bright easterly seaward aspect sheltered from the bleak winds. Their conformation in ledges is the ideal for successive tiers of stately homes, and the sandstone substructure of these ledges affords the most elegant of all building materials. It alsoconstitutes a district free of wind and dust, also perfectly drained beneath as to water and above as to cooling currents of air, so that the temperature and humidity are the most equable - even precluding frost - all the conditions for the best health. Castlecrag, four miles from Circular Quay, is named from towering rock. It has become a scenic Suburb which surpassed any other in the Commonwealth, and ninety aesthetic dwellings in stone have been planned or erected. As the dominant motif throughout has been the preservation of nature, emphasis may be justly placed on the treasures so carefully conserved. The flora is diversified and rich, representing possibly the most multifarious collections in any country. Ironbarks, flowering gums, cypress pines, honeysuckles, grevillias and heather, brilliant masses of wild flowers - these are noted atrandom in a stroll through the trees. More than 500 choice native plants are yearly planted out from the nursery. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 188 (table of contents) ====] TERRACED DWELLING .

A plan has been approved for a scenic Marine Drive which will skirt the foreshores between the Suspension Bridge and the Roseville Bridge when the roads are connected up. The round drive will give twenty-four miles of perfectly graded enduring surface. Superb examples of the skill of surveyor and landscape designer are afforded by the many highways through the vast estates. These have made easily accessible many heights and valleys which at first must have seemed shut off from human habitation. AtCovecrag, for instance, there is a gently sloping ascent - top gear to any car - and on its summit the visitor can look down 330 sheer feet at a flawless panorama. The thoroughfares are carved out of bed-rock and are finished in bituminous concrete or rolled blue stone asphalt, with ample width for pedestrians and vehicles, with every now and again a circular terminal way to serve as halting place or turning point. So cleverly inlaid are the roads that when lookedat from above they have almost merged into the foliage through which they pass. In order to provide short cuts for pedestrians embowered lanes intersect the main highways, thus facilitating movement from crest to waterfront. As the services and utilities of all the homes are supplied from the rear of each, the roads are not disfigured by poles and wires nor is the splendid road surface continually dug up to provide conveniences for new homes.

COMMANDING VALLEY VIEW [Note: The structure is the Fishwick House.] Page 538 of 923 Supplement to America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 192 ====] Ample public reserves have been made throughout Castlecrag, apart from the innumerable small parks and play-grounds intended for the benefit of the houses immediately abutting. The gratifying way inwhich these little neighborhood reserves are made to play their part in the creating of a community spirit will be touched on when considering social interests. In keeping with the idea of a Castle (Castlecrag) the roads and public reserves on that promontory have been given appropriate names - such as The Sortie Port and The Battlement in the case of Highways, and the Turret and Keep in the case of reserves. Other names suggest attractions peculiar to the areas. Inthe Gargoyle Reserve a rushing waterfall spouts out suddenly as it does in those old time fountains in which the mouth of a weird head serves as an outlet. Half a mile of creek frontage gives its title to the Watergate and a rockery lookout characterizes the Oriel. The Embrasure is surmounted by an overhanging ledge and forms a sheltered fern \"loge\" with a \"parquet\" playground, a waterfall and forest. Cool and restful the Retreat is the bed of a sylvan valley. Other reserves are distinguished byplaygrounds, lookouts, pulpit rocks, grottos, cascades and glades. All the recreation reserves form a single system and are connected throughout by a network of pathways, passes and shaded lanes. They are designed to perpetuate the delightful rambles which were a feature of Castlecrag before its development. An incalculable asset has been the segregation of four miles of water frontage, a common reserve to all the lot holders. Sports grounds, open air theatres,ovals, golf links, tennis courts, football grounds, etc. have been provided for by the wise foresight which has marked every detail of these Garden suburbs of Middle Harbor. The Golf links, which have been established on Castlecove offer [Note: ==== Beginning of page 193 (table of contents) ====] THREE PROMONTORIES OF CASTLECRAG [Note: ==== Beginning of page 194 ====]a sporting course of 18 holes within 5 miles of the heart of Sydney. It is characteristic of the Company's determined idealism that tempting private offers to buy this land and lay out the links have been refused. It was typical again of the new spirit that both Castlecrag and Covecrag should have been made sanctuaries of native life, vigilant protection being extended to the birds, opossums, porcupines andsoon, it is expected, native bears. Community spirit is a rare and delicate plant but it has made vigorous growth at Castlecrag and its roots go deeper every year. This has been partly due to the unifying and binding power of a common ideal, partly to the lead given by Mr. and Mrs. Griffin and the first house builders, and partly to the co-operation (necessary for the control and improvement) of immediate residents. Naturally a friendlyrivalry correspondingly stimulates a sectional camaraderie. Page 539 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoGenerous provision has been made by the Company in connection with the Community Club. Two valuable lots near the entrance to the suburb have been set aside for Club purposes and a most ambitious Club house and theatre combined will be erected. This Club home will be circular and the theatre willhave a revolving stage. In the building there will also be a kindergarten, gymnasium, billiard room, library, tea room, dancing floor, orchestra space and a roof garden. The open air theatres in both scenic suburbs will also advance music, drama and education while serving recreational purposes. Special care has been given to the planning of the area at Covecrag devoted to the future Civic Center for Local and Educational institutions, libraries, clubs, theatres, schools and churches. It is expected that the fruits of this care will set a standard for every suburb in Greater Sydney. There are two monumental Shopping Centers provided for Covecrag forming the entrances to the exclusively residential areas from the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 195 (table of contents) ====] INCINERATOR [Note: The structure may be the St. Kilda Incinerator, St. Kilda, Victoria.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 196 ====] massive stone pillars, with effective electric lanterns. Although the first few houses built at Castlecrag to provide needed accommodation were architecturally perfect and skillfully suited to blend with the landscape, they cannot fairly be compared with later handsome homes nor with even more ambitious dwellings approved for erection shortly. But they served three most useful purposes. They proved the absolute suitability and beauty of the sandstone on the estate and justified its stipulation; they pointed the way to obtain the greatest possible living room view of harbor and forest; and they introduced wholly delightful labor saving devices. Castlecrag buildings are of native sandstone which has been quarried on the estate or taken from the allotment itself. The stone is generally rough hewn and random set in massive walls, with windows in batteries, protected by overhanging trellises and climbing plants. So far as the future of these scenic marine suburbs is concerned, the progress made and the wide interest shown have already insured success. Four fifths of the land on Castlecrag has been sold, and the vastmajority of buyers intend to put up their own houses as quickly as possible. With the Harbor bridge built both suburbs have become closer than most North Shore resorts to Sydney and far closer in distance and time than other popular and fashionable suburbs. While there is no standard of comparison possible in the Commonwealth, similar developments in the United States have been financially and socially successful - often beyond all expectation.

You can't drive a nail into these woods. But many of them are very beautiful for cabinet work. Though Australia has no such autumn splendor as we yet when the rains come the gum tips, the new foliage, makes a wonderful show and everybody is out gathering gum tips for home decoration. On the southern coast of Tasmania where alone in Australia they have winter as well as summer the flora seems to be especially varied. Only here can the children experience winter as well as summer, the 4 seasons, but still everything is evergreen. The plant life of the world having originated about the south pole in Australia still holds to the ancient custom of being evergreen through the year. We find broad leaved evergreens, the leaves of endless sizes and shapes. Stupid Europeans insist at times in planting deciduous trees in their midst but they go dead every year and spoil the landscape. In the wrong placeand surroundings they lose the beauty they have in the regions to which they belong. Here we see one of the lovely Leptospermum shrubs, the Persiciflorum, the peach blossomed Ti.

New Zealand is as different from Australia as they both are from the United States. Griffin had already revolutionized Australia in various realms.

With the Capitol Theatre he started the sky scrapers and with the theatre itself established a standard which still leads the world in unique design, indirect lighting and sumptuous beauty. The ten story building but broke the ice for sky-scrapers in the American sense. With Leonard Chambers he defied the bureaucracy by running glass in pattern between the two corner piers of the building from the entrance canopy to roof level. The law required window sills 2'6\" from the floor. With the Cafe Australia and its sumptuous elegance - \"real gold tile,\" etc. - competition forced the fly-ridden holes of restaurants to climb toward its standards. With Mount Eagle Estate on the hill side he had defied the surveyors and attained a subdivision in accord with nature. With Pholiota he had defied the municipal authorities and won his battle for a minimum cost dwelling - a standard not yet met anywhere else in the world - minimum cost with maximum elegance. He had trained a number of young men in Architecture just as Mr. James Alexander Smith was continually doing with young engineers.

[Note: ==== Beginning of page 202 ====] [Note: Continued from page 199]They were winning competitions and establishing their practices, for Griffin had established a new form of partnership. Any draftsman who had reached a point where a client had come to him did not have to work on the sly with them but could become a partner in the firm, using time and office and any assistance the other partners could give on equal terms, the time measured on the rate of \u00a37 a week. This Page 542 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosafeguarded the quality of the output but the name of only the one partner was used on the particular job. By the end of six years with the Federal Capital, when the plan was gazetted, i.e., no deviation could be made without an act of Parliament, Griffin's work was centering in New South Wales so he closed theMelbourne office and centered in Sydney. Pholiota that we had never thought of as a selling proposition was advertised one day and sold the next. When the owner's work called him to West Australia, Griffin released him from his contract. The house was advertised for sale and sold the next day. Eric Nicholls came up with him and now, since Griffin's death in India, carries on the office and its traditions as the firm of Griffin and Nicholls. His story is remarkable too. As a blond youth just out ofManual Training school he dropped into the office looking for a job. A look at his lettering was enough for me, so I told him to come in again, I thought he could be useful to Mr. Griffin. \"I think so,\" he said. He was. Nicholls was an exquisite draftsman. One day he was sitting out doors sketching the facade of the club house Griffin had done for the Chinese Quo Min Tang [Note: Kuomintang] in Melbourne. An old man came along and watched him, recounting to him what great artists the Chinese were, etc., etc.He finally could not resist saying Mr. Griffin of the Federal Capital was the designer of this intriguing facade. Our latest client was Mr. Kanevsky [Note: Nisson Leonard-Kanevsky], a Russian Jew, who had landed in Melbourne with one shilling. He wanted Griffin to be his architect for a clothing manufacturing industry. Would Mr. Griffin please [Note: ==== Beginning of page 203 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . CASTLECRAG . Eric M.

When the day came for this deposit Griffin was out of town so I drew the money from the Page 543 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobank. Before the option was up he had sold it for \u00a32000 and used it to get an option on a site in the heart of the city one block from the central and only Railway station in Melbourne. Now he wanted to erect an office building on it. Would the Metropolitan Insurance Co. lend him the money for it. They would not.Sketches were proceeding in the office. He scoured around and came back with guaranteed tenants for all seven stories. The Insurance Co. assured him a solid sum. Mr. Abrahams, a wealthy money lender lent him enough more but at a very high rate of interest. The office was driving out the working drawings. Nicholls was established on the ground with a drafting table and stool and went up with the building. Everybody else in the office was too rushed to go near him. Everybody on the building was on tenter hooks. The contractor fearing he had bid too low was trying to scrimp on the quality of the work, the money lenders scared they would lose all, everybody snarling at everybody but all centering around Nicholls. This infant sat there making detail drawings, settling every conflict, requiring everybody to live up to the letter of his undertakings, never ruffled and, at the end a perfect and perfectly finished building - a show building in Melbourne, the finest building yetconstructed in Australia, and everybody his friend. What a thing it is to be born a Saturnian! Griffin had had a two years' fight with Melbourne's Municipal Council to get the drawings passed. When at the other end of the story Griffin had gone to India leaving Nicholls in charge in Australia the first thing he did was to begin to collect back moneys due. Presently the list was closed and he wrote Griffin - \"Is there anyone else that owes you money? If so send me the name and I'll clear it up.\" [Note: ==== Beginning of page 206 ====] But he had already cleared them up. And now that Griffin is taking a holiday in the supersensible realms Nicholls carries on - Griffin and Nicholls. In Castlecrag itself there is more than another man's lifetime's work to be done.

Four massive piers form a loggia from which three Page 544 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoFrench doors and two windows open into the house which really has no hall, but a circuit around the fireplace. This arrangement made it possible one stormy night to give the whole of the Christmas play in the house very effectively, a play which normally filled the whole Haven Valley with its shepherds andkings and angels. The audience sat on the floor along the east wall of the whole house. Three steps down from the street level gives a lovely bank around the entrance way, the rest of the front being a tiny patch of lawn surrounded by all-evergreen tree and thicket shrubbery concealing the house completely from the street, a bower of loveliness throughout the year. Once, before the fig climber on the wall had grown so large, I came home to find the whole facade studded with children standing onthe projecting stones of the rough local sandstone, the baby on a low stone, the other youngsters all over all the way up to the top. They gave me a good laughing welcome home. The succession of fruits and flowers here was wonderful as all over the place, practically all native except some herbaceous annuals and perennials, mostly the latter. The young Eucalyptus in the corner of house and garage became in a few years a tall spreading tree, no menace to a house with a concrete roofand whose floor is built solid on the ground. ART AND NATURE or NATURE AND THE HOUSE. Walter Burley Griffin A subject of such appalling scope requires a still further broadening to the fundamentals before considering the particular topic. Nature of course includes entire creation but, aiming its infinite subdivisions, one only is distinguished for a limited local self government not under control directly,and inasmuch as what is here undertaken [Note: ==== Beginning of page 210 (table of contents) ====] PLAN OF 56 THE PARAPET BUT IN KNITLOCK [Note: The \"caption\" to this illustration may be on page 222.] [Note: There is no page 211 in the Art Institute of Chicago copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 212 ====] [Note: Continued from page 209] involves the relation between this division and all the rest we can call it Man-Art , and to the remainder apply the name of the whole - Nature . NATURE - In observing Nature we can see that she automatically obeys invariable laws which we study for inanimate things - physics and chemistry; for animate things - biology and instinct. And we can see that the result is invariably complete, perfect. It is physically reasonable to the intellect and to the higher senses ethically right and eminently fitting or beautiful. Page 545 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoART - On the other hand natural manifestation through Man, called Art, depends upon man's limited perception of Law, Truth or the Spirit of Nature. He falls back on one or more of his faculties, his memory or the knowledge of accumulated experience, his intellect which attempts to reason and on hisemotions which feel for the ethic or the aesthetic, or often apparently on chance circumstance alone, in ignorance of the use of his faculties. Needless to say the result is always defective in one or more of the phases, never perfect. ARCHITECTURE - Realizing that Nature's works may be perfect for their purposes, yet man has not sought to reach perfection by taking nature as a model. His problems are different and characteristic ofhim alone. With tools he augments his physical ability - he moves on wheels, he eats his food cooked, in society he attempts to institute justice in place of force such as he can see in vogue among the ants and bees, and for his shelter, instead of imitating trees, hives, gopher-holes or nests, he invents a unique house. DESIGN - In creating then the things for his own house man is thrown upon his own resources and his training should involve a knowledge of man's progress up to his time, the logical power of deducing principles from those facts and the intuitive faculty of feeling rectitude, fitness, beauty. Our recent modern development has, beyond doubt, terribly slighted the last phase - this emotional creative perception, and the first steps in bringing Art nearer to Nature's degree of perfection. In other words to harmonize Art with [Note: ==== Beginning of page 213 (table of contents) ====] INTERIOR OF 56 THE PARAPET LOOKING TOWARD THE DINING ROOM [Note: The \"caption\" to this paragraph may be on page 219.] LAWN FACADE .

(CAPTION - with photo, PLAN in knitlock of 56 The Parapet which was built in stone.) The test of the pudding is in the eating. Our life and the life of the community in this dwelling was proof to the hilt. The house filled the 60' of the lot except for a 3' passage at either end. Every room but one had outlook to the valley view. One might call the house versatile since at various times it met perfectly totally differenttypes of occupants - the normal type requiring 3 bed-rooms, ourselves requiring none, our successors Page 546 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagousing two bed-rooms. Perfect for each and all and on emergency tucking away for the night whoever might want to stay. With us there was no bed-room furniture. Box couches served for storing seasonal household things or dramatic supplies, these as well as the other things to Griffin's design; desksserving equally well as dressers, etc. The so-called maid's room was the office, the room opposite was the library, the 3rd bed-room was a music room to the South of the living room, the dining room to the North. The three formed one room. Endless cushions for use as well as beauty. [Note: In the New-York Historical Society copy this paragraph is affixed to the verso of the illustration on page 207 (table of contents).] ................ HANDIWORK - Man's handiwork should embody all the virtues omitting none in any example unless it be considered a temporary makeshift, and that under stress of circumstances it may be more important that an article be useful rather than beautiful. As between his habitation, its contents and its environment, the things he cannot get away from, that are an intimate and constant feature of his existence, there canbe no such qualification. Furthermore in the furnishing, the decorating as well as in the structure and also in the surrounding land, the street, the entire city, the same sort of problem is presented and the same sort of training demanded of the designer. There never was an essential partition of labor up to the time of [Note: Lancelot (Capability)?] Brown in the early 19th century when the lack of seriousness with which landscape gardening had come to betreated had in the search [Note: ==== Beginning of page 216 ====] for simplicity come to a theory that if wild nature could attain her ideal for her purpose man could by selection and refinement make his own ideal, and a school of practitioners sprang up qualified, through knowledge of nature's traits and tricks, to displace the native designer. This unfortunate distinction persists especially in America without all the old difference to be sure. But while city parks arefashioned on the lines of the wild grove only to be profaned by the incongruous throngs, it is plain that we do not yet sufficiently appreciate that the proper study of mankind is man. Architects must broaden to cope with the design of grounds, streets, and city or countryside where man is involved. The present landscape gardener must make his scope include the building and its furniture, even to book covers and tea spoons, for creative work can accomplish results by subordination, not by division of responsibility. ZONING - The beginning of house design is in the group, and fundamentally the grouping of groups which has so rarely been attempted that we are at a loss to point out a single example. But for unethical systems of land tenure some classification might be self evident but speculative holdings and buildings have jumbled county and city together inextricably. It is possible however to contemplate what should and could be. In the city proper at points in immediate touch with the business center and where concentration requires heights of more than two or three stories the flat apartments are the only type fit for hygienic private and comfortable life and for proper arrangement of them the block is the required unit .

In the third zone the 50ft. lot permits the 1st individual design and the 75 to 100ft. lot is the legitimate field for the first individual design standing free, a home worth bothering with a rapid [Note: ==== Beginning of page 217 (table of contents) ====] RIDGE QUADRANGLES .

The 4th zone for which alone it should be necessary to submit to excavating Railway time schedules should aspire to country life with acre property, in places not less than 2 acres. What the arrangements and systems of intercommunication for such groups as just outlined should be, involves as infinite variety as the analogous problems inside the building. If city streets were preparedfor retirement with terminals at intervals on intersecting streets or even ranged as courts such as have occasionally been tried, one could build for a degree of quiet with certainty of freedom from encroachment of commerce of the thoroughfares.

[Note: In the New-York Historical Society copy this \"caption\" paragraph is affixed to the verso of the illustration on page 213 (table of contents).] THE FREESTANDING HOUSE - In the localities of the free standing house in the suburbs, roads would expect and recognize the presence of mankind and not affect wildwood meanders which each structure must insult by its intrusion while, in the country town, roadbeds not over 12ft. wide would suggest themselves in lieu of presumptuous avenues emulating the metropolis. Granting that many of the fundamental evils are now ineradicable, practically it is still not too late to supplement our public surveyor with a director of public improvements capable of judging from the artist's as well as the engineer's point of view the incessant questions of grade, building line, street trees, etc. DOMAIN OF THE INDIVIDUAL - Moreover whatever may be the obstacles to extending plan as architecture to street, square and parks and their grouping up to the countryside and interurban communication, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 220 ====] we can hope for an extension as far as the border of the individual's domain. Essentially the design of the house begins at the lot line for though either house or garden may excite interest, neither alone can impress, and it is in impression, with art as with nature, that its message is imparted. No house is half complete without plant life. Flowers with their direct appeal are our most potent esthetic educators and need be dispensed with in no dwelling entirely nor need they be relegated to the exterior but included in the interior since, anywhere, sufficient light and air to sustain man's health will support the plant. CAPTION - with photo - Central Court - Atrium Villa with Chinese lantern The central court of a house in a moderate climate eliminates the need for any hallways. As gardens grow on the garden side of the promenades they become as completely private as desired. Such a court destroys all feeling of being shut in and can present many charming features, garden, pool, lantern, statuary, etc. [Note: This \"caption\" is not in the New-York Historical Society's copy.]COURTS AND ROOFS - Open and surrounded courts and the roofs of apartment buildings are available for growing plants.

When, as is general with us, custom has decreed open front yards the respectful treatment of this street court is as a lawn panel in the highway border, part of a tree lined avenue ornamented with such shrubs or plants in urns as are in feeling with the architecture.

Maintenance with but slight attention, only a small degree more expensive with our semi-suburban plots for actual useful lawn (none other iscalled for). A simple garden will help pay for itself.

EUCALYPTUS & PITTOSPORUM [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.] AN UNDERSTANDING OF CLASS FELLINGWith the coming of the Christ, races ceased to exist though physical characteristics hang over for the physical body is inherited, but a task remains for human beings to fulfill and that is the breaking down of classes as they now exist for they no longer have any real foundation but only a purely artificial one which is deadly in its influence on human nature. In its place there should now develop a far greater range of individuality even far greater than any difference that ever existed between races. With a National Abilities Organization established, enabling abilities to develop to the utmost, individuals will naturally function in the fields in which they have ability but without the penalizing of certain types of ability as is done in our totalitarian states. The Equity Organization will see to that. To bring this about the bitterness between groups must cease to exist in the understanding of the fact that a problem cannot be solved from one angle but only when all elements are given equal considerationand the problem solved to the mutual advantage of all parties. With almost the first Christmas in Castlecrag, it became apparent that a little creative thinking was called for in the way of celebrating this most sacred festival. The people of Australia had already abandoned dealing with it as an indoor family gathering but, in taking to the outdoors on this universal midsummer holiday, it had entirely lost the feeling of a celebration with any significance. So, as there was as yet buta handful of children in Castlecrag itself, we decided to gather the youngsters of the environing district. To wipe out any possibility of hurt feelings, we sent out announcements that there would be an outdoor Christmas party to which all the children would be welcome, and suggested that parents desiring their children to take part should send a shilling for each child's present from the tree.

The structure is Pholiota, Heidelberg (Melbourne), Victoria.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 232 ====] [Note: Continued from page 229]This made it possible for us to know what our numbers would be and the age of the children. For several years we used the rock terraces and the interior reserve between and below two of the stone residences, and chose as the Christmas tree a Banksia Ericifolia growing on these rocks, and decorated it, frosted it by dipping the tips in water and then in flour, and hung festoons and balloons on the bushes round about, had Santa Claus, songs, bonfires and children's dances on the rocky terraces, dramatictableaus, and ice cream for all. They were spectacularly beautiful. Every year the numbers attending increased till we had over a thousand and found the children were beginning to come from distant suburbs to which the fame of these parties had spread. Then, but not really because of the numbers, though that made a big task for the handful of Castlecraggers who had been in charge but because of the wrong spirit manifested from the first, but which we had hoped to dispel, a feeling which was one ofthose many evidences of the insidious consequences of the existence of classes in a community. For instead of the feeling of camaraderie and the wholesome give and take of people who gathered together on even terms, it was always apparent, and we realized the method we were using would not break it down, that Castlecrag was looked upon as an over-lord, an upper class from whom you got or grabbed all you could. There was indeed no Christmas feeling growing out of it but only the increasing of afeeling of class bitterness. Again we saw coming to the fore that dominating spirit in Australia of eagerness to get something for nothing, which is the inevitable outcome of the existence of classes, naturally, as the most honored are those who get without giving. It can't be otherwise in an Imperial system. One year we planned to have the celebration around a beautiful [Note: ==== Beginning of page 233 ====] Page 554 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagospecimen of the New South Wales native Christmas bush - the Ceratophillum Cummiferum with its acrescent blossoms some changing from white through pink to red. So we put up a sign, - \"Please preserve for the Christmas Party.\" But they mangled and stripped it just the same, perhaps with all themore gusto. We were having terrific struggle to preserve the native shrubbery for on the whole Australians think they are doing a service to humanity in destroying everything that God and the fairies have created and for anyone to try to preserve it labels them as belonging to a different class so we could not but feel that much of the depredation of the succeeding years was done in malice though of course we knew that much was carelessness. Once we watched a man on the crest of the next promontory and12 fires followed in his wake. No use to try to catch him. He would be gone before we could possibly get there even by car. Nor on the whole would it be wise to try to punish anything of this sort or the whole community back of us would join burning us up. So fifteen years have been spent in diplomacy, in chasing and talking with the private individuals who passed through, for our promontories really serve as a national park for the packed districts beyond our boundary line. It has made a difference bit by bit in those years during which we nearly ran our legs off and fought fires till our hearts refused to function. Indeed Griffin gave his life to the preservation of those beautiful Middle Harbor promontories for one night after putting out a fire he stepped, in the pitch dark, over a precipice and fell on a rock his full weight on his right ribs and was put to bed for two weeks. Some time later he suddenly was caught with excruciating agony for which the doctors could get no clue forby every test he was a perfectly well man. The pain was just where the blow had struck and when they came to find if I had any clue I told them what I thought must be the cause. They operated and found a ruptured bladder [Note: gallbladder?].

In Willoughby, of the whole forest, not a tree remained. It was a weird idea to them but by the time the next generation came along it was easier for them to understand and now the streams of people that go through every week rarely have any flowers or branches in their hands. The ones who come to gather dead wood still set fires toreplenish their supplies but at last after these many years the fire department will help put out bush fires thanks to the work of the Societies that have grown up through the increasing interest in the native flora, and our citizenry has increased so that on the whole fires are early reported and quickly put out. The upper level had been reduced to absolute desert, for its natural resources had supplied the whole of Willoughby with timber and firewood and building stone and sand and soil till it was stripped bare. Onecould see why a people trained to think it was man's right to get things for nothing would be resentful of anyone's coming in and presuming to prevent their helping themselves. But now through chasing cows and chasing people and planting hundreds of seedlings, it is beginning to vie with the lower terraces in loveliness. No wonder the fairies occasionally show themselves to Castlecrag children. The class feeling showed itself again in the pulling up by the roots of our street plantings almost as fast as we could put them in, but we gradually learned to put them among other bits of native stuff where they wouldn't catch the eye. Although the word \"class\" is used in America, an American really has no idea of the meaning of the word. Class feeling arises only when [Note: ==== Beginning of page 237 (table of contents) ====] ENTRANCE VERANDA OF CASA BONITA [Note: The structure is the Mower House.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 238 ====] Case Bonita too can tell a story of how people can live in a minimum cost house. You can take your choice between two ways. First it was the home of Mr. and Mrs. Junge with their son Theo, truly a gift of the Gods. Theirs was a quiet life. Each had the soul of an artist which expressed itself in each detail of their living whether en famille or in entertaining their friends. Due to the castellated form of the columnar structural members of the knitlock house and the way they were treated above the roof in the formation of the parapet this tiny house from across the valley lookedas important and as interesting as a castle, as the stone castle on another of the promontories which was Page 556 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagophotographed and used as the ancestral homestead in England for an Australian moving picture, \"For the Term of His Natural Life.\" The whole allotment on which Casa Bonita stood is a series of rocky terraces. In building no injury was done to any of the natural features. The garage was built, naturally, on the level of the street. It is a pleasant room itself with a bay with a bank of windows opening to the East, and during the day Mrs. Junge used it as a work shop for her weaving and metal work. When I lived there it was my drafting room with a huge drafting board in the bay. When we were giving dramas it was the dressing room. The group of windows on its East sidegave it fine light and a beautiful outlook. [Note: The word \"Caption\" is at the top of the page in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 239 ====] [Note: Continued from page 236] there is an established upper class, recognized by law, as a consequence of which certain elements in the community get advantages arising purely from their positions. However different it may have been inancient times, in the present time there is no service rendered as an equivalent for such privilege. Today titles are usually given or at any rate offered as bribes to play the game with officialdom. Then there truly arises a working class (in contradistinction to an upper class) who feel greater and greater bitterness that they have to work for what they get while the most honored and respected elements in thecommunity are heaped with benefits for which they give nothing in return. As this feeling was deeplyrepugnant to us the Christmas parties were abandoned. Of course one finds snobbery in America as well as elsewhere but it has no significance. It has no power. Again in the Progress Association, we had a similar experience though we never gave up the fight there and now after some fifteen years have to a certain extent broken it down in connection with ourselves. The mere fact that Griffin was controlling the development of a considerable area, and that it wasapparent from the beginning that he was developing it on lines that would prevent it from becoming a slum, to our surprise, was like waving a red flag before a bull. The covenant did not require expensive houses, indeed several of them cut under the cost of the usual slummy types, but they were all beautiful and harmonious with the local materials and colors. Since in the early stages we were necessarily only a part of a municipality because of lack of sufficient population and could not form a municipality of our own, though our area was sufficient, there were some of the essential things which we had to submit to the Willoughby Council. For, although we paid for the construction of our roads in this 700 acreage, there were within it already some Council [Note: \"Progress Association\" - a group organized to promote improvements to the community. The Castlecrag Progress Association was formed in 1925.] Page 557 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 240 ====] roads though still unpaved, as for instance Edinburgh Road on the crest of the first promontory which was the only possible entrance to it. So our citizenry inaugurated a Progress Association to include aconsiderable area already thickly settled, extending West to the north and south thoroughfare - High Street. These meetings of the Progress Association were a curious experience to us in those early days. A fair number rolled up to the meetings which promptly developed into a real one-sided class war for the mere fact that men lived in our part where pleasant and sightly houses were being built and where every painwas being taken to preserve instead of destroy the native bush, meant that whatever was suggested was looked upon with suspicion and fought by those who considered themselves as \"working class people.\" You see in America people don't look upon themselves as \"working class people.\" These self-styled working class people did not think of themselves simply as citizens of the district with common needs for paved thoroughfares, electric lighting, sidewalks, gas supply, transportation, etc., butcontinually complained that it was always Castlecraggers who were given the official positions as if their interests were different from ours. They threatened to pack the meetings for elections to which we of course replied - \"Go ahead; bring as many members as you wish, the more the better. That's just what we want. Get your majority and use it to select whomsoever you please.\" But that never happened. One might say only the rambunctious, fiery individuals would come to the meetings at all. Our persistence,however, during fifteen years has made the Association effective in bringing about various improvements advantageous to everyone in the community, such as the completion of a new North and South thoroughfare (to which Griffin dedicated free of cost 200 feet of Castlecrag frontage, the Eastern Valley Highway, which will enormously improve transportation facilities for the whole district. The Association continue to function for the district and the class feeling is not [Note: ==== Beginning of page 241 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . 183 THE BARBETTE .

Give us time and we'll make democrats of those Australians yet. The method I hope to make effective is by making the United States into a democracy to serve as an example, bymaking it trinitarian instead of totalitarian. Another instance, but significant, was amusingly illustrated by a minister who, each week-end almost, for a long time used to bring friends of his up to see what was going on and always stood for a while in front of our house to dilate in loud tones so that we would be sure to hear, on the absurdity of such a building. His profession gave him great versatility and picturesqueness in these diatribes. Of course, tous it was apparent that he must have found our buildings very interesting or he would not be coming to see them over and over again. About two years later after a lapse of his visits, he came again with a group of his friends and, being in the yard myself, I asked them if they would not like to come in and see the house from the inside. So in they came and I showed them around. He said to me that he used to come to see these houses and didn't like them at all but somehow he had grown to like them, which Iexplained to him by saying we quite understood that anything different was always a shock to the human mind and in our business, which was pioneering, we took that for granted but we realized also that if a thing was the right answer to a problem it was not long before the people realized that and began to approve. Bertha Merfield, one of Australia's finest mural decorators, told me of the contemptuous way the English were in the habit of treating \"colonials\" when they visited England. She did not like it. But one of her rich friends when I asked her how she enjoyed her visit there said - \"Very much.\" I asked how she liked the way they treated Australians. She said - \"O! They didn't know I was an Australian.\" She had managed to conceal that fact. I asked her how she felt about having to conceal her nationality in order to be treated [Note: ==== Beginning of page 244 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . KNITLOCK . MR.

I had Page 559 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobeen introduced in her shop to a woman who was a florist, by a friend of hers and had gone to her shop and had chatted with her on various occasions. One Sunday, as Mr. Griffin and I were taking a walk through the botanical gardens, I saw her coming toward us and I am sure she saw us but, as she camenearer, she turned away and didn't look at us. I could see that it was deliberate and realized that she, a shop keeper, looked upon herself as belonging to an inferior class, resented it but didn't take the risk of bowing to us and being snubbed by our not returning her greeting. I met so many people at Castlecrag that I made a habit of bowing to most of the passers by. But no friendly return greeting unless there had been a formal introduction. But I preferred that to the risk ofappearing to snub someone I had met. - Typically British! Class! I had found that even in Australia, which is supposed to be democratic, it was quite the custom for people to manifest their own feeling of superiority by such snubs. I experienced it once myself. I had met Lady Somebody-or-other at a garden party in Adelaide at the time of a Town Planning Convention. Some time later, in Sydney, as I was waiting for the elevator to go up to the office, a group of women came in, amongst them this \"lady.\" Ifelt quite proud of myself that I remembered her and bowed. I got nothing in return but a cold and stony stare. I was amused inside realizing that one would naturally conclude that a woman in an office building at nine in the morning would usually be a stenographer and that I was being put in my place. As we all got in the lift, the \"lady\" who was going up to a Charitable Association (you see charity becomes a pure insult under [Note: ==== Beginning of page 246 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . 329 THE CITADEL [Note: ==== Beginning of page 247 ====] With stone no expense is entailed in the using of curved walls which give greater floor area for the same periphery of other geometric forms.

You are Mrs. Griffin,\" with a glimmer of apology which I attempted to turn by saying I was always so bad about remembering people that I was always a bit relieved whensomeone forgot me. But as I talked her face grew cold and stony again. You see - these incomprehensible Americans! They will not understand the proprieties which are the foundation of British Imperialism. An American takes these things with a laugh but they embitter the souls of the people who are \"subjects.\" The Communists and others are always insisting that class is as strong in America as anywhere else but Americans don't know the meaning of the word - it lies outside their experience. There is a natural difference of interest in the Economic Realm between manual labor and spiritual labor, each wanting, naturally to get the other's products as cheaply as possible but this is a thing that can be handled if the Political and Economic Organizations are two separate things. It has no connection with class as it exists today. These seem trifling things but they are enormously important. The Europeanizing of America that has been going on since the beginning of the last war is a heartbreaking thing to witness when one sees, as one who has had the double experience can see, that the European system is a soul destroying thing. The fact is that Australians are quite as European as the Europeans and the antagonism between classes is really bitter. The consequence of this is that the ideal over there is quite different from the ideal inAmerica. It is to put themselves on even terms with the most respected element, those who do nothing and get everything. Their ambition for themselves is, not to work but to get as much as possible for nothing. Whereas in America, so far as my experience has gone, the ideal is to achieve, to do work, to give quid [Note: ==== Beginning of page 249 ====] pro quo for value received. The difference in spirit is amazing. In the latter we find enthusiasm, joyousness and wide interests. In Australia - no interests, no enthusiasm, the result of which is that the community on the whole turns to gambling, the only spice to add to the pure physical comfort so easy to attain in that wonderful continent and climate of Australia. The difference in the spirit of the people is strongly marked in their so-called white Australia policy, another of those clever British misnomers, for it is directed against everyone and if anyone does come inby chance he is fought tooth and nail by everyone with astonishing unanimity. I had many talks with a very dear friend, Miss Mathews [Note: Susan Mary Matthews?], a supporter of the Labor Party, who was sent by them for a six months' investigation in the United States. I had continually stressed with her the fact that many of the measures being taken, all of them supported by the Labor Party, some of which were being put into effect by the opposing party, were having adisastrous effect on the character of the people. I told her how we felt that the turning of charitable work over to the government was destroying the soul of the people, was hardening their hearts, and though there is still much private charity work done, the effect on the attitude of the people as a whole was very apparent to us, coming in from the outside. Why should anyone do anything for anybody? Let the Page 561 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagogovernment do it. We told her how the fixing of hours of labor by the government and the minimum wage had brought about an attitude which discouraged all interest in training oneself for high skill achievement so that itwas practically impossible in Australia to get skilled labor. Why bother to train yourself when a wharf laborer would either get as much pay as a skilled laborer or not so much less as to make it worth [Note: ==== Beginning of page 250 (table of contents) ====] ENTRANCE .

For that's the way it worked out. And why do anything but loaf on the job? One was a fool to work hard when the loafer got just as much pay and was just as sure of holding his job. I called herattention to the desperate position of the architect for instance who could not get work done on his buildings either swiftly or well for if anyone showed any signs of superiority he was discredited by his fellows, and if you dismissed a man for inefficiency, the next man made certain that he was equally inefficient. Only when the Political Organization has been freed from connection with the Economic Organization can such measures be taken without disastrous results. She could not see these things and during a time after her return I was very cross with her when I learned that she had been trying to instill the same ideas into Americans she had met, the general line of her argument to them being - \"Why not get your government to do this? It's your money.\" And on her return she was still putting up the same arguments. But before six months had passed after her return she came to me and said that only after coming back and witnessing the attitude and spirit in Australia inthe light of her new experiences had she come to realize that what I had been saying was true. There was no such spirit in Australia as she had encountered in America and she could now see how the differences in the system were the cause of this soul destruction. I am sorry I was not able before her death to pass on to this able and energetic woman the knowledge of the technique necessary for the solving of these problems, which can be put into effect through the tripleinstead of our totalitarian organization of our communities.

The wooden pear is one of the largest. You see there were no human beings onearth at that time to need the fruits of the earth for their maintenance. The plants who do not need food but transform minerals into food did not at that time have to concern themselves with charity for human beings.

He made thisrequirement of the men surveying Port Stephens. Then he was up there he made the acquaintance of King Billy, an aboriginal who worked with the surveyors. Finding Griffin sympathetic King Billy talked freely with him and gave him much interesting information about the native plants. Through him Griffin learned how precise was their knowledge for King Billy could identify at a distance even a dead tree. The aboriginals were interested, as Griffin was, in the character of the form rather than in theminute distinctions which the botanists as a whole center on which in fact gives them the ability to attach names but does not give them real knowledge of the plants they are listing. When Griffin asked him what he thought about the surveyors' setting fire to the bush before they surveyed it he said - \"That is because they are cowards. They have no right to do this because it belongs to the birds and the animals as much as it does to them.\" The surveyors wore heavy leggings. King Billywent bare legged through the bush and had no fear. Contact with the ancient peoples should awaken us to the fact that they use a different kind of thinking from ourselves an experience which, if we were open minded, would lead us on to the investigating and mastering of that kind of thinking, to take as much pains as we have taken in the mastery of rational thinking in these modern times. The 19th Century transformed the thinking of European peoples. It isnot too much to ask that the 20th century accomplish as much. With 45 of its years gone this transformation is overdue. Mrs. Anna Ickes was one of the few Anglo Saxon people who in her study of the American Indian recognized that there was a radical difference in kind in their thinking. By the scientific investigation of [Note: Anna Ickes, social reformer and Illinois legislator, was the daughter of Mary J. Wilmarth, a reformer and suffragist, and the wife of Harold L. Ickes, an activist and New Deal political figure. She wrote \"Mesa Land: The History and Romance of the American Southwest\" (1933) and \"He-Who-Always-Wins and Other Navajo Campfire Stories\" (1934).] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 254c ====] these different types of thinking we might be able to extend our exact knowledge beyond the mineral kingdom for the very things they can do show they have a knowledge in the realms of life which is outof the reach of our physical scientists who are beginning to acknowledge that they have no knowledge of life. It is possible for us to develop in ourselves, in full consciousness, the kind of thinking which these American Indians make use of intuitively by means of which they can do remarkable things with animals as in their snake dances and ceremonials. I stood in the sun in an open doorway. In moving my arm I noticed that as the shadow on the floor approached the shadow of the door jamb a great lump, almost the size of my fist, lifted up on the Page 564 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoshadow of the arm and reached out contacting a similar lump approaching it from the door jamb. I have asked many materialists to find an explanation of that but I think the answer will never come from that source. In an astronomical account of the observations of a recent transit of Venus great preparationshad been made to note from various strategic points of the world the exact moment of the contact of the edge of Venus with the edge of the Sun. Such data would be used for important undertakings in the starry realms. But, the author said, unfortunately as the moment drew near a dark nexus developed which made it impossible to observe the exact moment of contact of the two circumferences. They hoped for better luck next time. My observations would lead me to conclude that what had happenedbetween the darkness of Venus as seen from the Earth and the darkness beyond the Sun was exactly what happened between the shadow of my arm and the shadow of the door jamb and would always happen. From spiritual science known intuitively to primitive peoples we can learn that light is not a mode of motion and that darkness is not a negative thing - the absence of light, a fact that is obvious to anyonewho stops to think for we can see darkness and it is not possible to perceive nothingness. Now in substances this phenomenon is quite well [Note: ==== Beginning of page 254d ====] known. The reaching out of a liquid, for instance, toward another liquid as it approaches. I think it is called osmosis. To an unprejudiced mind the conclusion of such an experience would be that darkness, far from being nothingness, is substance and subject to the laws of substance. Attraction caused thenexus. Of the Aboriginals Mr. [Note: William?] Hatfield says:- \"Whilst no one would predict for the Darwin area a future comparable with that of the more favored northeast coast of Queensland, there certainly exists here a vast field for development, and so far nothing has been done about it. The richly timbered Cairns hinterland is immeasurably more fertile andsuffers no long dry spell between copious downfalls in the wet season as does the Darwin back-country, but the areas along the northern rivers are capable of growing most tropical products. Many there are who argue that to enter that field means we cannot compete with Eastern countries with their supply of cheap labor, our white Australia policy forbidding the employment of the colored races. One indelible fact is therein lost sight of. A colored people exists there already and unless the whiteAustralia advocates mean to exterminate it with fire and sword, always will. The ground is so productive that the aborigine can have a varied vegetable diet without cultivation of any kind and once he is shown how easy it is to secure a far higher standard of living by a little preparation of the land he will respond and that in spite of all that has ever been written about his shiftlessness and indolence. Indolence! The spectacle of hundreds of our indigent whites preferring to sit down on the dole whenvotes are taken regarding relief work proves that indolence is no matter of color after all. Intelligence and patience will be needed but the black fellow can be trained to be a useful citizen.\" [Note: ==== Beginning of page 255 ====] Page 565 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 of ChicagoINITIAL - TASMANIAN COASTAL MELALEUCA [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.] BUREAUCRACY BUREAU-CRAZY Then the struggle to establish a high class residential suburb began with all the forces against anything that savored of progress gathering greater and greater strength till Heaven only knows how it will end. The general plan on modern town planning lines for the first valley was put before the Council for preliminary approval and months of delay and endless conferences finally ended in the Mayor's decidinghe would sponsor the scheme and the plans were signed with the approval of the Council. But it was with their fingers crossed as became apparent later. For the Councils are petty dictators with small powers for constructive action for in Australia municipal affairs are largely controlled by the state, but with absolute power to prevent change from time honored ways which have come down through the centuries and millenniums. The system of requiring the construction of roads before selling the land is a recent one in New South Wales consequently the thousands of pounds in rates that the owners of this land are paying is all being expended in road construction in remote districts of no use to Castlecrag while at the same time we have to pay some [Note: \u00a3?]40,000 a mile for our own roads for these bluffs are very rugged offering quite an engineering problem and much structural work. The previous method of subdivision left this estate isolated from the main thoroughfares connected only by a council road not even formed, jagged rocks and deep holes, and only after three years pleading would they consent to construct this, though the way was lined with houses on either side, but only on our advancing taxes to cover the total cost of this street not on our estate. The rest of Edinburgh Road is still unpaved. Castlecrag is on its south-eastern side. The village of some 50 families on beyond us goeson deputizing the Council for pavement, or electricity or gas as it has been doing for the past 50 years.

With the completion of the roads as planned and specified and to which they had given their approval in the beginning, there began a systematic delay of final acceptance of subdivisions which, since no title could be passed and no building constructed until the streets were approved and received a departmentnumber, had a most destructive effect on the carrying out of Castlecrag. A fence was required here and when built, after another long delay, an alteration of a gutter was required there, and when this was done something else somewhere else; in some case three or even more years elapsing before approval was given. This was accompanied by a systematic campaign of defamation. Reports of the bankruptcy of the company were spread broadcast. Every sort of lie was spread such as - one was not allowed to do thisthat or the other; one had to be a vegetarian; one could not plant a tree; - nothing was too outlandish to be broadcast and believed. The district immediately adjacent was deeply insulted by the fact that houses different from their own were being built and spread all sorts of statements they would take their oath to:- that they were extravagantly expensive, that one couldn't live in them without becoming ill, etc., etc. They also camethrough in great numbers and ring-barked the trees. If they found one such bandaged in hopes of its surviving they tore off the bandage. When trees were planted along the road side we would frequently find them torn up and tossed to one side. Finally a reform council was elected. The former engineer was dismissed, convicted of endless corruption, and in the early days of the reform idea those of our roads already completed were passed.But it was not long before things tightened up again. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 259 (table of contents) ====] ENDLESS WONDERWALKS CASTLECRAG ABOVE THE CLOUDS [Note: ==== Beginning of page [260] ====]The preservation of natural beauties suffices to give elegance and prestige to those who dwell amidst such surroundings, though the lots were bought for a fraction of the cost in other suburbs and the dwellings undercut the cost of the cheapest city dwellings.

The permanent officials, the civil servants, who are there alwayswhile the politicians are transients, are all powerful and nobody can touch their power, and they care not a hang what anybody thinks or says or does. Luckily in those early days of the reform Council and with a new incoming engineer before he had got onto the ropes, the general road scheme of the second promontory, Covecrag, was submitted and accepted. Heaven only knows what act of Providence will enable the third promontory to get thatpreliminary hurdle over with. But the Golf Links are already there. After a seven year fight there was achieved the official Deposited Plan of the subdivisions of the first valley. The fight now became intense in the construction of the houses. Since all officialdom stands together as a unit and as the State Banks hog the game of house loaning, the banks refused to loan money on Castlecrag houses; as one of them told an applicant - \"We do not do anything for Castlecragat present.\" To our knowledge they advised four clients against building. Of course one reason is that they are in cahoots with the brick trust, have been given stock in the brick trust, for Sydney which is underlain with a perfect building stone of which the whole city should have been built has become a desert of red bricks and tile, spreading over one lovely promontory after another. Castlecrag houses are being built in stone or concrete both of them taboo. It is only an occasional client that has the patience to hang on to the finish of the long fight which Griffin goes on fighting, or who has the requisite to finance himself. The Marseilles tile are not appropriate for the horizontal storms of Sydney so nearly every house in Sydney leaks yet the council refuses to pass the flat reinforced concrete roofs. The ingenuity of Griffin makes reservoirs of these roofs by sloping them to the center, plugging the down pipe in the center and flooding them for the first 28 days so that they are [Note: ==== Beginning of page 262 (table of contents) ====] ONLY DEEP CUTTING ON THE WHOLE OF THE 3 PROMONTORIES [Note: ==== Beginning of page 263 ====] In Covecrag, Griffin succeeded in getting the council to widen the boundary road, forecasting to them what has happened - that it would become a Greater Sydney thoroughfare. Those who bought lots on this frontage bought them along with Griffin designed shops; and central and ample space was determined for a Civic Center for community structures.

Now that Aquella is available and Vermiculite the waterproofing of any stone or concrete structures is solved as it was with the Maginot [Note: Line] defense structures. This is usually thought of as a warm climate but real discomfort comes not only from the cold during the four months of winter when the whole community rich and poor suffer intense discomfort in the houses, but frequently during the other seasons. With one voice all who come from other climates say they have never suffered with the cold in their lives as they do in Australia. The solution to this, removing all the discomfort of the climate, is a simple device used by the aboriginals - to take advantage of the much lesser range of the temperature of the ground, at least 20 degrees less than that of the air.This is practically all that is needed in this wonderful climate to make living comfortable. With doors and windows closed on nippy days the warmth of the earth comes up and fills the whole house and on the coldest days a bit of a fire in the fireplace with a warm floor for a start and the whole house is right. Such a little thing and a whole civilization can be transformed, but do you suppose a Municipal Council would permit it? By no means. The case was put, the reasons given, but reason doesn't interestcouncilors. It wasn't done and that's final. The gods helped us by sending the Bubonic plague to Australia. So we were permitted to build rat-proof houses.

There are so many interesting things to talk about in the Leo Parer's house on Sydney Harbor that it is rather difficult to know where to begin. For instance there is the famous Parer family with its ancestral dash of adventurers' Spanish blood. Then there is the architecture of Burley Griffin always aninteresting topic in which tradition the house itself has been designed. And lastly there is the beautiful locality itself which at first glance seems just the same as it always was, and yet not the same. Its leafy frontages have been invaded by a certain amount of new building. A lovely roadway winds its tree-shaded way along the water's edge, unrolling at each turn its always fresh pictures of blue water, framed between Middle and South Heads, with a spreading expense of ocean beyond. The front door is unadorned by porch or portico, its only emphasis being a heavy flat stone lintel projecting from the wall immediately above. Directly above the lintel is the long narrow staircase window which carries the vertical line of the door above the roof line. There are few windows on this side of the house so that the effect of the staircase window is unspoiled. Its simple upward sweep has a dramatic quality which seems to impart life and vitality to what would otherwise be a rather heavy brickwall. On the bed room floor a large square landing over the main hall opens out on the sun deck above the loggia. The bedrooms are grouped on either side, most of them having windows facing the harbor. Each bedroom is provided with built-in clothes cupboards with trays and hanging space.

WEST SIDE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 269 ====] Morella - The firm of Griffin and Nicholls is carrying on his work and tradition in Sydney. Viewed as a whole the house is a highly stylized individual composition which shows off with fine effect a flair for handling masses of material. There is evidence of a free play of imagination, anunexpectedness of grouping at certain points which, combined with the intensification of wall texture by the use of raked cream bricks, invests the whole building with a quality of vivid, graceful aliveness. This is notably apparent in the chimney treatment on the south side of the house. The plan grew into being as a natural development of the possibilities of the site adapted to the needs of the family. The utmost use has been made of the view over the harbor and consequently the front dooropens into what is really a rear entrance corridor beyond which a large square main hall opens out onto the loggia. The staircase has a hall all to itself opening from the rear corridor. Lounge and dining room are set to right and left of the main hall, with windows facing the view, and sliding doors on the inner wall of the lounge communicate with a small study with windows facing the back garden which can be made part of the lounge if desired. Servery [Note: i.e., a room from which meals are served] and kitchen with meal alcove adjoining are set behind the dining room. A cloak room, fitted neatly under the staircase which is compactly set so as to take up as little room as possible, is provided in the stair hall.

Its short pillars support an equally huge open sun deck reached from the bedroom above. Then beneath this, for the site of the house slopes steeply down to the water, excavation has been made for the building of a ball room acrossthe entire front of the house. The ball room is to be finished after the war, in time for the children who will then be grown up. Meanwhile the excavation is concealed behind an imposing row of pillars, the effect of which already gives some idea of what the future ball room will look like with wide glass doors opening direct into a dusky-scented garden bathed by some future Sydney moon.

And starting right means solving the problem before Page 572 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagostarting the construction. Getting in the habit of doing this brings one into touch with the source of information before the solving of the wider problems, for there are natural laws in the spiritual realm as there are in the material realm, and humans can learn them and work in accord with them if they areinclined toward construction or contrary to them if they are bent on destruction. In our profession starting right means control of the land which makes town planning possible. Well these conditions held at Canberra, Australia's capital, but the control was political so that was no good, although it did make possible the establishing of the ground plan though it was a terrific fight and much money was wasted. Next time the enterpriser [Note: Griffin] got control of 700 acres of one of Divinity's most perfect works, the foreshores of Middle Harbor, Sydney, three promontories rising to 330 feet above the water level, five miles of water frontage, a climate perfect the year around, never a frost, and in the midsummer never a hot night. A perfect summer resort and a perfect winter resort. If as noon passes the heat gets a bit trying one says, \"Well it's about time for a southerly buster,\" and shortly, not a storm but a livelyrefreshing breeze from the ocean sets things stirring and a lovely coolness reigns. And not the desert of our idolized California but the most perfect work of the Creator, a perfectly balanced garden, trees and shrubs all evergreen, most of them with showy blossoms, some blooming for nine months of the year; and nothing in the nature of a weed. This area is sufficient for a whole municipality so that after a while this community will be able to manage all its municipal affairs and will be in a position to arrange for the necessary separate functioning of the social affairs. From its inception there has been a strong movement in Castlecrag to keep the children out of the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 276 (table of contents) ====] CAPITOL THEATRE BALCONY BOXES [Note: ==== Beginning of page 277 ====]The stepped oblong ceiling of this very deep auditorium conceals the colored lamps which are played as a color organ from an enormous switch board behind the scenes so that a grand color orchestral program is given with each performance. The sound of the music organ comes through perforations of this stepped motif on both sides of the proscenium. The whole theatre is mysterious and magnificent, unique in the world. The auditorium seats of the main floor are entered from a center aisle and from the two side wall colonnades whose heavy piers conceal the lights whose reflections are shown in this photograph. When the theatre was being planned Griffin said to the owners - \"What a marvelous thing it would be if we could build a theatre like a crystal cave.\" The idea revolved in his mind, and inquiries were made inBelgium into the possibility or cutting crystal or glass to give effect to the idea. The cost was estimated Page 573 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoto be in the vicinity of \u00a3600,000 and was rejected. But Griffin clung to his dream and finally carried it out in fibrous plaster, like the old triangular crystal with the drop removed. Inside each V shaped box, highly ornamented, he arranged rows of lights representing all the primary colors of the spectrum. From a master switch the lighting is slowly changed so that the whole effect is that of the varying color changes of a revolving piece of crystal. Griffin carried out his motif throughout the theatre. Thus the Capitol Theatre today although about 23 years old is still one of the most unusual theatres in the world and a fascinating study for architects. (quotation from a Melbourne paper) [Note: \"... about 23 years old ... \" - The Capitol Theatre opened in November, 1924.] [Note: The word \"Caption\" is at the top of the page in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 278 ====] [Note: Continued from page 275]standardized schools. But even before this breaking away from the old municipality to which its acres belong, one feels when coming upon it as I overheard a mother say to her daughter with hushed breath, - \"One feels as if one had dropped suddenly into a totally different world.\" The homes emphasize this for they too are different from anything seen elsewhere. They are a part of the landscape, harmonious with it in material, color and form. The combined practice of town planning and architecture by the enterpriser, and the position of managing director with a controlling vote in the company owning the district, make it possible for the layout and construction of roads and buildings to be carried out on such lines as to destroy none of the natural beauties so that instead of man's occupation reducing these bluffs to deserts here, with just as intense occupation, one will be practically unconscious of man's presence though he will be thereenjoying all the most modern conveniences. Since it is one of Sydney's closest suburbs residents have the combination of all rural delights and all urban advantages. Its a joyful thing to tramp these slopes with Walter Burley Griffin in any of the stages of road determination and see how the entrancing rock formations which would be the envy of any national park are noted and preserved, how the spectacular outlook spots to the magnificent views across the harborthrough the Heads to the Pacific are thrown into permanent reserves for access to all and how the lovely trees are carefully preserved even if it takes two or three revisions of the surveys to accomplish it without injuring the perfect grades for motor traffic that prevail throughout these steep and precipitous terraced formations of Castlecrag. But if you love nature she yields herself to you, and these terraces in the end, after the roads have been built, seem have been created for the very purpose of ideal humanhabitation.

[Note: ==== Beginning of page 281 ====] [Note: Continued from page 278] willing to make it his foundation principle that the buildings shall be inconspicuous, yes, invisible. And that is what the ultimate answer will be at Castlecrag. For as you stand on the heights and look over thevalleys it will always be all garden and the brightest spots in the garden the roofs of the houses for they are made of reinforced concrete and can be covered with eight inches of soil and planted with lawns for games or with the most cherished flowers of all. These roof gardens! They make one feel suddenly bigger, make one grow bigger, for one commands the whole panorama and in the home which is one's own he realizes that the whole world is his. He commands it to the very horizon, and this withoutinfringing on the equal rights of every other citizen to do the same, utterly unconscious of others as they are of him. To accomplish this means the solving of many problems but when all the means for solving the problem are in the enterpriser's hands it becomes possible, one might almost say easy such is the joy of it. The buildings are constructed of the local stone, in this case an ideal building sandstone, easy to cut andglazing afterward, sometimes pure white at others buff or pink or brown so that if one does catch a glimpse of them as may happen, especially when first constructed, though often with the native garden so luxuriant and always preserved it is impossible even from the beginning to get a photograph from any point, the house appears only as a bit of a garden feature or a bit of the natural rockery. And so built the house is no longer an enemy of the garden but is on friendly terms, intimate terms, with itencouraging the familiarities of bush and climber and without the fear of falling branch of stately tree. The first requirement of religion, especially of the Christian religion through which we should now be fully conscious of the relation of the Christ, as experienced by the Eucharist, to the Earth, is respect for Page 575 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe works of the Creator. Through spiritual knowledge we are aware that the North is the body of the Christ since the event of Golgotha, and that the ethers which [Note: ==== Beginning of page 282 (table of contents) ====] HOME OF ERIC M.

Sometimes it serves as a partition between the living room and an entrance lobby, or perhaps to screen the way to bed rooms and kitchen. Sometimes it carries recesses for books or china or perhaps its \"face\" may be entirely plain according to the style of the room. But in all Burley Griffin's houses it is a commanding feature. We took a photograph of one of these chimneys. The face of this particular chimney was not absolutely plain, but had two small three-cornered glass cupboards built out from it. So narrow was the supporting frame-work of these cupboards that theyappeared to be completely of glass, magically resting on the stone chimney front. The photography was a joyous business. Everyone took a hand, suggesting this or arranging that (for people who live at Castlecrag are a happy colony for a common artistic interest which, without being in the least bit \"posey\" or unnatural, delightfully enriches ordinary friendly intercourse), and when we thought we had got it about right and were just going to shoot, there was a stir in the doorway and incame Burley Griffin himself, his rosy cheeks wreathed in smiles but his blue eyes alight with purpose nevertheless. \"No not like that. We cannot have that.\" Swiftly a chair was moved here, another banished there, a jar altered in its position on the shelf, and behold a transformation. \"Now,\" said he, \"You can shoot.\"Quotation from Miss Cooper [Note: \"Miss Cooper\" - Two of Nora Cooper's articles are quoted in Section II, No. 15, page 233ff and Section III, No. 14, page 266ff.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 284 ====] [Note: Continued from page 281] are his gift to the world are the cause of the transformation by so called Nature of water in the life Page 576 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoprocess through the vine to the grape and the wine. Christ teaches us this fact when at the marriage of Cana by the direct use of the ethers he transforms water into wine. And except where the precipice of one natural terrace has drawn a bit too near the precipice of the terrace below, all the homes are grouped around interior reserves giving space for play and festival, grove and garden. No child is ever naughty at Castlecrag, anyhow I never saw one. There is too much to do. And the pale lilies that come in from outside turn to roses though they are really just as close together as before but they don't know it. The dwellings staggered so that you look into the neighboring gardens and feel them as part of your own, unconscious of the buildings or boundaries. Then what happens when the people are really living there? Well the Mrs. has something to say to that for she had been saying for years that she was bent on starting a civilization in which children could be happy and had been assuring her angel that she was willing to pay whatever price was necessary to accomplish that end. With the happiness of adults we need not concern ourselves. That is their own affair and often unhappiness is the best thing for them. Through unhappiness one can develop faculties.Our own concern for them was to give them beauty. For humans can endure hardships and grief and disasters but they cannot endure ugliness. Ugliness destroys their souls. But children have a right to happiness. They require it. And they require all sorts of opportunities and experiences which are dependent on the very wide interests and activities of their elders. So the feminine element began to work like yeast and everybody just naturally began to ferment. The very fact of the town plan, the very fact of the preservation of the natural beauties, recreated the neighborhood as a reality, which has entirely disappeared from our cities with such disastrous [Note: ==== Beginning of page 285 (table of contents) ====] KNITLOCK DWELLING & FUTURE EXTENSIONS [Note: J.

Its concrete walls, deepened to a lovely weather stained yellow, fitted naturally into their woodland surroundings. From behind its long glass doors one could imagine nursery rhyme children peeping, or elfin folk scampering in and out between the concrete lanterns on the flat roof, from whichthe house takes its name.

From the very beginning with only a handful of residents things began and they went on and it soon became evident that every man is naturally a genius and every one hungry to express his genius. First the obvious thing - a Progress Association - which as it worked out was the most difficult of all because it meant the breaking down of class boundaries which really can't be done in a community which has a group of people legally authorized as superior which fills the souls of people with bitterness and malice. But we played a bit of hob with the idea anyway. The difficulty instantly arose from the fact that we included within the boundaries of the association the neighboring thickly populated workman'sdistrict (the term is theirs not ours) because the main North and South thoroughfare was there and seemed a natural line of demarcation. But no. The invisible line between the ordinary thing and the something different that was being done constituted an impassible barrier in the minds of the already settled district, one that could not be crossed except on the basis of warfare. Americans, though they use the word, have not the slightest idea of the meaning of the word \"class.\" The nearest they come to it is aconception of snobbery which is a totally different thing. Thus it was when, with our innocent American minds, we organized a children's Christmas party. These parties! Unforgettably beautiful things. Within the boundaries of Castlecrag anyone could buy a lot. Anyone could build a house. But one couldn't be in Castlecrag long before one became a Castlecragger and with no external pressure, just theattraction of what was going on. In the Progress Association Mrs. G. [Note: Griffin] had charge of the Junior Branch which showed tendencies of swamping the club so a suggestion was made that there should be an age limit. Mrs. G. agreed and suggested that 75 should be the limit set. Her suggestion was carried by acclimation, perhaps more truthfully described as shouts of laughter.

The Ballet was inaugurated. Some of us did the simpler things in the ballet but Louisa [Note: Lightfoot] went ahead with enthusiasm and industry even with the surprising feats the Russians do. At the end of the season we were showing Sydney things. The Ballet became a permanent thing at Castlecrag and a lovely feature in nearly all the social life and frolics, one of them a lovely thing around a bonfire in thelower valley under the full moon among the wondrous smooth red-barked and white-barked gum trees. Later on we took a moving picture of this Arabian dance, a capture of the ladies of the Harem, our leading lady being carried off along the winding path down the valley, high up in the air on the hand of the bandit chief. It was screened in the metropolitan theatres. A youth had a longing for the drama. He had spoken his pieces at some of our parties. Mrs. G. [Note: Griffin] told him he could use her house any time he wanted to, so the dramatic club was formed - The Dais. It soon appeared that one of the young women was a very fine ingenue and the family's enthusiasm led to their home being used for the meetings and sometimes for the performances. But always in emergencies 56 The Parapet was available. The young founder developed a fine capacity for decoration and stage setting and everybody joined The Dais. Stodgy old fat fellows proved geniuses incomedy. Their wives at times in tragedy. A woman who had had humiliating experiences bucked up and took a role and displayed such talent that it helped to remake her life and gave her status again. Club members began to write plays and these and other performances were at times given in the city. Castlecrag individuals and groups got the habit of taking prizes in metropolitan affairs. Professionals were invited out and came with a bit of haughty feeling but waked up with a new idea before theevenings were over. Fancy dress parties became frequent, each house offering a new stage setting that put everyone on his mettle with the new effects to be achieved; in the jewel box, the tiniest and the cheapest house in [Note: ==== Beginning of page 290 (table of contents) ====] SANDSTONE DWELLING .

The early dwellings in Castlecrag were not large but the architect's basic principle was that the one essential in a home was a good sized assembly room and then anything more you could afford. And the numbers that used to roll up for those parties! And sometimes a party spilled over into the house next door and stunts were doubled and laughing processions passed each other going from one house to the other. All Sydney would have come if we could have accommodated them. The finest musical talent ofSydney and many visiting artists came and sang and played for us. And many a one on leaving has said, \"I'll be glad to come any time you want me Mrs. Griffin.\" Always the feeling that they were getting as much as they were giving. A hundred, a hundred and fifty was not unusual and the charming events and fun without any need of artificial stimulants kept them going till the wee small hours. And \"How do you get such people together,\" was a frequent comment. Or, \"Nowhere do we find such gatherings asthese.\" A young couple was shy but wanted to do their bit so took up a suggestion of Mr. Herbert's and started a Neighborhood Circle on cultural lines with lectures and discussions, and again everybody came not because they were asked but because it was too interesting to stay away from. Outsiders as well as Craggers were welcome to all the functions. And the pick of the lecturers were ready to come to talk toCastlecrag. Castlecrag was being looked upon as important and there were not more than ten dwellings there. Mrs. Felstead was doing beautiful needlework, so backed by Mrs. G. [Note: Griffin] she formed an Arts and Crafts Society. Castlecraggers gathered together their handiwork and old enthusiasms were fanned to life.

In this gracious natural atmosphere, the Chinese fountain, the strange and restless molding decorations on the glass doors, seemed almost human.

Children, young folk and parents were in everything. A two month's exhibition was arranged in Mrs. F.'s [Note: Felstead's?] home and a stream of visitors from the other suburbs continued through the whole of the time. A young new-comer starts a weekly group to study economics. The whole citizenry organize a Castlecrag Community League to put themselves in legal form to safeguard for all time the ideals andnatural beauties of the prospective municipality. The point is that all these affairs were a part of the everyday life of everybody. You didn't have to go into the city nor to remote suburbs. Things were easy, at hand, under your nose. They just happened. Trying things have happened of course but let them simmer in the varying lights and shades of this interplay of nature and humanity and as a rule they come through in a very satisfactory way. Andalways there is the feeling of things growing and building up. And more and more is enthusiasm rising, ever more and more opportunities offering to each and every individual. And all the time there is right at hand the infinite peace of stillness and utter seclusion when one wants it in the midst of perfect beauty. Always the intimate contact with nature that is absolutely essential to the education of children (who cannot be educated in our cities as they stand) and that is so healing to the sick soul. Men and women must work together in practically all fields. But it is true that there are certain things women can do that men cannot. The essential man's function is to conquer nature. Woman stands timid and frightened before that requirement, whereas man registers joy and enthusiasm at the very thought of it and at every opportunity that offers. Woman's function is to see to it that man does not destroy what he has conquered. Today man is conquering and destroying the world and woman is failing to performher function.

ACACIA MELANOXYLON - INITIAL CAPTION There are some 400 species of Wattles in Australia. Their blossoms are mostly small balls of stamens often in great clusters shading from pale buff to pure gold. Usually spherical balls but sometimes small cylinders like trees of goldenrod. Their leaves may be anything from phylloids to needles to pinnate but I think their cotyledon leaves are always pinnate. And the acacias run all sizes from small open shrubs to stately trees such as this Melanoxylon. On the whole they are not long lived as they are especially subject to insect pests. Their bark is used for tanning. There are great treks to the bush, for that is what Australians call the forests, in wattle blooming time, different seasons in different districts for there are wattles for every one of the 12 months of the year.Some of their leaves are pure silver so you can do marvelous things with them in landscape work. This was the big brush with which Griffin loved to do his paintings. The Wattles are the Golden Rod trees of Australia, over 400 varieties, whose flowers run the gamut of the yellows from pale cream to deep gold, and there is never a time when some of them are not in bloom. So with proper selection you can have superb masses of bloom every month of the year andforms from the daintiest of shrubs, the perfumed Suaveolens, to the stately Melanoxylon, the foliage of every conceivable shape but always evergreen. Would that some true philanthropist would plant our desert western slopes with Wattles.

The Conference did the only thing possible, it placed upon the Councils the responsibility of investigating any design of concrete construction submitted and of allowing or disallowing its use upon its merits. While reinforced concrete construction has proved to be both sound and economical for large buildings, efforts to adapt it to the special requirements of residential work have not been very encouraging. Some years ago, it will be remembered, Mr. [Note: Thomas Alva] Edison was credited with the statement that he had almost perfected a scheme for casting cement houses in one piece with floors, roofs, pipe ducts and chimneys, as well as baths, sinks and other fixtures, all part of the house. The molds for these were to be set up in a few days, the pouring was to be done in a few hours and after another week orthereabouts, the molds were to be removed and the \"home\" was to be ready for occupation. Fortunately this was one of the abortive efforts of the wonder-man inventor, for the possibility of having whole streets - of having whole suburbs filled with these cast monstrosities is shocking to contemplate. In many of the schemes for using concrete in small house construction the claims made for its economy as compared with brick have not been borne out by experience and, generally, the increased size of the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 301 (table of contents) ====] CASA BONITA .

In brick-work the unit of vertical measurement is 3 inches and the unit of horizontal measurement, 4 and a half - a half brick, and these small units permit of a variety of architectural design that is almost infinite........ A method of concrete tile wall construction has come under the notice of the writer that is interesting. It possesses in a large measure the advantages of flexibility possessed by brick, the unit being 6 inches, the width and length of a half tile, vertically and horizontally, and although the cost of the wall per superficial foot may be equal to that of a brick wall, there are other economies effected that favorably affect the total cost of the house when this method is used. There is first a saving of space, the walls being only 2 1/2 thick, including finish, as compared with brick external walls, plastered 12 in. thick, and brick internal walls, plastered, 6 in. thick. This means that an area which is only sufficient to build a cottage in brick work of five rooms would be large enough to build a cottage in concrete tiles with six rooms. The thin walls are possible because the system of construction is columnar, the walls being curtain or enveloping walls only, with all loads carried by the columns, and the structural design of the tiles andmethod of treatment in the building makes damp penetration impossible. Each tile is one foot square, so that half tiles are 12 in. by 6 in., and this is the possible unit of measurement vertically and horizontally. The tiles are 1 3/4 in. thick and the back is grooved. The wall is made up of two tiles placed back to back, interlocked, with joints broken so that no through joint exists in any part of the wall; [Note: ==== Beginning of page 304 (table of contents) ====] Page 584 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoAN EXTENDED VERSION OF THE CASA BONITA PLAN [Note: The structure is the Mower House.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 305 ====] the tiles are made with a face practically impervious to moisture but they have their interlocking surfaces dipped in bitumen so that there are two waterproof membranes in the center of the finished walls. It will be seen that contact is made only at the positions marked (a) so that the wall is cellular and is protected against the transmission of heat or cold. Each tile has two strands of reinforcing wire running horizontally. The tubular cells provide channels through which electric conduit, small service pipes, etc. can be taken. Columns are formed by the use of quadrant and tangent interlocking tiles. These columns are spaced at convenient distances governed by the design and position of openings, but the curtain or enveloping walls will easily span a distance of 16 feet between columns. The columns are hollow and the larger service pipes for conveying roof water and sewage to the drains can be taken inside so that they do not appear on the outside wall faces. These walls meet the requirements of the proviso to Clause No. 23 they are structurally sound - tests show them to be as strong or stronger than 9 in. brick walls in lime mortar - and they are hygienic, being damp-proof and cellular. Floors and roofs are carried on plates supported by the columns, or if flat concrete roofs are used, by reinforced beams spanning from column to column. As the tiles are interlocked back to back the walls have a finished face on the inside as well as outside and no plastering is required. With some slight stain or tint sponged on the inner face, the effect has all the charm of a textured tile wall. The outer face has a surface like rubbed sandstone, the color varying with the sand used. This color may be uniform or the tones may be mixed to give vitality and texture; the joints are defined so that the face is divided into 12 inch squares, a very pleasing scale and these canagain be divided into four by the lighter marking on the tile when it is used for the inside faces.

At the growing suburb of Castlecrag, at any rate, with the stereotypedhybrid English pattern or spec-built nondescript, \"mod. brk. bung.\" [Note: modern brick bungalow?] out of the way, or at least at arms length, a human size scale is indicated to preserve the beautiful illusion of vast distances created by the fine texture and irregular outlines of the diminutive flora and of the tumultuous hills that seem mountainous. In Southern California, Mr. Frank Lloyd Wright has recently carried out houses on a scheme having tesseral [Note: i.e., composed of a small square or tablet (tessera)] elements of the same facial size and similar appearance, though quite different in structural significance, since they form cavity walls in the ordinary sense, stable because of their mass rather than through specialized columnar or concentrated supports, and there are no vertebral segments. Internally segmental houses possess the advantage over all other finished types of house requiring no veneer of tiles, plaster, textile, paper, enamel or paint. Thetesseral faces of hard dry concrete in any desired degree of smoothness or roughness are susceptible of stain or tint or any color, but without it they are of an acceptable finish in themselves, at the same time conveying the sense of strength and endurance which only the sincerity of solid homogeneous structure provides. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 308 ====] [Note: Continued from page 305]The construction results in vertical projections in the wall where the columns occur curved outward in section, with a narrow flat face suggestive of Gothic design, dividing the wall into panels with a very pleasing effect. The construction also results in concave internal angles which are hygienic as well as pleasing in appearance. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 309 ====] CASA BONITA A building is not just a facade, nor a plan. It is a detail in its natural setting, it is a unit among its neighbors, it is an interior fitted to meet its social functions and obligations. It is a note of emphasis in a natural setting taking its place harmoniously, a note in a melody, a chord in harmony. Anything less andit has no right to exist. Some houses are so dainty you can hardly believe they are for humans. Casa Bonita is an absolutely minimum cost house. On this rocky and jumpy allotment which drops steeply down into the valley there was room for only the garage on the street level. Well sometimes it was a garage, sometimes an artist's studio, sometimes a drafting room with a huge drafting board in it under the two windows facing east,fine for laying out perspectives. It is as attractive as any part of the house because with knitlock there is no such thing as a lack of finish. The inside is the same as the outside. Color can be added but it is Page 586 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobeautiful without, the tesserae vary somewhat in color as they come from the factory so at a little distance one gets the impression it is marble. Side windows were included in the garage for here again they don't run up the cost. With the front garage doors wide open it was a picture to see Mrs. Jungesitting there weaving richly colored rugs and draperies for her doll house which from across the valley looks like a castle. The house drops lower, the top only 4 feet above the street level. A bridge across a bit of a chasm takes you under a trellis bower to the roof. What a view! Raking up and down the valley! The parapet wall needs no coping but a gracious note was added by perforating the top structural tiles as they were madewhich gives a graceful and quite Indian touch.

Only the color movies could rival the settings of this Paradise play. The action took place on the terraces on the levels of the house and the veranda and on the various rocks and paths up and down and through shrubs and trees circling from 60' away to the various boulder and terrace levels including the roof of the house - a succession of lovely and superb settings, rich and varied and with the background of the bluff above across the street.

Not only the elemental things but in the whole animal and vegetable life. All primeval conditions have been retained somewhere so that men can get knowledge of evolution. Unless we call to mind that the earth was liquid before it was solid it is impossible to understand the vegetable life in Australia, even the trees. In America I was taught that I must observe the laws of the growth of these and realize that the trunk grew smaller as it sent off its branches, tapering to the top. But many Australian trees pay no attention tothese human theories. One of the Sterculias of Queensland is such a one. It looks just like a sea cucumber. Its trunk swells out and then narrows up at the top just like a cucumber and all its foliage spreads out like a circle of tentacles.

The following is a sketch of the application of this principle in one realm. While I played around with the architect with whom I was working in the picturemaking business in which we both took such pleasure, Burley Griffin took things more seriously for there was the samedifference between Louis Sullivan and many who followed him that there was between Griffin and myself. It is one thing to be a painter of lovely pictures. Sullivan thought in terms of construction as did Griffin, inventing and solving problems. New styles arise through the solving of the problems for new civilizations. Griffin turned out new methods of construction & new forms of materials & hardware, and so on. Many a time did someone seeing his indifference to patents ask permission to patent a thing,something he had worked out. To prevent this he did at times patent a thing to protect his clients. His only interest was that of the clients. The baked tile form and construction was remodeled to meet his demands, for stability and weathering. They did it but made an awful fuss over the trouble it was, vowing they would never do it again, but shortly they were doing nothing else. He invented an interlocking concrete tile construction, most lovely, Page 592 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoand the last word in economy in concrete residential work. The superficial appearance of this seen in pictures has been copied in some California houses [Note: by Frank Lloyd Wright?], more copybook architecture resulting in absurdities from a structural point of view. Starting every problem from the point of view of landscape architecture meant, at least in Griffin's hands, that every characteristic of a location was carefully considered and taken advantage of and no natural loveliness destroyed. Not only was there careful consideration of the location on the lot but even total transformation of customary plans to save this, or to get maximum effect from that. The invention of this [Note: ==== Beginning of page 319 (table of contents) ====] KNITLOCK HOUSE EASILY EXTENDED BY ENTRANCE & 2 ROOMS ENCLOSING COURT [Note: The New-York Historical Society caption to the illustrations reads, \"Extend Knitlock House With 1 or 2 Rooms By Enclosing Court With 1 or 2 Rooms & Veranda.\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 320 ====] interlocking tile came from this double outlook of the town planner and the architect for by this he could get color in harmony with stone and also a material impervious to storms and to the menace of plants to use in a stone district and at the same time undercutting even the cost of bricks. Griffin's double profession gave him an advantage in tackling the problem of developing the suburb of Sydney - Castlecrag - enabling him to show that the unique loveliness of Australia did not need to bewiped off the earth in the process of occupation but that 750 acres of natural garden with its wonderful variety of flowering evergreen trees and shrubs could be occupied as intensely as other suburbs, now hopeless deserts, and still remain 750 acres of garden. And so it could be with the development of the whole continent. Man's interests are not necessarily in conflict with nature. He doesn't need to be a destroyer in order to live. The system he established, contrary to custom, was to make the buildings as inconspicuous as possible, to construct them of local stone, an ideal building stone underlying the whole of Sydney. What a pity Sydney itself was so held by the throat by the brick trust backed by the bankers, doubtless shareholders. If only the municipalities of Sydney had been built of this stone which is so desirable that when Melbourne built important buildings it brought the stone all the way down the 400 miles from Sydney. The banks would not lend money except on brick and Marseilles tile roof houses both materials entirely unsuited to the climate. Griffin fought them to the end. One lawsuit cost each of the parties $10,000. We have many reasons for believing it was instigated and even financed by the brick trust. It became too unsavory for the judge to be willing to give a judgment against Griffin so he demanded a compromise. Of course one understands that a councilman takes his life in his hands if he passes a building thatdiffers in any particular from the routine Page 593 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 321 (table of contents) ====] HOUSE OF 7 LANTERNS . KNITLOCK structure is [Note: ==== Beginning of page 322 ====] thing for his enemies can say he has been bribed to authorize anything so different from the established custom of the British Empire and it will be obvious to all good Britishers that he must have been, and the whispers will go the rounds and out he goes at the next election. This is inescapably the answer if politics is allowed to interfere in the economic realm. However Griffin never gave up his fight with the councils and bit by bit his methods of construction became convincing, since they solved all the problems of hot climates, minimum cost, permanent and fireproof construction, an asphalt pavement under the whole house with sleepers set in it and the finished floor of wood laid on it with no air space so solid floors (a thing which our imitator in the U.S. didn't do in the California house & which [Note: N-YHS reads \"whose floors\"] consequently had to beripped up later); and cellular concrete roofs - termite and vermin proof and moisture proof keeping the house cool in summer and warm in winter. The Marseilles tile roofs are not satisfactory in this country of driving storms. Practically all of them leak. After one typical storm a telephone inspector told us that everywhere else in Sydney every house he had been in was leaking, some of them quite flooded, furniture damaged and so on. So he [Note: Griffin] invented a concrete diagonal roof tile whichsuccessfully kept out the storms. These horizontal Sydney storms also frequently blew the rain right through even hollow brick walls. So the brick trust is responsible for the denuding of Sydney's luxuriantly foliated gullies. With brick walls and the usual tile roofs the subtropical vegetation is a menace to the type of construction used throughout Sydney. The fig and bignonia [Note: begonia?] vines and other wall climbers work into thejoints and play hob with them. Great branches of trees fall and smash such construction. I myself know a little girl killed by a storm broken roof. With Griffin's construction there was no danger at all. The trees even but two or three feet from the wall could be left undisturbed making unnecessary the requirements of the banks that all shrubbery shall be cleared away to [Note: ==== Beginning of page 323 (table of contents) ====] VIEW TO THE SPIT [Note: ==== Beginning of page 324 ====]a distance which is about the total area of an ordinary allotment. This was another of the fights as Griffin Page 594 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoknew it was not necessary for his type of buildings. I remember the cry from the heart of the owner of a building in Brisbane whose pink Bougainvillea was one of Australia's \"sights\" of which I had heard from many travelers, when she saw Castlecrag houses. \"Oh, if my house had been built like that Ishouldn't have had to cut down my Bougainvillea!\" In Australia people complain of the heat and suffer with the cold. When they came into my house which stretched across the lot and opened up with a colonnade of windows to the lawn and the valley view, they would step out onto the lawn and feel the cold again, come back and look to see where the heat came from. It came from the floor, so this ideal under floor heating system of Mother Nature's keeps thehouse warm as in summer it keeps it cool. Then with the cellular reinforced concrete construction for the roof the house was kept warm in the winter and cool in the summer - as with an icebox. Here again however since everything is under control of officialdom every obstacle was put in the way. There was a state law requiring floors to be 18 inches above the ground. With the first C.C. [Note: Castlecrag] house Griffin argued in vain with the council for a solid floor. The law was intended to prevent dry rot,but with no air, floor in bitumen, there is no dry rot which is really rot from moisture. So with the second house Griffin decided to defy the council. He built it with a solid floor but fortunately (for councils are ruthless) before the house was completed the angels came to his rescue and sent the bubonic plague to Sydney. At Griffin's instigation (for he missed no chances) several doctors wrote to the papers saying it was a strange thing that in a place subject to bubonic plague it should beagainst the law to build a rat-proof house. Pressure was brought to bear and the law was repealed. So no longer could the law impede this step. But except for Castlecrag don't think for a moment that a general change [Note: ==== Beginning of page 325 (table of contents) ====] TERRACED KNITLOCK HOUSE [Note: The structure was designed for The Bastion at Castlecrag.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 326 ====] in building followed. In a bureaucratic community the spirit is well broken and nobody is inclined to attempt any changes. Griffin's houses continued to be the only houses in Australia that were comfortable winter and summer. Elsewhere dank, smelly, verminous spaces under one's house, scorched shins andshivering backs and chilblains in the winter - the dance hall or movie or bed the only warm places. The tile roof with its ventilated air space served somewhat in keeping the house cool in summer but in winter, since heat rises, it promptly let all the heat out whereas with cellular reinforced concrete construction it functioned like an ice-box keeping the warmth out in summer and in in the winter. But the fight against the flat roofs was perpetual though almost all the big modern buildings in every city inthe world are flat roofed. Such are the absurdities of bureaucratic rule. This going to the root of things enabled Griffin to solve the architectural problem of the design of flat Page 595 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoroof houses which I had seen struggled over in the offices where I had worked but never solved. Of course there is always the packing box type but that is no solution. \"It doesn't take an architect to design a packing box.\" (The Chicago Sun) That is no solution. Beauty and character are essential elements ofarchitecture as versus engineering - flesh as well as bone. It was well solved in the dwelling of Mr. Melson in the lovely bit of river valley in which as landscape architect he [Note: Griffin] enabled his clients to preserve the beauty, although occupied, in his Mason City group scheme. When asked what style of architecture the Castlecrag houses were his answer was - \"Early 20th Century Australian Architecture.\" He looked for and foresaw the greater and the smaller needs of individuals and communities so that five miles of foreshore with all its richly varied flora and rock grandeur were reserved for all time, an unheard of thing because the big money came from the sale of water frontage, all else selling as rubbish and going always to slumdom. But he could show his shareholders that by doing this the values of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 327 (table of contents) ====] AUSTRALIA'S GORGEOUS FLORACERATOPHYLLUM GUMMIFERUM [Note: ==== Beginning of page 328 ====] all the other lots were enhanced so that there would be no financial loss but the whole suburb would remain permanently high class. This was a revolution in Australia, and Castlecrag may be of continentalimportance there where one at present sees nothing but utter destruction of nature going on and the best districts rapidly going to slums. Elsewhere ultimately high apartments will be built all along the water's edge shutting off all harbor views, whereas on a covenanted estate such buildings could be placed on the hill crests and the beauty and outlooks retained for all time. PLANTS - Walter Burley GriffinWithout doubt all plants have their particular significance to men and the real objectiveness of their qualities has been borne out in the quite independent appeal of certain types of plants to certain classes of people. Children and amateur gardeners for instance are first drawn to flowering annuals perhaps because with these the will can be exercised to get immediate results. Age and experience bring wider interests but so important to the Briton is the functioning of his will that his appreciation of nature findsits greatest scope in gardens, even to \"Garden\" cities. The limitation of this objective is that the gardener's standard of judgment is the perfect specimen plant instead of the comprehensive group entity. The architect's ideal is often somewhat similarly confined but he is less concerned with the facility of cultivation than the forms appropriate to architectural settings, whereas the landscape architect sees in all plants the possible adaptation of their texture, color andsilhouette for the enhancing of effect of perspective and scale necessary to induce sublimity, serenity, Page 596 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofreedom or other feelings, appropriate to any given situation. In appraising Australian flora, on my arrival twenty years since, the Myrtaceae generally and certain particular species of other plant families suggested immediately vast and unique opportunities for [Note: ==== Beginning of page 329 (table of contents) ====] ECHIUM PLANTAGINEUM KANGAROO PAWS [Note: ==== Beginning of page [329-2] ====] CAPTIONS to 4 AUSTRALIAN COLOR PHOTOSSpringtime carpets West Australia Vast fields are often covered by a single variety. National Park in the October. Blue Leschnaultia is one of the state's most popular wild flowers. Christmas bush bursts aflame in December summer. This spectacular plant inhabitant of New South Wales gains its name from the period of its flowering and owes its red coloration to enlarged calyxes rather than to the actual petals. The inner petals are white and soon wither. Salvation Jane is South Australian. Its blossoms resemble hooded bonnets worn by the Salvation Army. Cattle have survived by feeding on this nitrogenous pest - Echium Plantagineurium [Note: Plantagineum?] - known as \"Peterson's curse.\" The plant is akin to the blueweed of the Shenandoah. Western Australia's Floral Emblem These oddly shaped flowers are \"kangaroo paws \" so named because the flat, unopened buds suggest the feet of Australia's equally strange animal. Several differently colored kinds of these plants grow in thestate.

Richness of color and exquisite texture they certainly had, parallel with the best of the northern flora, but additionally this almost exclusive ligneous and evergreen plant world Page 597 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagopossessed at the same time the grace of form of nude deciduous woods, and the penetrating sunlight with the deep-set shadows picked out the most lace-like sculpture that could ever give pattern to formal backgrounds of walls or pavement. Luxuriousness was exemplified in the smooth angophora, strength in the Port Jackson fig, delicacy in the lemon scented gum, whilst a subtle balance of perfectness was to be found in the prickly paper-bark ti-tree. The final word in stateliness however was left for a specimen of multi-columnar cypress pine near the north lagoon of the Melbourne Botanic Gardens then labeled Callitris columellaris. All these trees demanded preference in planting plans but no nurseryman nor gardener could ever produce thislast named plant. The botanical reference classified it only as a variety of a North Coast species whose illustration indicated a totally different character of tree. Subsequently the specimen in Melbourne was renamed correspondingly though evidently it has never borne cones to verify its identification. In the grounds of a sanitarium called \"Penquite, Doncaster Road,\" North Baldwin, Melbourne, is to be found a hedge of this species, thirty to forty feet high from which seeds can be procured as they are freelybearing. Dr. Scougall has done vital service to the topmost branch of art - Ground Planning, Ensemble Planning - in bringing to notice the 50 or 60 grand examples of this superlative tree which have been 60 to 80 years maturing in the old Grace Yard garden of Gladesville. These now known cultivated specimens already explain many things and will furnish the necessary clues to cultivation and, since one of then is seed bearing, will certainly re-establish the species in horticulture. Its sure adoption in suitablelocations all over the world will follow because it is unmatched amongst fastigiate [Note: i.e., sloping or tapering to a point] trees.

INITIAL CAPTION TREE FERNS More ancient than the seed plants are those with spores. The ferns in Australia have through the millenniums developed into trees growing to 20 or 30 feet in height, scattered through the forests, their fronds often having a spread of 15 or more feet - a number of varieties all exquisitely beautiful. The fern gullies are fairyland itself. The moisture in the atmosphere encourages all sorts of moss and lichens to grow on the barks and on the rocks making everything rich and glowing in color. Here from a bowed ancient tree fern trunk innumerable seed have sprouted and a sassafras has sent streamers down to the ground some 6 feet below and established an enduring trunk. The interlacing of colors is impossible to portray. Back a bit we see a giant [Note: N-YHS adds \"white barked\"] gum shooting up into the sky, smooth as a telegraph pole. A bit of sky-blue above and its reflection in a wee stream below give us our composition.

Nothing like them in all the world. Moist the year around. Luxuriant with an infinite variety of growth from the Fagus Cunninghamii, the Australian beech, with leaves shaped and arranged like our Maiden Hair Fern, to the fern covering of dripping rocks. The leaves of the Sassafrasitself are a bit fern-like. And the moisture of the gullies turns the bark of all these smooth barked trees all the delicate moss and lichen colors. So many of the Australian trees, unlike ours, have showy masses of blossoms that pilgrimages to the fern gullies in the Spring time are not unlike the Japanese pilgrimages to the flowering cherry and plum.

Such is the advantage of the sanguines always have over the other temperaments. Showy they are and Jacks of all trades and just as well it was for it made me a most convenient slave for that husband of mine. If I did owe him a debt from a previous incarnation, I surely did my best to pay it in full. It is as well I had no idea of that as the driving force, for the joy of those wonderful years with one of the most importantmen of his generation would surely have flown if there had been any admixture of obligation in the services rendered. Only in late life could the two angles be reconciled and the circle complete. How wisely do we, in planning for a new life, blot out the remembrance of those past debts until such time as bonds shall be so strong that nothing can matter. His was a Will temperament which lent itself to no nonsense from teacher nor wife nor bureaucracy. Yet no one ever saw him angry. When the war was on he drove ahead regardless of specious pleas of altered circumstance. Nor did he concern himself with the war until the destruction of the cathedrals began when from his indifference to the loss of life (which I must confess shocked me a bit for his nature was sweetness itself in his human relations) he became incensed at such outrages and insisted the Germans should be wiped off the face of the earth. When I objected to his inconsistency (for throughthat war, from our Australian vantage point, we were more pro-German than pro-ally) he brushed aside my arguments saying men could easily be replaced but how could one ever make up for the lost cathedrals. It was later, after several years of the fight for Canberra, that he remarked as we were crossing the paddock one day on route for the office - \"It is evident that the Lord isn't interested in architecture, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 334 (table of contents) ====] Page 599 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoCAMPBELL DWELLING [Note: An inscription on the verso identifies the structure as \"Residence [/] A.C. Cameron [/] Killara\" in New South Wales.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 335 ====] He's interested only in making men.\" It was just too incredible to him that the Lord should have such a strange preference. He himself came straight from the stars just that way with an absorbing interest in form and color. As a baby he never picked a flower. He went around the garden patting them, loving them, and when in his college days Bailey's [Note: Liberty Hyde Bailey's?] encyclopedia of plants came out he read the whole thing through, later recognizing plants when he ran across them. Even in Australiahe could identify flowers he had never seen by his remembrance of what he had read years before in Bailey. He had full use of that absolute memory that most of us evidence only in a state of hypnotism. That first year, when he was already driven day and night with both his public and private work, Saturday was always kept free for those walks in the outlying districts of Sydney, anything up to 20 miles, with Miss [Note: Constance Mary?] Le Plastrier, the botanist, identifying trees and shrubs andflowers, for Canberra must be planted right away and, except for the Botanical Gardens laid out to continents to make possible the study of world groups, it must be planted to Australian natives and it must be planted to color, segregation and combination done in full consciousness for Griffin always painted his pictures with the big brush. Nature was his handmaiden. And other [Note: another?] of Australia's best known botanists Miss Le Plastrier brought to walk with us - Mr. Hamilton [Note: Alexander Greenlaw Hamilton?] and Mr. Cheale [Note: Edwin Cheel?] - and they never resented the 7 and 8 hour lectures he got from them on relationships and soil conditions and habits for it was for Canberra and the need was urgent. By the end of the year he knew more than anyone in Australia of what was significant for a landscape architect, and could recognize plants more accurately from near by or far away. Only the aboriginals could beat him at that. It was their picturevalue that he was primarily interested in but he loved them so he could always speak to them by name. As for me, I spent much time for several years in listing plants and all details concerning them in tabulated form for use in any and all planting schemes - Newman College was already on the boards at [Note: ==== Beginning of page 336 (table of contents) ====] KNITLOCK HOUSE WALLS & ROOF [Note: The structure is the Paling House in Toorak (Malvern), New South Wales.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 337 ====] that time. It was a very compact form, tabulated to show different growth requirements, as soil, moisture and so on; heights and shapes of growths; color of flowers, foliage, berries and barks. There were those Page 600 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowho thought it might become a work of national importance. It is now being carried on by a couple of young Anthroposophists who are working in the new 20th Century methods of agriculture as established by Rudolf Steiner, methods which increase instead of depleting the fertility of the soil. Theyare looking forward eagerly to a development of Australian flora comparable to and going even further with their flora than the achievements in other countries. The results will certainly be unique. It is interesting to know that in Germany where Anthroposophy is banned (where if three people come together to converse on the subject in any of its many fields, the many fields of 20th century science, they may be handled as traitors) Anthroposophic agriculture is required (or was until they overran thebroad fields of their neighbors) for they realized the need for a type of cultivation which will produce fine crops without reducing the fertility of the soil. There were some 35 centers for distributing the knowledge and materials required and thousands of acres were planted bringing forth crops superior to those under the chemical methods which are really destroying the fertility of the soil - killing the earth. Australia is rapidly being awakened to the fact that there is something radically wrong with the present methods. Scarcely a week passes without a column or half-column article about the serious condition of the soil, about blights of the products and the diseases of the animals fed from the large quantity production methods attained by chemical fertilizers and other materialistic scientific methods some of which are denuding the districts, some creating growing deserts whose dry sands are sweeping on, constantly increasing the desert area, some of which are reducing the fertility of the soil till it isbecoming a pasty concrete-like substance, its fertility lost. It is a pity [Note: ==== Beginning of page 338 (table of contents) ====] BLUE VALLEYS OF THE AUSTRALIA MOUNTAINS [Note: ==== Beginning of page 339 ====] The Australian mountains - The Blue Mountains - are so named from the color which fills their valleys. This is no mist. I am convinced that, ancient continent that it is, the blueness is that of the ether which brought about the pre-earthly condition of matter, i.e., the liquid condition. Just so the rings of Saturn are known, even by our materialistic scientists, not to be substantial since the movements within them of the satellites is not retarded. They are one of these primeval conditions which hang over to enable men to conceive of evolution, like unit cellular [Note: unicellular?] living entities. The four rings of Saturn record the four formative etheric forces which have now manifested their created conditions - warmth, gas, liquid and solidity. Australia is our oldest continent. The chemical ether, blue, records, as do the curious vegetable and animal creatures, the pre-solid condition of the earth.

In Australia almost all the residential gardening consists of completely destroying all the natural growth and then putting in European plants, the consequence of which is that no matter how beautiful a garden might be when made when, as always happens sooner or later, the home passes into other hands it entirely disappears, for such plantings require constant attention without which they cannot last throughthe long dry seasons, so that on the whole the towns and suburbs are barren deserts compared with what we are accustomed to in America. Griffin's method of planting together according to color gave his plantings a splendor one rarely sees, and for seasonal ensembles too. To attain these ends he supplemented the flora somewhat, especially with South African plants whose local conditions closely resemble those of Australia and in whichindividual flowers are larger usually. So interested was he in losing no foot of planting space that on the whole he urged the building of flat roofs of reinforced concrete which, as occupation became more complete, could be covered with 8 inches of soil and planted with the choicest and gayest of flowering things. Thus occupation need not diminish the acreage of garden existing before man's invasion. Especially desirable is this on sloping or terraced ground where one looks down on the buildings whichthus become garden features in the midst of greenery, the roads below hidden by the tree foliage. During the early years in Australia it was impossible to comprehend the strangeness of the manner of growth of the mysterious flora. I myself in my study of drawing had been taught that trees grew just so; that the trunks grew smaller and branched out and towered upward. But no rules could be laid down for the forms of trees in Australia. The Angophora is usually called the red gum because in its general growth it is very like the gums but it is not a true eucalypt. This word means \"I cover thee.\" The seed pods of the gums are almost spherical, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 342 (table of contents) ====] CASTLECRAG RETREAT RESERVECAVERN KEEP RESERVE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 343 ====] Page 602 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagolike fairy kettles with a lid which the fire-fairies lift for the blossoms' coming out party. Not so this precursor of the gums, the most conspicuous tree of the bluffs of Sydney Harbor and growing nowhere else. With its evergreen crescent leaves and its deciduous bark it has a loveliness that chains theattention, with its brilliant red leaf tips in the new season, its masses of white blossoms and the complete peeling off of the bark in the spring leaving exposed a delicate, flesh pink skin as smooth as the check of a child the color of which gradually deepens, becomes henna, flecked and shaded with a pale but brilliant blue and ends the year with deep crimson flashed with red. But the weird enchantment one feels arises perhaps more from the shapes of the trunk and the branches and the connections with the ground. They flow and swell and contract, twist and turn in ways that are so well illustrated in the drawings of Mr. Eric Saunders, which show the ever recurring voluptuous feminine forms. They are not vegetable forms as we know them. They are more animal or human. Your mind cannot cope with the problem they present till you search back and back beyond the research of physical science into spiritual science which reveals that before Australia, was Lemuria. And you feel agreat light has flooded your soul for you begin to know things that cannot be learned through physical senses but which nevertheless the earth reveals to us and proves. We see before our very eyes forms hardened into physical conditions of today that existed in a previous condition of the earth, before geology was, before rocks were, when all creatures, [Note: the word \"man\" erased] (Adam not yet descended from Paradise), animals, plants, were liquid, living in a liquidor viscous earth, mobile, fluid, changing, when the whole earth was under the control of the chemical other of the formative forces, the force which brings about the liquid condition of matter. In these trees we seem to be seeing muscles extending and contracting, the trunk pours itself out over the rocks seeming to attach itself to them by viscid masses and [Note: ==== Beginning of page 344 (table of contents) ====] SALTER DWELLING INTERIOR .

Then one can understand these strange animal forms. The great bottle tree of Queensland, the Sterculia, is another instance.

Such understanding, as always, established more friendly relations and we wished it could be attained by more of the European invaders so many of whom had a real antipathy to this vegetation so strange tothem. From the first we had been very enthusiastic, feeling that the archangel who had painted this continent was the greatest artist of them all. I myself had done much architectural exhibition rendering work and had come near to creating some of these types to meet the requirements of architects who would insist that their buildings should be very such in evidence in my renderings of them. So I had strained a point in the veracity of the trees I used, but here nature itself accomplished the decorativecharacter required, for many of the trees were so open in their foliage that the structural members - trunks and joints and branches were always well in view, and their trunks with their endless range of color and texture and markings were exquisitely decorative too. It needed no stretch of imagination to make mural decorations of these trees. In my ever busy life there was always a minor strain because I was not able to make a set of at least a hundred of these wonderful decorations so lavishly put forth bythe fairies of this ancient continent, the Gnomes dissolving the rocks for tender rootlets, the Undines carrying up the sap, the Sylphs forming the flowers, and the Fire Fairies the seeds. A few I have recorded, The Eucalyptus Urnigera growing along the coast of Tasmania, a slender tree, vivid red, shooting like a flame straight up into the sky. Elsewhere it is the blossoms that set the forest afire, as with the Eucalyptus Ficifolia in West Australia where blossom time is a riot and the usual whiteflowers of the Gum trees turn to every color of the rainbow and many shades that no respectable [Note: ==== Beginning of page 346 (table of contents) ====] WATERGATE CASCADE RESERVE . CASTLECRAG KNOLL RESERVE . ==== Beginning of page 347 ====]rainbow ever indulged in. Stately avenue trees too so that whole streets can be planted to the unbelievable henna flame or pink or yellow. Not blue. There are Blue gums but it is the exquisite blue of their young leaves that gives them their name, not the blossoms. Think of the slopes of the Rocky Mountains planted to masses of this color, not too far above the frost line! Well why not? Come on, let's. And the Banksias with their candle-like blossoms, some small, some three inches in diameter and eight inches high growing upright on the branches. No wonder we chose it for our Christmas tree. And their strange bark, the [Note: Banksia?] integrifolia a contorted tree with a bark like the thick and deeply incised hide of a prehistoric reptile, endlessly fascinating to me always a lover of tree barks, a lover of pattern anywhere, still a faithful disciple of the Spirits of Form though I did service to the Spirits ofMotion too in my love of the dance. One of these rusty banksias closed the vista of my living room in Casa Bonita as I looked out across the veranda and down the path of my rocky terraced garden.

Nothing like them in all the world. Moist the year around. Luxuriant with an infinite variety of growth from the Fagus Cunninghamii, the Australian beech with leaves shaped and arranged like our maiden hair fern, to the fern covering of dripping rocks. The leaves of the Sassafrastree itself growing there are a bit fernlike. And the moisture of the gullies turns the bark of all those smooth barked trees to all the delicate moss and lichen colors. So many of the Australian trees, unlike ours, have showy masses of blossoms that pilgrimages to the fern tree gullies in the spring-time are not unlike the Japanese pilgrimages to the flowering cherry and plum. A pity these Anglo-Saxons have not the reverence of the Japanese in making their tea-houses beautiful expressing thus their recognition ofthe spiritual beings who have set forth such beauties for them to enjoy. Wherever I have been in Australia, and I think it is a general [Note: ==== Beginning of page 348 (table of contents) ====] INCINERATOR & CONCERT LOGGIA IN PARK [Note: ==== Beginning of page 349 ====] characteristic, the individual species of trees are very closely confined to a particular district. One can see therefore how disastrous it is when by fire or otherwise the trees of a region are destroyed. In all probability these same can be found nowhere else. With the various members of our families visiting us at not wide intervals, we took a number of trips and often noted how, even in the course of one day, we would go through several remarkable distinctive types of forest. The change might be quite sudden withsome slight unnoticeable difference in circumstance. The Eucalypt was the prevalent tree but its completely different types ran into the hundreds; the lovely spotted Gum silver gray with quite formal rounded spots of a deeper shade; or Rubida, pure white with towering trunk; some of them running to the height of our California tallest trees though not so great in girth; or in the cooler regions at a higher level, the twisting white trunks of the Snow Gum; or down the valley, dark, rough, patterned bark of theMess-Mates named for their habit of growing in pairs. One did not need to have been trained as a painter to be able to make marvelous mural decorations of these trees with their surrounding undergrowths often saprophytic [Note: i.e., living on decayed vegetable matter], that curious and unknown relationship, or shall I say unknown except to those who carry on their scientific investigations by direct perception in the realms of the four formative forces, the life forces. It is arelationship somewhat of the nature of that of the citrus fruit trees to the nasturtiums which if planted around them prevent the ordinary blights to which the citrus fruits are subject in our artificial way of growing them. One could copy literally the forms and colors as they were handled in nature itself arranged just as one is taught to do with pigments to get luminous effects by juxtaposition of color against color instead of the amateurish way of trying to present color directly and imitatively. InAustralia you could imitate and still get the reputation of being an artist.

LEPTOSPERMUM . NEW SOUTH WALES . TI TREE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 351 ====] No. 16. [Note: 19] INITIAL CAPTION LEPTOSPERMUMThe Leptospermum, the Ti-tree of New South Wales, is weird beyond words. It carries to the extreme all the characteristics of Australian forestry. It seems a very part of the rock formations and yet it emphasizes in even the trunk that spiral which is the great mathematical deity at the base of all plant life. The hyperboloid, the leaf form. That archetype which [Note: Johann Wolfgang von] Goethe saw, the ego back of all plant life, the idea which Goethe explained to [Note: Friedrich von] Schiller who after awhile said - \"Oh you mean your idea.\" \"Well,\" said Goethe, \"If it was my idea I saw my idea.\" This hyperboloid is one of the creations of the Great Primeval Creative Spirits, the hyperboloid which in the plant kingdom spirals its way from the finite to the infinite. The tree by its nature is immortal, forever young as its living part lies between the external bark and the interior core, as young after centuries have passed as in its early days. We see this movement in the twining vane, in the spiral, sometimescompacted into a circle, of the arrangements of leaves on the stem, and if you want your dreams to climb out of their grotesqueries into the infinite send your soul as you go to sleep up this mounting curve. In the plant kingdom it can't go so high but expands and contracts in three great cycles - leaf to stem, blossom to pistil, fruit to seed. The leptospermum grows in dense masses, an almost impenetrable low forest, grey in stem and branch and leaf, though an occasional single tree gets left behind as the grove moves across the sandy seacoast over which it spreads its roots wide in search for water. For though the plants create the minerals we find as crystals and rocks, the plants themselves arise from the kingdom of liquidity. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 352 ====] INITIAL - LEPTOSPERMUM - NEW SOUTH WALES TI TREE [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.] WITHIN THE LAW For many years there had been the opposition of the councils since any specifications for residences deviating from those laid down by the Roman Empire were not to be tolerated. And there was the unitedfront of Australia against anyone coming from the outside for the open door to immigration has never been the policy of Australia, that open door policy that made the United States the richest country in the world. So that in addition to the refusals of the banks to lend money except to the routine spec builders and their clients, and their requirement that the building should be brick since they had holdings in the brick trust which prevented the whole community from building with the beautiful local stone, theopposition was supported by the whole legal profession. Naturally individuals negotiating for the Page 606 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagopurchase of a lot would refer the matter to a lawyer for technical advice, contract form, and so on. I think without exception the lawyers of Sydney did not limit their advice to such points but unanimously discouraged their clients from purchasing land at Castlecrag. Of course the point they made openly wasthe covenants but the real reason was that Griffin was a foreigner. But we kept on keeping on. Covenants were not new to the British Empire. After several years Griffin noticed a suspicious advertisement in the paper. In undertaking this enterprise he had done all the so called promotion work. He had discovered the property and bought it himself, making the first deposits, and forming the company had sold the shares. He took no promoter'sfees for any of this work but made it clear from the beginning that what he needed and would take as a substitute would be a managing director's control, for a unified management would be essential for the carrying out of the planned and covenanted development. It was written into the original articles that the first three shares which he owned should have a special voting power which would give him this control. In the early years he never used this power but the share-holders always knew it was there and finally decided they would \"put one over\" [Note: ==== Beginning of page 353 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . BATTERED STONE WALLS . ERIC PRATTEN [Note: ==== Beginning of page 354 ====]on him. An advertisement appeared in the Sydney papers. This suspicious paragraph was an advertisement for a manager of an estate, the wording of which sounded much like Castlecrag. Griffin immediately looked into the matter in order to prevent a possible fait accompli. The situation resolved itself into a lawsuit between Griffin and the company to establish the status of the special voting power of his shares. This dragged on for months piling up costs into the thousands of pounds for both partiesfor the British law is the Roman law based on the protection of the citizens against the foreigner and the judge was evidently very loath to give a verdict for Griffin though he accused the shareholders of flagrant dishonesty in the evidence they gave. You see there were too many covenanted properties in the community for him to want to outlaw covenants. He finally hit on an ingenious way of distinguishing between the three shares and gave his verdict that two of them carried the special voting power but notthe third. No one hearing the case could tell whether Griffin had lost or won. As it happened he had enough other shares to maintain his majority vote. How disgusted the judge must have been. Now a curious thing happened. For some time I had been dilating to the young folks who passed through my hands on a pet theory. I think something of Louis Sullivan's I had read put the notion in my head. It was that emotions are real forces. If a thing can bring about deeds it must be a force, so whywaste such forces? If one was tempted to fly into a rage why should one just suppress that force? Why not instead divert it to some special use as with electricity one can turn on a current to illuminate a room or to heat a flat iron. So my advice to the young fry was to divert such forces from direct explosions into Page 607 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoacquiring a house and lot, or a horse and buggy. We had much fun over it but when this serious situation arose I definitely undertook to divert my many opportunities for wrathful explosions, or for soul development, to the end of bringing it about that, if it was really of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 355 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING & GARAGE . ERIC PRATTEN [Note: The caption to the New-York Historical Society illustrations adds to the title \"No Let Down In Out Buildings.\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 356 ====] The idea of slumping in the quality of minor buildings is as shocking as the false fronts in Urban buildings. [Note: The word \"Caption\" is at the top of the page in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 357 ====] [Note: Continued from page 354] value to the community Griffin should be enabled to carry on this work which seemed to us so desirable. Some of the share-holders had been going around quite openly bragging that they didn't care whether they won this first suit or not; that it was the company's money against Griffin's private resources and they would take the case from court to court until they bankrupted him. However, when the verdict was given against the company, nothing happened. It had been a long drawn out affair. But one day whenGriffin was down in Melbourne, our lawyer rang me and said something had happened and would I come down to take lunch with him to talk the matter over. He started the conversation by saying, \"Now don't get excited.\" He was, by the way, one of those to whom I had aired my theories. And then he told me that the lawyers on the opposite side had come to him asking as a favor of courtesy of the profession that he should grant them the privilege of appealing the case. He had consulted with his partner on thematter and the partner, a considerably older man, had said that in this particular case where the personal venom of the opposing party was well known, he should not acquiesce in such a request without the permission of his client. What had happened was this. On our side we had one solicitor and one barrister, a requisite in the British courts. The Company opposing us had two solicitors and four barristers, the most renownedcompany barristers in Australia, all experienced and knowing the technicalities in these questions thoroughly. But the Powers that be had apparently put them all to sleep just long enough for, if a case is to be appealed to the higher courts, the intention must be put before the court before a fortnight has Page 608 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagopassed, and a deposit of 100 pounds laid down as evidence of sincerity. The fortnight had passed. It was required that if a case were to be taken to the Privy Council this intention must be put before the court within three weeks. The three weeks had just expired when suddenly they woke up to the fact thatno longer was it in [Note: ==== Beginning of page 358 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . DAVID PRATTEN . ENTRANCE LANTERNS [Note: ==== Beginning of page 359 ====] their power to take the case as they had planned to the High Court, the Supreme Court or the Privy Council. This latter would itself have entailed very heavy expenses before the legal proceedings could even begin. In my own diversions I had repeatedly said I wished these men no harm, but what human imagination could have conceived of putting into effect such forces as these to safeguard this undertaking in this emergency? Naturally I made every attempt to get in touch with Griffin in Melbourne to warn him. I didnot succeed but, amiable as his nature is, though they had all been buzzing around him saying heaven knows what to commit him to something that would make it possible to carry on the legal action, he did not get caught in any of their traps. He did not know what had happened till he got back to Sydney. As time went on, a doctor came to this community with the intention of making his home there and of building a private and convalescent hospital as well. With all its rural loveliness, we were so near thecenter of the city that the doctor could get to his urban office in twelve minutes by using a doctor's privilege of speeding when he chose. From its initiation, with the purchase of a building already constructed as a nucleus, this enterprise was very successful. Consequently he bought further property adjacent for an extension of the hospital and, across the street, for a separate dwelling. From the beginning he was delighted with the type of development and with the charm and advantage of the flatroof. He called upon Griffin as architect in these further structures but instead of calling for tenders as was Griffin's custom, he preferred to use a builder who had previously done work for him. We are now convinced that the brick trust took advantage of this to influence Dr. Rivett to defy the covenant which required that no construction could be carried our without the consent of the Company's architect. One point after another was brought up to alter the structure from ways with which the doctor himself hadbeen [Note: ==== Beginning of page 360 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . STONE . DR. RIVETT . ACROSS STREET FROM HIS HOSPITAL [Note: The structure is the Rivett House at Castlecrag.] Page 609 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 361 (table of contents) ====] PHOTO . MARION MAHONY GRIFFIN . PHOTO BY KOEHNE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 362 ====] [Note: Continued from page 359]in entire sympathy. Griffin acquiesced in one after another of these but also the builder was constantly on the alert to slip something over without Griffin's knowledge, and presently we saw that construction was being pushed ahead for a sloping tile roof instead of the flat one as on the working drawings. It was not that Griffin would not authorize tile roofs or had not at times done so where the client desired and no disadvantage would result from obstructing the view of the neighboring dwellings and this house wason the top level but, if such construction was effected without his approval, it would make it impossible to enforce the covenant, since it would be a defiance of the covenant, and would establish a precedent. He made every possible speed to place an injunction to prevent proceeding with this roof, but the builder drove ahead working day and night and Sundays to complete it even after the injunction had been placed. Again we were in the courts. The costs for each party ran up to $10,000. The judge was finding it difficult to get a foot to stand on for giving the verdict against the foreigner but finally, in preparing to sum up the case, he hit upon a bright idea and brought up a trifling point to which even the opposing barrister rose to say he didn't put any weight on that particular piece of evidence. The judge, however, waived him aside and gave the decision on that point alone against Griffin. Consideration for others makes it impossible for me to state what thepoint was, but it sufficed to give the verdict against Griffin without implicating the covenants. To have established a precedent for defying covenants would have menaced important imperial interests and would have discredited him in the profession so we did not reap the technical advantage of having the covenant issue established but the suit was so conspicuous that it really did establish it in the eyes of the community. Before we could appeal the case, another suit had arisen with the extension of the hospital unit in which a supposedly reputable architect was caught perjuring himself. He swore that a certain [Note: ==== Beginning of page 363 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . SEGMENTAL REINFORCED CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION [Note: The [Greater Sydney Development Quarters.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 364 ====] drawing had been approved by Griffin and brought the plan as evidence showing Griffin's signed approval on the drawing. As it happened, when this drawing had been submitted to Griffin with a Page 610 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoparticular form of construction, he had signed his name in approval but before returning it and sent it over to be blue printed so that when he produced the blue print it became apparent that the document had been altered after his signature. Curiously enough no one in the court stressed this fact but when thearchitect looked confounded and distressed about it everyone used every means of quieting his nerves and placating him, even our own lawyer (an Australian of course), so no weight was given to this fact. However by this time the judge was getting a bit jittery and gave very strong instructions to the lawyers to get their clients together in a mutual agreement that would remove the case from the court. An agreement was arrived at and that was that. Griffin had entered these cases only because the whole of his undertaking would have been brought to an end if he had not taken action. We already knew the ways in which foreigners would be handled in the courts. We learned that from an experience of my own in the early years of our stay in Australia. I had for some years before been practicing architecture either on my own or in partnership and took it as a matter of course that if anything worked that way I should continue in my profession. A residential jobwas brought to me and I carried it through. When the construction was completed the client refused to pay any fee. I myself was inclined to do nothing about it but Griffin thought that was improper, that in a way an architect owed it to his profession not to accept such a situation. So it was taken to the court. Now one does not need to say that judges as a whole are corrupt. In an ingenious system such as the British Empire they need only a few, or perhaps only one, to manage the situations that may require acorrupt judge. The method is the following one and was used in my case. When the listing of the cases was published my own was far down on the list, 20 cases [Note: ==== Beginning of page 365 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . ADOLPH MUELLER . MARION MAHONY HOLST Architects [Note: The Adolph Mueller House is in Millikin Place, Decatur, Illinois.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 366 ====] ahead of mine, so far away that my barrister put off looking into my testimony on the day when we went to court. Not the regular judge but a different one was on the bench. Evidently the barristers as a whole when they saw the judge who was sitting knew something was up and one after another of themmade some sort of a plea for the delaying of their cases till mine was left the first on the list. Just why my own lawyer made no such attempt, I don't know. This judge had shortly before been used for a similar purpose in a Parliamentary case. My client had been brought to me by a civil servant, i.e., by an enemy, of our acquaintance. When the newspaper reporters came in the following session before court was called I heard one of them say, \"Well what mischief's up now.\" The response was simply a liftingof the eyebrows. Curious eyes were turned on me. The evidence was taken on both sides and stress laid on such points as my having used undue pressure on my client to induce him to accept my advice, one of the evidences being that I had given him pains-taking and very complete and attractive looking drawings. Also that the absurdity of having a heating system had been forced on him. The discomfort of Page 611 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe winter season was in fact one of the things he was anxious that I should solve, counting on my American experience to accomplish that. The client himself was a civil servant and I am sure they must have had him in the bag in some way for quite evidently he had been told not to worry, to say anythinghe wanted to, that nothing he said would prevent his winning the case for, much to the astonishment of my lawyers when he took the stand, white as a sheet, he expressed satisfaction in all his dealings with me, complete satisfaction in the house and particularly expressed his satisfaction in the comfort of the heating system. The verdict was given against me all costs to be borne by me. However in these cases of Griffin's he had no option and had to go into the courts willy-nilly. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 367 (table of contents) ====] METROPOLITAN INCINERATOR [Note: An inscription on the verso reads: \"Incinerator - Alternative Design [/] Pyrmont\" in South Wales.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 368 ====] The circuit court is perfectly arranged to facilitate corruption. This does not mean that it is necessary that all or many of the judges need be corrupt except that the consequences of the system must be apparent and that they acquiesce in being a part of the system. When a case is up in which the predetermined decision is desired the judge in the particular court can be sent to another district and another judge, one of the chosen for this kind of work, can be placed on thebench. The lawyers may become used to the consequences under such judge and as in the case of an architect versus a Civil Servant for fees, they may ask for postponement of their case. The lawyer of the predetermined case may or may not ask for postponement. If he does the judge won't grant it. There are no official notes taken. The client may ask for such and pay for them but in all probability he will not know anything about the court system or requirements or privileges. His lawyer may or maynot advise his client on this point. In this case he did not and the client knew nothing of this right. The judge then is the only one who takes any notes. He takes down what he pleases and leaves out what he pleases; in this case the client noticed and her barrister afterward commented on the fact to her that he took down none of her statements but only those of the opposite side. The judgment was for the Civil Servant and included extreme accusations of the architect though the defendant in his evidence had socompletely admitted everything the architect had said that her lawyer said, \"Well there is no need of cross-examining this man,\" and his lawyer said afterward to one of the architect's witnesses that it was a rotten judgment. It is supposed to be possible to appeal but this is in fact not possible as the architect's lawyer made clear to her since the higher court takes no evidence and can base its decision only on what the judge shows it. Since no stenographic notes had been taken there was nothing to put before a highercourt.

The government is helpless before the judiciary and this in the affairs that are supposed to be of most vital concern to the community. There is no court or judge before whom they can take their cases so they have to go from pillar to post askingthis judge and that if they will be so kind as to take on this case. Frequently every one of the supreme justices will refuse to take on a Royal Commission. Then sometimes no State judge will act, then the Government goes hunting about for a barrister who will be willing to act. Naturally in a case that looks bad for the officials it will be extremely difficult to find anyone willing to take it on as, if a judgment against the officials is rendered, it means the end of that judge's career and if the truth is plain to thepublic it may be very trying to have to render judgment in their favor. The system is one which presupposes that one will not be inclined to accept the position unless is has been made worth his while by one side or the other. As a rule all the favors are in the hands of the bureaucrats. Again the system is one that promotes corruption. FIREPLACE .

Knox suggested that the solution of the European problem would be for them to have a Union, not Political but Economic. This is a constructive idea for which type of concept we have urgent need. But it is not enough that we suggest what Europe should do, we should set her the example. The founders of our constitution gave a sound definition of the function of government - an organ to maintain Equity. No other country has been so favored as to havea correct concept. It definitely established the political government to meet the moral requirements of human beings in a community. Everywhere else welfare is the basis, and that means grab anythinganywhere you can get it. It rests on the concept that might is right. The century following the foundation of America has developed an economic life which is essentially a community affair since it is based on the division of labor. It is now plain that economic problemscannot be solved by individuals. To meet the bodily needs is now a community affair and requires a community organization. (See the Delaware River transformation.) This can function wholesomely onlyif it is independent of the political organization. Its laws are entirely different. Business cannot be run democratically. There can be no efficiency in business run by majority votes. Its law is mutuality, mutual advantage , not equity. An Economic Organization should consist of the total citizenry, not organized democratically but consisting of multitudinous economic associations, and which in its totality would have exact knowledge, based on experience, of all sides of economic affairs.

Human beings are different and would not be human beings if they were not different. But mutual advantage in business is a sound economic principle. Where is the easiestplace in the world to put that concept into practice? Though we must have different political units, at least until the peoples of the world are better acquainted with each other than they are at present, when it comes to the economic organization we can, without confusion, have different units as was suggested - Europe, the Orient, the Americas - or a world Economic Organization, which would be the soundest of all for then we should have that type oforganization where things are made and sold within one and the same boundary of which the United States was an example, in contradistinction say to England, and which of itself tends to the maximum efficiency and the highest standard of living of the community as a whole. Now we Americans are the favored of the Gods at the present time. Such favors entail obligations. Nowhere would it be so easy to establish a National Economic Organ as in America and indeed we needit as much as Europe for the rate at which we are being Europeanized is terrifying. Law or no law we are building up interstate tariffs or exclusions on one subterfuge or another. Another decade and internal warfare will be well established here. But at present there is less animosity between individuals and groups here than anywhere in the world. The bitterness between classes in other parts of the world is something beyond the imagination of Americans. To effect the separation of these two utterly different fields would not be difficult here, at least comparatively speaking. Organization is the peculiar genius of Americans. But now the whole tendency here is to follow Europe's example and have the Government take upon itself more and more control of community affairs and this no [Note: ==== Beginning of page 375 (table of contents) ====] SWASTIKA FLAT BUILDING .

Lacking other national community organizations it cannot do otherwise. It is so apparent that something must be done. And since we like all other communities are totalitarian, having but one organ to attend to community affairs, we throw up our hands even if we do not approve and say well the government must intervene. Even the big business men, who certainly know that any minute the government wants to it will take over their business and leave them paupers, have no Page 615 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoconstructive suggestions to make whereas it is they who could expedite the formation of an economic organ if they would extend their thinking to broader lines. There should of course be no trying to bring this about by political means. We cannot expect a King to cut off his own head. Economics is the realm of buying and selling so money, whose concern should be just that, should be in the control of the economic organ where it could not be played with as we have seen all our communities do since the first world war with such disastrous results. Any attempt to do so would be a crime and would be dealt with as such by the political organ which under such circumstances could work with clean hands. The concept of a Threefold Commonwealth has been well worked out by Rudolf Steiner - one organ to effect liberty, one to effect mutuality, and one to effect equity, the three needs of human beings in a community. That these three completely different functions cannot be carried out by one organ is axiomatic - as impossible as for the individual human being to carry our his three functions of digesting, circulation and thinking without the stomach, heart and brain organizations. It is equally obvious thatthere should be no central organization. Each must function independently though the fruits of each are used by all.

A sharp turn as here would make the street frontage quite narrow. As shown in the photo the only street level entrance is out through the rock; to the left under the bedroom above is the garage, to the right, already on the level of the street, is a gate to the kitchen yard, straight down through a tunnel between the walls of the garage and the kitchen between beautiful gold-tiled walls one reaches the handsome illuminated front door. Above the garagethe housekeeper's suite as shown in the photo is open on three sides to fine views especially grand to the Southwest. The front door opens into a great reception hall with intriguing prospects on every side. To the left a short flight of tile-patterned masonry steps takes one to the bedroom floor. The two main bedrooms are to the east both with direct access to the roofs of the main rooms below and stepping up to the higherroofs, with awnings when desired, and grand views on every side over the valley and harbor. To the right of the reception room is a colonnade of openings into the dining room which in addition to its valley view is lighted night and day by a large fish-pool in its ceiling with glass bottom. To the left through a broad opening a wide flight of steps down, for the room is under one of the bedrooms above, brings you to the library, its high windows to the East. On ahead from the reception hall to the East is a grand central stone fireplace with opening in center between its flues so that you see on beyond into the living room with its windows sweeping around the further side to the East and North and South.

The nature of the allotment on which it is to be built determines the type of house. The Fishwick house at Castlecrag - from its roof the one a half story above the other - commanded two valleys one to the South, the other to the East and North-east. The residents here spent much or their time and entertained their guests on these superb lookout terraces, and supplemented their garden with showy, blossoming plants annual and perennial. A path down the valley leads directly to the open air theatre but before plays had been given there the dwelling itself had made charming settings for plays. In this case the living rooms are on the lower level, the bedrooms half a story above and the library a half story below. The allotment is kite shaped, the only street frontage is on a circular drive with an interior monumental rock garden circle in the center, just sufficient to give the triple entrance to the dwelling, in the center thegold tiled walls of the front entrance, to the left the garage opening, to the right the entrance to the kitchen yard and the kitchen. This is the only stub end street on the Crag and arose from the fact that the Council had forced a steep road down to the next level to give entrance to a boating reserve so the Castlecrag lower roads diverged from that. This dwelling gets superb views in all directions.

Here were held musicals, for madam was a musician herself and, as customary in such town planned communities, each family centered on its particular field and genius in its often even grandiose affairs of hospitality. Here, before the valley theatre had yet been made available, was presented Goethe's \"The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily\" - his only fairy story. It is impossible to describe the loveliness ofsuch a production. The guests packed the house including the areas of the windows outside. It was given in German this time. When presented in the valley later on it was in English and miraculously lovely.

EUCALYPTUS RUBIDA [Note: ==== Beginning of page 385 ====]No. 21 - INITIAL CAPTION BLUE GUM The Blue Gum of New South Wales is named from the gleaming blue color of the leaves of the young tree which is quite bushy and the leaves almost circular. They lose this color as the tree shoots up into the sky and become narrow and sharp pointed. Material science has no explanation for the power of the sap to rise to such heights. Only spiritual science through its perception of forces can explain it for neither the pumping power of the weight of the atmosphere nor osmosis can lift liquids to such heights. But those who can see the four elemental formative forces can see the rising of the blue chemical ether, which creates the liquid condition of matter, every morning as the living earth breaths out carrying the vegetable saps upward and rising highin the atmosphere where it builds the clouds. In the perfectly balanced flora of Australia we find many saprophytic [Note: i.e., living on decayed organic matter] plants as in this case. The tree and this bush are interdependent. [Note: The paragraph above is crossed out in the New-York Historical Society copy.] The Rubida is one of that group of white barked Gum trees some of which rival our Sequoia Gigantea in height.

It is not then hard to understand that \"in this kingdom the spirits are ever active transforming the invisible into the visible, the realm of time into the realm of space.\" The white bark of the Rubida does not need to be interpreted through the artist's technique.

And not only are these trees evergreen and in perfect foliage all the year round but many of them have a long season of luxuriant and lovely bloom - white, orange, scarlet, yellow, blue - and the color of their barks runs a gamut surprising to one coming from a cooler climate. To know how to plant the streets of Sydney or Melbourne one needs only to go tramping about the environing country where one would find in perfect condition the beautiful growths that covered thesites of the cities before they were devastated by the human grasshopper. Now, it is high time we were repenting of our sins and getting to work to replant these same trees. It is impossible to conceive a more beautiful tree that the Angophora Lanceolata, one of the most common trees about Sydney and of which beautiful specimens can be found in Melbourne; and the exquisite color of its smooth bark varies with the seasons from a warm gray to a lovely rose and cinnamon, becoming really brilliant against the richtone of its foliage, so beautifully massed, setting off but not concealing the branches which grow in a curious liquid fashion quite contrary to the rule of thumb for drawing trees which I was taught - very picturesque. This is one of the old trees of Australia, the precursor of the Eucalyptus. Two other Angophoras are superb for avenue planting. Ideal too are the Eucalypts. Occasionally we find some of these trees along the roadside where we can get an idea of their perfection [Note: ==== Beginning of page 387 (table of contents) ====] TREE FERN GULLY [Note: ==== Beginning of page 388 ====] for this purpose. The Haemastoma, the white bark, the Eucalyptus Teretecornis of which I have seen a specimen 4 feet in diameter, a wonderful tree with all the ideal requirements for avenue planting, its bark banded with white and soft grey like a lovely drawing, its branching open, showing clearly through the foliage, its delicate foliage giving ample soft shade yet letting the breeze through. This, as many others of this family, as the rubida, the saligna and regnens, is perfect from an architectural point of view. While relieving the severity and coldness of the buildings it still leaves them visible as it does its ownbeautiful branches. A short walk on the outskirts of Melbourne will bring one to splendid specimens of the Banksia, perfect in form for street planting. Among the Melaleucas, the dream tree, Styphelioides and Leucadendron. If you want dense shade, the splendid Eugenia Ventenatii or Ficus Rubiginosa or one stately and loss spreading Syncarpia, or for needle like delicacy of foliage the Casuarina. We can find native treesvarying from the wide spreading to slender vertical forms; from dense mass to open growth; from deep rich greens to lovely grey or russet tones; from thick leaves to the daintiest possible, as in the Casuarina like a lovely mist.

Among these the superb Tarietes, 3 quite distinct types, and the Cryptocaria Triplynervis, and Obovata, stately as possible with tall trunk same 80 feet high and a splendid spreading top. The Stenocarpus Sinuata, a miracle of a tree which we can see aflame in the gardens. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 389 (table of contents) ====] CLUB HOUSE .

There is no limit to the variety of our arboreal material for a variety of effects. In marked contrast to the Eucalyptus is the stately vertical trunk of the Agathis, a broad-leaved conifer growing to a hundred feet in height. If one wants to alternate trees of contrasting height and type, conceive the beauty of an avenue of the splendid Grevillea Robusta alternating with Callistemon Viminalis. The Grevilleas grow to a greatheight, ridged black bark, wonderful rich foliage, as graceful in manner of growth as the much talked about American Elm, with the added miracle of a season of gorgeous orange blossoms, alternating these with the multiple stemmed, ragged barked grey trunk, the new foliage red leaved and beautiful blossoms lasting a long season. In fact the long blooming season of most Australian trees and shrubs is an amazing thing to one accustomed to seeing the quickly disappearing blossoms of other regions. Among other trees are the Castanospermum Australe, Flindersia, Fagus Australe, Lagunaria, covered in its season with tiny crab-apple like blossoms. Among the small avenue trees the Eugenia Touhmani and Tomlinsi, solid foliage from the ground up, Panax Elegans with its graceful stem and spreading top, or the lovely Archontophoenix Cunninghamii, smaller than but just as graceful and beautiful as the Royal Palm. What a stately colonnade these would form planted on either side of a lane, not too far apart, thestraight grey shaft and the graceful capital; an endless number of trees perfect for avenue use.

On the foreshores of Middle Harbor, than which nature never created anything lovelier, a picture is developing whose painter uses not brushes and pigments but trees and shrubs and all the growing things, mostly native flora, and the local stone; knowing that a painter achieves his great effects by a restricted palette, thus achieving harmonies comprehensible and therefore acceptable to the human mind. Wherever human communities have succeeding in leaving group structures that delight the soul for all time it has been by using a single material indigenous to the locality - the palm-thatched villages of thetropics, the adobe and cliff dwellings of the Pueblo Indians, the hill cities of Italy whose stone structures seem an absolute unit with the hills themselves. Sydney has used its beautiful stone to a considerable extent in its city buildings, but what a shock do the nerves receive when we look upon the great stretches of residences, and by far the greater part of a city is composed of residences. The raw odour of crude bricks, the chaotic hodge-podge of varied forms, thestartling red clumsy roofs sloping to shed the snow where snow never falls, the impounding paling [Note: i.e., wooden stake] fences - one after another the lovely ever-blooming slopes of Sydney's harbour are thus transformed. But one spot, by a man of destiny, has escaped this type of development which so wrings the heart of everyone who has known Sydney's loveliness and returns - after an absence of ten or fifteen years. The prevalent road systems of Sydney's foreshores take the street from the high point to the low point, like a knife slashing a canvas, leaving an ugly scar that never can be concealed, while at Castlecrag the roads of easy grades sweeping along the bluffs are invisible [Note: ==== Beginning of page 393 (table of contents) ====] SUSPENSION BRIDGE .

The dwellings in this new suburb are in accord with that most fundamental of nature's laws. They are inconspicuous, destroying none of the natural harmonies and, when under the protection of the present management nature has had time to recover from the devastation of fire and axe, which has gone so far already toward making a desert of Australia, they will nestle into place so that these slopes, even when as intensely occupied as the already developed suburbs, will be as completely garden as they were before they were touched by the hand of man. A natural acropolis, three hundred feet above the water, on the central peninsula, Covecrag, is the civic center. A sports field surrounded by public and semi-public buildings, is entered from the business thoroughfare through a semicircular colonnaded gateway. This center comprises such buildings as Churches, Clubs, Assembly Halls, Schools, Libraries, Hotels and Theatres. Two natural amphitheatres are located - the Cove theatre on the water frontage, the Glen theatre at the head of the valley.

Instead of the garbage being introduced directly to the fire, however, it is first received on a sloping drying hearth grate and passed through a blast of air heated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. At the lower end of the sloping hearth is a residue chamber into which the clinker and ash are drawn by the stoker from a rear port, and the residue is tipped, as accumulated through horizontal revolving hopper doors into steel ash skips in an enclosed tunnel beneath, whence, free of all dust, the skip carts arewithdrawn.

So it is always. A thing to be done has to be done by one man. Thomas Jefferson in the 18th century established a democratic organization on a sound foundation with Equity as its basis. The following century brought about a development in another field beyond the reach of the imagination of proceeding periods. This was in the economic field. Where is the man who will take the next step to follow Jefferson's, necessary for health in a human community? For like man himself a humancommunity is a living thing. It cannot stand still, it must grow and develop. A hundred years have passed. The next step is urgent. There are plenty of men with the ability but where is one with the courage to establish an Economic Organization? World economy is already here. It needs but a crystal to be thrown into the vat to crystallize it into an instrument for lack of which the world is perishing now - a World Economic Organization.

There surely cannot be a business man in our community now whose eyes have not been opened by the events of the last two years to the fact that anytime the government wants to it will take over his business andhe will be a pauper among paupers. Totalitarianism goes that way of its own momentum and we are totalitarian. All our governments are organized as power instruments. To maintain equity it must have power, as is apparent in the traffic police problem. They will use that power indiscriminately so long as there is but one instrument to attend to community affairs. Its power can be defined, limited, only if instruments areprovided for meeting other community requirements than that of equity, not only for the present generation but for those to come - conservation of the earth for example.

MELBOURNE [Note: The structure is also known as the Keith Arcade.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 402 ====] Material science came to its flower in the 19th Century. Through it a new technique has been developed in the material realm, that of providing for our bodily needs, that of Economics. It is in America that the practical effects of Jefferson's discriminating thinking gave the freest rein to economic life the consequences of which are continually being brought to our attention these days in statistics andpublications of the wealth, ingenuity and enterprise of America compared with other communities - on which all the others are showing themselves to be more or less dependent at the present time. It is for America to take the lead in solving these problems we are faced with now. America is the land of adventurers. Most of the adventurers of the world now have come here, for nowhere else were the doors open to them. Deeds are in the nature of adventures. Is there no one now among these men ofdeeds who will take the initiative in building up an Economic Organization? To do that one should not look for assistance from the political organ. It needs no new legislation nor need we bother our heads about old legislation. We cannot expect the political organ to diminish its own powers. But entirely outside of politics we can build up a complete Economic Organ which when established will stand on an equal footing with the political institution and, consisting as it must of the total citizenry, will quietlyattend to its own affairs, that of buying and selling, leaving to the government only the task of maintaining Equity. Our efficiency would be enormously increased thereby and the further step of making it a world-wide organization would come of itself. My prophesy would be that India would be the first to follow suit, India which has savvy enough to realize that Dominion status is no good. Mexico next I think and China and also Ireland who hasrefused dominion status. And the dominions would begin to wake up and Canada and South Africa would follow and even Australia and New Zealand.

It is perhaps peculiarly American, but in fact there is not in the United States much interest in building up, in endowing families. In fact the usual parent feels a bit proud of having built up his own businessor wealth and would love to be able to take pride in his son for doing the same himself. Out of this there has arisen the curious fact that over half the wealth in the United States is in the hands of women. Men would rather pass their wealth to their wives than to their sons. There quite likely are the \"sixty families\" but that is a bit ridiculous to the American. In consequence they have become the magnificent givers, their donations functioning all over the world. And that is as it should be. Now this method is one of themost important factors in a wholesome Economic system for as in a living being the getting and eating of food is a minor factor compared with the necessity of eliminating, at least one can live longer withouteating than be can without eliminating, yet we have not been in the habit of considering the complete, absolute consumption of capital as being as necessary as its production. Indeed this is the essential difference between the mineral and the other kingdoms. Entities in the mineral kingdom can accumulate, can get and get. In fact one of our astronomers, Mr. Chamberlain [Note: Thomas Chrowder Chamberlain?], based his ideas of the universe on this accretion theory. Shame on him! He's no true American. Americans believe in living. He belongs with the imperialists. The principle of subtraction, of discrimination, of elimination, is the essential of living kingdoms and our Solar System is a living thing. Our real problem today is not one of poverty, but one of wealth. How to dispose of our wealth! This cannot be solved by the ordinary concept of distribution but only by a proper method of circulation, [Note: \"Sixty families\" probably refers to Ferdinand Lundberg's 1937 book \"America's 60 Families,\" Page 627 of 923 to of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowhich claimed that America was owned and dominated by a hierarchy of sixty of the richest families.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 406 (table of contents) ====] MINIMUM COST HOUSE & FUTURE EXTENSIONS [Note: J.

America is probably the only place today where the problem of an economic association can be tackled (because of its sufficient area and population) and solved because of an interesting fact. In the United States there is not the bitterness between employer and employee that exists elsewhere. You have to see it to believe that such venom can exist even in Australia which is supposed to be a workman's paradise. No month passes that some expression does not come before us in America of a realization on the part now of the employee, now of the employer, of the fact that theproblem cannot be solved from the outside but that the solution must meet the necessities of both elements. Now in 1944 we are beginning to see the working together of labor and management to solve the economic problems, no longer so bitter a warfare. There are only two possible kinds of economics. And there is only one way in which the conflict can be completely solved. In the one the manufacturer sells without his boundaries, in the other within. There isa whole world of difference. If one sells one's products beyond the boundaries he has no interest in his employees except to get the articles made at the cheapest price so his whole effort is bent on keeping hours long and wages and standard of living as low as possible. If a man wants to get rich and cannot sell except within the boundaries he (and the whole manufacturing group) must see to it that the employees, which for the most part constitute the purchasing element, musthave an increasingly higher standard of living, must be able to purchase everything that is manufactured in the community and must have time enough to use them. Does this require the isolation policy so fashionable today? By no means. You see our feelings lead us astray. We must have correct concepts. The great mistake of President [Note: Woodrow] Wilson was his advocacy of the self-determination policy. The need of today is for all sorts of people to find a wayto live together.

It requires the diametric opposite of isolation, for to attain this latter form of economy the Economic Organization should be not national but world wide, should not be concerned with national boundaries but entirely independent of them. With the whole world united in its economic affairs in one organization, with the National government connected with it in no way except to maintain equity withinits own boundaries, with an end put to the interfering of the governments in economic affairs, it will be possible for economic life to be carried on in accordance with its own nature, that of mutual advantage . National economy, the concept \"for the benefit of the citizens\" cannot but result in war. With World Economy established the way will be open for the maximum differentiation not of races or peoples but of individuals which humanity is ripe for now. The states will express themselves in different standards of morals and efficiency which does not entail conflict so long as the Political Organ is independent of the Economic Organ. As soon as America has taken this next step which will bring democracy down out of the clouds by giving it a body to function with, it will become apparent that patriotism does not mean a bond to a locality but to a soul conception. Strictly speaking that is the definition of a Political Organ. At present the United States is the only considerable country which has established itself on a moral concept. Since that is the only function of the political branch of a community the destiny of this concept is that it willbecome recognized as the basis for migration. People's allegiance will tend to take them to the terrestrial region where the moral standard as expressed in the Political Organ conforms with their own. No other [Note: ==== Beginning of page 410 (table of contents) ====] INTERIOR OF THEATRE . MELBOURNE [Note: The structure is the Ascot Theatre.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 411 ====] definition of patriotism has a leg to stand on. Nowhere except in America can one give an intelligible definition of what is called nationality, elsewhere they are tying the word up with matters which have no national significance. The boundaries of neither the economic nor the cultural organization need to conform to the national boundaries. When we look deeply into this matter we find that the United States is the community that has graduated from the dominion of the Folk Soul. To place herself under such a domination would be the greatest catastrophe. The next evolutionary step is to recognize humanity as your people, to become conscious of humanity as an entity and no longer be concerned with your well being or the well being of your Page 629 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoparticular district but only with the wholesome development of humanity which must, because of the nature of man as a distinct kingdom, be so constituted as to make possible the free development of the abilities of individuals, for each man constitutes a species, and must so function as to be able to adjusthimself to the increasing diversity consequent. The communities who take this line will be carrying on evolution, the others will be retarding or dropping out of the stream of evolution. All the major groups of Europe are now concerned with the question of power. Each is hell-bent on making its prince the prince of the world. The Parliamentary form of government is the cleverest instrument ever yet devised to bring about that catastrophe. It is not America's function to back any such pretensions. Americans as a whole are people who have escaped from Europe. The chief escape has been from a fixed idea. At the present moment the whole trend of the so-called conservative element in American activities is the reestablishment in America of the European system. There is hardly a one who has not supported the movement for Civil Service reform. The results of a perfected Civil Service are showing themselves now [Note: ==== Beginning of page 412 (table of contents) ====] DAVID PRATTEN SENIOR . DWELLING PERSPECTIVE & GROUNDS ERIC M. NICHOLLS . ARCHITECT [Note: ==== Beginning of page 413 ====] in Europe. The alternative to such a system is a threefold organization which limits the use of power to the maintenance of equity and does not require an extensive officialdom. This means that it would not be difficult for the business executives and the industrialists to adjust their minds to the advantage of having the use of capital, not the hoarding of it, all they need for their economic adventures without the handicap to themselves, their children and the community of the ownership of capital. The only point in fighting for private ownership is to prevent State ownershipwhich means dictatorship. With this prevented by the barring out of the Political organ from any participation at all in economic affairs, the whole advantage of a system based on the right of individuals to use capital to whatever extent it is necessary for maximum efficiency becomes apparent. Americans owe a debt to [Note: Thomas] Jefferson. They cannot pay it by praising or quoting him, but only by seeing to it that his life was not futile, that he did not lay the foundation of a healthy communityin vain. Living things die if they remain fixed in form. This country must take the next evolutionary step. The genius of the people of the United States for organization was shown in the response made to President [Note: Franklin?] Roosevelt's recognition of the propriety of the Economic realms' solving their own problems when he called for codes. Unfortunately neither he nor the business men understood the basic significance so the movement was not taken advantage of to carry to completion the buildingup of an Economic Organization, this and a reactionary Court.

It is the Christian foundation stone of the Economic organization. The basic principle of our present form of economics rests on mutual advantage to buyer and seller in its transactions. We must learn that the loftiest motives if put to work in the wrong place or in the wrong way have no virtue, may even be disastrous in their effects. Only through correct concepts in time and space can wesolve problems. We see our people bewildered in many problems; railroading for instance where it is now apparent that unification is necessary if the railroads are to survive and yet the Political organ has passed Anti-trust laws to prevent unification. Unless we clear up our thinking it will almost certainly end in government ownership though it is still apparent to most that such cannot be efficient. Witness the railroads inAustralia. Such undertakings require men of business capacity and experience. If we could but recognize that the government's job is to maintain equity and if the easy way, the lazy way of taking over the business was out of court entirely, these railroad concerns could come together as a business association, employer, laborer, patron. Just as the traffic policeman does not have to work out the problems of motor car construction and sale, nor of trucks, nor does he have to equalize speed and power of the various types of transportation in order to maintain equity but has only to stand and see to it that all forms of transportation, whatever their Page 631 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagopower, vehicular or pedestrian, have equal opportunity to cross the streets, even if one of them be a cripple and so exceptionally slow. So with its task understood government could maintain equity without undertaking or managing business. The railroad group would form one Economic Association, the motor [Note: The illustrations listed as being on page 416 in the table of contents: SALTER DWELLING . MALVERN . . PLAN .

Mr. and Mrs. talked over their requirements, gave us the location of their lot in the outlying districts of Melbourne and told us to go ahead. Griffin solved the problem and I made the sketches. It was a rude shock to them both. Mr. Salter brought us the sad news telling us his wife said those Griffins were mad.Griffin chatted with him and he went home not quite so huffed. After a week or two he was back again saying they had gone over the plans again and again and always, to their surprise, found that in every detail it met their requirements perfectly. They found that the knitlock construction had enabled them to have bigger rooms and the court thrown in for nothing since its 2 1/4 inch walls required so much less area for construction and - mad or not - we were to proceed with the construction. They realized too that the elimination of all trim to openings, interior or exterior, was not only a saving but an advantage for durability. A light wash of pigment, wax and turpentine would give them all the interior finish needed and they could do it themselves if they wanted to. Inexpensive as it was it would hold its own in Melbourne's swank suburb, Malvern. The court enabled all the rooms to have at least two external walls and so windows and would of itself create a draft that would keep the house cool onhot days.

Then there would be another association, that of transportation as a whole and so on through the whole economic realm. This will be enough of a task for One Organization without its undertaking the handling of moral problems as well. Mutuality is its task, morality is the task of the Political institution. When the latter has no favors to grant it will notbe open to bribery. Its concern would be equity in the realms of nature and of labor as the value of neither of these is measurable. The foresight too of the framers of the constitution in writing into it that there shall be free trade between the states is proving of no avail. Just as between Australia and New Zealand potatoes are kept out on the pretense of blight but really because of the protective tariff obsession, so in the States are the barriersbeing built up in ways the National government can't deal with. We shall have warring little states as in Europe. It cannot be prevented by the Political Organ. It requires a National Economic Organization to deal with such problems. With these practical problems correctly solved our present civilizations will be able to express themselves in beauty as did all the ancient civilizations before man was individualized and given theindividualized Ego and Free Will.

So in the decoration of this building the motifs of the decoration are not conventionalized physical forms but are rich expressions of the basicforces back of all nature. This was Griffin's last work in Australia. In this he established firmly the interlocking of Town Planning and Architecture. One could not ask for a more telling monument to his work in this ancient continent. In the basic arts of architecture (in its broadest sense) and music (which is now making one with speech and motion) Australia is now ready to lead the world. The 4 formative forces which have already manifested in nature express themselves in 4 basic forms or movements, the circular, triangular, wave and rectangular. Through these non-material forces all forms (matter) have been brought into the fixed forms called matter. These are the motifs of the decoration of this building. Within this building, a powerful expression of substantiality, matter reverses its steps moving from solid to liquid, to light to heat, and disappears. It would be absurd to say that somethinghas been destroyed (other than form or appearance). That which had manifested is at the moment not manifesting as is the case with latent heat when water [Note: \"becomes steam\" crossed out] passes from steam to latent heat. So here we find architecture expressing these spiritual facts not through the feelings, as in the past, but by emotion controlled and directed by the trained intellect which, through discipline, can move on toconscious imagination and inspiration. After Griffin's death I saw a photograph of light. I don't know how it was made but it proved that light manifested in triangles. It was an exquisite and incredibly elaborate pattern of triangles and one could see in it how and in what manner light would progress and not necessarily in a [Note: ==== Beginning of page 423 (table of contents) ====] PYRMONT INCINERATOR . VIEW FROM STREET 40 FEET BELOW [Note: ==== Beginning of page 424 ====]CAPTION The Sydney Incinerator erected on the high rock promontory of Pyrmont will stand, we think, as an historical record of 20th century architecture. It is as beautiful, as majestic, as unique as any of thehistorical records of the past. Historically it records the basic fact of the 19th century civilization later emphasized by the smashing of the atom. The ornament is the record of what remains when matter is destroyed - warmth which manifests in the material world, in the spherical form - the only form of matter when the solar system came into material existence, the Saturn period; the triangle when the gaseous condition came in the Sun period (see photograph of the sun's rays); the crescent or wave form of the Moon period when there was the liquid Page 634 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocondition of matter; and the rectangle , the controlling form of the solid condition as seen in the human being's blood crystals. When the atom was smashed there remained only warmth, light, sound and magnetism. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 425 ====] [Note: Continued from page 422] straight line. This detail of Griffin's suggests the richness of these a elemental forces. The warmth ether manifests in spheres. We glimpse here the origin of the solar system - nothing but the warmth condition of matter - the manifestation of the warmth force. This is the basic factor in incineration which takes all the refuse of the great city and reduces it to elements. Because of thismethod an incinerator can be placed anywhere, in a park or wherever a monumental building will emphasize a beautiful landscape. It can be right in the center of things for there is no unpleasantness in the process. Municipality after municipality realized this and adopted the method. The cost of the building was always included in the bid. Griffin was the architect of the company so every municipality had to accept the architect with the method, and the company so invariably won that the othercompetitors gave up bidding. The light given off is represented by the triangular motif, very charming as used here but by no means as elaborate as light photographed. This is the creator of the gaseous condition of matter. The sound or chemical ether creates the crescent, the wave form. It is the force that brings liquidity into existence. We catch the connection of liquidity to sound in the wave movement which sound sets up and in the greatincrease of sounds in liquids. The wave form we see in the restless seas. The fire and liquid motifs are combined in the pattern of the outermost panel. The life ether manifests in rectangles and we see the square and the rectangle are the base of the third panel. This is the form of the human blood crystals and also of the solid earth though erosion has rubbed off the corners of the primeval form. The whole building is ornament yet in this decadent period when the ideal of the whole community is cheapness Griffin did what he had said once long ago - the only time in his life he ever made such a [Note: ==== Beginning of page [426] (table of contents) ====] PYRMONT INCINERATOR . DUMPING FACADE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 427 ====]remark - \"I'll jam it down their throats.\" For here as in all his work he proved that the beautiful was less Page 635 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoexpensive than the ugly thing. In a time when people feared beauty, were suspicious of it, made a virtue of the lack of beauty he still gave it to them on their terms. The contractors themselves said this building was cheaper than if it had been built of brick in the usual way. The secret lay in the larger units, thesaving in the erection. The scientists of today do not understand what they have done in their so called breaking down of the atom, though the answer is clear before their eyes in the process that takes place. They never find the atom for there is no such thing but they witness matter moving from solidity to illumination (light), to heat with tremendous violence. In other words they transform matter into forces, a natural thing since allmatter is created by forces, by Beings who use forces to bring things into manifestation. The so-called atom has no matter in it, only forces - magnetism, sound, light and warmth. So the Greek knowledge has in the 20th century been proved correct. The forces are not vibrations of matter, but are the predecessors, the creators of matter. They were right in feeling that forces are credible but that matter is incomprehensible. The 4 which we experience today are warmth, light, sound and life.When we Westerners realize this which we have proved, the West and the East will have met. The created world will grasp the reality of the creating world and the creating world will acknowledge the created world. That is our task today and the health of the world is dependent on the understanding of this duality. This was Griffin's message in architecture to the West as he went to the East to carry his message to them leading them beyond the Greek concept which was being imposed by Britain, and breaking down other barriers. No other language speaks so clearly and truly as architecture. Its history of humanity is no \"fable convenu.\" [Note: ==== Beginning of page 428 (table of contents) ====] No. 23.

Then came the momentous decision to have the Anthroposophic Festivals, to awaken a greater consciousness of the significance of the seasons, at Castlecrag. Miss Mitchell, the General Secretary [Note: of the Anthroposophical Society] of Australia, approved. Lute Drummond, later to succeed Miss Mitchell, had translated into lovely rhythmic prose the Mystery of Eleusis by Edouard Schure. The Senor [Note: Walter Burley Griffin] had set aside the Haven Valley for an open-air theatre and Mrs.Griffin was aflame to produce a play in the valley. The Castlecrag Dais [Note: the Castlecrag dramatic club] had done creditable work for some years and had given one of Yeats' Cuchulain series - The Only Jealousy of Emir [Note: Emer] - among whose characters were Spirits of the Moon - in the metropolis of Sydney. In her introduction she had, through Anthroposophic information, been able to relate the play to the realities of the moon realm and received the compliment that her introduction was asdelightful as the play. But though it had been talked about, it had never been produced in the Valley. So the valley was astir for weeks with Castlecrag \"Bees,\" Griffin working like a navvy [Note: i.e., a construction laborer] along with the others, to his great delight, for if he had not been destined for architectural realms his choice of occupation would certainly have been digging ditches and breaking stones. A stretch of the west side of the valley was terraced and faced with great stones to form seats forthe audience; the other side and the head of the valley, a hundred feet above and down a hundred feet and more to the harbor, was the stage the loveliest ever seen. There were coastal Angophoras great and small with their ever-changing colored bark, one of the eight pillars of heaven in the Australian Natives' lovely lore and a magical succession of blossoming trees, shrubs [Note: ==== Beginning of page 431 ====] and climbers through the year. No man-made imitation of indoor theatre here but every fairy creation carefully, religiously safeguarded; wattles, different kinds, so golden blossoms for each month in the year. There was the Christmas bush, its blossoms acrescent, starting tiny white, growing and glowing through pink to rich red; and yellow gonpholobium, blue hardenbergia, red waratah andlily-of-the-valley trees holding their vivid blue berries for the rest of the year; a greater variety of blossoms here in the Middle Harbor district, the botanists tell us, than in any other spot in the world - Page 637 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoAustralia the world's most ancient continent.

The path forks to the west down to the Prometheus rock where that mighty Being poured out his defiance of the Gods and his message to man giving him the gift of anger, the fire through which he could learn to re-enter the realms of spirit; and to the north around to the head of the valley where in this first play we gave were laid the main scenes of the Mystery of Eleusis:- At the foot of a high stone wall was laid the royal scene of the Queen-mother of Triptolemus, the great initiate who, coming from hisfields, refused his mother's demand that he should go to the Agora and claim his dead father's throne but who listened instead to Demeter's [Note: ==== Beginning of page 432 (table of contents) ====] ANGOPHORA LANCEOLATA LOSES ITS BARK EACH SPRING [Note: ==== Beginning of page 433 ====] ANGOPHORA LANCEOLATA In Australia everything is evergreen, broad as well as narrow leaves, and all sorts of shapes. Instead of losing their leaves seasonally many lose their bark every year. This is especially conspicuous in the angophora. Each year the outer bark peels off completely leaving a pinkish cream, flesh colored bark smooth as satin. This gradually passes through several colors, a rosy silver grey becoming streaked withdeep pink and gradually turning to a vivid crimson. This then splits and drops off at first exposing bits of soft flesh tone and then drops off entirely. The tree is a constant excitement the whole year through. Its masses of white clustered blossoms come according to the mood of the individual tree almost any time during the transition of one of Australia's seasons to the other for Australia has but two seasons. There are no native weeds in Australia, a perfectly balanced flora, but from month to month the fairiesrecarpet their domiciles with ever-changing colors and designs.

The demons low in the valley have gathered about Pluto standing by the thrones, one of which Persephone has left to follow Hecate and Triptolemus up to the Higher realms, and the hermits in their wide-flowing lilac robes gather in lovely movement and form at the foot of the great wall, imploring. The valley becomes engulfed in darkness as Triptolemus brings Persephone before the throne of Zeus and, in aconcentration of light, Dionysus appears from among the gleaming goddesses - the new god who succeeds Zeus - that prevision of the ancient mysteries of the coming of the Christ. Such times we had at those first rehearsals, for all were very earnest! Our Zeus kept calling across from the audience banks that they couldn't be heard, I telling them that they were not to strain their voices, that they would be heard all right. Finally I asked him who was producing that play anyway, he or I. Hegranted that I was, so I said then I was the one to do the worrying. On the evening of the play you could hear the softest sound. The valley was a perfect megaphone and our Anthroposophic knowledge - that sound is a function of the darkness as color is of light - was proved. As I sat with my prompter's book as the play began, a drop of rain fell on my page. I wondered whether Ahriman [Note: an evil spirit in the ancient Middle East] or the fairies would win but we were guardingtheir haunts and they drove the clouds away. Later, on one or two occasions, they put our spirit to the test with a rainy evening but we took it well, knowing the many duties of the Undines, and they rewarded us during the years to come - over five now - by giving us perfect nights, with but one exception, for all our [Note: ==== Beginning of page 435 ====] plays in that most fickle climate of Sydney where the so-called dry season has just about as many rains as the wet and where the weather-man has no chance of being accurate in his prognostications. After the play was over we Anthroposophists fell on each other's necks, it was so unbelievably beautiful. And so it was the following seasons. At Christmas time always a nativity play. There was always a changing personnel, never a pretense of dramatic technique (though usually there were one or two of dramatic experience with us) but alwaysfrom the heart. The work was neither professional nor amateur. We achieved that truly wonderful thing, an unsophisticated drama. To our first Mary, with her perfection of beauty, when she first read her lines, I said - \"You can't read these lines from the head. They must be read from the heart. I know you haven't got a heart but you must lay aside your intellect. See what you can do.\" A few days later she rang me on the phone saying - \"I have a heart!\" \"Well show me,\" I replied. And show me she did. And so with allthe young folk. They sprang to the opportunity of expressing themselves spiritually, simply thrilled just to be in and a part of great spiritual work. The audience would sit the two hours long on their hard stones and no backs, breathless, enchanted. \"It doesn't seem real,\" you would hear. The Jerusalem women from below watched the Angel Gabriel float in his golden gown, lily in hand, above the wall to speak from a lonely boulder to Mary led in by angel children and praying at her Page 639 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoprie-dieu; the shepherds climbing the slopes from below and building their bonfire; the kings with the rich color of their robes making a striking tapestry against the lovely composition of shrub and lofty tree; then all gathering at the feet of Mary and Joseph, the whole hillside above gradually lighted up withthe angelic hosts, twenty, thirty, in groups of three here, five there, on up and up in their rainbow robes; and high over the hill-top the star of Bethlehem. One Christmas there were five groups of the Hierarchies on the upper hillside each with one [Note: ==== Beginning of page 436 ====] Archai holding a circle aloft, two Archangels with triangles back of the head and three Angels with wings. In each group an Angel set off a Roman candle. The topmost group was silhouetted against thesky, the star of Bethlehem above their heads. Gradually they moved down the hill taking formations as they came down till they all grouped on top of wall and down the double flight of steps seeming in the mysterious shadows of the valley to be indeed walking on air. The music - flute and violin - played by angels. The cherubs clustered around Mary, and the speech chorus, who had spoken first from the east valley crest and then from the top of the wall, now knelt in the lower valley below the Holy Family, theKings and the shepherd group, each with a candle lighted by the five boys, the acolytes who had previously set off the Roman candles for the Angel Gabriel. And then the chorals invisible. One friend of a friend, brought somewhat reluctantly to see Grimm's fairy tale, \"Die Kugel aus Kristal,\" [Note: \"Die Kristallkugel\"?] given in German, rang next day to say - \"One wouldn't have a chance to see a thing like that once in a hundred years.\" It was wonderful indeed the variety of effects one could get in this valley. Those who saw this fairy story felt they were living in fairyland itself. It wasn't a drama one was watching. It was a new experience in life. The old witch mother giving her incantations over the bonfire on the extreme western rocks and driving her disobedient sons away with curses when they brought her flowers instead of herbs; their wanderings and adventures across the valley and encounters with fairies dancing among theshrubs and gnomes from the gnarled roots of the great trunked tree, and the perfection of the illusion of the final battle of the youngest son with the fabulous bull in a rocky crevasse watched and screened by the circle of Egyptian mummies with their incantations. His victory in this last adventure marked his final conquest over himself, man over his lower nature, so that now he could see the vision of the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 437 ====] castle of the Sun whose daughter came out with her Sun-maidens to receive him. Griffin himself had directed and helped in the building of this really tiny structure which gave the impression of a great castle for the knitlock material, which needs no mortar however complicated the forms, was used and the structure placed just over the crest of the hill with a strategic bit of tower here and there so that onefelt there was in fact a great castle just over the hill. And so with one play after another. In Euripides's Iphigeneia, the temple of Diana illumined by a superb full moon, shining so brightly on the waters of the harbor below that it became a vital part of the scene, Page 640 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowhence Orestes came and found his sister. On the day that Iphigeneia was given my telephone bell rang and a man's voice inquired about the play to be given in the evening. I learned later that it was Dr. Kakatakus, the newly arrived GreekConsul-General. He had come to Australia with quite the European concept that it was the land of wild barbarians and was astounded to find in the hotel bulletin the notice of the production of one of his country's great plays. To direct anyone in Sydney is not easy and he evidently was a stranger so I suggested he take a taxi, but if he didn't want that expense to take a bus to our shops where there was a shopkeeper who would taxi him down to the theatre. He followed this latter suggestion telling the lad tohave the taxi wait at the door of the theatre. Of course there was no door, the theatre being the valley, so Joss brought him down around the valley road and presently heard the exclamation, \"My God!\" and as he went on, again, \"My God!\" The Consul was perhaps fearing for his life on this lonely way with precipice on either side. But a few moments and he was in the midst of the gathering and fell into the hands of Miss Lute Drummond, who is music personified and the founder of opera in Australia. Sinceshe was about to start around to give her always charming preliminary esoteric introduction to the play, she passed him on to Miss [Note: Ida] Lesson, Librarian of Australia's [Note: ==== Beginning of page 438 (table of contents) ====] ORESTES FINDS IPHIGENEIA IN THE TEMPLE OF TAURIS [Note: ==== Beginning of page 439 ====]Mitchell Historical Library, who was collecting the shilling entrance fees from those who gathered. His enthusiasm knew no bounds, thrilled to have found such appreciation of his own people and enraptured by the beauty of the production. For months after he introduced into all his speeches before any of the public functions he addressed vivid appreciation of this experience of his life. The Torian temple, more severe than even the Doric, on the terrace above the wall, was reached by a double flight of stairs from the terrace below, and Iphigeneia's attendant women, approaching from either side, mounted this stairway as she herself swung around the temple terrace to her sacrificial ceremonies. [Note: Edward] Burne-Jones' picture of the Blessed Damosels descending the stairs can give a hint of the loveliness of these movements. Orestes and his friends who had been tossed on these unknown shores were addressed as they approached the foot of these stairs by Iphigeneia above,surrounded by her priestesses. Here in this temple forecourt the enraged King of Tauris was appeased by the appearance in the temple forecourt of Diana herself, and the wonderful procession was formed to follow Iphigeneia carrying the sacred statue down the steps with maidens and soldiers following, wending their way across the valley and up the hillside, across the top terrace and down disappearing as they made their way to the water's edge. Surely it is in such ways as this that our young people shouldbecome familiar with the majestic literature of these earlier civilizations. We all became worshipers of Diana and the moon that night. Oedipus Colonus we gave there, the second of Sophocles's great trilogy, and Antigone too. Some day Page 641 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowe will give the whole trilogy in sequence starting with Oedipus Rex. In this second part of the trilogy, which we gave, is summarized the life of one who though innocent committed all human crimes, and expiated them - a superb role. When the time had come for the death of this grand old king, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 440 ====] Oedipus Colonus, the two angels came and led him and the young King Theseus around the foot of the precipitous rock, the messenger returning to tell from the top of the rock that no one except Theseus had been allowed to go on to see the way of his death - this new kind of death which opened the way to men's mind for a comprehension of the resurrection to be learned later through the Christ. At thismoment a brilliant falling star swept in a magnificent curve down over just this spot so that some of the audience even wondered how we had managed this effect. I had returned alone from India and felt that the Archangel Michael himself had lent the senor [Note: Walter Burley Griffin] one of his meteors so that he could do what he had so often reached [Note: reach?] over a draftsman's shoulder to do with that firm hand of his - sweep in a form just where and as required - so that he could give our work in theseplays in which he was so interested that final touch of perfection. Then came Antigone, the third of the trilogy, a really modern play, a play of today - with its lesson so important to our time - the individual's defiance of tyranny, of dictatorship, expressed in that greatest of women's roles - Antigone, the eternal feminine. The Sydney Herald commented:- \"The choruses took up their groupings among the bush and greenery with complete confidence. At times the effect of all the illuminated figures in eloquent poses was dream-like and almost incredible like that of a highly imaginative painting. One thought of Fra Angelico and his multitudes of angels. The acoustics of the dell were remarkably good. Every word carried clearly even from the most distant crag. Some of the distinctness, of course, was due to the excellence of the speaking. All the actors, and the chorus too, realised the large scale of utterance and gesture which sucha place and such a play demanded, a play with singular aptness to present-day Europe with its ideological struggle between democracies and dictators. Creon's sudden outbursts, when they came, were memorably intense; and their effect was redoubled by an eerie echo which the contour of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 441 ====] the terrain produced.\" A friend writes:- \"Just a line to thank you and all your people for the great joy and excellent performance of last night in that delightful setting. It was a great effort and certainly inspiring and very beautiful. Could there be any greater gifts to mankind than what you wonderful people are doing. We all bless you and yours.\" And the praise poured in. \"Better than the open air theatre in Regents Park, London,\" they said. I Page 642 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagolaughed and said, \"Oh, but we have the valley.\" But no, \"Better in every respect; diction, costume, grouping,\" and \"Better than Reinhart [Note: Max Reinhardt]\" from those who had seen the same plays given in Germany. But we didn't need this. We knew we were doing something unique, as the PassionPlay is unique. We knew that we were giving our young folks a chance to cross the boundaries, to express their own spiritual natures in great ensembles with their fellow beings. We saw what was their hunger for this in their thrill in taking even a tiny part in these great works:- \"Sakuntala,\" the Indian play, Goethe's \"The Green Snake and The Beautiful Lily,\" Everyman,\" the Medieval Miracle Play:- This last is perhaps the best known of the old church plays. It was surprising to all of us to find what a complete and perfect drama it is and how one could almost speak of it as the most popular play we gave though the continued strain of piety in it is very foreign to most of our people at present. We had a curious experience with the youth who took the part of Everyman. Greek-like himself in face and figure and quite a bit of dramatic experience and quite equal to the handling of the great role (he had done Orestes with us) but when we had but two or three more rehearsals ahead of us he came to us and saidwe'd better drop the play; he couldn't go on with the role - he couldn't learn it. Of course I said it would not be possible to drop the play; I'd find someone else to take the role. Such situations may always arise in nonprofessional work. I would have taken the role [Note: \"The Recognition of Sakuntala\" is a drama by Kalidasa, a Sanskrit poet of the fifth century AD.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 442 (table of contents) ====] A YOUNG GRASS TREE . AN AUSTRALIAN PHOTO [Note: ==== Beginning of page 443 ====]myself had there been no other way out as Lute Drummond did once when the leading lady in Mirrabooka was hit in the eye with a tennis ball on the day of a performance. But after leaving him a few days I suggested he come in and have a chat with me. He said he simply could not memorize thelines. I told him I quite understood, the reason was that this was an initiation play and he was out of sympathy with the Christian initiation but that it would be a great experience for him if he conquered this antipathy and that I would undertake to drill the part into him. So for the next two weeks he came to me every day and I rehearsed him line by line until we had broken down the inhibition. He gave a superb performance of, one of the richest and most varied of roles, in which Everyman depicts the whole rangeof every man's soul life. And there was the Australian Aboriginals' mythology, their Mirrabooka - The Southern Cross - set to poetry by Australia's young Shelley, Sylvia Brose - one of our actresses, herself a perfect Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Two of our young girls, Sylvia [Note: Brose] and Bette Ainsworth, under the inspiration of our work and our study and our encouragement had taken upon themselves a nine months' pains-takingstudy of the native lore of Australia which is truly very beautiful and which, illuminated by the knowledge which Anthroposophy gives, reveals itself as being full of deep significance grounded as it is in the same methods of thinking as of all those pre-Christian peoples who had direct experience in the Page 643 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosupersensible realms through imagination, inspiration and intuition, words which have lost their meaning during this materialistic age but which we are beginning to comprehend now at the close of that period which really ended with the smashing of the atom. They found the story of the origin of manchecking with the knowledge we obtain from other occult sources, including the Bible, but presented of course in their own unique way and very beautifully expressed in terms of nature. The girls brought these myths together [Note: ==== Beginning of page 444 ====] in most lovely form. The personification of native trees and flowers, the butterflies and bird and bat. And the desolation that came after the descent out of paradise, and though they, being pre-Christian, hadnot experienced the Christ event, the girls introduced the events of the nativity of the Christ in the form of a vision, after which all nature came to life again - the resurrection as expressed in this ancient mythology. The play stood on even terms with the other great works we produced. If we would but wake up to the reality of the causal realms! If we would but take the pains to open our etheric eyes and ears as Anthroposophy shows us how to do, so as to perceive in the causal realms;what wonderful opportunities we could give our young people. How we could then feed their hungry souls the starvation of which is leading them hither and yon, frantic, unsatisfied. Why are we so afraid to cross the boundary beyond which we can experience the causal realms with the same precise, checkable knowledge that has mastered the mineral kingdom during the past five hundred years? Only so can we master the three other kingdoms of vegetable, animal and man. Just out of their teens, stirred by the thoughts with which Anthroposophy surrounded them, taking part in the great dramas of past civilizations which through spiritual science they could understand, eager to reach deep into the significance of the lore of the ancient people of their own continent, these two girls studied with seeing eyes the Mythology of the Australians. Out of this was born the genius of a young Shelley. The play, Mirrabooka, was presented in the Haven Valley where long ago this ancient peoplehad dwelt and where one of the eight great supporting columns of Heaven, the Angophora, stood majestic, the dwelling of Yaraan. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 445 (table of contents) ====] PLAYS GIVEN IN THE HAVEN VALLEY [Note: The caption to the New-York Historical Society illustration adds the word \"Theatre\" to the above title. The list is transcribed below.] The setting aside of the spectacularly lovely valley in Castlecrag as an Open Air Theatre -- The haven Scenic Theatre -- made possible the presentation, under Mrs. Griffin as producer for the Anthroposophic Society, of many of the world's magnificent dramatic works, productions which stoodon a par with the great presentations elsewhere.

But Persephone, with her sun-light nature, can be rescued from the dark realm of the passions only by the God in Man -Dionysus. He, who has been torn to bits, experiences life through all Mankind. He is Hades, the darkness that waits for the light and can therefore receive it. Man can be raised from Hades to the Empirian [Note: empyrean] Heights only by the Divine in himself. Persephone, in calling for him, brings this to his consciousness and she gives to him the clairvoyance by which, united with her, he can find his way back to Olympia.

Also Had A Valley Reserved For An Open Air Theatre.\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 448 ====] THE ABORIGINALS One of the earliest private works of Griffin in Australia was the layout of the City of Port Stephens which will ultimately become the New-York of Australia. It was surveyed, plotted and all the lots sold and there it rests. England does not want it to come into being but wants to hold this superb port in the control of the British navy. Beautiful Australia, pathetic Australia. Almost without exception probablythe American who goes to Australia goes with the conviction that it is a democracy, perhaps even more of a democracy than the United States, but it takes but a very short time to find how far this is from the truth, and a long stay invariably fills one with dismay at the hollowness of this outward pretension. These conditions are not the result of war but were entirely fixed and apparent before the war. Instead of finding oneself further west after the trip across the Pacific one finds oneself in an atmosphere more European than Europe, nowhere a feeling of equality between man and man but the most amazing class feeling. We learn that in America no one knows what the word class means as understood in Europe and Australia, and in the latter country a bitterness of feeling difficult to comprehend. One rarely hears a conversation that does not express class animosity. One searches for causes underlying and touches on such revered customs as that of granting titles, an acknowledgementthat they believe it is right for certain subjects to consider themselves superior to others and the root of this disease forthwith poisons the whole community. We stand amazed at the consequence of things we Page 646 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoare in the habit of considering lightly but we no longer laugh at those forefathers of ours who destroyed this germ in the growing country of the United States. Economically we understood of course how the wealth of the people of this beautiful continent is poured into the coffers of the British \"back home.\" The early monopoly of the land made that simple. Whatever one undertakes he soon becomes aware that England is running Australia [Note: ==== Beginning of page 449 (table of contents) ====] A YOUNG CALLITRIS COLUMULARIS [Note: The structure is the Grant House.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 450 ====] and makes sure that the profits of all undertakings flow to England. It is a vassal state existing for no other purpose than the aggrandizement of the men \"back home.\" Australia has a navy you think but though built by Australians' money the moment it is launched it becomes English and is no longer under the control of Australia. A man who has civil rights under the laws of Australia as long as he keeps hisfoot on land but the minute he is on the water he is no longer under the Australian law but under the English law. And now that the war is on though Australia has refused conscription he can under those circumstances be conscripted. Australia decides to build a Parliament House but English architects want the job so the international competition for it is stopped. The requirement for this came directly from England. A tenant wished to remodel a building and must wait months for permission and approval ofdrawings by the owner in London. The statistical statement of the wealth of Australians shows practically no rich men and but a few well-to-do men. Australia's wealth is drained into English pockets. If we are to deal with first things first, in Australia we must consider the aboriginals - their civilization - and we have it pictured in the play written by two young Australians girls still in their teens, Sylvia [Note: Brose] and Bette [Note: Ainsworth] depicting the mythology of the first settlers of Australia whomigrated from Paradise to the Earth. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 451 (table of contents) ====] WITH PROTECTION THE UPPER LEVELS SOON GO NATIVE [Note: The structure is the Grant House.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 452 ====] What absurdities we Westerners are taught. In schools we have been told that the Australian aboriginal is the lowest type of human being with so little intelligence that he can count only to three. But human Page 647 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobeings cannot be so segregated. The Australian natives are the Paradise people. Man's history up to the present time has been a descent into matter. We have become almost mechanical. It is up to us now to start the ascent into the spiritual. During our first year in Australia we learned of Mr. David, a full blooded aboriginal, who had just completed his university course in higher mathematics and received his degree in the University of Sydney. A jolt like this breaks down the whole structure of one's prejudices. It prepared us for realizing the fact that no longer are there real distinct races though certain physical characteristics remain temporarily in groups, for the physical body is to a certain extent still dominated by heredity. With thecoming of the Christ races ceased to exist for the Christ gave that \"light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world\" to all men and this light, which is the Ego, makes all men equal in that it wipes out all limitations to their powers to develop their individual selves. Our conclusions were shortly to be confirmed by Miss [Note: Zonia] Baber, a professor of Pedagogy and Geography in the University of Chicago, who had been traveling the world over at various times.She visited us this same year of our arrival having now completed her circuit by a visit to New Zealand and Australia. She told us she had always asked the teachers she encountered whether they had ever been able to distinguish any difference of mental capacity in their pupils which they could attribute to difference of race, and the universal answer had been in the negative. This was again confirmed in \"The Biography of a Beechcomber\" [Note: E.J. Banfield's \"Confessions of a Beachcomber\"?] where the author described his experiences in the education of his children along with that of a little adopted aboriginal girl while he was living [Note: ==== Beginning of page 453 ====] on one of the islands of the Great Barrier Reef. It was Susie who was quickest to learn and who helped his own children with their lessons. It was strange to find what seemed to me a lack of capacity for a white person to understand someone of another race when he later in the book told how Susie had goneback to her people as if she had sort of reverted to the aboriginal when it seemed to me so apparent that she had slipped away from her adopted parents out of thoughtfulness for them because they had been obliged to barricade their home and maintain almost military defenses against the determination of Susie's people to get her back to marry her to an old man to whom the tribe had allotted her. It seemed to me that Susie deliberately gave herself up to them to put an end to this trying situation for the family ofher beloved friends. The barbaric treatment of the aboriginals by the Europeans has by no means come to an end though there is not the same bravado as in the early days when European property owners at times, dwelling on opposite sides of a stream, made a sport of shooting the black folk as they swam to the shore on one side and then, when they swan back in desperation to the other side, shooting them again as theyapproached the opposite shore, back and forth, back and forth - \"great sport\" like Kipling's in Africa. The whites have continually taken possession of more and more of the land after having dedicated it to the aboriginals always driving the natives out if in the barren districts to which they have been allocated they happen to find a mode of livelihood, as by discovering good oyster beds. Then again the whites Page 648 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagotake possession and drive them further on in consequence of which naturally it is bound to happen that in the need for food the aboriginal occasionally steals from the neighboring whites. The method generally used under these circumstances is that the white people put out where it can be found flourwith poison in it. The natives finding this and taking it die. This is still done though in some groups the natives have come to realize that it is not [Note: ==== Beginning of page 454 (table of contents) ====] THE BATHS CASTLECRAG PROMONTORIES [Note: ==== Beginning of page 455 ====] safe to eat white man's food. At one time I spent a fortnight in Tasmania with three other artists on a sketching outing. One was a poet and I found that she was well versed in aboriginal lore. I checked with her a story Mark Twain told, already confirmed by a Melbourne Doctor, that the aboriginal problem had been disposed of inTasmania by sterilizing them. This story was of how a warlike group was approached by a kind hearted man, and courageous - Mr. [Note: George Augustus?] Robinson, who won them to confidence in white folks and brought them down from the hills to enter into a treaty on a promise Governor [Note: George?] Arthur had made to him. They were greeted by pomp and ceremony by the Governor and people and amicable arrangements were entered into. This friend so far confirmed Mark Twain's story[Note: in \"Following the Equator\"?]. So I asked her what happened afterward - what became of the aboriginals. She said - \"Oh, they petered out.\" We had been discussing the question of the superiority of one race over another and she had been very positive in her feeling for the superiority of the whites, I arguing for the dark-skinned people. So I asked her if the aboriginals had been sterilized to which she answered. \"Yes.\" Then I said, \"Do you think that is evidence of the superiority of the white folks,\" Shesaid - \"Oh yes; the blacks would have done the same if they had been smart enough to think of it first.\" We did not continue the discussion. One morning in Castlecrag a man and his son came to my door enthusiastic over having found a cave on the estate with important records of the aboriginals. He said he had heard we were giving Greek plays on the other side of the valley and thought it would be interesting to have in the publication he was aboutready to get out a photograph of the Gods as we were depicting them in that same valley, the home of the aboriginals. We had one of Diana appearing before the temple to persuade the King to let Iphigeneia and Orestes return to Greece, which I gave him. He was very enthusiastic over the records he had found showing the mathematical understanding of these people. He said, \"They tell us that [Note: ==== Beginning of page 456 (table of contents) ====] Page 649 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 The Art Institute of ChicagoTHE MYSTERY OF ELEUSIS [Note: An inscription on the verso of the illustration indicates the photograph was taken at the \"Michaelmas Festival\" (i.e., late September?) in 1934. The structure is the Haven Valley ScenicTheatre.] THE VALLEY'S EASTERN TERRACE . MOUNTING HIGH TO THE NORTH DROPPING LOW TO THE SOUTH [Note: ==== Beginning of page 457 ====] the Greeks invented this, but I have found evidence that they got it from the Australian natives; and that the Egyptians were the first to comprehend this other thing, but they got it from the Australianaboriginals. I knew that he was more correct than the others but that all these early peoples got such knowledge from the same source, not from each other - from inspirational or intuitive thinking, direct from spiritual sources. Quite recently those who are investigating sympathetically - that is without preconceived conclusions - are finding continued confirmation of the native Australians' power to do many things quite beyond the reach of our modern civilization which more and more limits itsperception to material things letting other perceptive organs atrophy. There are things that we would do well to investigate without prejudice and things that we should learn how to do. I am not a student of the aboriginals nor is this the place to go into details on the subject, but it is well authenticated that when groups of natives find life under the present circumstances unendurable their leader will announce that on a certain day the tribe will die and on that day they die not through physical means; and that whengroups of white adventurers are in perilous situations, when supplies are gone, the black guide may tell them that help is coming, in two days it will be there - in two days the help has come. A little less arrogance, a little less cruelty, might make it clear that there is no such thing as racial superiority today and that apparent differences arise not from difference of faculty but from difference of circumstance and that advantage to all will derive from a social system which will see to it that all menhave the opportunity to develop their individual abilities.

Its clusters of needles are lacelike against the sky, and in the forest are like a mist floating about among the other trees. They are almost black-barked, grow along the coast and some species grow right in the salt water. In this they are like the mangroves which are common in Sydney Harbor. FICUS. - My first rage in Australia was the destruction of an avenue of Ficus Macrofolia. Port Phillip of Melbourne has its characteristic Fig Trees as has Queensland and so has Port Jackson of Sydney, both huge and grand trees and more shrubby types. Such a contrast these make with the casuarina. In Australia the shrubs and trees just tell you they can do anything. They can even live through long droughts without turning a hair so to speak. In perfect condition they just stop growing and then whenthe rain comes, a year, two years, they rush their growth at top speed. This I think is because of their oils. The fig is a sort of rubber plant and it pours its roots fantastically over the rocks till the gnomes make some entry open in the rocks for then to enter. The gnomes don't bother with them till all the other plants have been attended to. The fig foliage is a solid mass. It lets no atmospheric moisture pass it by butmakes use of it all. That is where the Undines are at work. In the waterfalls is where they play.

The West slope of the valley - the audience seated on terraces faced with the local stone, no backs, the audience sitting through two hours unconscious of that fact, entranced by the plays. Sometimes a shooting star in the Eastern sky timed, it seemed, to fit some dramatic point. The rest of the valley is the stage, trees and bush and blossoms and rocks to meet any dramatic requirement. To the North a steep rock wall with a long terrace - a road in fact above the eye running East and West. Above it terrace on terrace of spectacular rocks and shrubbery and grand trees. To the East a flat terrace above the eye so scenes can appear and disappear across it, mysterious or spectacular. Then the little stream flowing down to the sea, its head and its further bank offering a rich range ofsettings - terraces, huge boulders, exquisite varied shrubbery - dainty Lily of the Valley trees and majestic Angophoras and so on. It fitted the aboriginal lore perfectly, completely.

We know now that the nervous system is a musical instrument and that through music Apollo taught the European peoples to think, not just to remember as ancient peoples did but to think, to rationalize.

LOOKING NORTH [Note: The structure is the Haven Valley Scenic Theatre at Castlecrag.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 462 ====] And now we know that clairvoyance was natural to pre-Christian peoples. Humanity had to lose that faculty temporarily in order to be able to reason - to think, and to function with free will. That accomplished we must, through our wills, learn again to perceive in the realms of forces, in the realm of spiritual beings. As Europeans have discovered, the aboriginals in Australia still have this faculty. Chorus of the Flowers - \"No earthly senses veil our sight,We see the forms that weave in light.\" The actors were all in imaginative characterizations of nature, flowers and birds, butterflies and flowing waters. From the heights the Flowers bring the Sleeper - man's spiritual other half - for like all primitives the Australians knew of the creation of Adam - a history of which only now the study of language is proving the truth - a common origin of all humanity. Chorus of the Flowers - \"until In thine own spirit shall forever shine The true Sun's mighty ray.\" The Christ Spirit which dwells in man as the Holy Ghost, the Ego.No one who saw the play, written and produced by two young students of Aboriginal mythology - Sylvia [Note: Brose] and Bette [Note: Ainsworth], - could ever belittle the civilization of those most ancient people of the world. They are the immediate descendants of the dwellers in Paradise (which the continent Australia still is) - the Paradise before Adam and Eve left it to come down into materialization, into Atlantis whence people spread to all parts of the world as is now proved by the students oflanguages who find the common roots in all languages instead of in just the so-called Aryan ones. These people recognized the truths back of the Southern Cross - Mirrabooka - the fall of man into the fourness [Note: i.e., four-ness] of materialization, into the North and South, the East and West, which is expressed so beautifully in the Stupa temples of the Hindus - the great dome with Page 652 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 463 (table of contents) ====] HAVEN VALLEY .

The great Angophora tree whose bark turns from flesh pink each Spring to blood in the closing year - a yearly sequence - stands on the middle terrace of the Valley Theatre. In its heart dwelt Yaraan - the Living Tongue The Sleeper lies on the great roots of the rough barked tree on the top of the East terrace.The illusive scene illuminated by the shimmering concealed flares opens with the dancing steps of Streamlet while Telopea, Queen of the Flowers, comes with her chorus of Australia's wonderful Flowers bringing in the Sleeping Spirit of Man, the Holy Ghost awakened only when Man has traversed the vale and turned back to his origins longing now for something beyond the material. The Bird alights on a great rock to tell Telopea that Man approaches following the Streamlet as she flows down the valley, and Nerida whose guiding star is Love tells Telopea that in her pool she had dreamed of the coming of Man, and that he knows not the Sleeper, yet her form fills all his thoughts. Nerida found in her pool a crystal that she will give to him. Streamlet flows on and Man following her streambed awakens to the fairy loveliness of the valley. He calls to Streamlet to pause a bit that he may know this sanctuary, the Temple of Nature. She tells him of her adventures toward the Sun as Mist and her return as Dew. Then the Bird comes to him and tells him he must appeal to Yaraan - the heart of the Tree - who alone can inform him as to the secrets of the Valley.

NORTH [Note: ==== Beginning of page 466 ====] Yaraan in his trailing henna robes, the color of the Angophora tree, appears at the foot of the great Angophora tree as the Chorus of Flowers warns him of Goonear and Bigaroo - good and evil - between whom he must choose and Nerida gives her crystal to him as guide in the regions below. Then enchantment catches your breath as from here and there among the flowering shrubs the Butterflies appear - children from 5 to 7 years old and perfect actors as they flit from flower to flower and chant their messages of light glowing in their wings. But they shrink and fold their wings about the Sleeper when the Bat approaches from the further side of the Valley and lights on a great isolated rock below the terraces of the Flowers. He scorns their hope that Man will lead them to a higher life and soon brings them word from down below that Man has lost the crystal and is creeping back a pitiable thing. All Nature's creatures are stunned by this word but as Man stumbles backTelopea calls to the Butterflies, the Beings of Light to guide him and they lead him to the foot of Telopea's rock whence she pleads with him, who alone has the power of will, to exert himself. As he fails the Butterflies pass with dropped wings to their bower and Yaraan again appears to plead - \"Is this indeed the end? Now when space and time are one must we sink into nothingness? Is there no power to flood the Cross of Death with radiant Life?\" and the Bat answers - \"Earth hath not found it! Now comes sickness, desolation, death.\" And blackness shuts out the scene. Here the authors Sylvia [Note: Brose] and Bette [Note: Ainsworth], introduce the news of the Christ event. On the long terrace to the North the Angel Gabriel appears and on the wooded heights above, the Page 654 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoAngels sing - [Note: ==== Beginning of page 467 ====] \"He comes to fill Earth's heart With His divinest Love.\" With the passing of this vision the Valley awakes - The Butterflies chant - \"Thou poor Bat now is thy little season ended.\" The whole Valley is awake, the crystal is found, Man's Sleeping Spirit is awakened, the threefold crystal of Thinking, Feeling and Will shines from her brow. So does the Valley Theatre bring understanding between these ancient peoples and the peoples of today.

Enter Willy Wagtail Telopea, I bring you news of Man Who soon must pass this temple. His mind, Waking from its dream-like sleep, leads him on To seek a Bullimah on earth. Therefore, In your ancient duties pause to help him Who follows his appointed path. Telopea Since it is you who speak, I listen, O favored of the Gods, and also In the air, there is a hush of waiting; In leaves of trees the voice of Heaven speaksOf things to come. Yet tell us more of Man. Whence comes he? What forces gave him birth? Chorus A. and B. - Born of the earth and the air and the water, Page 658 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoOut of the Flame and the Thunder he came, Formless he was till a mighty Designer, Created a Word that has molded his frame. Willy Wagtail - There was a time when darkness brooded Over space and cold and Earth, But in the stillness slept the lovely one, Goddess of light and life. The SpiritWakened her and at her breath the still air [Note: ==== Beginning of page 472 ====] Moved in harmony. She rode upon the wind, The light her chariot, and all creation Evolved upon the Earth. And yet Mankind Unmanifest remained. Then through the worldWas the concept of an order new, Belonging to the old and yet by it Not bounded, aspiring beyond its confines. Then in the storms that swept the land with fury Was born a formless being; I firstBeheld the brightness. I felt his presence And through me he spoke to those that knew him not. Chorus A. and B. - Three pillars of smoke were there by day That ringed round the watching hill,And swift transforming to a watery cup, From the sky received the thunderous bolt That drew in its wake the flame of fire Enfolding within it the form of Man. Nerida - But O Telopea, when heavy and chill The waters of Wahwee's pool upon me lay And night gloomed darkly, a wandering ray Of moonlight slid softly down the still Green depths to solace me, and whispered thusOf the age-old heavenly birth of man: \"Long ago, O little loving Nerida, When the morning star dwelt in bright beauty Here upon the Earth, the Lady Moon Down glided dream-like, on her own soft lightTo wed him. From this noble union sprang Page 659 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe race of man.\" O Messenger 'twixt world and world, Was this not truth I heard? [Note: ==== Beginning of page 473 ====] Willy Wagtail - Yes very truth, but know you not that truth Has many faces? Man himself is manifold. Chorus A. - The children of these two now shine As stars. And thus high is the aimOf their descendant Man, who now Must find the source from which he came. Enter Streamlet Chorus B. - O little Streamlet whose clear voice we love, Hast seen the Wanderer on the hills above? Fleet thy flow past rock and glistering wood And swift must be the one whom thou dost lead. Streamlet - Swift indeed is he who follows me - A Pilgrim to the Perfect Land. For I, Who love my path that lies along this vale Where sunlight makes my clustered bubbles Glance and froth in happy laughter, I sang Sweet music, that told of shadowed pools,Like dove grey veils of evening, where little winds To my water spirits whisper, and of the tender plants That drop in delicate grace above me. And then I told of Ghiraween and her Whom Nerida and Birwain have found. Willy Wagtail - He who listened it is he of whom I spoke.Telopea - (indicating the Sleeper) I think 'tis her he seeks.Nerida - He knows her not - And yet her form fills all his thoughts.

The return of the spark to the fire. Streamlet glides on. Flowers retire leaving the Sleeper alone on the rock. Man enters attracted by the glitter of the water and does not see the flowers.Man - What faerie vale is this where I am led? In shadow dim as some vague memory.In sunlight greenly glowing and serene. Here perhaps, where all things seem to live May live the very shape of my desire. On this fresh glade a stillness lies and yet Something is that makes me greater than myself.Surely here has every plant a life apart And beautiful. O that I could release The force that swells within me, to wing my soul That it might grasp the lofty heights whose state I dimly guess at.(Advances further toward Streamlet) Swift slips the stream whose voice I long to hear. Wilt stay a little, Streamlet, I know not Whose sanctuary 'tis I near? Streamlet - All this, O Man, And more is thine, if thou will have it so. This Ghiraween, where Nature forces be, Holds timeless, lovely things in trust for thee. Man - Is't Ghiraween? Byamee's temple blest? Then here at length I name the nameless quest [Note: ==== Beginning of page 475 ====] That sent me forth to seek an unknown Good. Knowest thou of this O Streamlet? Streamlet - Page 661 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoSome part Indeed I know - that part which I myself Have felt and striven for. So canst thou readThe story of thy quest in this I give thee. Once the wise Sun Mother lived among us In endless day, and all our ways were love; Yet for this earth too fine her gentle spirit, And when she left me, far away to dwell,I thought my empty heart must break for grief, For grey, unlovely loneliness; and muted Was the voice of these pale waters. Despair Lent me strength, and Oh so much I loved her, My Sun Mother, that I left my narrowed bedAnd rose and rose, far up beyond the earth, Now palled in darkness. But who can span Another's destiny? I could not reach her. At last, worn out with grief, forlorn I fell To rest on every bush and flowerIn glistening tears of dew. Then, as a blossom Bursting into bloom, the sky filled with her light, And her warm love transforming me, lightly I floated up as vapour. Thus easily That great heart throbbed across the void of earthAnd Heaven! O Pilgrim, thus thy fate, To seek and strive and still to fail until In thine own spirit shall forever shine The true Sun's mighty ray. Man - What brings these thoughts To life? What power gives thee utterance? [Note: ==== Beginning of page 476 ====] Willy Wagtail - (coming forward from the Flowers) Yaraan can tell of that, for in this tree The great tongue lies as a God entombedThat thou must waken. Man - How speaks this hidden tongue?Willy Wagtail - Thou thyself once heard those sounds unutterable Until the gross earth wrapped thee round and closed Page 662 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThy delicate perception. Now must thou Seek for the heavenly voice in all the forms Of Nature. For these eyes saw the mighty tree trunkSplit and riven even to the ground, and then From the secret sky the living tongue Dropped down, and round about it closed the tree. In vain for man to call upon the dead; Nepelle's self is silent too. So must thouLook outward for the Gods whose presence is In every bush and bird and flower. It speaks in wind and rain and thunder And in the low clear call of summer sea. (Turning to the Angophora tree)Yaraan, Yaraan, whose pitying branches Drooped o'er the first earthly death, whose leaves Sheltered the yellow-crested Monyi, In kindness yield thy wisdom unto Man. Man - Yaraan, great gum thee, where shall I turn my eyes For light to find my dream? O speak to me. Yaraan - Thou man of mighty destiny, from starry space The light shines forth. Star-cold the cross of death (Mirrabooka)Must palely glow until thou find the power To make it flame with hope for thee. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 477 ====] Willy Wagtail - He has No memory, Yaraan, of that far timeWhen the Cross of Death in Southern skies was hung. Yaraan - Remember, then, how in forgotten dream-time Across the parching plains man fled to me - Fled with strife and ugliness behind him.Lifeless he fell at my feet and I mourned Till my bark dropped great red tears of blood. Then in the land of sunset Death came And raised the fugitive to rest within my boughs. So lest he should be utterly forgotten,I set these eyes and those of Death to shine Page 663 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoIn heaven. Willy Wagtail - But thy passing to the Land Of Sunset is not so. Yet wake thy sight And call on her who guards this valley - Telopea will tell the pilgrim's way To Bullimah where all desire dies. Chorus A. - He seeks the city of the blue-white walls That the Pilgrim sees by his own soul's light, But darkness deeply on the traveler falls E'er he finds wisdom and strength and sight. Chorus B. - The chasm unfathomable Deep as despair And the rolling stone Threaten him there. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 478 ====] Man (aside) - Their voices are fresh as the Balbalmas Their forms have Bralgah's grace - and now I see her - Telopea, her movements like the wind In fronds of she-oak. (Moves toward her) (To Telopea)Thou, whom Byamee blest And in whom his wisdom dwells, Oh teach me. Telopea - Thou seekest the perfect Land, O Pilgrim, Where all things move and breathe in harmonyAnd where a higher self awaits thee. Outside the city two cone-shaped crystals stand And round their bases coil the serpents Goonear and Bigaroo. The first Is evil and him thou must bewareLest he should lure and blind thy mortal sight. The other is the great physician, that heals All earthly imperfections. For him, For Bigaroo, thou must prepare, and when Before thee the spired city gleams Page 664 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoAnd fragrance fills the air, his voice discern. Yet gentle are the words of false Goonear And so our Nerida, whose guiding star is love,Would help thee now that thou may'st choose aright. Man - Of Nerida I know who saved her people And found in Wahwee's pool a way to life Nerida - In Wahwee's pool O man I also found Among the cold dank woods, a flawless stone Whose generous rays made the treacherous wave Lucent and calm. In this, three principles Have fused in perfect balance and onlyGoonear's evil glance can dim its lustre. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 479 ====] Willy Wagtail - Take the crystal Pilgrim, it will lead you Safely to the true Bigaroo; And I myself if so thou dost desireWill be thy guide along the narrow ledge From which hath fallen many a hapless soul To wander in impenetrable depths. (Man takes the crystal) Man - Thee Nerida, I have no words to thank, For with the stone thou gavest me some virtue And firm within me is my purpose. (To Willy Wagtail) O messenger and kindest friend, I cannotTake thy care. My way is solitary. As the hawk rose god-like in a flame of fire To float serenely splendid, beautiful, Above the lightning and the storming winds, So too will I ascend to shining heightsThough I must be my own relentless goad, As Wahn, the crow, pursued the eagle-hawk, Outwear within me all ignoble things And rise triumphant, bird-like, to the skies. Page 665 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoChorus A. - Farewell thou pilgrim who hast little space to stay, The air grows cold with shadow of approaching gloom,We who love thy questing would speed thee on thy way And pray thou 'scape the darkness and Goonear's doom. Man - I thank the Gods that wrought thee, gentle beings That gladly gave me of your hidden light,And say farewell to thee with sadness, Who brought the brightness to my spirit's night. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 480 ====] Chorus B. - Farewell, Farewell, And may thou beForever faithful, That we grow in thee. exit Man Telopea - Now hath he gone - and here entranced still Sleeps she for whom he treads his lonely way; And yet not one of us could take man's thought Back to his ancient state and the world That he once knew. Willy Wagtail - Only the butterflies, That bear immortal memory, that with The life earth renew themselves, only they Could have told Man of the spheres that cradled him. Telopea - I see them now; their wings are filled with light. Enter Seven Butterflies . Chorus of Butterflies - All colors of earth are ours to hold, Glimmering and lovely, fold on fold,Like skies' deep blue or sun's bright gold; Blossoms are we of the heaven's making Page 666 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoBorn of light in its first glad waking. 1st Butterfly to Telopea - We come to the sleeping child of wisdom From whom man turned away, to ring her round With that soft shadow of divinity That clings to us, who know the gates of Death. Telopea (Pointing to the Sleeper) - Approach her, whom Byamee cherishes. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 481 ====] (Butterflies circle around Sleeper) 2nd Butterfly . - Even as thou liest dreaming, lovely one, We dreamed of sun-bright life and yielded All our earthly form. In a little sleepThe mystic rhythm of the heart of Gods Was ours and here we leave it to unfold Within thee and to crown thee as with joy. Bat enters and Butterflies shrink back. Willy Wagtail - What evil brings you, Creature of twilight, Begotten of darkness and fear? Bat - In this valley, Bird, is a creeping Death, Remorseless, inevitable, cold with Hate.I see the long grey fingers stretching out. The very air rocks of his presence. Willy Wagtail - Away with you, bearer of ill. Some spirit, Haunting the shadows of Eleonbah WondahInspires you with hideous foreboding. Here is no Death, but only nature, love And sunshine. I tell you one is gone from here On Holy Quest and from his Soul enwrought With all this Temple's wisdom, shall be bornThe eternal, divine, unconquerable spirit In whom we all, that are in man complete, Page 667 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoShall know the solvent touch of Fire and grow Unto a state of life imperishable. Bat - This man to lead you to a higher life! This man, that even now is creeping back A broken pitiable thing! He to whom The dark-eyed Nerida gave her flawless stone [Note: ==== Beginning of page 482 ====] Is crushed and blinded, and the crystal He will never find again. He went Down the steep path and by the narrow ledge, And ever, as the outer voices called, He listened and so the quickening love was stilled And left his soul no quality responsiveTo the healing truths of Bigaroo; And therefore death is here for all of you And him, and all creation. For that one, By the shining three-fold crystals, passed Near to the evil coils of GoonearWho promised him all earthly strength and might. And lo! I, who in Goonear's presence dwell In twilit dark and Fear made palpable, I saw the crystal cloud, even as his eyes, Filled with Goonear's evil glare, could bearThe baleful glance no longer. Back he started In a blind agony, and clasped those orbs That would not look on ill and, as he did, The stone fell from his aching fingers And it rolled far in the rocky chasm.Then he, uttering the desolate wail Of the lost, stumbled back toward this place. He who went forth in the pride of his spirit, Lower than the lowest, here returns to die Where in constraining earthly force must perish all. Nerida (hushed) - In this true? How gloomily faints the wind In the moving tree-tops. (Looks toward the valley and sees Man returning) He is coming.What grief is here! He is beyond all pity! Page 668 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 483 ====] Could I but find a great-winged love to heal him. Bat - No plea can reach above. No ray of light Can pierce through the crowding doubts and fears. Now returneth half-remembered agonies, And all thy heart's pure cry is silenced. Telopea - I will not hear nor fear thee Bat. Not once Have we made supplication vain to him Whose life is in us. (Man enters) (To Butterflies) Beings of light, very gentle Be thy care of him whose steps unwitting,Blindly bear him back to you. His hurt is ours, And still within his heart's deep shrine of pain There burns the tiny flame of holiness. Willy Wagtail - (Watching him) He speaks not. In desolation Silence is, profound and toneless. (Butterflies lead him to foot of rock. Telopea, Chorus A. and B. gather on top around Sleeper) Chorus A. & B. - Byamee, Byamee Thou kindly spirit hear! On Ghiraween cold shadows lie, We cannot feel thee near. (All kneel except Telopea, Bat and Sleeper) Telopea - Thou whose being is Where a Will divine flows through Enchanted heavens, of thy strength Yet aid us. - Darkness shrouds thee! - Byamee, art thou not great enoughTo make an attribute of that new life That would unfold in Man?

I feel the air heavy And my words fall back upon my head, unblest.One door is closed, another hath not opened. Blind are they to the earth's slow pain, Deaf to the voices that wildly 'plain, Helpless to aid when the two paths meet. (Butterflies pass with drooping wings back to their bower)Chorus - Thou, Ghiraween, our lovely place of flowers, Here we wove thy beauty through the dreamlike hours, Here purely dwelt when Time itself was young, And in our happy hearts the Infinite has sung.From Bullimah came sweet that living breath. Now from our being comes the moveless form of Death. (Chorus sinks down overwhelmed) Yaraan - Is this indeed the end? Now when Space and Time Are one, must we sink into nothingness? Is there no power in realms of mighty air To flood the Cross of Death with radiant life? Bat - Earth hath not found it. Now cometh sickness, desolation, Death.

A power there is. One comethAnd of his kingdom there shall be no end. Blessed is she whom He doth overshadow Purer than a flower's breath her life hath been. Forgotten ages and centuries yet to be At her feet lay the jewels of their years.The choirs of Heaven's host break forth in music The waiting world gives back the holy sound To men, of good will, Peace!

Though he is clad in flesh In answer to man's cry, Yet all created thingsHe thus doth sanctify. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 486 ====] For such high harmony Lives in His body's shrine,It joineth earth with heaven Links human with divine. Chorus singing Page 671 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoPART III Last carol is heard from distance and singers are not seen. Butterflies enter from bower and while music lasts flutter in and out among the flowers, etc. All stir except Man but only Bat stands near place wherehe entered. When carol dies away Butterflies gather around Bat. 1st Butterfly - Thou poor Bat, now is thy little season ended. Back to thy native haunts thou must soon fly, And in the shadows, in which thou dost delight,Live out thy span of ill and know thy doom, Till in the farthest dawn of time, in thy heart too, Shall greatness wake. Bat - Yaraan foresaw this. In him the great tongue dwelt and when he spoke Of the Cross of Death he waited ever To see it flame with heavenly life. Thy presence Stifles me. Alien thou art. What hast thou found to break Goonear's power? 2nd Butterfly - Thou alone who keepeth tight-walled hate Around thy heart, hast neither seen nor heard The splendor that has filled the earth and sky. Senseless we lay, as though the Eternal GoodHad cast us out forever into causeless space, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 487 ====] When softly through the air from very far away There came a sound of singing as though the birds Of all the world, of all its ages long, Would break their hearts in the one lovely paean.Then in the curtained dark shone out a star More splendid than the Sun, and in our souls There crept a peace that evermore will bless, And the night was glorious with a love That made the whole earth tremble back to life. Bat - Upon this love I lay not hold in fear. Doth the abyss then yawn for me alone? Now were death welcome but that it cannot change Page 672 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe evil principle to good. So must I live To shatter it. I pass, O happier than I, Now is your darkness ended, Mine begins. (Exit Bat in direction of Goonear.) Butterflies have awakened flowers who are now around the Sleeper. Chorus A. - There where Goonear's heavy glance doth fall On drying flowers and birdless trees, he dwellsAnd ever sees a dauntless race advance That know the ill - yet pass it greatly by. Chorus B. - And so attain the Form Where shines the hidden SunFor she that dreaming, slept, Now wakes to lead man on. Telopea to Willy Wagtail - As Butterflies, the heaven's memories Exquisite, have linked us with lost worlds,Now come thou, Bird, that bearest noble thought, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 488 ====] And loosen Man from Earth's too close embrace To see this Child of Wisdom. So shall he Then understand the Bullimah within her. Willy Wagtail - (waking Man) Ages past, Byamee blest the barren land And it leapt gladly into fruitful life, Now hath another clad the earth with love And thy soul liveth in its gentle breath. Wake thou! The veiled Light before thee glows,On every side a thousand voices call - \"Arise! Thy strength is counted and thy task decreed!\" Man - The light of a lovelier dawn hath scattered From a dead past the mists that sealed my sight.All beauty hath been born of sacrifice, And hour by hour I hear, unceasingly, Page 673 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoA thousand voices, in alien tongues they speak. Bewildered I in these strange realms of sight and sound. Yaraan - Wert thou not dead and hath not infinity Encompassed thee? See there the one that God Enshrineth, and in the power that fills the earth Now toil, till all contending voices shall Resolve themselves in one. From heaven the TongueOnce fell and diversely filled creation. Now comes the Word divine, through countless years Evolved. Sound it and the universe is thine. Man - Yet hath Goonear seized upon the stone That Nerida found and gave to me, and I No longer see the vision of the end. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 489 ====] Telopea - Fear's frozen mantle from Earth's glad face is reft Thy doubts but hinder thee. The Great Heart reigneth now.When but a little while ago, upon us lay The sabled darkness and we entangled were In filaments of evil that bound our thought To Earth, then, when misery made the whole world mute, I seemed to stand upon an ancient forest floor -And thou and all of these were of my life And part of me - A tide of feeling rippled Through the green ghost world. The trees bowed stately heads. A little fleck of sunshine that lost itself Within the raptured woods, touched my dancing feetWith beauty. Far-off a bird sang, so sweetly That almost life itself had ceased to be To make its life immortal. My breath Caught itself upon the listening quiet And froze into a tracery of still,Uncaptured loveliness, a starry Form For thee to fill with substance, My heart, faint with an unknown tenderness, Yearned upward to the heavens, and Gentle Hands Caught mine. Silver threaded mist clung closelyTo that Shape of Love, and I that ever longed Page 674 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoTo link myself with Beauty's inmost grace Now found delight and those dumb dreams That never would have known an earthly waking,Soft as the morn's first sigh, around me winged Radiant, into the limitless light of heaven. Through airy avenues of skyless space [Note: ==== Beginning of page 490 ====] The Gentle Hands drew me. At length, downward We fled and countless stars flashed in our wake,And plunged into the unresting multitude Of Ocean, and its crested waves, piled high With feathered foam, in homage spent themselves. My feet now trod the smooth sea bed, then faltered Within a cavern boundless, of that blacknessWhere no ray of light has ever touched the gloom. But the Gentle Hands still guided me and suddenly, Brighter than the stars that followed us from Heaven I saw the crystal shining, translucent, Lovely, and I put forth my hand and plucked itFrom its strange sea setting. Then was calm at once around me and I Was here in Ghiraween and Nerida's stone With that same beauty, shone upon the forehead Of the one that here doth wait for thee. Nerida - It is not lost, O man. Upon her brow In threefold purity the crystal shines. As into ever widening seas hath fled, Into its depths, thy growing aspiration. Birwain - There is the light to find thy dream. In her attainment lies the Perfect Land. (Exit Nerida and Birwain.) (Butterflies and Willy Wagtail form a chain between Man & Sleeper)Telopea - Thought and memory now raise thy heart to her. The power, that now within her dwells, transforms The cold and shadowed cross. Thou canst not fail. Page 675 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe heavens are the witness of thy deeds. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 491 ====] Willy Wagtail - Unseen was she when thou went through this vale, She slept, in whom lies thy complete fulfillment. (Exit Butterflies and Willy Wagtail) (Streamlet flows up from the valley) Streamlet - Pilgrim, even as mine, thy efforts failed To trace the circle, but the Sun's great heart Hath compassed universal space and thee, And Earth is drawn into the heaven's soul. Consciously thou standest in the forward stream Of all creation and thyself doth make its end. (Exit Streamlet) Chorus A. & B. - To the children of the stars is given The force to mold their lives' design Till truth for which the years have strivenAnd sunbright wisdom shall within them shine. (Exit Chorus) Telopea - Quietly shall beauty lead them by the hand And serene thought uphold them. A will divineShall point their pathway to the skies. (Exit Telopea) [Note: ==== Beginning of page 492 ====] Man - (to Sleeper, led to Sleeper by the Butterflies) In thee at last do I behold the essence Of Immortality. What vision dost thou bring? Lo! in a southern land, where the waters Page 676 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoOf a strange sea sweep about its shores In constant turmoil, lieth the earth's crown Of high endeavor. Its sanctuaryIs hidden in unyielding bitter wastes But there are some that dare its fastnesses. Within it, for centuries uncounted, A sacred flame hath burned, unsullied, Of the first primeval purity. ThereLieth littleness. The children of the Sun Are one in an eternal brotherhood. The portals of the shrine shall open wide And the world have vision of a land afire That makes of worthless aims a holocaust -Afire with purpose never lost, but overcast In long years of denser life. (to Sleeper) As a torch Thy figure shineth in dark places.Who knows thee not, who cannot find thy light, Though the salt earth preserve his frame, his spirit, Yet aspiring, shall on a new earth find redemption. For me, lead thou. My soul shall seek no other guide. (Sleeper leads Man off) [Note: ==== Beginning of page 492b ====]Their conformation in ledges is the ideal for successive tiers of stately homes, and the sandstone substructure of these ledges affords the most elegant of all building materials. It also constitutes a district free of wind and dust, also perfectly drained beneath as to water, and above as to cooling currents of air, so that the temperature and humidity are the most equable, even precluding frost - all the conditions for the best health. Some years ago the genius of Walter Burley Griffin, architect and town planner, saw the amazing possibilities of the three virgin promontories on the western side of middle Harbour with their glorious four miles of water frontage. His enthusiasm inspired a group of Australian capitalists amongst his professional clients, and the magnificent amphitheatres passed into the hands of Greater Sydney Development Association Limited. This is literally a case where the last is best, for here is the only harbor frontage free from the threat of commerce and quite out of the field of industrial expansion now in evidence in every other direction. It is the only waterside development that can be, and will be, protected against flats.

In both these fields he was functioning before he left high school. The first city plan he laid down was for a Chinese client for China. The underlying principles were clearly established here - the laws of distribution and occupation. Just so in his brother's home was the continuous second story sill line laid down so generally followed by the Chicago School of Architecture perhaps under the influence of the Japanese prints brought to their exhibit in Chicago's Columbian Exposition in the last decade of the 19th century, when Spiritual influences were concentrating to transform rational thinking (which had been necessary to bring aboutthe individualizing of men) into creative thinking which would give them freedom in the true sense of the word, as opposed to license.

STATE NORMAL SCHOOL GROUNDS . WISCONSIN [Note: The plan is for the Northern Illinois State Normal School in DeKalb, Illinois (now Northern Illinois University). References in the literature can also be found to plans for the Wisconsin State Normal School in Milwaukee (now University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) and the State Normal School in Charleston, Illinois (now Eastern Illinois University).] [Note: ==== Beginning of page [1-2] / 1 (typescript) ====] A NEW HISTORICAL PERIOD [Note: The word \"Introduction\" is crossed out.] A new historical period which ended the renaissance of the Greek period, a solar cycle of 5000 years, began with the turn of the 20th century. It differs essentially from past periods in that human beings areno longer under the domination of a folk soul. Louis Sullivan was the founder in America of modern architecture and has had perhaps more influence in Europe than in America, at least an architecture no longer under the domination of ancient forms; but Page 687 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowith the private ownership of land, which unfortunately succeeded Federal control in the United States, the development of architecture was stymied until the profession of community planning, which alone could give architecture a free chance in post-feudal times, was established by Walter Burley Griffin andthe University of Illinois. This has still dragged because only by a unified control of considerable areas of ground could much town planning, and therefore architecture, blossom. The growth of modern architecture still awaits the removal of the poison of private ownership of land. This can be brought about wholesomely only when the Threefold organization is effected. This is at present expressed, though scarcely on its feet, in the United Nations with its Security (political) Organ,properly a police Organization whose only function is to maintain Equity - like the policeman on the street corner - and second its Economic Organ and third its Social (or Abilities) Organ. The collection and allocation of the land values, though required by the Political Organ, would be in the hands of the Social Organ, and would be used to enable every citizen to develop his own abilities to the maximum throughout his life, facilities for this provided for him from birth to death. Griffin was enabled to develop modern architecture largely though the considerable areas owned by his clients or himself. Naturally these opportunities enabled his work to have sufficient character to influence [Note: This page is not in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 2 ====] a body and a soul and a spirit. They all need to be fed. Feed only the body and the other two thirds of him [Note: the citizen?, the human being?] die. He becomes only body, not an animal but a beast. We see this in Europe now. In earlier civilization the overlords lived in close centers. The people, farmers, spent their days in the broad surrounding open spaces. The ancient type of city was properly planned for its time and has great beauty and magnificence. In our industrial civilization only the overlords can afford to live in the wide open spaces. The citizens, the workers, are packed into the cities, great spacebut solidly packed, slums and nothing but slums, but the wealthy can escape from their more expensive slum districts. Now the problem of putting Chicago to rights in the matter of residential requirements was solved in the 2nd decade of this century in a competition fostered by the Chicago architects. The solution could be applied to any part of the city as well as to all the outlying districts which have been settled and are stillto be settled during the succeeding decades. Nothing has been done correctly because the man who solved the problem went to the antipodes where he died. One other architect has put forth this same plan except that he has used only the suggested economy of the street arrangement and squeezed out all the open spaces to add more streets and more congestion. This plan has been published in the news papers recently. It would be a crime to use it. But why not use the original plan. I can think of no reason exceptthat each architect feels that he should respect in others what he demands for himself, claiming that what he designs belongs to him. So they continue to grope around for some other answer and nothing else is the answer. So a professional vice is holding up the carrying into effect of this vital work and slumdom continues to be universal in all the residential districts of Chicago.

Cottages in Britain are pretty in their very pettiness and fit naturally into little isolated villages. Here dwellings must be congregated in enormous colonies. The old standard was that of individual effort, or handicraft, crudity and inefficiency. The new is of cooperative effort, machinery precision and economy. The former provided physical protection to the human animal. The latter must afford, in the home, comfort and facilities for sedentary pursuits and the nourishing of intellectual growth. So might an infinitude of parallels be drawn, all pointing to the foolishness of attempting to bind ourselves with the very shackles that determined the old styles, which is the very thing we do when we look to precedent for our inspirations. In a sentence, the conditions and the environment require an intelligent appreciation. To produce a modern style we must first master the possibilities and comprehend the reasonable limitations of our new and complicated constructive media. Whereas of old the architect need merely be familiar with the economies of simple masonry and carpentry, today it is a question of the science of engineering, and then not only static, but embracing equipment and distributive systems that are dynamic. Only the student inducted into engineering, versed in the technique, is in a position to apply and develop in architecture those basic laws that govern our intuitions of time and space, or line, massand proportion which apply to the eye just as to the ear do those of rhythm and harmony in music. Now, would you venture to indicate how a national type of architectural art could be evolved for Australia? [Note: ==== Beginning of page 13 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . RALPH D.

Here already the second story continuous sill line wasestablished. This again was not a merely superficial but basic architecture which lies in the plan primarily and not purely in superficialities. Griffin was a conserver of space. In our cold climates where heat for winter has to be supplied he did not simply install a basement under the whole house only a small part of which was needed for the heating systems of that time but leavingabout half the basement for such uses dropped some of the living quarters to the ground level. In this case the living room thus became a story and a half high. Down half a dozen steps from this level and one was in the billiard room. There was still plenty of space for the heating apparatus. A half story up from the living room were the dining room and the library which thus became a balcony of the Living Room. A story above these are the bed rooms. In this as in most of his buildings he laid out a landscape and planting plan. The location of the dwellings by no means followed the rule of thumb of the usual methods of placing the house on the lot. Many advantages were won in this way. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 16 ====] [Note: Continued from page 12?] Music is a parallel art in that it appeals to primitive instinct, and is independent of representation of ideas, of literature. Music is, so far, the one great art that has been developed in modern times, because it had kept pace with science, as that has clarified the phenomena of sound, and with the mechanical progress that has opened new avenues of musical expression. Modern science and mechanics offer fully as great advantages to architecture, which have only to be recognized in order properly to apply the Australian motto to this even more important necessary anduniversal art.

We must not think personally where causes are cosmic. All forms in matter or thinking derive from the chemical ether which is the manifesting force as compared with the spiritualizing forces of warmth and light. It is the central region of America that is ruled by the chemical ether whose basic manifestation is liquidity with the centralizing force of gravity forming spheres - that great Mississippi Valley - and there we find the founders of creative thinking in the arts, the modernists, Lois [Note: Loie] Fuller and Isadora Duncan in the dance, George Bernard [Note: George Grey Barnard?] in sculpture, Leo Masters [Note: Edgar Lee Masters?] in poetry, Louis Sullivan in architecture, Walter Burley Griffin in Ground planning - town planning or whatever you choose to call it, and so on. Though all new movements derive from one individual, since ideas arise in a human mind, when that has happened the way is open to all humanity to carry on and develop the work. The foundation has been laid. Louis Sullivan laid the foundation of modern architecture. His influence was felt as early in Europe as in America and evenmore powerfully there in the early decades. Personal vanities and claims obstructed it here, especially the widely [publicized] [Note: supplied from similar passage at III.10.175)] braggadocio of one who did little but talked much. The necessity of preserving the life of the Earth is a prime duty in every field of life, in every occupation, and taking maximum advantage of its gifts is the task of the designer. The power of a conscientious consideration of all the elements of a problem was brought home to me when I saw the revolution in methods and results that took place when landscape was made a part of architecture. It meant not only a broadening of the view but a positiveness of action arising from the firm foundation of definite facts determining the general scheme before taking up details of internal requirements. Landscape architecture does not mean gardening as an afterthought to a building butmeans a consideration of the external [Note: The text on this and the following pages is very similar to that found in Section III, No. 10., pages 175, 179, and 172 (above).

Not only natural conditions but the character of the surrounding buildings have sometimes to be taken advantage of, sometimes to be overcome. And we must consider not the mere personal point but must look to the advantage to everyone affected, for it is curiously true that a thing to be a real and permanent advantage to one must be an advantage to everyone, just as in the animal or man a sound organ is of vital importance to all the organs. When society in an organism, and the individual can benefit only from what is of benefit to all since all areinterdependent as root, branch, leaf and blossom of tree. My first object lesson was the case of a house the working drawings of which had been completed, and accepted by the owner and the contract let, when it was first subjected to the criticism from this fundamental standpoint, when Griffin entered into partnership with the architect [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright]. The lot was one next to a two-story flat building with its porch built close to the sidewalk line.Across the street from the flat building was a beautiful park. The house criticized was being set back on the lot as if shrinking from an ugly thing of which it was afraid, leaving the greater part of the grounds to the front, allowing the other building to look over it destroying its privacy and shutting off from the client the delightful view opposite, the home garden dominated by this ugly building. A knowledge of the conditions of the surroundings led to the flat criticism that although the design was charming it was not the right answer, this was not the proper plan for the location, words which meant nothing to the designer who was only an architect, to whom town planning was a closed book. Griffin suggested that the living rooms be elevated above the eyes of the passer-by lifting the basement out of the ground, and that the house instead of being a parallelogram should be ell shaped, and that the whole building be brought forward alongside the flat building and so acting as a screen [Note: The last two paragraphs on this page have been crossed out in pencil.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page [20-2] ====] around the whole house giving it a real dignity worthy of the discipline he had been under with Mr. Sullivan. Page 698 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoWhile this was going on I was told to make sketches for an abstract 2 story 3 bed-room house which I did. This gave me an experience of why the Chinese tipped up the overhanging eaves though expressed in modern scientific terms of forces of gravity instead of demons - a reality in whatever terms expressed.I guess I was never a conformist. Any [Note: Anyway?] it was a cruciform plan. Later on when I had left the office and Griffin was in partnership there an amazing thing happened. He told me one day several years later of his first experience there. A residential job had come into the office and the two men went into a competition for it. He mentioned the name of the client and I was wide-eyed thinking he was going to say he won it. Why otherwise should a man be telling me about it. But he said he lost, andI laughed and told him that house had been built exactly in accordance with my design - that first one. It was a revolutionary design, abandoning the universal parallelogram, T shaped, and center reception entrance hall dropped to ground level. His losing in that competition was doubtless a unique experience in that office. His revolutionizing of the work in that office was first expressed in the [Note: Frank W.] Thomas House. Later this architect went abroad. He asked me to take over the office for him. I refused. But after he had gone Mr. [Note: Herman] von Holst who had taken over asked me to join him so I did on a definite arrangement that I should have control of the designing, that suited him. When the absent architect didn't bother to answer anything that was sent over to him the relations were broken and I entered into a partnership with von Holst and Fyfe. For that period I had great fun designing. While the construction of the home of Henry Ford was being carried on, presentation sketches were made for Mr. [Note: C.H.] Wills. At this period I too followed the Japanese feeling. It was not till a short time afterward, when I entered Griffin's office, that I realized the difference. [Note: The William A. Storrer Catalog Number (3rd edition, 2002) for the Thomas House is S.067.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 21 (table of contents) ====] No. 2. OWN HOUSE . TRIER CENTER [Note: Trier Center was located in Winnetka, Illinois.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 22 ====] CAPTION In this case also Griffin built a basement for furnace and storage under the Living Room only. The other half of the living floor - dining room, kitchen and veranda, were built solid on the ground, proper construction installed to prevent seepage of moisture. Turning to the west on entering one enters this suite. A half flight of steps to the right takes one to the lofty living room with its perforated screen frieze above window and door head height encircling three sides of the Living Room and forming the windowscreen for the bed rooms.

A truly creative achievement as perfect as those of the Greeks or Goths.This is a minimum cost house. It has corner fenestration but beautiful instead of the teeth knocked out which has so widely followed this type of construction which substitutes tensile for compressive members so universal before. This with all its ornament is as cheap as the usual barren examples as was proved in the incinerator in Sydney, Australia, where the whole wall is highly ornamented. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 23 ====] THE HOUSE . AN ELEMENT IN A GARDEN SCHEME The design herewith illustrated is an example of the kind of improvement projected for a neighborhood group of houses being planned for the 9 acre rectangular plot of land lying just West of the New Trier High School Community Center in Winnetka, Illinois. This house is one of the group to be started at the break of Spring that will comprise the first installment of a series of 36 small fireproof cottages that represent an attempt to demonstrate some of the advantages of recently developed practical and estheticprinciples for the layout of small home groups. Among the advantages, besides the generally recognized saving in wholesale building operation, especially for fireproof structures are:- Greater utilization of the ground and openness of view, first through clustering together and thus concentrating the public thoroughfare and service functions of the house to leave wider, freer ground space for private use and preservation of the rural character;secondly, by arranging the clusters with respect to each other to give vistas from all principal rooms extending over at least two unobstructed lots in each direction; thirdly, in the combination and composition of units of simplest forms, single little houses, into picturesque or formal designs, using connecting walls and hedges with tree and shrub backgrounds to help convert each house, that alone would be an unmitigated box, into an appropriate link of a rambling, cozy, private community home ofseparate wings, bays and pavilions, such as might constitute the dream of the useless overgrown Castle in Spain toward which each of us is so often selfishly and aristocratically inclined. The site of this one isolated house unit that will mark the starting point terminates an extension of Alles Road eastward to a small circular park which will effect this road's diversion to the north and also form the northern terminal of Bertling Lane that is [Note: ==== Beginning of page 24 ====] to run southward to a similar circle planting screening its south entrance from Winnetka Avenue. Located focally this house can take on a somewhat more decorative and special character than is intended for the remaining ones. In its function of a high Studio Living Room, it is afforded somedistinction, and perforated concrete geometric tracery for the frieze windows of opalescent color glass Page 700 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofor this room, and the conservatory as well, gives the single motive that is utilized to characterize the whole design. Not only outside is the characterization intended but inside also in fireplace, sideboard and grilles, rendered possible through the elimination of wood trim or fixtures, wood being used onlyfor movable or portable appurtenances. Perhaps thus a cottage with only two bedrooms may be able to dispense with any want of a maid's room and the responsibility of a household organization. At any rate, the office organization in Chicago in which both members of this household are involved is considered enough to absorb all available energy in that direction. And it is now becoming the conviction of many others that conservation of freedommust lead to the simplest house units and construction with retinues the smallest compatible with the size of the family, a standard simpler by far than prevalent types and perhaps approximating the completely tile-outfitted lunch rooms that serve the cleanest food with the least help and at the lowest price and the greatest profit.

Walter Burley Griffin When we have become satiated with precepts and principles, and examples illustrative thereof, architectural or indeed pertaining to art in general, we are ripe for an appreciation of the real thing which exists not because of these essentials but through and constrained by them. They are not what makes art fresh, invigorating, inspiring; they do not endow it with character. Art principles are analogous to scientific principles, they tell much of the body, the husk of the thing but they balk at the life, yet it is with the introduction of life that the thing becomes real and natural. With nature and art as with human nature the absorbing feature is the heart - the soul. We are attracted by an ideal behind, the perception of which is, perhaps, subconscious but at any rate there, and our Page 702 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoenjoyment is measured by the keenness of the perception. It is the case of the yellow primrose. Say we call this aesthetic intuition or feeling, because it is independent of the intellect in the same way that we know ethical feeling, that of right and wrong, to be. A higher than mortal development mayshow a continuity in the fields of physical and meta-physical observation but for the present we must admit ignorance of the relationship and it is nothing less than presumption in the analytical art critic to content himself with picking flaws and extolling conformation to his own rules, unless his own preconceptions, through his absorption in these details, become as totally oblivious to the presence or absence of life as he is incapable of producing the beautiful himself. A resort to taste however is not at all implied unless that of an absolutely free and open commune with nature is meant; for ordinarily taste is a more or less self conscious emanation from inward, or a creature of habit reducible to one's own or another's previous [Note: ==== Beginning of page 28 ====] sanction, the reverse of susceptibility to the spirit of nature or man's translation of that spirit - art. Whatever it is that takes hold of us when we are stirred by the storm, solaced by the serenity of calm, awed by the grandeur of the mountain, whatever it is that influences us in nature's various moods, that, or some phase or it, the artist must have when he expresses himself in a poem, a painting, a symphony or a house, and that, if he has succeeded in expressing himself, is what the witness will feel unless he is fenced about with custom, self-sufficing learning or with prejudice. Is it a coincidence then that art has been in history the handmaiden of religion? Not when we realize the intimate relationship as to source and manner of conception. And so has the architect preached as long as his religion remained heart-felt and heart-enacted, rather than authority inspired and authority enacted. And so was his art then the highest expression of the \"sermon in stones.\" Now if this were an exposition of art what has been said would be the climax but to connect it with The Natural House is only to pass from general to particular. To begin with, such an understanding of art establishes the necessary conditions of its teaching and practice. Only for the youngest then can that education rest on authority. No rules, no doctrines, can be accepted after maturity until tested by the inward initiative or creative force, the idealistic feeling that we have been talking about. As with the spirit of a New Testament in the heart, the Decalogue may safely be forgotten (though history seems to show that in undeveloped periods before the dawn of democracy, the latter is useful); thus to affirm that sincerity, thoroughness, restraint, etc., etc., are essentials, or to learn the necessity of regard for consistency of scale and motif, for grace of proportion, for the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 29 ====] Page 703 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagodegrees of variety in unity, repetition and contrast; or to imbibe the 33 aphorisms of [Note: John] Ruskin's Seven Lamps of Architecture or the dicta of any seer, is to deal laboriously with the numerous observations of the mind-resultant, one soul attitude, the receptive susceptible one toward nature. Alone familiarity with these observations and deductions may beget talent, the faculty for the simulation of art; but if from the attributes we are finally led to the sources of power we are no farther than we might have been at the outset had we sought nature direct. When, however, whether deductively or inductively, the intimacy with nature and love or creatures' spirit have been acquired, technical proficiency (knowledge of the tools and materials and facility in theiruse) will govern and limit the translation and perpetuation of her impressions. To recognize a work of art then do not proceed to try it by the formulae of the teachers with whom you happen to have been thrown for art, again like religion, is too vital a feature of human experience to be dependent for its comprehension on the word of mouth of man from generation to generation or to be withheld from a large part if the world through chance failure to meet its teacher. Forget these limitations of the mind, become unconscious of self for the time being as when in contact with nature's own handiwork and if under these circumstances no similar message is received the art is wanting though no defect in principle can be detected. Now a house in so far as it is artistic differs from other artistic expression nowise but in the media used. The same ideal, the same sort of feeling must be behind its conception and, in recognizing this, perhapswe will look for more in the architecture and be less exacting of the architect. We can be satisfied with little conformation to our own views as well as with less [Note: ==== Beginning of page 30 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . ROCK CREST . MASON CITY [Note: The caption in the New-York Historical Society copy inserts the name [Joshua G.] \"Melson\" into the title.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 31 ====] CAPTION The half story scheme so frequently used by Griffin is not conspicuously apparent in the elevations for the formality of the design is never sacrificed, so this economical and space saving method though sofrequently used by him has rarely been used by the profession. This method enabled him to make good use also of differences of levels of the grounds. It was never permitted to interfere with the dignity of the exterior. And roofs became accessible and useful terraces. Page 704 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 32a ====] [Note: Continued from page 29] comprehensive statement of his reasons which it may tax his wits to concoct. Just as soon as the love of the work is dispelled and the designer begins to produce listlessly or mechanically, however carefully, the possibilities of the production are destroyed, there is no life in it. The builder of the natural house requires from the outset a degree of relief from exactions and distractions, a freedom of action which he rarely gets. Here is a condition that chiefly accounts for the all but total absence from this field of art (otherwise the broadest and most influential of all) of true creative artists. In other branches of art generally popularjudgment, however perverted and unjust it is, is at least withheld for the result but here it is imposed in restriction at the initiative through a false assumption of conflicting interests. Once let the judgment of the people be shifted to finished creations and the choice of design based strictly thereon, house designing will invite serious, profound effort which it needs and merits to instill into it the intuition which the very word \"create\" implies. Perhaps apology is here due for the foregoing under the caption of \"The Natural House.\" It is apparently and possibly really a digression but, were it granted without question, a plea for or discussion of, \"The Natural House\" would be almost superfluous. [Note: Punctuation in this last sentence follows that of the New-York Historical Society copy.] What the house could indeed be, having been produced naturally, is a sequel which need only be touched upon. Being natural it is a reflection in the first place to a greater or less extent of the spirit of the nation, the people, that builds it, of that specific variety of human nature I mean, not its status in erudition. Houses in the past, the world over it seems, have been better generally when regulated primarily by the ways and means at hand [Note: ==== Beginning of page 32b ====] [Note: Supplied title: Exterior View and Plan of Villa, with Court [/] Residence of Mr. S.R.

It is not listed in the table of contents.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 33 ====] rather than by purely architectural aspiration, simply because when serious attempt at architecture has been made it has not meant art but learning, cleverness, talent or ignorant striving for these. Hence for comparison of results the general conclusion has been that in houses practical considerations should govern, that house building, furniture building, should be striven for rather than house and furniture architecture. Of course use of the most available materials and methods of construction applying them to the problem in hand in the most obvious and seemingly straightforward way cannot fail to partake of a limited feeling of the designer for his work, but, a deeper insight, a desire for the utmost attainable, is apt to manifest itself independently of local brands or crudely developed productions. It is in [Note: \"in\" crossed out in N-YHS] lazy neglect of an opportunity not to reach for an ideal which will be held by apparent limitations only after every effort to overcome them has been exhausted. Thusthe Natural House will never glory in crudities nor in simplicity, nor in directions \"per se\" but only as these tend to an end by which alone they can be judged and which alone is the life of the house. When we come to this ideal, though, we will be sure that it, in the house, is the ideal of the domestic life for which it stands. If that ideal is tranquility to the extent of exclusiveness or hospitality to all the lengths of festivity or of any of the gradations between, it must be that particular one to which it must adapt itselfwhich should appear to us. For our part possibly the restful, the peaceful but statically vigorous character appeals most strongly as I believe it does to the most of the peoples when the country itself is mild in aspect, the climate erratic though temperate. On the other hand where nature in the low tropics seems more restful and unambitious it may be assumed that man and his habitation partakes of the unambitious, and while thedwellings of the Tyrolese I fancy reflect the rugged mountaineers [Note: ==== Beginning of page 34 ====] as well as the tumultuous environment. To be natural is to be true and unaffected and when thus submissive to nature's will, if you will, man contributes a consistent integral, organic part as the result of his effort. Nature demands a unity in her ideal which embraces human nature and its expressions as well as all animals, vegetables and inanimate creations and requires of each a contribution that shall fit into the great harmony.

GRIFFIN HIS SUCCESSOR Mr. Griffin says:- \"Louis Sullivan probably broke away from the old traditions when he left the Beaux Arts, if not before. He made his first declaration, presented his thesis, in 1884 when he read his \"Inspiration\" before an assembly of brother craftsmen. Since that time he has been the recognized leader in the effort of the best and brightest among the profession to \"draw the thing as he sees it for the God of things as they are,\" though it was not until 1893 that a broad, illuminating and progressive conception of his art was forced upon the attention of the world by his Transportation Building with itspolychromatic doorway at the Columbian Exposition. The public is at last realizing the logic of the principles for which Mr. Sullivan labored and which the best among those of lesser years and fresh enthusiasm have sought to develop. It does not mean that a discovery has been made and old principles in form and ethics turned topsy turvy. It does mean that a majority of those who believe that \"form should follow function\" and that \"Progress should go beforeprecedent\" have good ground for so believing. The principle is being worked out by architects everywhere. Vitally active, and sanely pursued in the Middle West of the United States, it is also the inspiring motive on its Western border, and on the continent from Finland to Buda-Pest [Note: i.e., Budapest]. It is the source of the most interesting architectural work. Even among the conventional and the traditional its logic appeals and draws. It is the basis of thought as it will be of action of men whose talent and sane discrimination guide them in their professional work.\" Mr. Griffin, Mr. Sullivan's successor in creative thinking, in these fields awakened the community to the necessity of considering simultaneously the problem of building and environment near and far. It now becomes clear that these cannot be practiced as separate professions, architect or town planner, but only as one indivisible profession - landscape architecture. It is time our Universities woke up to this fact and Page 707 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagomade one subject of these for united they [Note: ==== Beginning of page 38 ====] stand and divided they fail. Canberra - the only modern city in the world - Alpha & OmegaThere is an error which derives from our present day habit of being satisfied with rational thinking which starts from a premise and follows a straight line to a conclusion. This method of thinking leaves out all the multifarious facts that do not fall into that straight line. This method of thinking is or can be purely mechanical and is the idol of our time. More living thinking follows curves, sometimes very devious curves, for it takes note of facts and does not rest satisfied with theories. Facts lie outside ofreason. The Gods do not use that method of thinking. Creative thinking goes direct to totalities and works from wholes to particulars. The Greeks conceived the totality of nature - earth, water, air, fire, its four conditions of matter brought into existence by the formative forces revealed recently in the smashing of matter in the resorts [Note: retorts?] revealing astounding forces. The Greeks expressed their inspiration in the fourness [Note: i.e., four-ness] of theirtemples. Every true revolutionary is a creative thinker, not a destroyer but a builder. Thus the French revolution was not a revolution but an upheaval substituting one control for another. The same is true of Bolshevism in Russia and so with most community upheavals. There was however in France someone who had a creative imagination when he cried out for liberty, equity, fraternity. But the vision faded. Noone did anything about it. The concept of humanity as having three functions was never translated into deeds. So we continue to have totalitarian governments and continue to have upheavals in our communities but nowhere yet the revolution of transforming our communities from the totalitarianism form to a threefold form to meet these three needs of humanity. Yet it is axiomatic that if an entity has three functions to fulfill it must have three organs to fulfill them. This revolution calls for no upheaval,merely constructive deeds. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 39 ====] So with Architecture and Landscape Architecture (Town Planning is a most unfortunate title for one lot is as important as a city) a simultaneous consideration of all the elements is requisite, is essential. Inmodern times, say since the 15th century, Griffin was the creative thinker in this field. As a boy in school he laid down the basic principles of occupation & distribution. Shortly after graduation he laid down a town plan for a Chinese client [Note: Wong Kai Kah (1860-1906)?] of a city [Note: an addition to Shanghai?] to be built in China. It was not long before the opportunity he had been waiting for presented itself - Australia was calling for designs for their Federal Capital city. He won the prize and was made Federal Director of Design & Page 708 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoConstruction of Canberra. When after six years he resigned a law was passed that no deviation from the plan could be made except by an act of Parliament. Since a city is a thing that grows through the decades and centuries Griffin never expected to see more than a small part in actual execution but, sincegovernments don't have to pay interest on the money they expend, Canberra is now one of the sights of the world the roads of a whole city and its suburbs laid out and constructed on the ground the whole of which can be seen from the neighboring heights, and the citizens are saying that through that great conception of Mr. Griffin's the soul of Australia is developing. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 40 (table of contents) ====] PYRMONT INCINERATOR . CONFIRMING A NEW ARCHITECTURAL PERIOD [Note: The incinerator was located in Sydney.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 41 ====] CAPTION INCINERATORThat beauty does not necessarily increase the cost of a building is well illustrated not only in Own House but on a grand scale in the Pyrmont Incinerator of Sydney, Australia where the whole surface of building and chimney is highly ornamented. The tile units are larger than bricks and the building a large one so that the rich and varied ornamentation representing the four ethers - warmth circular, - light triangular - sound crescent - and magnetism square - entailed no increase of cost over brick. The resultant building holds its own in this period with Egyptian, Greek and Gothic. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 42 ====] LAND PLANNING That land planning was the essence or Griffin's profession, even the land planning of a single lot, is illustrated in Volume III, The Federal Battle, where photographs of his community plans form the Initials for its 24 chapters. The full flowering of his work came in the last year of his life which wasspent in India with which country America should be closely bound through mutual (individual not imperial) interests. Each has much to gain from the other whereas Europe will doubtless have to stand apart for a long time to come. We must realize that architecture and community planning are inseparable and that, for all the great genius of Sullivan, the school which grew from his inspiration died aborning so to speak until Griffinunited community planning with it. The Chicago school died not only because of the cancer sore in it - one [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright?] who originated very little but spent most of his time claiming Page 709 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoeverything and swiping everything even using an Australian [Note: George A. Taylor?] who contacted him on a trip through America and thenceforth forwarded to him what he could get hold of of Griffin's work as for instance an imitation knitlock house in California and solid floor on the ground whichimmediately began to leak and had to be done all over again. The square tiles of the walls had no structural raison d'etre. Purely another case of \"I want to be the lion too.\" The development of individuals as well as of the arts, especially Architecture, depends on the structure of the community and so long as private ownership of land continues the community can have no structure. We can't even get a quarter section of Chicago to prove that through its treatment thecommunity can become a healthy, happy organism with no child delinquency. Unfortunately from some points of view, Griffin's appointment as Director of Design and Construction of Canberra took us to Australia before this revolutionary design, Own House, Trier Center, could be carried into effect. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 43 ====] This was in 1913. Griffin was already in Australia when the working drawings [Note: N-YHS handwritten addition: \"of one of the dwellings - Own House . Trier Center -] were being made. I handed the plans to the engineer in our office, a fine engineer he was too, to work out the structural steel. He came to me presently saying scornfully that building couldn't be built, it had no stamina, couldn't take the horizontal stresses. You will notice that it has two pairs of heavy piers. The rest of the house is two bays, all windows, the glass house par excellence. The concrete piers terminate either end of the stairpassages. I replied - \"Do you mean to tell me those great heavy piers can't hold up that little house?\" \"But,\" he said, \"there is no weight in the corners to take up the horizontal stresses.\" \"But surely,\" said I, \"it is possible by engineering means to take up such stresses by tension members as well as by compression members.\" He returned to his desk and tied the bays into the piers. This is an interesting instance of the basic difference between the engineer and the architect. The engineer thinks in terms ofthe past - \"It isn't done.\" The architect thinks in terms of the future - \"It has to be done.\" There is an inclination in our mechanical minded communities to give the credit in the building of the first skyscraper, the Auditorium Building, on a swamp, by the firm of Adler & Sullivan to Adler, the engineer. Quite false. If Adler had refused to solve the problem for his design he [Note: N-YHS handwritten addition: \"Sullivan\"] would have solved it himself - a skyscraper with no foundation tostand on too it was, built on a swamp, on a raft [Note: N-YHS handwritten addition: \", the precursor of Wright's Japan building]. In this - Our Own House - widely publicized at the time, is the prototype of the glass office building which came before the public a quarter of a century later. A creative concept once attained grows and spreads. It is a seed planted. The house is germinal in other ways, a half story house. It antedated present methods of heating but why waste a whole story on furnace and fuel. So the basement is limited to the area of the Page 710 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 44 ====] living room which is a story and a half [Note: N-YHS handwritten addition: \"high\"] above it. The perforated concrete tracery frieze around the living room continues around the whole house forming theentire fenestration of the bed rooms making them secluded even when the windows back of them are open. This form of wall is not expensive, the pattern, repeated, brings the cost to that of a normal wall but in feeling it is exquisite. We have an instance in an incinerator building in Australia where the whole outer wall is ornament in rich variety to illustrate the 4 ethers, the formative forces - warmth, light, sound and life (or magnetism) - and it cost no more to build than an ordinary brick building. Thestructural units are larger than bricks making the erection economical - the Pyrmont Incinerator. In the Griffin house, solid on the ground, advantageous in every respect, are conservatory, dining room and kitchen. Up a half a story, the lofty studio living room; the hall of the bedrooms a half story above forming a balcony for the assembly room. Here piano and orchestra can play leaving the floor space clear for dance and other entertainment. This house closes the vista as you enter Trier Center by Alles Street. The connection with Bertling Lane is a circular safety park which could be treated as shown with a pool or with a fountain for dog, horse and man.

No outbuildings are to be allowed outside restricted court garden limits indicated in the original plan.Hedges and wire fences will be the reliance for separating the private gardens so far as isolation is desired by any families. The low walls indicating the demarcation between private garden and public forecourts are part of the original construction and an important factor in unifying the treatment of the thoroughfare spaces and bringing down in height the connecting with the earth of the building features of the whole garden scheme. The street leading into the tract from the west and the lane leading through it are formally set off by the terminal public parks and the approaches from each direction are closed by buildings which will be correspondingly accentuated in their architectural relationship with the remaining houses, as in the case of the first one of the herewith illustrated. Such necessary accessories as light fixtures will be made appropriate garden elements, a possibility exemplified in the stone lanterns of Japan. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 50 ====] TRIER CENTER . Walter Burley Griffin In the effort to make our communities attractive the most important element is the home of the average man on the average lot and its placing in relation to the natural scenery. All other structures, however impressive in themselves, are incidental to the aggregate multitude of homes and have small effect comparatively. The very littleness and multiplicity of the units of this character that go to make up the effect necessitates the greatest care in keeping each modestly unobtrusive in itself and in doing all it can to avert the disaster of monotonous staccato repetition of self-sufficient pettiness on the one hand or, on the other, the confusion from rival efforts of each to distract the attention from the others and to attract it to itself after the manner of the old-time hackman [Note: hackney carriage driver] of rival hotels at the station or thevulgar, intermittent flashing signs of a \"Great White Way.\" Subordination - The types of individual detached structures that will make the country suburb restful must tend toward subordinating itself to the fullest extent possible to the native beauty and verdure which its invasion on other terms utterly destroys. Here is a case where a block frontage made up of wood and glade of especial attractiveness has previously been undisturbed and where this house is thefirst step in an attempt to preserve the natural characteristics of these features without reducing the proportion of building to grounds that real estate conditions in the community require, since the buildings are being erected for the market. Local conditions demanding a high basement rendered reasonable a high-capped terrace connection for the proposed structures, helping to tie them into one group as well as to mitigate the otherwise emphaticheight of each structure. Material - A single material and treatment will serve to further tie them together and as the material which needs least paraphernalia of protective features or connective expedients the one nearest and Page 712 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 51 ====] most resembling Nature's solid rock, of itself withstanding the storm and capable of supporting a bower of vine, shrub and flower, monolithic concrete has been adopted. For satisfactory design in this material, as in any other, the possibilities of its nature must be sought directly and developed accordingly with consistency avoiding irrelevancies and superfluities. Concrete may be assumed to demand a simple way of construction, with repeated use of the same molds and with large masses contrasting with plastic decorative elements. Walls accentuated with projecting overhanging vine garden features and a concrete roof that will support grass and flower plots are made the most of as a roof terrace garden surrounding a second story verandahelping to afford to that necessary contrivance the maximum enjoyment by day, in its airy station looking out in the four directions and catching the slightest breeze, and of rest at night in isolation and privacy from the remainder of the house as well as from the grounds. Similarly, the elevated veranda of the house to the south, next to be built, will be immediately accessible from the entrance for day use and privately from the bedrooms for the purpose of outdoor sleepingcompartment, though in other respects and plans it will be as radically different as the respective sites - the first in the open and the second in the woods. Arrangements - In the house illustrated, the rooms are on one floor, giving the advantage of a flat for ease of housekeeping. The Stairway and hall are so grouped [Note: N-YHS substitutes \"arranged\"] as to give independence of access to the various departments - living rooms, kitchen, sleeping quarters. Thewhole of a flat roof is utilized. The stairway is so placed as to make the roof accessible from out of doors or from any of the departments below without passing through any other, while by the shifting of one hall door between the two casings provided for it, one important isolated room can be transformed from a retired bedroom into a [Note: ==== Beginning of page 52 ====] reception room, library or office at the entrance. By a somewhat similar change at the rear hall a maid's room can be made to accommodate part of the family. These varied adaptations are especially important for investment houses where exact family requirements can least of all be specified. Interest Aroused - That there is no lack of keen interest and delight in a straightforward attempt at the solution of an architectural problem is evidenced by the procession of people who come to visit any such building in the course of its construction, individuals frequently returning week after week to watch its various stages of progress; and also by the warm affection and watchful care of occupants after completion. It seems also to be the fact that such a house built for sale can be disposed of with facility. The residences are sometimes sold long before completion, while still crude for lack of all thosefeatures which add so much to the grace of a finished structure. Page 713 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe unfortunate conception that we can give style to our buildings by copying motives developed in former times has had a most deadening influence on our builders and has resulted in buildings so lacking in interest that we have curiously been led to believe that our people are lacking in appreciationof art. The contrary is the case. The refusal of people to be interested in the meaningless, borrowed trappings of former civilizations in an effort to pretend quality and culture shows accuracy of judgment and a true sense or the beautiful, for art consists only in doing well what needs to be done. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 53 (table of contents) ====] MODEL OF TRIER CENTER [Note: ==== Beginning of page 54 ====] No.2 For this Trier Center group a whole series of new and charming types of minimum cost houses dropped from Griffin's pencil but unfortunately his call to Australia prevented them from being carried into execution. They all gave more to the client than the routine cheap houses and all were beautiful and hadindividual character. The interior parks were not needed here for Trier Center is adjacent to the school group of open grounds and play fields of the Trier Center school group. So the area can afford to be completely a housing scheme the alternated setting forward and back of the houses giving open view in the 4 directions. Here the revolution in house design becomes impressive, every dwelling being unique and lovely as a littletemple. In endless variety minimum cost dwellings were turned out by Walter Burley Griffin always with perfection of form and planting of grounds. Corner fenestration was initiated, installed and widely used by him but never with the barrenness which makes that type so generally used now look like folks with their front teeth knocked out.

The neighborhood takes its name from the elaborate development the past year of the adjacent New Trier High school into a complete domestic social center for the entire township where in quadrangular grouping, with a park and garden setting, besides the play grounds and game fields, are provided restaurant, auditorium, theatre, gymnasia and natatorium, additional to the full educational equipment,recognizing a new function which our public school buildings have begun to assume to make them count for the older members of the family as well as the children. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 57 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . TRIER CENTER [Note: The print caption beneath the illustration reads (in part): \"First House Designed for Trier Center\".] [Note: ==== Beginning of page [58] ====] CAPTION This house is one of a series of thirty-five small fireproof cottages that represent an attempt to demonstrate some of the advantages of recently developed practical and esthetic principles for the layoutof small home groups. Among these advantages, besides the generally saving in wholesale building operation, especially for fireproof structures, are: Greater utilization of the ground and openness of view, first through clustering together and thus concentrating the public thoroughfare and service functions of the house to leave wider, freer ground space for private use and preservation of the rural character; secondly, by arrangingthe clusters with respect to each other to give vistas from all principal rooms extending over at least two unobstructed lots in each direction; thirdly, in the combination and composition of units of simplest form, single little houses, into picturesque or formal designs, using connecting walls and hedges with tree and shrub backgrounds to help convert each house that alone would be an unmitigated box into an appropriate link of a rambling, cozy, private community home of separated wings, bays and pavilions,such as might constitute the dream of the useless overgrown Castle in Spain toward which each of us is so often selfishly and aristocratically inclined. In this unit house we have a large assembly room serving for living and dining. The floor is solid on the ground. The veranda is on the roof. The plan shows an extension of the same type with bed room and bath added to the veranda on the roof which is partly open garden and partly roofed with a desk at thewindow sill height. Page 715 of 923 Supplement to of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 59 ====] That there may be no loss and may be much gain in abandoning the so-called artistic method and rationally accepting conditions and scheming treatment in accordance, was interestingly illustrated in the first typical group plan I saw worked out - in arrangement of four houses to a block the one arrangementby Frank Lloyd Wright leaving practically the whole of the yards to the street frontage, giving no privacy and necessitating long drives and walks for access to the houses. The disadvantage of such an arrangement was recently again brought to mind while passing through Victoria British Columbia, when a friend stated that she could not be induced to build her home in a district considered to be the most attractive in the city and supposedly ideally laid out but where, as she expressed it, all your living was inthe eye of the public. FOUR HOUSES TO A BLOCK . HOUSES IN CENTER As we go further from a metropolis we may have larger acreage, say 4 allotments to a block. At one time this problem was set for a group of architects to consider as a generalization. One, thinking entirely from the picture point of view, established as a type the placing of the houses back in the center of theblock. That there may be no loss but much gain in abandoning the so-called idealistic method and rationally accepting conditions and scheming treatment in accordance can be shown by a comparison. With the houses grouped in the center, practically the whole of the yards are opened to the street giving no privacy and necessitating long drives and walks for access to the houses. Thinking bearing [Note: N-YHS substitutes: \"Bringing to bear\"] an appreciation of outdoor conditions led Griffin to a reversalof this four house scheme, building on the corners instead of the center of the blocks. You will see the advantage of looking at the problem not simply as an architect but as landscape architect. For the architectural effect we still get at each street intersection, and where it will be much more effective for the occupants themselves as well as for community effect, for a consciousness of humanity adds greatly to the interest of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 60 (table of contents) ====] FOUR HOUSES TO A BLOCK . ALTERNATE SCHEMES [Note: ==== Beginning of page 61 ====] nature if constructive and not destructive, man's hand supplementing and enriching nature. No private roadways are necessary for access, saving expense and adding space for gardens and playgrounds. The temptation for men and children to cut across the corners of the lot is eliminated. By placing the service quarters next the street the desirable outlooks are reserved for the living rooms of the house, none of the private space being required for service quarters which are amply provided with light and air from the public streets. The living rooms thus look upon a private stretch unintersected by Page 716 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoroadway, an effective park for use in common if so desired or, if subdivided by hedges, according utter privacy for each family while still maintaining the quite parklike character and offering opportunity for the play of the young people away from the danger and distractions of the street. Since both house andnature are three dimensional, the feeling of spaciousness is their prime requisite. Special conditions may, of course, call for variations of this arrangement. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 62 ====] A PLEA FOR LIBERTY . Walter Burley Griffin To improve our conditions requires change. The question is, what changes in our methods will open the doors to the greatest and most rapid progress? In reviewing European communities we find the greatest progress in architecture, the nearest approach to solution of domestic requirements is found in that community which has fewest governmental restrictions. If an architect is to solve a problem, he must be free to break away from established methods. Architects should therefore be responsible for their work and that responsibility should not be shifted. Especially inefficient is the removing of that responsibility to a Board by which system it is impossible to locate responsibility. Experience shows that an architect who attempts to do a model house is seriously hampered and usually totally prevented from carrying out such work, because the very fact that it is different means that it will not be passed by the authorities in control. This consequence is the very essence of the system of governmental restriction of building, since bodies politically constitutedcan lay down rules only by reference to and in accordance with what has been done and is the custom to do. We find, therefore, that we are compelled to build residences that are too large, too cumbersome, and too expensive. The net result when individual family accommodation cannot be provided at cost within means of those to be provided, is that these are overcrowded in the accommodation allowed. The real problem of course is not concerned with better housing which is beyond the means of the people concerned, but with making opportunity for sufficient means for these people to have proper housing. As long as the land owners can raise the rent to correspond with the improvement of any locality, there is small advantage to be derived from our efforts.

Their [Note: i.e., Americans'] tasks today are to construct and their field as individuals is the world.What the Gods have given us we are under obligation to share with humanity, with the world. It is for us to free humanity for we alone are free human beings. Only individuals can do this for the Christ broke up all peoples and races giving the individual spirit, the Ego, the Light, to every man in the world. Democracy is as important as the smashing of the atom. Unless democracy is applied to humanity as a whole the power released in the atom will become demonic and destroy humanity. Only in America hasit been experienced. In democracy [Note: N-YHS adds: \"found only in the United States\"] the Spirit of the Human is released as in Atom-smashing the Spirit of Matter is released. In this physical experiment the 20th century has fulfilled its basic task with the dual law - that of up and down, inside and outside, force and form - where, in the realm of manifestation, you can't have one without the other. The reality of matter is form and nothing else. The smashing of the atomic form freesthe spiritual forces of matter. They are not things that can be weighed and measured except in terms of force. Thus do the Orient and the Occident meet. The reason why America won the war and will win the peace is because the strength and power of the individual is recognized and given full play. The first step was to escape from the rest of the world - the Eastern world, the Asiatic continent of which Europe is but a state and to establish a communityorganization in which no individual nor group had power over another, a community whose basic principle is EQUITY. There are many lovely and wonderful people elsewhere in the world but they arehelpless. Migration to America frees their spiritual forces. That is the magic of the United States. The founders of the Congressional System smashed the political atom which holds the rest of humanity in bondage. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 64 ====] The immediate task of Americans now is to go out individually to every part of the world - emigrate instead of immigrate the watchword - and break down the bondage of individuals everywhere. It is a difficult but not impossible task. It is the task of pathfinders. The following tale is the story of one such American. He found individuals wherever he went who leaped to help him blaze the way in this bitter battle against the Powers.

Walter Burley Griffin BUILDING RECORDS LIFE Buildings are the most subtle, accurate and enduring records of life - hence their problems are the problems of life and not problems of form;- but through the forms and material of buildings we can gain an insight into the life of the past. In many cases that is now our only approach and, where archeology and history have afforded a check, I like to believe that buildings convey the most truth of the mental and spiritual states of various peoples and times. In the aggregate the architecture of a people certainly represents the greatest amount of human effort applied to the realization of purely human ideals. MODERN ARCHITECTURE LIFELESS In our own times, of which we have of course the most complete history, the decadence, almost atrophy, of the art of architecture since the Middle Ages in Europe points to some analysis of life as necessary to the formulation of the problems of building. Roman history offers the only parallel to such loss of the creative instincts and the substitution of imitation and ostentation for sincerity and invention. Thosetimes were sordid and prepared the doom of Western civilization. With similar failure in our architectural expression for over 400 years it may be worth our while to consider why our ideals are lacking constructive results in the one art that is based on common and general impulse. The great significance of the architecture of our times is that it is not only for the man in the street but necessarily by and of the average man. Alone amongst the arts, Architecture denies to the genius of theman ahead of his time the very forms, colors, notes or words with which to express his ideals or to blaze a path for the masses. The masses must painfully grope out their own uncertain way. Even the artisan has little chance to put on the extra touch or express his feeling in his work because he is limited to the market [Note: ==== Beginning of page 67 ====] which only a mass popularity will afford for economic mass production. We cannot get away from the fact that we are immersed in a democratic and economic age, democratic probably because economic. LIFE DOMINATED BY SCIENCE For 300 years intellectual curiosity has absorbed the best part of man's energy. The results of scientific investigation have been so progressively startling that we have become more and more mentally conceited, individually detached from the world as a creation, from our own sub-conscious minds, from the common universal mind and from religion and art in which the emotions play as great a part as the intellect. Robbed of the aggressive and inquisitive independent intellect the cults of religion and art have Page 719 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagodeteriorated to timid routine sanctioned by orders and precedents and controlled by rules and regulations, and relying on these sanctions and rules for the economic support of the scientific and practical man who is not interested in the intangible or the unproven. The dwindling of creative architecture and the deprivation of new beauties on the earth for so many years is not the worst side of the picture, for there has been active destruction going on - not only in the inevitable breaking up of old idols but in the wanton despoliation of nature. Nature has come to be regarded primarily as a field of economic exploitation, and its beauty considered only in the few cases where this beauty can be exploited profitably. In a world dominated by individual curiosity, success and arrogance the marvels of inorganic and organic creation are being ruthlessly converted into transitory expedients of personal aggrandizement and physical stimuli and the upshot of such a process must be a quarried world of rank weeds and domestic pests on the one hand and, on the other hand, a few useful but diseased, dependent, degenerate plants and animals tamed and cowed. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 68 ====] THE ADVANTAGE OF SCIENCE It must be admitted that the modern age has been useful, if it can provide the foundation for a freer life for succeeding generations. The scope for imagination is a hundred-fold greater than at any time in history. A squad of men with mechanical equipment can perform feats of construction in a year worthy of centuries with legions of workers before. If, as has been stated, our average man, woman and childnow have at their disposal physical force equal to some twenty slaves then, as compared with former civilizations based on six serf power to one free man, our powers for self expression are in the aggregate six times or 120 times as great for destruction or construction. SHORTCOMINGS OF SCIENCE What a pity that the monument to this power, so far, exists in our cities all alike dirty, monotonous, disorderly and desolate, with their conscious pretensions and reiteration of the commonplace and the lifeless forms of antiquity. I hope and believe we are not satisfied with this as the final product of science. The great scientists themselves have about come to the end of their pursuit of matter, in the elusive electron most intelligibly characterized in a citation by Henri Poincare as the \"Hole in the ether.\" Just as geographical discovery has now been thrown back onto archeology so, I anticipate, will thepioneering spirits that have evolved physical science turn back, perhaps by way of psychological experiments, to the great mental substratum of mankind which underlies the individual conscious intellect. There is certainly sufficient evidence of the unconscious mind to satisfy the most inductive and empirical experimenter and, considering the completeness with which the whole of mankind has been convertedby the pioneers of science in three centuries, a wider awakening to the disused powers of the universal mind need not take long. Page 720 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 69 (table of contents) ====] FLAT BUILDING . Walter Burley Griffin [Note: ==== Beginning of page [69-2] / 69 (typescript) ====] The people of today are uneasy, straining at their limitations, whether or not they realize that those restrictions are self-imposed on their natural activities. Satisfaction dependent on external stimuli, such as movies, jazz, speedways and acrobatics, is bound to be short lived; these betray a craving for emotional satisfaction which can never be attained except through feelings in sympathy with rather than opposed to practical needs and experience. REVERSION TO FULLER LIFE Such satisfaction can be found through social consciousness on the one hand and aesthetic appreciation on the other. The present hectic state can only bring about quick exhaustion but it contains a certain spontaneity and so much less hypocrisy than the intellectual, puritanical pretension of only a few years back that it may betoken the turning point from a purely intellectual outlook and timid repression back toa broader psychological and emotional contact with life. After passive simian curiosity has been satisfied in the pioneers of thought, and after economic strain on the underlying humanity has been eased by the expedients of practical followers of science then, when the physical senses have become calloused to excitement, more and more men will be turning their attention inward to the possibilities of co-operation between the head and the heart in social service and creative effort. The scientific beliefs of our intellectual philosophy, which have failed to develop an organic communal life, have been inconsistent or fundamentally in conflict with an enduring civilization. We have come to recognize an external natural order of things which we see, hear, touch, smell and taste and consider real, but such a world of isolated, individual intellect supplies no place for instinctive ideals or desires such as justice or beauty; and if the supernatural or divine world once conceived by us to support thoseideals [Note: ==== Beginning of page 70 ====] has lost its reality we must find something else that will. Perhaps the pioneers who have for some years been exploring the complexities and conditions for the full-rounded, healthy working of the human mind or soul may be evolving a practical religion compatible with modern objective science taking into account, without the prop of external agencies, mankind's vast subjective activities, desires and needs. ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS I submit some simple equations to indicate basic elements in our problems of life. The factors are indicated by wide general terms instead of a, b and x and are arranged in three columns under the Page 721 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagorespective generalizations of ethic, economic and aesthetic. A tangible category for social relationships might be as follows for these three columns:- a (Ethic) b (Intellectual) (Economic)x (Aesthetic) COMMON (emotions)INDIVIDUAL(concepts)OBJECTIVE(satisfaction) Instinct Senses Existence Nature Man Life Peoples Persons Society Society Science Institutions Public Institutions Private Instituti ons State Public Needs Private Effort Commodity Land Labor Wealth The Unconscious The Conscious The Imagin ative Love Justice Religion Responsibility Industry Art Instinct Oral Sense Harmony Visual Sense Pattern, Beauty Memory Literature Memory and Action Drama Memory and Sound Poetry Memory and Sight Painting Memory and Touch Sculpture Time Technique Music Space Technique Architecture It is hardly possible to boil life down into twenty or two hundred formulae that might pop into one's head, but it is astonishing how the lack of differentiation between, or the omission of, one or the other of these simple factors has left such unsolved equations in fundamental human problems that we have failed to attain a happier objective. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 71 ====] NATURAL LIFE BEFORE ARCHITECTURAL GROWTH It is but natural for each of us to rank high in importance the particular field of work on which he happens to be employed. It is also right, and necessary to his self-respect, to make it possible that all the multifarious duties in the world be discharged. In the measure that a man speaks truthfully he conveys his own perspective of the universe with the things in his foreground looming largest. However, as already pointed out, architecture is an inescapable expression and revelation of and to all mankind, and one's relation to it is an index of his individuality. It is therefore really important to the Page 722 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofundamental self-respect of everyone of us to study life from the perspective point of the architect. In the future as sure as fate our purposes, our strength, our insincerities, our foibles will be an open book in the remains or ruins of our buildings. The record is not only qualitative but quantitative as the lastresultant of all our physical powers. Up to the present day - to attempt to discuss this subject without illustrations would be a waste of time but we all witness now so many miles of pictures weekly that it is unnecessary to portray the fact - the monotony of the modern environment is not merely here but everywhere. The isolated relics of earlier art as well as the unique variations in races of men and genera of plants and animals are being obliteratedin the ubiquitous standardized product of our building art. It is significant that not until the modern intellectual age of renaissance did we hear much of anything about architects, and it is not to the architects that we go to learn architecture now, even in the schools where the cult is taught, but ultimately to the unidentified origin back in the naive, subconscious creative periods when art was not in conflict with the surrounding natural world nor a reflex of internal strife.

Walter Burley Griffin [Note: ==== Beginning of page 75b ====] CAPTIONThis structure illustrates Griffin's freedom from the domination of the past and his genius for economy. The revolution in [Note: Frank Lloyd] Wright's designs with the coming in of Griffin did not end with the [Note: Frank W.] Thomas house which was lifted up out of the ground. I myself realized later that Wright was quick on the uptake. The [Note: Isidore] Heller house which was on the boards when I entered like the [Note: William H.] Winslow house was the old colonial plan. In a bit of free time Idesigned a house for my family in Hubbard Woods where we children had grown up. It was a long narrow oblong with an octagonal room flanking on either side near the front. The next Wright house Page 723 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowas that plan - the [Note: Joseph and Helen] Husser House - but two squares instead of the octagons. I thought nothing of that till years later Wright began his publications claiming all the young Chicago Architects as his disciples, which was far from the truth. I would grant that what one likes one can use -as on the growth of Gothic - but cannot claim. [Note: The William A. Storrer Catalog Numbers (3rd edition, 2002) for the Wright buildings are: Thomas House - S.067; Heller House - S.038; Winslow House - S.024; Husser House - S.046. ] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 76 ====] [Note: Continued from page 71] BACK TO NATUREThe definite idea of architecture to my mind lies in the organic, systematic way of creation that nature shows in fitting an infinite variety of means to as many ends with perfection of form for every function - to recall Louis Sullivan's alliteration:- \"Form follows Function.\" Communion with primeval nature is the common school for future architects that it was in the beginning of civilization when everywhere in every race and every climate anonymous architects expressed fitness and beauty in their constructions. Nowhere in the modern world have the conditions set a more attractive problem for the architect than in the wooded rock ledges of the headlands of Sydney Harbor - a nice problem, for the factors are definitely clear-cut and simple socially, economically and aesthetically:- a million people free to exercise their own judgment, economically able to provide themselves with fully equipped and appointedsubstantial homes with a beautiful, easily worked stone and underlying their sites and all other building materials indigenous, and all skill and equipment, handy, and the most, beautiful outlook possible to imagine complete to start with. The aesthetic requirements are modesty to the extent of subordination of structural features to the striking characteristics of the forested cliffs, using the stone and level coursing uniform with them thatwill accomplish this, and a diminutive scale of one story that can accord with the diminutiveness of natural forms without breaking with the established habits and accepted type plans. After a hundred years during which every alternative has been introduced from every corner of the earth this natural formula is now being tried out at Castlecrag in Sydney Harbor.

This dwelling of Mr. [Note: William F.] Tempel has this formality. In this case the living room is on the ground level and thus becomes a story and a half high and the dining room becomes a balcony of the living room. It is hard to express in words the elegance and openness of such an arrangement. Even a small house can become impressively spacious. Griffin completely solved the problem of a floor built solidly on the ground by embedding 2 by 1 1/2 floor joists in an asphalt pavement and laying the floor boards directly on this asphalt. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 79 ====] Caption Griffin in his early work - American - was really classic though strictly 20th Century, no imitation of the older Classic style, but formal and balanced. When handling the lovely valleys of Castlecrag his works were often romantic, as indeed were the Capitol Theatre and the Cafe Australia of Melbourne. In India he became what a 20th Century man should be - a free individual no longer under the control of the Folk Soul - and his work there covered a wide range of designs, continually creating new styles soto speak - as Mr. [Note: Talbot Faulkner] Hamlin of the Columbia University said - \"uniquely original.\" NATIONAL BANK .

But the sleep that knows no waking Chilled the gentle maiden's breast, And the Brave, all hope forsaking, Laid her in the hill to rest -Laid her where the mind may wander Far o'er slopes and ledges steep, And the mind on billows ponders, ponders - Billows grand, but locked in sleep. Then the brave's bold eye was darkened, And his hand forgot the bow; Naught to human speech he harkened; Naught but sorrow would he know. Frozen was his heart of gladness As the summits capped with snow;Dark his soul with sullen sadness As their cavern depths below.

All his life it hurt him to have flowers picked, hurt him as itdoes others to see a bird's wing broken, an absorbing love that enabled him to recognize new flowers in the field that he had read about in encyclopedias years before, the absorbing interest that develops the absolute memory. This memory in later years enabled him, in a new country with a different monetary system and utterly different prices of materials (after one day and night spent with a contractor going over prices of all building materials), to go on the witness stand quite ready to answer any questionswith definite statements as to current prices. As a little boy in school, teased and bullied by bigger boys, he decided that if he cried when they hurt him it would amuse them to keep up their torments so he never cried no matter what they did. They soon quit bothering him. In manhood no one could disturb his equanimity. I have seen him go through torments that have driven other men into rages of fury with blood-shot eyes, that have thrown themquite off their balance; but they never got under his skin, they never disturbed the sweetness of his disposition, they were never to wear him out as he could have been worn if he had allowed his emotions to be roused. When eleven years of age he received a pamphlet from the U.S. Government doubtless intended for his father. It was one of Henry George's. He read it and decided on the first book he would draw from thelibrary. A year later, for in those days children couldn't draw books till they were twelve, he drew out George's Social Science. The problems of humanity then became his problems and with the thorough grounding of one of the masters of Economics he looked at life with the clear eyes of one building on firm foundations, distinguishing between man-made and God-made things. Possibly this early contact with [Note: Henry George (1839-1897) was an American land reformer and economist who advocated a single tax on the value of land in his 1879 book \"Progress and Poverty.\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 85 (table contents) ====] ESTELLE GRIFFIN .

So great may be the influence of the opening of a spiritual door toa youthful mind. So great may be the service of the adult to the juvenile. A tow-headed, blue eyed suburban child whose boyhood life was redeemed somewhat by the fact that the suburb [Note: Maywood and Elmhurst, Illinois] was not very extensive in those days making possible long walks in the open fields, occasionally to the river banks, though thoroughly conventional and timid parents forbad swimming. A child's instinctive recognition of its rights and of the necessity ofindependence in certain realms brought a fair number of plunges in the river swimming pools. Interest early turned to building and the first work executed was the lantern on the roof of his father's barn. From the very first as shown in his first real job - Mr. [Note: Thomas E.] Wilder's barn - his creative capacity satisfied with nothing short of perfection was masterly and had a dominating and revolutionary effect on the work of the office of Frank Lloyd Wright with whom he entered intopartnership in the early days of that office, as illustrated by the dwelling of Mr. Little in Oak Park and the Larkin Building in Detroit [Note: Buffalo]. His fertility in design in architecture as in town planning has not been matched by anything since the days of Louis Sullivan who broke the ice for creative work in modern times. While still in the grades the key scheme for the city plan was worked out. His clear insight probing to fundamentals led him straight to the basic solution of the double problem of communication and occupation the simultaneous consideration of which like all unities has for so many centuries eluded the mind of man. So long do we humans shuffle along on the surface of the earth and fail to enter the spiritual kingdom where problems are solved. Not so our young dreamer of dreams. [Note: The William A.

Evidently holding that simple faith, though in those early days with no conscious analysis of it, at 20 years of agea sturdy young man went to his state University and demanded a course in Town Planning. No University in the world gave such a course.

They told him that if he found six others who would take such a course they would create it for him. He found three others and the course of Town Planning was established in theUniversity of Illinois at Champaign to be followed in the next quarter of a century - after the Australian Federal Capital adventure - by the establishment of courses in Town Planning in many Universities in many countries. Unfortunately the field is still largely controlled by land speculators.

Father and Mother met in the great fertile Mississippi Valley. In the following Mother jotted down notes of early days. Illustration - Drawing of my Grandmother and her Great Grandchild, Eleanor, drawn by Eleanor's Mother, Lucy Fitch Perkins. [Note: The text regarding the illustration is crossed out in both the New-York Historical Society and Art Institute of Chicago copies.] Notes jotted down by my mother - Clara Hamilton Mahony. What a strange combination of circumstances it was over a hundred years ago that brought together that little colony from New England, England, the South, Canada and the West Indies and planted them inTazewell County, Illinois, in a spot on its great prairies of waving grass far from any river, sea-cost or mountains to charm the eye or to give promise of a great city rising out of that ocean of grass. In the canal boat that carried its precious load of venturesome dreamers were the young doctor, Augustus Perkins, and his bride, Mary, the English scholar, the Kentucky Colonel, the dashing young teacher Colonel James with his wife and beautiful daughter and young son, Quaker Wilson and hiswife, Doctor's brother and wife, a German tinner, two sea captains with families, a banker and, in a short time members of father's and mother's families and other interesting people. On that boat was also a young peasant girl quiet and watchful who on the boat's stopping ran to the wharf and was going to get off when the captain told her this was Ashton. \"Ashton,\" she said, \"I thought it was Corpus Christi Page 730 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoand here it is this damned place.\" The members of that colony were of the sterling kind, educated, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 91 ====] refined and of course courageous and with all the elements that make for success. They had their dreams. They divided the land off into lots, parks, and located public buildings all on paper - all a fizzle, but hardly a family that did not make its mark in the history of Illinois. Four or five died millionaires - not made in Tremont though, and in law and statesmanship many became distinguished. Tremont became the county seat so the brilliant men of the county, like our great [Note: Abraham] Lincoln, Judge [Note: David]Davis, [Note: Stephen A.] Douglas and others were often entertained by our good peoplethough they could not claim them as residents. My Mother told me that when the court was in session she often from our house on the hill could hear the men in the court house roar with laughter at the stories they were telling at two or three o'clock in the morning. All know of Lincoln's gift of story telling and my father could almost match him. The ladies were noted for their refinement, intellect and good cooking. Folks from the neighboring cities flocked to our town when an entertainment was given for they gave us credit for knowing how to entertain after the grand manner. Let me describe one of the banquets. Daniel Webster was reported on his way West and that he would stop in Tremont. All went to work. The Town Hall must be decorated. One of the residents was an East Indian sea captain. He had silks and tapestries that he kindly lent and the ladies used them in decorating. All that had cut glass or silver lent it. At one end of the table theCaptain's solid silver set that had been presented by grateful passengers for carrying them through a terrible storm safely, and at the other end another set of the same kind - tray, teapot, sugar bowl, etc. The ladies saw to it that the tables were loaded with tempting food and they were dressed in silks and satins that they had brought to the wilderness in their chests. It was a brilliant affair but the most memorable speech was made by old captain Wybray. I must give you a short sketch of him. He ran [Note: ==== Beginning of page 92 (table of contents) ====] GRANDFATHER AUGUSTUS PERKINS, M.D. GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOVEJOYMARION MAHONY . self portrait [Note: In the New-York Historical Society copy the illustrations are arranged somewhat differently from the order listed in the table of contents.] Page 731 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 93 ====] away from his home in England and hid in a ship. He rose step by step until he became captain. He was unlettered but a born poet. It was a great treat when his family received letters from him to hear them.Often there would be pages in rhyme. At the banquet when he went to welcome Webster with his little wife on his arm - he was a big man - his words were something of this description. \"I have been around the world several times, I have bowed before kings and queens on their thrones, but never with the heart thrill that Love felt in shaking the hand of our illustrious Daniel Webster.\" Webster was one of my Mother's [Note: MMG's grandmother's] heroes. Father [Note: MMG's grandfather] hurt her keenly once. When she had been extolling him father said - \"but he never paid your father the hundred he owed him.\" Father had to humbly beg her pardon. One summer father sent her East to visit old friends and relatives and while visiting at Mr. Webster's his niece said wouldn't you like a lock of Uncle Daniel's hair? He was writing at his desk when his niece went back of him and cut quite a generous lock. While that was happening as he probably had heardwhat she had said he wrote mother a little note sending his regards to grandfather, etc. On coming home mother found so many wanted \"just a few hairs\" that she would have no lock left so with the note she had it framed and gave it to her eldest grandson, Dwight H. Perkins. (That and one from Lincoln are still treasured by the family. Another from Lincoln was stolen from the walls of grandson Leslie's living room.) Mr. Lincoln was a frequent visitor at our house and my mother he admired and honored. When he was made president he remembered his friends of old Tremont. Mr. [Note: David] Davis of Bloomington who was a frequent guest at Tremont he made a judge of the Supreme Bench [Note: Court]. John Albert Jones, who used to walk five or ten miles before breakfast and drank from ten to fifteen cups of tea at the parties, he made judge of the Court of Claims, my father, Brigade Surgeon in the Civil War. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 94 ====] As these pages are written just for my own family I think here is a good place to speak of father. The beautiful picture of Dr. MacLure in Bonny Brier Bush stories has been thought of by some as an impossibility in fact. The author was asked to answer the question. He said - \"It has been my good fortune to know your country doctors, not one of them without faults but who each one of them might have sat for my hero.\" Father from a little boy seemed cut out for a doctor. He was born in Hopkinton, New Hampshire, and Mother in Sanbornton. Grandfather Lovejoy was its richest man, had his 25 wagons plodding the roads to Boston and lived in the finest mansion in Sanbornton. He failed, went to Toronto when father and mother were married and from there joined the colony that went West to Illinois. Grandfather put what was left of his fortune into a beautiful farm on Rock River. Father is happily described by Mrs. [Note: Eliza W.] Farnham, one of the early woman suffragists and friend of Lucy Stone and Susan B. Anthony, who in her book called \"Life in Prairie Land,\" said he was another Dr. MacLure. I loved my father dearly and never dreamed anyone could speak of him disrespectfully so I was indignant when a mother, after hours of agony, was reported as saying - \"Some say mean things of you but no one could equal you when a woman is in travail.\" Page 732 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoHe often traveled sixty or seventy miles to see a patient and in those days they had no nurses and often no woman to help and father would be gone for days and days. For many years he was the only doctor so he attended the birth of most of the little ones. In all his thirty and more years he never lost a motheror a child. A physician told him that was a most remarkable record, that he should have kept a record. He never kept any kind of books and when he did send in a bill being obliged to pay his own bills, often he would get one back equaling his for vegetables they had put in the back of his buggy, which he never asked for and took for granted were presents, especially as he had one [Note: Eliza Farnham's \"Life in Prairie Land\" was published York in 1846 by Harper and Brothers.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 95 ====] of the finest gardens in the country. He was the life of every gathering and the amusement of the young folks when he danced as he kept perfect time and danced on his toes. His horse he always petted and would talk to it. If he fell asleep the horse would always stop when it came to the gate of a place where somebody had been sick, fatherwould open his eyes, look and say - \"Nobody sick here now Pomp, go along,\" and the horse would move on. I used to love to drive over the country with him, and sometimes he would say - \"Daughter we shall probably take dinner here and they will possibly have a simple meal, just bacon swimming in fat and boiled potatoes, but eat as though you enjoyed it.\" Our home was very pretty, built on the top of a hill opposite the square where the red brick courthouse stood. It had circular walks, latticed porches,pretty garden - and now not a vestige of its former self left except the great hard maple trees that father planted when he built. The old court house that should have been converted into a Hall or Library was torn down. The little town of Tremont had its churches and schools. Generally one resident minister but the pulpits were often filled by the ministers of different cities. Of course the Episcopal Church had to be visitedwhenever it had members that wished confirmation. I will speak of two I knew. Bishop Chase the founder of Jubilee College in or near Bloomington used to come and confirm and to christen. (My brother Leslie graduated from there.) He was gifted but an arbitrary old soul. Once I heard mother say that when he read in the service, \"I am the Lord of Hosts,\" you always felt that was what he considered himself. Bishop Whitehouse was a highly educated polished scholar who, I always felt, must have had atouch of the snob in him or his children would not have been such snobs, but they may have inherited from someone further back. One of has sons came one day into old Dr. Davis' office for attention. The doctor was one of our ablest physicians but a very blunt man and some temper. This day his office, as usual during office hours, was [Note: ==== Beginning of page 96 (table of contents) ====] MARY LOVEJOY PERKINS called Star of the West and her GREAT GRAND DAUGHTER .

He went but in a moment wriggled up to the desk, leaned over and said, \"I don'tbelieve you know who I am. I am Bishop Whitehouse's son.\" \"Damnit, take two seats then.\" He slunk back. In writing of Tremont one must not forget the old Col. James if only to give me a chance to express my gratitude. He left Tremont in its early days and settled in Chicago. Successful in business he had a lovely home. Many remember his grandson, Louis James, who quite distinguished himself on the stage.Col. James' handsome daughter Elizabeth married Thompson Flint who came to Chicago and made his millions in grain here. His wife and mother were always closest friends. But the glory of Tremont is a thing of the past. Captain Wybray's lovely home you would not recognize. Of course there are splendid farms about the town, neat and nice but the charm where? A word of the grand old sea captain. His home a large white mansion in the center of noble trees was noted for itshospitality and refinement. His son, Lawrence Wybray married my beautiful Aunt Sophia and they and the family lived there with the Captain and his dear little wife - a home where all the scattered family could congregate. Two of his sons settled in New Orleans, his lovely daughter Georgine married a rising New Englander who came out West a young man and met his fate and made his fortune finally settling South on a large plantation - sugar. Here I wish I could put in words what I owe that lovedcouple. During the Civil War as my father was sent to Virginia as Brigade Surgeon, I applied and was assigned to one of Chicago's public schools. Every weekend I was made welcome in their lovely home. I remember one Monday morning a fierce storm was raging but I dressed and started out to get a car on State Street. Standing in the middle of the tracks he stood all muffled up directing the street-car men. At that time he was Superintendent of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 98 ====] the street-car lines - I heard a voice - \"Go back Clara, I'll see that you get to the school.\" He never considered himself when he could do anything for a friend. A bride of one of Tremont's rich deserters who had heard him talk of Tremont's glories visited the place and when she failed to find anything interesting she said, \"Show me that pear tree that bore pears, the finest that ever grew. It was found with one pear and that tasteless. She had her opinion! [Note: The text contains no end quotes for the quotation in the paragraph above.] A few character sketches:- A tinner was a German and of course a skilled workman. He made furniture also and though I'm 84 years old, next to my 200 year old mahogany table that crossed the ocean in1700 something, went through two fires and still has the same hinges and castors and is a thing of rare beauty, a table the tinner made for me is still one of the strongest best made articles I have. Father went Page 734 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoin to his shop one morning and he [Note: the tinner] said to him, \"Doctor isn't hell all confuse?\" \"I suppose it is,\" said father. \"Well then my wife is hell for she is all confuse.\" One of the colony was a graceful, handsome, witty, entertaining young man who married a lady very plain but who knew most of everything on every subject of anyone I ever know. She would have made a good Secretary of State. Her husband said she deserved no credit for she couldn't forget. There were five of us children. Mary died when an infant, two other girls and two boys. Of course it was very difficult to get help though father as he went all over the country had better chances than most. But he helped mightily when work piled too high. Sunday was our heaviest day. Father came inlaughing one morning and told us about a little red headed boy calling to him over the hedge, - \"Say Doctor do you like Sundays?\" and father to please him said, \"No.\" \"Nor I nuther,\" said the boy, \"and I don't see why the Lord took the longest day for Sunday.\" [Note: ==== Beginning of page 99 (table of contents) ====] UNCLE LESLIE PERKINS [Note: This illustration does not appear to in the New-York Historical Society copy.] MOTHER CLARA PERKINS MAHONY AUNT MYRA PERKINS [Note: The pictures of Clara and Myra appear on this page in reverse order from their listing in the table of contents.

Father was a fine provider and mother a tip top cook. \"I would drive fifteen miles to get a piece of your lemon pie,\" we heard, and I myself still think they were the best I ever tasted. My father after his long drives and anxious hours of nursing would come into his home and say, \"Mary a strong drop of tea please,\" which Mother would quickly make ready in one of his pretty little tea pots. My brother Leslie had a blooded pup which was the pride of his life. Also it was a winter of bitter cold. I shall never forget the morning I was called by my father to hurry down stairs if I wanted to see my little sister. He declared I didn't touch the stops. Father took Mother in her breakfast and told her whathe had just read in Leslie's journal - \"This has been the darndest week for accidents I ever heard of. Father broke his teapot, my dog Don froze to death and Mother had a baby!\" Illustration - Aunt Myra Perkins - Uncle Leslie Perkins [Note: See the illustrations on page 99.] Page 735 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoMy sister became a very fine performer on the piano. Added to her lovely self, that attracted the young people but that annoyed father so he wrote in big letters \"Short calls make long friends\" and hung it on the mantle. First night two young gents came in and at just midnight they jumped and blew out the lightsand rushed out. There was much good cheer and good feeling but much work, but no one of us ever heard our mother speak angrily or even impatiently, and we were no models. She hadn't father's sense of humor, still she amused us at times describing some caller. I remember a lank washed out young girl sitting by the stove waiting for father to put up a prescription and mother, who was all politeness asked after her father. \"Father is dead, he died of fever.\" \"And your mother?\" \"Oh she is dead too. Died ofhim I guess.\" But I was to tell of the Bloomington dance. They took their finery and wore home suits. When they returned the next day where their log house had been was a pile of ashes. Father had a fine medical library [Note: ==== Beginning of page 101 ====] and surgical instruments. It was a very serious loss to him, even if he had the means, which he had not, to buy more he could not get them in a new country. All Mother's wedding gifts, her entire wardrobe, nothing, nothing left. The town people thought an old codger who used to tramp about the country was burned as they saw bones of a skeleton, but it was a skeleton father had in his study. Dear old Quaker Wilson took Mother in and treated her so lovingly, and father was always cheerful and knew that, with patience, comforts and a home would come again. They had a fine Lyceum for several of the colony could act well, so with gatherings here and there, sleighing parties, dances and plays they had many memorable times. The little town grew but since the Civil war but few are left that have any legends to tell of the early days. One left and went to New York leaving his family six millions, another had a great sugar plantation in Louisiana on the Byou [Note: Bayou] Teche, a region made famous by [Note: Henry Wadsworth] Longfellow. After the house burning Quaker Wilson and his wife took us into their home and their loving care and tenderness could never be forgotten. All the able-bodied men went to work to build a log cabin and the ladies to sewing articles for the doctor's wife Mary. Soon Hamlet, one of father's brothers, came with his bride who though called plain would outshine any young beauty by her grace, intelligence and charm of manner. Aunt Margaret in her happiness saw everything in a rosy light. She wrote to her husband'sbrother, Judge Hamilton Perkins of Concord, New Hampshire, of her romantic life on the Prairie describing herself as reclining on a couch with crimson covering, and other matters in the same glowing colors which caused Uncle Hamilton to say when he later on received a letter from Mother - \"Now we shall get facts as here is a letter from Mary.\" I dare say he learned the truth about things but it would be cheerful, full of hope but facts. He would be able to picture the couch as boards on boxes and coveredwith turkey red. [Note: \"Lyceum\" - The Lyceum movement, named after Aristotle's school in Athens, was an early form of adult education which flourished before the American Civil War.

Little they knew. Uncle Hamilton went into the lumber business up by the Falls of St. Anthony. His house was built on a high place overlooking the falls. The winter had been severe and in order to prevent serious trouble the ice had to be broken. None of the men would risk it so Uncle went to work and soon the great piece he was working on moved and as he stood erect with his arms folded across his chest it quickly moved on by his home from the windows of which his wifeand three children saw him carried over the falls. Years later our Quaker friends, the Wilsons were murdered in their Winnetka home, and as far as I know the murderer is still living unmolested and undisturbed. Mrs. Sawyer, another Tremont character, believed in feeding people so all her life she rose at two or three o'clock and cooked so she could have pies, cakes, meat and hot bread for breakfast. Her son and a young girl she raised used to scrap in theyard and she would raise the window and exclaim, \"Abail Buss and Sara Ann ain't ye ashamed of yourselves!\" The Platt family had a large family of girls all very intelligent but of delicate health. The two eldest were addicted to walking in their sleep. Julia would rise, go out, do all her chores and commence getting breakfast when Uncle Nathan who married the eldest sister would hear her and awaken her. Thetraveling ministers and lecturers often stayed with us while they remained and one night Rev. L. read us a sonnet of [Note: John] Milton's. Not long after Angeline had gone to her bed her mother called to father and said, \"Augustus, Angeline is sitting up in bed and talking a steady stream. Father when he reached her said, \"She is talking in her sleep and is repeating verbatim Milton's sonnet that Mr. L. read. She had never read it nor heard it before and could not repeat any of it when awakened. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 104 ====] Of course some of the colony had some means with them and soon homes appeared but most started in log cabins. Whenever an adjoining town had a dance or a good time all the neighboring towns would endeavor to send representatives. Bloomington, Pekin and Peoria were busy towns.

In this Marshall dwelling the lofty central dining room with its clerestory windows gives a feeling of elegance, and its projecting roof gives shade to a portion of the flat roof and to the roof veranda. One might say this is a flat roof house in its simplest terms. Its very formality makes it not only dignified but beautiful. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 107 ====] COLOR I had an interesting experience. I stood in a doorway in the bright sun, my shadow sharply cast on my light carpet as was also the jamb of the doorway. Presently my attention was arrested by a surprisingthing that happened every time the shadow of my arm came near to the shadow of the door jamb. A big lump almost the size of my fist swelled up on my arm's shadow and reached out till it joined the jamb's shadow. On closer inspection I saw that there was also a smaller lump reaching out from the larger shadow toward that of my arm. I have in only one case found a material scientist who would give any serious attention to this fact or who would offer an explanation of it though all of them are familiar withthe fact of osmosis where one liquid is drawn toward another. Too interested in their theory to pay any attention to facts. In astronomical observations of the transit of Venus the scientists have made the same observations but brushed them aside hoping for better luck next time. It was again a case of darkness attracting darkness - darkness the beginning of matter, the creator of liquidity, exhibits the phenomenon of attraction. For a fascinating exposition of this phenomenon I refer you to the 6th lecture of Dr. RudolfSteiner's series on light.

TEXTURE . COLOR . Walter Burley Griffin First of all it is necessary to understand that all superficial characteristics should be the natural consequence of underlying structural requirements. Honesty is quite as basic a necessity in architectureas in other fields of life. We find here as everywhere that spiritual qualities precede material expression and real and permanent beauties can result only on such a foundation. Thus, to attain beautiful results in architecture there must be no superficial requirements but purely rational ones and the whole effort of the architect must be bent toward the accomplishment of three things:- An absolute solution of the problem resulting from due consideration of all the elements which have any bearing on it; an honest useof materials in accordance with their nature, and perfection of form. The first of these, a solution of the problem, we have been discussing in the previous lessons. The second point is the honest use of materials. There is no necessity nor is it tolerable that any material used in a structure should be made in imitation of any other material. Sham, wherever found, is intensely disagreeable and savors of those classdistinctions we find in undemocratic communities which classify human beings on purely superficial qualifications. All materials in nature are beautiful, and structures will be beautiful if materials are used frankly and treated according to their natural characteristics, and we find, in fact, an infinite variety of perfect structures where it is as impossible to say that one is more beautiful than another as it is to say that one landscape is more beautiful than another, and these structures may be of any material, whether itbe the unbaked mud of Adobe structures of some of the Indian peoples or whether they be of bamboo or stone. The ugliness arises only when we try to twist one material into imitation of another as of wood cut or painted to represent bricks or concrete shaped to imitate stone or any of the other innumerable subterfuges so commonly made use of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 109 (table of contents) ====] EVEN THE TINIEST BUILDING PERFECT .

The [Note: William H.] Winslow house was also under construction which dwelling like the dwellings of most of the Chicago School of Architecture adopted the sill line of the 2nd story windows as adominating factor in the design. A rendered drawing of one of [Note: Robert C.] Spencer's houses was pinned up on Wright's office wall. The Winslow plan was Old Colonial. [Note: The William A. Storrer Catalog Numbers (3rd edition, 2002) for the Winslow house is S.024.] [Note: This page is not in the Art Institute of Chicago copy and is transcribed from the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 111 ====] in our own time. The third requirement is perfection of form. We use this term \"perfect\" in the same way as in speaking of a crystal, that is, the shape should be simple enough to be comprehensible and should be complete. This is as necessary in anything thatpresents itself to the eye as harmony is to whatever presents itself to the ear if it is to separate itself from chaos and appeal to our consciousness as a creation, a structure, a thing - in architecture, a building. Here, as in all the works of man, to have a thing attractive it must emphasize the fact that it is the work of an intelligent creature who has done his work in joy and affection in the full expression of his capacities. We will discuss and consider the honest use of materials. We find the natural building materials most generally used for the shelter of human beings have been stone and wood, but to those from very early times have been added artificial materials, brick, tile and concrete. These are quite distinct in their characteristics and nothing but disadvantage arises from the attempt to make them imitate stone. These artificial materials contrast sharply in their characteristics, thebrick and tile because of the burning necessary in their manufacture must be in small pieces usually much smaller than stone as ordinarily obtained from the quarries. Concrete, on the other hand, has no such restriction and lends itself to massive structure with large unbroken surfaces. When so used it becomes very impressive and quite as beautiful as any other material. In fact, the possibilities in the use of concrete have barely been touched for there is no limitation of the materials with which it can be madeso that its surface effects can vary from the greyish tones of the cement itself to any of the colors of the material with which the cement is mixed, which may be anything from sand to sparkling quartz or exquisite [Note: ==== Beginning of page 112 (table of contents) ====] Page 741 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoMINOR BUILDINGS TRUE TO FORM OF THE GROUP . DOG KENNEL [Note: On the verso is an inscription which reads: \"Even a dog kennel had to have the style & perfection of the house[?]\".] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 113 ====] marble or jewels themselves if there were no restriction of expenditure. Just so, brick if used in accordance to its nature will give any of an infinite variety of results both in texture and in color. In this country scarcely more than two kinds of brick are known but in Europe we find a great range both in size, shape and color in this material, and the last decade or two in the United States have developed bricks whose surfaces vary from smooth polished to soft rich surfaces obtained by cuttingthe bricks with wire and of great range of color from lovely greys through soft or glowing buff or yellow tones to various shades of reds and even of purples. These bricks, with their natural variation in color, give surfaces as lovely and rich as velvet or tapestry. In addition to these main structural elements there are others which are by nature surfacing materials and may be used either for protection or for finish - such stone as can be out in thin layers, as marbles,which may be used either for flooring materials or for the surfacing of walls, exterior or interior, or that form a very serviceable material for making tight air spaces and if properly handled giving a very beautiful surface. Wallpaper, our commonly used cheap substitute for tapestries would better be discarded altogether as far richer effects can be obtained at less cost by omitting the third hard smooth coat of plaster and makingthe 2nd coat of sufficiently coarse material to give an interesting texture to the wall. Without any further treatment, if properly done, this gives very lovely grey tone. On this surface any color scheme desired can be obtained by the use of transparent stains. We can obtain a glowing or velvety tone with a depth and richness not to be attained with any other material except that of woven fabrics. Wood is not a proper structural material since by nature it is bound to change in size and form whatever precautions may be taken in its seasoning. It is, however, a very beautiful material for surface decoration and can therefore be used to advantage in thin [Note: ==== Beginning of page 114 (table of contents) ====] VOLLAND OFFICE . CHICAGO [Note: The New-York Historical Society copy has two illustrations on this page.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 115 ====] strips or in broad surfaces which can be obtained by the process of veneering, here, the movement can be entirely overcome and by the use of our modern tools, the machines, we can get broad surfaces Page 742 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoshowing to full advantage the lovely texture, color and graining of an infinite variety of woods. To bring out to perfection, we should not use complicated forms or thick coating materials such as paint. The finish that is given wood should be only such as is required to preserve it and keep it clean. Whenused for external work, since it is impossible under the circumstances of the weather to keep highly finished surfaces, the most satisfactory method is to use the wood rough as it comes from the saw instead of the paint dressed surfaces so common at present which have to be painted. These rough surfaces can be simply stained by materials which will penetrate enough to act as preservative of the wood yet do not conceal the character of the wood itself. Such stains can be the tones of the wood itselfdeepened only enough to prevent unpleasant results which might arise from the soiling of very light colored woods. So treated wood members used in the trimming of a house as for window frames and sashes and eaves and barge boards are far richer in their effect than any less frank use of the material can possibly be. In the interior, protected as it is from the weather, wood can be used for certain members where it may be desirable to use an easily worked material or where lightness is necessary as in the trimabout windows and doors, for doors themselves and for furniture whether built in or movable, the most charming effect being gained by the use of the same wood and same finish throughout the house or at least throughout a suite of rooms as the living rooms or the bed rooms, and the most beautiful effects will be obtained not by the high hard polishes but by the most transparent stains, just sufficient to emphasize the natural grained wood, rubbed down with just enough wax to keep dirt from penetratingthe wood. This method gives a soft surface scarcely distinguishable from the unfinished wood itself.

Identification is based on a picture from the Eric Milton Nicholls Collection found in the National Library of Australia's \"Pictures Catalogue\" under \"Advanced Search\"(http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/picturescatalogue?mode=advanced).] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 117 ====] The determination of what materials shall be used in any structure is settled by several facts, all of which will be affected by the location of the building, for the expense of any one of these materials is largelydetermined by the locality which in one case may mean that wood is more expensive than any other material as is almost the case in Australia at the present time or may mean that stone will be less expensive than brick. Quite aside from the matter of expenditure it is usually desirable that local materials should be used as most harmonious results, especially for the community, will naturally arise from this method and whatever material is used should be considered for both exterior and interiorpurposes as the simplicity and harmony and quality of a building is largely determined by the use of the same material wherever appropriate both outside and inside. No other one thing will go so far toward giving a feeling of finish and unity to a building as this. Glass is another material used for quite special purposes and its characteristics can well be taken Page 743 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoadvantage of for the increasing of the charm of our homes. For a long time the staining of glass appeared to be a lost art as the colors obtained by modern processes were raw and garish. We have found, however, that this resulted from what has been termed too greatperfection in its manufacture, since the richness can now be obtained by the introduction of what were considered impurities. It is hard to describe the lovely effects which can be obtained by a proper use or colored glass since so far as I know there is none to be seen in some countries and the matter of scale in all the elements of a building is of vital importance and the subdivision of the glass in windows and doors often goes a longway towards giving a home that feeling of domesticity which is necessary if it is to meet its requirements. These points will affect and hold all the occupants, especially the children whose whole attitude towards life is bound [Note: ==== Beginning of page 118 (table of contents) ====] INTERLOCKING SQUARES PLAN .

Here again, if we study the natural character of the material we find we need not go to any great expense to get charming effects for glass, though difficult to cut in curved forms, is easily broken in straight lines. We should not, therefore, make attempts to paint pictures with colored glass but should use geometric motives or purely decorative forms. We come finally to the extreme surfacing material which is color itself which, if it is to be used in such a way as not to obscure the qualities of the surfaces on which it is used, should be applied not in the form of thick paints but in pure transparent stains. These may be water mixtures or oil mixtures, but should not be mixed with the dense materials such as whiting which is almost universally used by our present decorators. As to color itself, not even this should be looked upon as a matter of personal taste and whim. The proper colors to use in interior decoration is quite as such a matter of mathematics as is sound and form. In decorating the interiors of our homes we should recognize that both eye and mind and spirit have definite requirements which will be met only if we conform to the natural laws of color. Human beings are not creatures made to burrow in the dark but light is necessary, both for health and happiness, and this should guide our use of colors in the interior in order that our homes may approximate outdoors inthe meeting of these requirements as closely as possible. In other words we want to bring light into our homes. Page 744 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoA glance at the spectrum will show us that the most luminous part of it is not to be found on either end but in the center. Out of darkness we come gradually into intense light and on again into darkness. The blue, violet and indigo rays tend toward obscurity as well as the deep red end of the spectrum andalthough with direct light such as we get from the sun itself there is still a certain luminosity in these terminal colors of the spectrum yet we will find that from reflected surfaces we can get a feeling of luminosity only by the use of the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 120 ====] central colors, therefore, the violets and indigos and reds are debarred from use in interiors and we find that wherever they are used there has been an attempt to overcome this fact by using them mixed withwhite which results in pasty, sickly tints which should never be used at all in decoration. Neither is it possible to get that feeling of luminosity by one color only. Experiments in decoration of high ceilings have been made which show that an effect of brilliant white can be obtained by painting a ceiling in narrow strips of a succession of colors constantly repeated, and we know that in light itself a union of all the colors of the spectrum result in white. Our rooms should therefore be arranged to make the use of2 or more colors in a room. In fact, a color scheme can hardly be called a scheme unless it contains 3 tones just as 3 tones are required to form a chord in music. To show the difficulty in the use of words in describing colors I need only say that it sounds as if we were very limited in our choice of colors when we can use only the yellow or its mergings into the red through the orange on the one side and into the greens which are its combination with the blue on the other side but, in fact, the tones so composed areinfinite in their variety though they can generally be classified under the one term, russet. It sounds very crude and ugly if we say a room is to be decorated in red, yellow and green; but a mere change of names to russet, gold and olive is sufficient to make one realize that such a combination may be very beautiful.

At a word their soft breasts they unfold And yield to my spirit's embrace; Yet when o'er her charms I grow cold. Contented each sinks in her place. They fire me, they melt me, they find Where the fountains of feeling are hid,And the shackles of passion unbind; Yet they hush at the drop of my lid. They tell me the wonderful tales Of Persia and Araby blest; One speaks of Europe's fair vales,And one of the virginal West. Hot love talk one brings from the South, Drunk with the sun's ardent beams; And folk-lore one has in her mouth, From the Northland's magnificent dreams. Every week a new, beautiful form On my harem's retreat I enfold. To the new love I'm never less warm - Toward the old love I never grow cold; Yet censure I scorn and defy,And in virtue's calm eyes dare to look; No Morman [Note: Mormon] nor Turkman am I - Each beauty I boast is a book.

Remote from the twang of the harps. Paradiso's fair fields I would rove; Secure from all quavers and sharps, And, clasping the volume I love, I would roam all alone far awayTo some silent and soul-hiding nook And drown dull eternity's day In the depths of my favorite book. And if to inferno I stray - My wasted and erring life's meed -My pains will in peace melt away If I'm only permitted to read.

A good many residences in that part of Grand Rapids are located on top of a high embankment which rises up from a number of the streets. The Amberg house being located on the corner lot and with such an embankment gave the Page 747 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoopportunity to build practically a one story house as viewed from the street leaving the driveway to go under the house on the street level. The total height from the sidewalk level to the highest floor is one story. By varying the height of the floors between the living room and the rest of the house we getadded height in the large living room which makes it possible to get a very attractive scheme of ceiling lighting. The main entrance from both sidewalk and driveway comes directly under the dining room. Two-thirds of a flight of stairs brings one to the level of the living room, morning room, living porch and hallway, giving access to the small outdoor flight of steps to the garden located in the inner angle of the lot,making it unnecessary to cross the driveway in order to reach this sunken garden. Five steps above the living room level are the dining room, service pantry and kitchen. This leaves the space below the service quarters entirely out of the ground so that the servants' bedrooms could be provided with full windows which would take away any feeling of being in basement rooms. It also leaves the servants' quarters in an \"L\" by themselves with direct entrance from the driveway. By raising the floor of the bedrooms to the same height as that of the dining room the feeling of seclusion to the sleeping quarters is obtained and the window sills are lifted so high above the level of the lot at the top of the terrace that no one can look directly into the rooms even from that level. The placing of the main bedroom at the end of the lot gives it the beautiful outlook to the south over the sunken garden.

I quote from a New Year's greeting she sent to her friends:- \"A word to that faithful company of co-workers who made my life one continual delight. (her teachers) Their high ideals, their unvarying steadfastness to duty, caused one of our head supervisors to say, 'this institution could be left without a head for a year and yet maintain its standard.' I always knew I was simply a good organizer and an appreciativeonlooker of the superb good work you did. And reference should be made here to our able and efficient engineer who told one of the force that he had 'been with us seventeen years and had never had a disagreeable word spoken to him.' Ever ready to do and to watch after all the physical comforts, we were able to maintain an \"even temper\" as long as the air was fresh and the temperature even. Good-bye to the Christmas Holidays and a ring into the New Year.\" Marion, the second born child, was a fragile thing that Mother had to keep out doors, ill as soon as she was brought into the house. Father was from Cork. Mother was of New England blood dating back almost to its beginnings. Father emigrated from Ireland when a boy. He was a Catholic, Mother a Unitarian - the only two logical positions as father said. On the death of her [Note: \"his\" crossed out] father our father took the gold from his pocket and had it made into a napkin ring for Jerome and afinger ring for me, the only grandchildren yet born. A kindly fate in the form of the Chicago fire drove them out, with the two babes in a clothes basket, to dwell for a decade (when fire burned their house to the ground and sent them back to Chicago) in the loveliest spot you can imagine, beyond suburbia - four houses and no others within a mile in any direction. Our home was at the head of a lovely ravine. A half mile walk through the beautiful forest tothe [Note: See also MMG's reminiscences in Section III, No. 5., page 67ff.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 130b (table of contents) ====] Page 749 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoHUBBARD WOODS AT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN [Note: The New-York Historical Society copy has two images of the same map: the first (somewhat altered) captioned \"Preserving the Natural Beauty Is [/] What Should Have Been Done\"; the second,\"Present Subdivision .

Such a wonderful place for children to develop, God's university. All the wonders of the wilderness and yet so convenient to the city that both father and mother slipped into the city for their daily work. Town planning would make such things possible for all children, just a little foresight. We children were safeguarded by a grand Irish housekeeper, and educated by that greatest of teachers - Mother Nature - and in her loveliest mood. And in the lap of nature she grew well and wiry. When city guests came out for the week end she was called upon to exhibit her tree-climbing feats. Gathered on the veranda they watched her, barefooted, climb monkey fashion the tree just in front of the house, branchless well above the top of the two story house. And they teased the boys because they couldn't do it. When school age came they thought nothing of the mile walk to the village school at Winnetka. Always that was supplemented by the outdoor life. In the early spring gathering hepaticas from under the verysnow, on to fall with its wild hickory huts, black walnuts and butternuts and hazelnuts; and the berries - raspberries, black berries, blue berries June berries and wild grapes and crab apples and on in the winter snow, wintergreen berries. And then always the marvel of the lake! the joys and delights in the summer, the ice hills and caverns piled up in the winter and, when a storm was on, the walks through the woods with father and mother to the top of the bluff to watch the grandeur of the waves piling up over thesands and battering and foaming up the bluff itself. Did ever children have such joys. And then spontaneous combustion and the house was burned to the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 132 (table of contents) ====] AMBERG . PLANS [Note: ==== Beginning of page 133 ====]ground in the middle of the night - \"A magnificent bonfire,\" Mother said; and the family moved into the city. The grandfather's rings were about the only things saved from the blaze. In the city Marion carried on with her tomboyish ways; in the winter hitching her sled onto the passing wagons, etc., though so Page 750 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoshy of human beings even when well along in her teens that she would walk around the block to avoid greeting an acquaintance seen approaching in the distance. Then Aunt Myra - her great pal during all the years of this saint's life \u2014 took her home to Tremont for a year with the maternal grand-parents, thestately grandmother carrying on the household duties, the grandfather, who had never lost a baby, lying on his deathbed though the nine year old child was entirely unconscious of this fact. There while Aunt Myra went to the surrounding districts on her horse Lucy, and to the neighboring towns giving piano lessons, the wee girl went to school and managed so to ingratiate herself to her teacher that they became lifelong correspondents in spite of the fact that she told a lie to her when askedif she was chewing gum. Miss Fenner instead of reproving her reprimanded the other pupils for leading this little girl to this act. I never forgot it (though I can't to this day see how she managed to make out a case against them) but in later years appreciated her pedagogical talent. I had the habit that year of telling lies - when Aunt Myra asked me if I had brushed my teeth or Grandma asked if I had been sliding in the ice - wearing out my shoes and so forbidden. Many years after when I spoke to Aunt Myra about it as contrasted with my truthful disposition, she said, \"Yes why did you do it?\" My present philosophical analysis is that I was quite consciously rebellious of this to my mind quite unwarranted assumption of authority on their part, especially in things that Mother would never have dreamed of opposing - but mostly just a general stand against authority. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 134 ====] These instances stand out so vividly that, together with my estimation of my own character, I am inclined to consider them very important from a pedagogical point of view. I've helped many a mother to realize that it is folly to expect morals in young children and bad pedagogy to emphasize them. With grandfather gone I was no longer of importance in grandmother's home, to run errands in emergencies since Aunty's work took her far afield (though I was never conscious of my usefulnesswhile I was there. I think now it would have been wholesome for me to have known. Children appreciate and respond to a consciousness of responsibility.) So I returned home again where the only outdoor playground was the streets except for a pocket handkerchief back yard where many circus tricks were performed. But one day as I was approaching my twelfth year Mother called me up onto the little entrance porch and suggested that I was getting to be too big a girl to romp in the streets. My soul wasfilled with astonishment and rage. I think I gave her no more worry on that score but I still played hop scotch even after I became a teacher much to the amazement and delight of the school children. Then my Father's death - Angina Pectoris - the youngest of the five children, Leslie, only four years old - and the whole burden, though I fancy it never occurred to mother in the light of a burden - but the whole responsibility in every field on her alone, economic, domestic, educational, social - and how fullshe filled them all and her loneliness without her beloved only on the rarest of occasions becoming visible to the rest of us. Once she said to me - \"When I am crossing a street in the midst of traffic I think - 'Jere [Note: Jeremiah] is beside me and will look out for me.'\" And it was a lucky thing he did for she was a holy terror in the midst of high speed traffic. In her seventies she would cross the main thoroughfares with dignity at a quiet pace utterly oblivious while drivers and motorists cursed and Page 751 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoswore but did not touch her. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 135 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . 3 STORIES . Marion Mahony & Herman von Holst [Note: ==== Beginning of page 136 ====] Father was adored by all who knew him. In Hubbard Woods the neighbor across the street, James Chisholm, a journalist, his wife a singer, worshiped the ground he walked on. These two were as likely to drop in on each other at 2AM as any other time of day - their wives quite uncomplaining. In the wee hours it never occurred to father to abstain from waking mother, as he was turning in, to read her hislatest poem or dilate on a bright idea. For some time he was principal of one of Chicago's schools. His teachers adored him. One night not long after his death Mrs. [Note: Ella Flagg Young?] came in with a box which she handed to Mother. Mother said, \"It feels as if it were filled with gold,\" - took it to the beautiful old mahogany table - such a vivid picture in my mind - opened it and in truth it was filled with gold - a shining thousand dollars togive all the thrills of a miser to one who was furthest possible from being one, collected by the teachers who knew and loved them both, as an expression of their affection. Father was one who acted on conviction of the human individual's power. When the time came for the selection of a school superintendent he determined that his old school teacher, Mr. Howland, should be the one chosen. He threw articles into all the news papers till - \"such was the pressure of publicopinion\" - Mr. Howland was selected for the position. He and Mrs. [Note: Ella Flagg] Young were the only great and worthy ones who have held that position in Chicago. Mrs. Young, interestingly enough, when thrown out of her position by a political mayor catering to job seekers who resented a woman's holding so remunerative a position, was reinstated through the uproar of \"public opinion,\" this time the women of Chicago who in the midst of the turmoil had received the franchise. The women succeeded inthis though all the men were saying - \"If she's out she's out. It isn't possible to get her back. What you women should do is to decide on someone else who will suit you and concentrate on him .\" But the women had determined to put Mrs. Young back and they did. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 137 ====] Public opinion in truth! Then politicians cut their Gordian knot by creating another office, giving it equal pay with the superintendency and putting a man in it. With the franchise in their hands the women couldthrow out the Mayor and he knew it. Father had the reputation of being the best slinger of the King's English in the city. And friends have told me of how he would sit quietly of an evening and then suddenly take the floor and the whole group would be aflame. Oh! these Irish! One of his poems - My Harem - written to his books was published Page 752 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoshortly before and was almost identical with a poem by Oliver Wendell Holmes. Father wrote him about it saying if the dates had been reversed he, the unknown of the two, would certainly have been suspected of plagiarism. He received a very pleasant reply commenting on the frequency of suchoccurrencies and that it wasn't the first time it had happened to him, Mr. Holmes. You see things do come out of the blue if one has access to it. No rational thinker can accept the idea of chance. A creative idea when once conceived is imprinted on the others and is accessible to imaginative, though not to rational, thinkers. During those early days in Chicago Mrs. Young was the principle of the school all the children attended. On her return from the country school Marion was placed by her in a 5th grade room with instructions to Miss Jones to pass her on to 6th grade if possible. The year would end in a month. The class was reviewing and Miss Jones pushed her through. On Father's death the only just 4 year old Leslie was put in first grade (there were no kindergartens in those days) and made his grades regularly. When the five [Note: Jerome, Marion, Gerald, Georgine, Leslie] were through the teachers said -\"Thank God that's the last of the Mahonys.\" Mrs. Young expected them to make all Jere's [Note: Jeremiah's] children shine. She also, the year after Mother was thrown on her own, coached her for the principal's exam which she passed, to which position Mother was eminently fitted and in which she became one of the leaders in all the progressive movements of the Chicago [Note: ==== Beginning of page 138 ====] schools. The year after Father's death Grandmother and Aunt Myra, Mother's idolized sister, came to live with us and from that time formed an integral part of the family. But let the pendulum swing for a moment to the Antipodes to glimpse the childhood of the earth and man's early days on solid earth after his long periods of evolution in the spiritual realms and in the gradually solidifying solar system.

The fact that Aunt Myra lived with us during the years after Father's death meant that we all had a second Mother and a wonderful bosomfriend. A pianist and teacher, she too was a natural educator and took lessons of all the great pianists who came to Chicago in those days. So she was among those who developed a system of pedagogy in music which rapidly brought the music of the United States up to a high standard. This gave me an opportunity to see, through my own experience, how important it is for us now to take the schools out of the hands of the political organization - as important as it was a while back to take it out of the controlof the church. For when I had completed my school work including the university and was ready to start practicing the arts as a profession I found I knew nothing, could do nothing. It was the custom in those Page 756 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagodays to teach drawing in the schools but not music so, since one could get the drawing for nothing, the parents accepted it as sufficient whereas with music when a child was not getting satisfactory instruction they would dismiss the teacher and put him in other hands. The drawing therefore like everything else inpublic schools dropped into a deadly routine of no educational value. When I discovered the consequences in myself I went back, as opportunity offered, to various schools in Boston and Chicago and demanded the kind of work I required, interesting the teachers and creating quite a sensation among the students. Madame and Monsieur Pape were the teachers in Boston and when at the end of a quarter I had to leave for home and expressed my gratitude to them for all they haddone for me, Mme. [Note: Madame] wept and said I was the only student who had ever expressed any thanks though they took so much pains for them. \"But,\" she said, \"you certainly got a lot out of your quarter,\" and I certainly was grateful to them for it. But I had to get what I needed. I found afterwards that there was a privately run school in Chicago in the hands of an old High [Note: ==== Beginning of page 146 ====] School classmate of mine, Miss Church, and was thrilled to see what interesting work she was doing and what fine creative results she was getting from her pupils. So from my own experience I was able to check what I got from other sources later - that one of the most urgent necessities for establishing a true democracy was the complete separation of the educational system from the political. Only through such a step shall we be enabled to allow creative ability to develop in our young people. As was to be expected Miss Church's enterprise did not last long for at present a private school is a business, and willbe until we have established an Abilities Organization to take over, and stands a small chance of being able to continue to exist in competition with government run business. It was run out of existence quite as definitely, though not so self-consciously, as the privately and efficiently run buses were run off the streets in Australia, by increasing and increasing and increasing the taxation on them. We have a chance occasionally to see such instances but how many such undertakings are killed, thwarted, or preventedfrom ever starting, we have no way of measuring. I have good reason to be thankful to Aunt Myra for her continued interest in my musical education in spite of the fact that I had no special talent in that direction. For through her I became acquainted with music and even achieved a foundation which, after an interim of many years of no practice, enabled me (when the need came for me to forget myself) to practice Beethoven and other composers with sufficientsatisfaction to myself to be a great and lasting healing of the soul. We learn that just as the life body (which we have in common with the plants) is a light organization, so is the soul body, builder of the nerve system, a sound organization, thus great creative powers lie in the pulling into shape of the astral body. This enabled me to appreciate the importance of opening the doors of these realms of creative experience to all young people. I lost that close companionship with my Aunt through her death before my [Note: ==== Beginning of page 147 (table of contents) ====] Page 757 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 IN THE RAVINES . ROMANTIC [Note: The caption the New-York Historical Society illustration mentions \"the spectacular ravines of Sydney.\" The structure is a perspective for Scheme Three of the David Pratten House.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 148 ====] marriage, but never have I lost the feeling of the continued closeness of the relationship. In later years I learned through my own experiences, which are the only basis of knowledge, that this non-material realm is a real world as varied and rich as the material world. Reason tells us it must be as it is the causal world, and the smashed atom has informed us that it is the force world. Later I learned this through perceptions which could be checked by the perceptions of others with the same exactitude as theobservations of facts in the material realm. But before we had learned to make a conscious entrance into this causal realm it had been amply proved to us that the sort of things which happened to us at critical moments in our eventful lives could not be accounted for by chance. Anyway the belief in chance is contrary to reason and no truly scientific thinker can accept such an absurdity. So, even before we could be conscious of the methods of this world beyond the boundaries of our nineteenth century type ofconsciousness, we realized that help was being given to us by beings who were concerning themselves with what we were doing and we interpreted it as coming from loved ones who had crossed over into the realm of consciousness of which we had not yet become directly aware. And it is not mediumship nor spiritualism as generally conceived that we are speaking of. As the baby period passed, Mother took her roistering family back to Hubbard Woods for each summer long vacation. There was a bit of an adventurer, Mr. Merriles, who had started building houses West of the tracks and then, I suppose in the pinch of some depression (such an absurdity these depressions) had left them in all their various stages of completion. For years we just chose the best one of them still left and camped therein for the two months. They were gradually disposed of the best one each year being occupied the next year, so we passed down the line, but always so long as there was a roof, afloor and a few walls, it suited us perfectly. We bothered with no furniture. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 149 ====] Mattresses on the floor were luxury enough and when extra guests arrived a blanket on the floor was perfectly satisfactory to the family. There must have been some sort of cooking arrangement though Ihave no recollection of it, so little was cooking a part of our life, except that when we went out early in the morning for the day's adventure Mother always had one cooked dish. No one ever had more wonderful holidays than we. As we started on the trail, sometimes we would be joined by neighbors or sometimes by city folk who came out for a lark. Always there was the hope that we would live there again and I wept when the allotment next to ours with a sweet bit of the head of aravine was sold to be built on. And Mrs. West, one of the original four families, watched with her heart in her throat the cutting down of trees, only a few at first, but she told me that others were dying and she was sure it was in consequence of the loss of their companions. She sensed the interrelationship of plant life whose United Ego dwells in the center of the Earth, this living Earth. Bio-dynamic agriculture is Page 758 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoproving that natural plant groups are interdependent entities. This despoliation was slow then but rapid afterwards. Here again is one of the instances where if the United States had been a true democracy, with the Abilities Organ established, this whole wonderful ravine district extending from Winnetkamiles north through Lake Forest would today, for all its intense occupation, be as beautiful as then giving the citizenry itself every advantage (more than they have under this system of despoliation) and retaining accessibility for all to its loveliness. This is being proved at Castlecrag for here in Hubbard Woods too the lower levels of the valleys themselves and the whole foreshores of the lake could have been retained in a park system in all its pristine grace and majesty. There can be such open beautifulspaces even in the most intensely occupied suburban districts as was proved by Mr. Griffin in the competition inaugurated by the City Club in Chicago shortly before his departure for Australia, in the Newton Center quarter section [Note: ==== Beginning of page 150 ====] subdivision. During the first year in High School a lifelong friendship began. Among some 40 pupils in the room one young country girl made herself decidedly conspicuous by her free and easy and chatty way with the teacher. I sat quite across the room from her but had spoken to her once whereupon a pal of the moment with scorn in her voice practically instructed me to have nothing to do with that girl. My answer was to pick up my book and march over to sit down with Anna to ask her some question in grammar for she had shown herself to be clever in her studies. She was a natural gypsy - pretty and sparkling -whereas I, although I cared nothing for conventions, was in those days quiet and reserved. But the bonds between us are as close today as they were in our girlhood. My childhood had been in the country too so my thinking was not so cramped as that of the city child. Another lifelong friend from those high school days, in contrast to the sparkling gypsy, was Katherine, a dainty strawberry blond. A considerable part of my spare time after my return from Tech [Note: Boston Tech, later renamed MIT] was spent in the study of French in that charming and very active French group in her home whose activities consummated in the establishment of the French Theatre in Chicago. This pursuit of French was my initiation in acting for where one is remote from the possibility of hearing a language this participating in drama is an especially good way to learn. Also a different language if really used is a fine training of the thinking powers and this being a thinking language was amost helpful supplement to my native will language, the English, where the verb comes early in the sentence. It was many years before I added German, a feeling language, to my quota whereas every child should have such a trinity in command by the time he is 12 [Note: \"nine\" erased] years old for during those early years when the power for acquiring vocabulary is so amazing, a child can learn three languages as easily as one. His health will not be diminished but improved by this through the balancingof [Note: ==== Beginning of page 151 (table of contents) ====] HOUSE OF CUBES .

Favard when one evening several of us took a train journey together and Mlle. Favard continually expressed astonishment and delight in the remarks I made saying:- \"Why, everything she says is interesting!\" Apparently her conversations with me in French had never given her the slightest hint of any such personal qualities. Mrs. [Note: Mary J.] Wilmarth coached me in French preparing me for my exams for Tech. Her naughty daughter Anna told her I had failed in French and Mrs. Wilmarth was taking the blame on herself when at last grasping the situation I told her I had passed. It was this young friend, Anna Wilmarth, who put me through the University. The only return I was ever able to make was earnestness in my work. This Anna Wilmarth was Mrs. Ickes who for many years was a Congressman in theIllinois Legislature and who resigned her position later to go to Washington with Mr. [Note: Harold J.] Ickes when he became a member of Mr. Roosevelt's cabinet - Minister [Note: Secretary of] for the Interior. For years she had spent her holidays in the desert of New Mexico, studying and writing of the Indian customs. She didn't do her work from the outside but became an intimate friend of the Indians and was admitted to very secret ceremonies. She learned to know the reality of their different way ofthinking and never spoke of them in the light manner so customary with the rational thinkers. Her book should be a help toward making Americans willing to listen without prejudice to those who can show us how, in full consciousness, to add to our rational thinking this other method of thinking which the primitive peoples use intuitively. When we have done that our community can begin to function creatively in free will as nature beings, no longer children who quite properly have to be guided duringtheir immaturity. I made a dash at the drama while at Tech by joining the French [Note: Anna Ickes (1873-1935), social reformer and Illinois legislator, was the daughter of Mary J. Wilmarth (1837-1919), a reformer and suffragist, and the wife of Harold L. Ickes, an activist and New Deal political figure. She wrote \"Mesa Land: The History and Romance of the American Southwest\"(1933) and \"He-Who-Always-Wins and Other Navajo Campfire Stories\" (1934). Mrs. Ickes died in an auto accident in New Mexico.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 153 ====] Club. I was the only girl in the club so when we gave a public performance I was cast as the countess in one of the two plays. Although at graduation I was voted as the handsomest man in my class, I was completely outrivaled in personal beauty by the countess in the other play, a blond youth who became Page 760 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagostartlingly beautiful in his feminine array. I had objected when our costumer, the teacher in painting, had instructed me to wear corsets. I said I never did wear them. He said if all the rest of the men could wear corsets I could too. I accepted his logic but laced only moderately whereas the ballet dancers pulled theircorsets so tight they could scarcely swallow a mouthful of water on the night of the performance. I assumed a man's name on the program so went before the audience as a man among men. Through this innocent deception I won a great reputation for \"Gerald Morse\" as an actor. My play was put on first. My maid, the only other woman in the cast, was taken by a man and I learned afterwards of the many compliments:- the wonderful way in which I did a woman's role, how I put on my gloves just like awoman, and so on. But it worked a hardship on my blond rival because when he spoke his first words the audience roared with laughter, his masculinity being completely revealed in his voice. Of my outstanding early friendships, one was Echo Simmons living with the Davises in Hubbard Woods, and a constant companion during the last years of those holidays which ended only with the finish of high school work and my start in the university in Boston in the course of architecture. Echohad come down from Minneapolis [Note: Minnesota] in a calico gown. There would be no shock in such a procedure today but in those days, as with so many things, it simply wasn't done. Early in our acquaintance Echo walked in the 20 miles to our home in Chicago and as she entered, as cheerily as if she had dropped in from around the block, she called our - \"Are there any errands I can do for you Mrs. Mahony?\" Her affections were as vital as her body. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 154 (table of contents) ====] MARION MAHONY & ECHO SIMMONS [Note: ==== Beginning of page 155 ====] As I look back now I realize that all along the line the friends were sent to me by my guiding angel to break down the barriers of an individuality that had a natural preference for isolation. This step is therequisite after we have attained individualization in order that our Ego may reverse from concentration within our skin to an expansion in spirit till it includes humanity. Echo would sit on a stile waiting for hours till I came along on the family jaunt for the day to the woods or the lakeshore. There was, through my life, a succession of these lovers, my husband being probably the outstanding exception for apparently it was my task to do this service for him which my friendswere doing for me. During our teens Echo and I read and discussed [Note: Herbert] Spencer and [Note: Charles] Darwin and such like, absorbing the scientific fundaments of our time as is essential for any people in any time. Thus later one will have established a foundation from which to leap to the science of the future if fear doesn't prevent his taking it. The great service rendered by these nineteenth century thinkers was to establish in the minds of Western peoples the reality of evolution. That theirinterpretation of facts was topsy-turvy was a detail that could be put to rights by the thinking that was appropriate to the 20th century. Anyone who wishes to understand what is meant by such a statement should read \"Man and Animal\" by Dr. [Note: Hermann] Poppelbaum to glimpse the reversal of [Note: [Note: \"Etheric of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoFormative Forces in Cosmos, Earth, and Man\"?] for the 20th century correction and supplementing of the physical sciences. A week or two after my arrival at Boston Tech a niece of the Lucy Stone Blackwell [Note: women's rights pioneer] said to me - the only Westerner among these Boston girls - \"I don't see that you are so different from other folk.\" I laughed and asked her if she had expected to see me with a feather in my hair. She laughed back and said that probably was about what she had expected. The girls were of markedly different types and connections and views but a group of us when graduating started a Round [Note: \"Stile\" - a step or set of steps for passing over a fence or wall but forming a barrier to livestock.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 156 ====] Robin letter which has been going around the world for some forty five years now (for we scattered even to the far antipodes) and is still going strong. It has maintained a close and intimate friendship supplemented only occasionally by transient meetings and itself has always been an extremely interesting document of the lives of these typical American doers. Far apart from each other in their spheres and interests and points of view yet with the closest ties of affection, this one little unit can wellmake clear the absurdity of the hope so frequently expressed in these days that the solution of our social problems will come about through human beings becoming more alike. They are due to become more and more unlike as individuals though the differences of races ceased with the coming of the Christ who was \"the light\" and gave that light to every man who comes into the world. Since then there has been no difference between races except physical differences which are disappearing. In the University another friend of the same name as mine, Marion, a most beautiful girl of the [Note: Edward] Burne-Jones type tackled the stronghold of a higher classmate. The first attack was in the dressing room and the conversation that was so absorbing that we both forgot and missed the classes at which we were due. So for the succeeding years the two Marions discussed the philosophies of the Western peoples, Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\" and so on. A picture of myself was brought to myears through a friend of Marion's who caught sight of me getting in a street car with a big drafting board and tee square with - \"I saw your picturesque friend getting on the car with her big drafting board utterly unselfconscious though all eyes were turned on her.\" It took the journey to the antipodes in later years to shake the fixed concepts of the northern, the continental, hemisphere and to melt to the fluid of the southern hemisphere these bare bones of science with which our people rest so satisfied these days. In all these many and varied friendships it was usually they who were the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 157 ====] initiators. This does not mean that I did not have a very great affection for these wonderful friends, but my shyness perhaps in self-expression never broke down except once. With that man of mine it seemedthat I was possessed. It was as if a demon took hold and shaped me to its whim. Indeed years before a friend in the office had said the surmises were that I must have been disappointed in love because I took Page 762 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagomy work so earnestly. I was devoted to my work and indeed throughout my life have been convinced that work is the one great satisfaction for human beings which means that those women who have not grown up to take a life's work seriously as our men do are being deprived of life's greatest continuoussatisfaction. But when I encountered Walter Burley Griffin I was first swept off my feet by my delight in his achievements in my profession, then through a common bond of interests in nature and intellectual pursuits and then with the man himself. It was by no means a case of love at first sight but it was a madness when it struck. The many years were packed full of every joy and every anguish till that demon who sat on my shoulder seemed to have run his gamut of possibilities in work and play together and finally through that curious conflict of interests, perhaps best expressed as a warfare of philosophies, Nietzsche was a bone of contention between us, this man who like Kant would prove one thing on one page and its opposite on the next, masters of reason both of them going insane, makes a god of it, it leaves one with no ground to stand on, for anything that can be proved can be disproved. The only basis for knowledge is perception, checkable perception. Not till the battle had been fought out to a finish was it possible to realize that the close companionship of marriage is the best training ground for that demon - the Ego - which presently finds it cannot continue to endure submission to any of the external worlds - neither that of the environment itself, nor that of the physical body in which it has incarnated - these two realms of law; nor to that other external world, the chaotic world of its soul. And with a wrench from [Note: ==== Beginning of page 158 (table of contents) ====] UNITY CHURCH . EVANSTON . ILLINOIS . Marion Mahony . Architect [Note: illustration is of the Church of All Souls.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 159 ====] all its customs and habits and conventions and emotions, it frees itself from all these bondages. Then can the companionship be resumed on apparently the same old terms but really a completely new thing for each has found that through this battle, really with one's own self, one has developed faculties which open the way to perception in a new world where one is no longer a slave to anything external to his real self, his own Ego, but can make contact with the formative forces which make it possible for him to be the master of himself, of his thinking, feeling and willing. He finds that life is no longer filled withproblems impossible of solution; that he no longer has to grant that he can have knowledge only in limited fields but that if he will take the pains he can gain the means of solving all the problems of his time. This is of course a necessity for the people of each period if the evolution of humanity is to be a real thing. In 1930 at the end of that character testing decade of one's forties [Note: fifties?]which followed the seven year battle over Canberra, I threw up my hands and ran away, this time to America. My parting words to Walt were - \"Well now you are a free man.\" His to me - \"I'm a perfect damn fool.\" In 1931 I wrote (from the United States to Australia) - In his cycle on the Threshold of the Spiritual Page 763 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Rudolf] Steiner says:- \"In love when one really loves a person there exists in the depths of his being a terrible antipathy to that person. The antipathy is there if the love is real love.\" This is the only statement I have ever heard anyone make that seemed to me true and significant except one that Emily Bronte made in which she said that if she really loved a man she would hate him as she hated herself. I myself as you may remember have said that it was absurd to look upon the marital relationship, if it were based on love, as having any relation to friendship, that it was more like that of enemies. I have told Clarmyra [Note: MMG's niece] that one should not choose a mate as a friend but as an opponent, an opportunity worthy of her mettle. This statement of Steiner's would seem to imply thatlove - that there was [Note: ==== Beginning of page 160 ====] such a thing as real love - and that it was based on a spiritual reality, perhaps a need that could be met only by interdependence (This is our old quarrel isn't it) a need of course not connected with physical needs. [Note: reading follows N-YHS copy] In 1932 - Dear Edith, You ask, \"Can it be Marion that he doesn't understand? Is it that he really has not seen?\" In a way that is the case. He won't see and what he won't see he can't see. You didn't quite get the point in regard to anger as you will see when you read the lecture. One should boil with anger. There must be anger. It is the fire that Prometheus brought down to mankind. It is the divine force that makes possible the balanced development of the Ego which is necessary for its continued existence. One can and should make better and better use of that force and should learn totransmute it into better judgments for the solution of life's riddles. [Note: Rudolf] Steiner says that without the molding force of anger through which the Ego becomes richer and richer, the Ego reaches a point where it begins to weaken and disintegrate and that is the point where I think Walter stands. I sometimes think Walter lacks the capacity for anger. I could suggest a trap to set for him to test out this point but I do not believe in testing human beings. But this is what Steiner says. He says that there arepeople who say they make a sacrifice in not being angry, but they can't sacrifice what they haven't got. The anger must exist. He says that one can over and over again transmute anger into judgment but the anger must exist or it can't be transmuted. That with this work of the Ego in transmuting anger it develops the qualities that are necessary for its perfection and permanence. That with this there comes a tranquility of soul and a power, but without this interplay it becomes cold and hard. Once, the first year we were in Australia, Walter was angry - or shocked - when one of his backers on becoming a member of the Legislative assembly (a permanent office like the House of Lords in England) said he [Note: \"Edith\" might be Edith Williams, the General Secretary of the Anthroposophical Society of Australia, who met the Griffins in 1929.] Page 764 of 923 Supplement to of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 161 (table of contents) ====] UNITY CHURCH . PULPIT . MURAL by Marion Mahony [Note: The illustration is of the Church of All Souls.] UNITY CHURCH . PLAN [Note: The illustration is of the Church of All Souls.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 162 ====] couldn't back him further in the Federal Capital issue. That has always been a great comfort to me and I have tried since to convince myself that at times since then he was angry because it seemed to me gruesome, not human, never to be angry. But he never has been and has looked upon that as a sign ofhis perfection as compared to myself. Just as when I said that I could see in myself the capacity to do any or all evil things and felt that that was the basis of a capacity for sympathy with humans in general, he looked at me with shocked eyes as an evil thing feeling that his lack of any such perception in himself was another basis of his perfection. But Steiner says in his lecture on the Mystery of Death - \"No self knowledge is true unless it discloses to the depth where the tendency to all possible wrong-doing dwellsin us. This tendency is implanted in us in order that we may grasp spiritual life with the Consciousness soul.\" I quite realize that this characteristic of Walter's has been a very valuable one in the frightful struggle he has had in his profession in Australia and that perhaps the Angels have safeguarded him for that great work but I feel very sure that the time has now come when his problem is life and not architecture andthat he should shake up this perfectly clean consciousness of his and be able to see himself and others in truth and reality. To Walter all human beings, except this wife, are exactly like himself, perfect, and he never gets outside of himself in his estimate of them. This he looks upon as a virtue but it is really an incapacity to see the truth. And in 1932 - Well Walter Burley, that's that. Your truly human letter speaking to me as a fellow being crossed mine telling you I was coming home. You wrote to me that you hated my letters and I wrote you that I hated yours. The synchronization is the satisfactory part of it. I jolly well would have deserved a cessation of communication on your part and you would equally have deserved finding me back on your hands unrepentant. Thanks for the distinction on freedom. It is a comfort to [Note: ==== Beginning of page 163 ====] know from words out of your own mouth that you do not think Steiner upholds Nietzsche's concept that freedom consists in not doing what your wife wants you to do. This letter is not being written in solemnity but in lightness of heart. Marion Mahony Griffin In the early professional days I was profoundly influenced by the Single Tax of Henry George and only many years later realized that this concept of freeing natural resources from absolute ownership of Page 765 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoindividuals needed to be supplemented with a realization that also they must not be owned by the community, the State. Ownership is a very different thing from the right to use. It is for the State to see to it that equity is maintained in the use of land. Its function is also to safeguard the land - nature - forthe future not only for men but for all God's creatures. We must not continue our killing of the Earth. In later years as member of the Single Tax Association in Melbourne with their group established in a city building of their own through the enterprise of Griffin, we witnessed the illuminating spectacle of the difference in feeling between the American and the Britisher. One of the finest thinkers and the most successful teacher of the Single Tax I have ever known, Mr. Renwick, debated one evening with anopponent who made just one point and kept returning to it throughout the evening and it was a pathetic spectacle to see Mr. Renwick and all his convictions go down under this onslaught for he had a son who had been killed in the war. The one point was that with the Single Tax established the Empire could not continue to exist and Mr. Renwick could see this and could not tolerate the idea and in a soul battle taking place before our eyes that night the Empire won. Mr. Renwick never recovered from that defeatof his higher self played out on the stage of his soul. He died not long after. A conspicuous friend of the years in my native land was Mother's friend, James Vila Blake, the minister of the Unitarian Church. He was a man who could not be intimidated into refraining from saying what he [Note: Henry George (1839-1897) was an American land reformer and economist who advocated a single tax on the value of land in his 1879 book \"Progress and Poverty.\"] [Note: James Vila Blake (1842-1925) was a minister at All Souls and wrote the covenant which was accepted by that church and other Unitarian congregations.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 164 (table of contents) ====] UNITY CHURCH .

They finally felt they were in a position to contribute to his support but he suggested that they use the funds to build a little church. I Page 766 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagohad by that time graduated from [Note: Boston] Tech in Architecture and had had some years of practical training in office work. He suggested me as architect to which they agreed but they also selected a board of directors. This is one of the stupid methods general in our community which arisesfrom the misplacing of the democratic ideal for in neither Economic nor Ability realms can democracy be applied. Decisions made by a majority vote in such matters cannot be correct. They are compromises. Such points as costs limitations would of course be established to begin with. The privilege of the choice of the architect in this case was properly granted to Mr. Blake since he desired to make that decision. He was in a true sense their leader and they were under obligations tohim. He had had experience with my capacity as an artist, and beauty was one of the requirements of his religion; and he knew my qualifications. The board as usual, especially as it contained an architect, took pride and satisfaction in continual obstruction. Indeed how else can a board feel that it is fulfilling its function. I had yielded on various points one requiring a complete new design. They had turned down my first which Mr. Blake realized later was a pity. The design was an octagonal motif and an unprejudiced solution of the problem. The second design was more conventional. Mr. Blake once asked me if I couldn't yield on this point or that point but I told him that if I yielded on the points they were making it would mean a total destruction of beauty in the building. Finally they suggested that we go with them to inspect a certain chapel, which we did. As we went around the building Mr. Blake kept saying - \"Butwhy have you brought us here? I couldn't preach a sermon in such a place as this.\" [Note: ==== Beginning of page [165-2] ====] [Note: Supplied title: Section No. 3 . Thro Parlor, Entry & Kitchen Looking Toward Front] This illustration is on the verso of page 165 and is not listed in the table of contents.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 166 ====] And so on. As he and I went home together I said to Mr. Blake, \"Did you notice the height of this wall?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well that is the dimension they were requiring of me.\" \"You don't say so.\" \"And did you notice this and that?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well that is what they were requiring of me.\" \"Do you mean,\" he said, \"they wanted you to duplicate that building?\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"that's what they wanted.\" \"You don't say so,\" said he. From that time on he stood absolutely by me, and the board had to accept those decisions.It was he who said that Marion would have a hard time if she married a man who was not honest. My destiny proved that that was not a discipline required of me in this incarnation.

Then came the exodus to Australia and the separation from all those friends with whom one grows up and with whom one works, especially in a profession such as architecture, with bonds of interest and enthusiasm and an interplay of ability and skill and inspiration weaving a web of rich pattern and glowing colors, too many the names of these [Note: ==== Beginning of page [166-2] ====] [Note: Supplied title: Floor Plan This illustration is on the verso of page 166 and is not listed in the table of contents.] [Note: There is no text page 167 in either the Art Institute of Chicago or New-York Historical Society copies.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 168 ====] to record and one of the sad things of life that a quarter of a century of worldwide separation leaves no way open in this incarnation. But over there in the Antipodes the weaving of a new web was begun and, fortunately, no matter how great an antipathy one may have to a system utterly different from that to which one has been accustomed, parliamentary versus congressional, this does not at all diminish the closeness of the contact with many wonderful individuals nor does it affect the strength and beauty ofthe bonds made with them. Enemies we had not known before, but from now on we were surrounded by bitter enemies as well as beloved friends for the senor's [Note: Walter Burley Griffin's] work put him up against the whole British Empire, against all the financial interests, against the big business interests of Melbourne and Sydney, and against the Bureaucracy. Now indeed I was bound to the work. On that biggest of the islands of the South Seas, wonderful friends found me tied though I was to the office and the drafting board all through the years. In Melbourne Lillian [Note: Hamilton] Moore and Mrs. Paling and their various groups of friends where the questions of war and democracy were discussed without prejudice throughout the duration of the 1st World War. Another lifelong friend was young Adela Pankhurst, still in her teens who, in that first year of the war published her book \"Put Up The Sword\" so full of valuable historical information. Though it was banned during the war I had it onmy shelves where it was always accessible. She herself was one of that trinity including Cardinal [Note: Archbishop Daniel] Mannix and Walter Burley Griffin which really saved Australia from conscription, Page 768 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoa very different thing in Parliamentary communities than in Congressional communities. She was a real orator with unlimited vitality. We spent a lot of time trying to convert her from communism, really but another form of dictatorship, bureaucratic dictatorship. Later her own experience converted her. But stillshe did not realize that the Parliamentary form is completely bureaucratic. In Sydney so many friends and so wonderful, now moving toward a common center from which one could grasp the earth and humanity as a totality.

Before then I had been saying what a pity the Lord, who had created the wonderful beauty of stone and bush and animal, had made the fatal mistake of creating man who devoted all his energies to destroying these beauties. But now I grasped this reversal of things and realized that, instead of man's standing at the top of a tree of evolution through these kingdoms, they had all, mineral and vegetable and animal, derived through the eons from him.Surely there was some more constructive, creative work he should be undertaking now. From this standpoint it was possible to attain a basic purpose for life. \"Then,\" as Albert Steffen says, \"One's enthusiasm for the SHAPING OF DESTINY gains more and more the upper hand over every other desire.\" Two years later Mr. and Mrs. [Note: Edith?] Williams came into the Castlecrag community and through them we joined the Anthroposophic Society , delving into the realm of man's wisdom .

May I quote your article in a book I am writing on what an American learns in Australia. Among the larger units there are just two countries which have honest governments - America which makes democracy possible and Russia which is frankly a bureaucratic government. If found undesirable it can be altered. The other European countries are parading in the guise of democracies but in fact give the people no chance at all. I hope you can find time to read the enclosed Congressional versus Parliamentary Government. I hope that you dwell on these points continually as the future of the world depends on understanding thesedifferences. An illustration of how helpless the people and their representatives are is the story of [Note: Winston] Churchill. Though I do not know the facts in this instance our repeated experience of similar things makes me sure this is just what happened. It is typical. If India now forming does not contemplate selection of president directly by the people the confusion of Europe will be hers. [Note: The last sentence is handwritten and inserted into the text.] In the early days of the war Churchill, feeling America's support might hang on the handling of India, sent [Note: Sir Stafford] Cripps to India. He must have authorized something that he would agree to if India would. Cripps arrived and the Indians did agree to the suggestion but 2 days later the cable came saying - \"It can't be done.\" Now how could that happen! Well this is how that sort of thing does happen repeatedly. Churchill was Prime Minister. He had not yet been initiated to toe the mark as [Note: Ramsay] MacDonald the Labor Leader had been previously. He thought he held a position of authority. [Note: Walter Lippmann (1889-1974) was a newspaper columnist and author and one of the most widely read political commentators of his time.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 173 ====] However some Civil Servant had to type out the stuff he had sent Cripps. This secretary's first allegiance would not be to the Prime Minister but to his superior Civil Servants so he passed theinformation on. Thereupon an official (permanent of course) came to Churchill and said - \"But Mr. Churchill that can't be done.\" So Churchill knew he must either pass that message to Cripps or have the government thrown out of office, and a new election. He can perhaps be excused for not being honest as M. [Note: Raymond] Poincare (who after all was President) had been in the previous war, and successfully as it happened in that one case, where he defied the whole Masonic Organization and got aCatholic - Foche [Note: Ferdinand Foch] - to accept the leadership or the army on his terms. (I could tell you that tale in detail if you wanted to use it.) But Churchill toed the line feeling I suppose the importance at the moment and the risks in the change in the party control in Parliament. So he toed the line.

Then the accomplishments in thisparticular line go ahead with leaps and bounds till we gaze with amazement at the results. Page 773 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoWe have illustrations of this in music. Human beings in all stages of development have taken satisfaction in music as distinguished from noise but the development of this wonderful field was very slow till the law - a purely mathematical one - of the conservation of rhythm - was understood. Whenwe learned that noise resulted from the interference of sound waves with each other and the consequent destruction of sound and that the sounds that we derived pleasure from were such combinations as reinforced each other so that they went on to infinity, immediately there began a development of the art of music which is one of the miracles of the present time. A hundred years has done what all the thousand of years preceding did not begin to do. There is a great moral lesson in this. Let us try to learnthis fundamental lesson and in whatever we are doing search out the controlling law. Music is a time art measured by rhythm. To satisfy the human soul these units must be preserved and must be so used as to reinforce each other, for destruction is painful to us but evidences of continuity are a joy and inspiration. Architecture is a space art. Let us search out its basic law. Is it not the conservation of space. As in music we rejoice in being made conscious of time, one of the great fundamental elementsin our present creation, and in [Note: ==== Beginning of page 177 ====] being made aware of infinity through the preservation of rhythm, as in architecture and landscape architecture which are but interdependent elements of one field, we rejoice in being made conscious of space and can be satisfied only when the space units we use reinforce each other and a feeling of spaciousness is obtained. In a building or in a community a huddle and a clutter of unrelated units is asdistressing as a harsh sound. Let us illustrate this principle so simple yet so vital, capable of so many and so varied results. The first problem in this field is that of the smallest unit in our life today, one family. We take it in its simplest distinct form. We must concentrate our attention on present requirements and conditions for the family lives in a community amply able from its industrial development to provide effective shelter andcomfortable living, though from its wasteful handling of community earnings individuals must use utmost economy in their family life. We will illustrate simply the point we are making of the conservation of space. Every family requires provision for the entire isolation of its individual members. This is provided in the bedrooms which should be directly accessible without passing through any other room and all of which should have direct access to the bathroom. Similarly the working quarters shouldbe isolated, and so concentrated as to save as many steps as possible and, for the same economy of labor, in closest possible connection with the dining room. Apart from these private needs the quarters to be used in common should be so arranged as to help each out in as many ways as possible, for increasing floor space, for giving feeling of openness, for charming vistas. Where utmost economy is necessary we can still get a good sized living room by using the floor space that would be required for asmall living room and a small dining room as one room, for in fact while a family is using a dining room the living room is empty and vice verse. With a little more leeway, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 178 (table of contents) ====] Page 774 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoCOMSTOCK 2 STORY HOUSE [Note: The structure is the Hurd Comstock House II.] LIVING ROOM . STORY & A HALF . OF THE OTHER COMSTOCK HOUSE [Note: The structure is the Hurd Comstock House I.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 179 ====] putting the two rooms together in the form of an L adds a little bit of mystery. With a house a bit larger a half story level scheme given opportunity for a large living room with high ceiling which its greater proportions prevent being inharmonious, with dining room and perhaps library opening out from the higher level giving at the same time seclusion to these rooms and a delightful feeling of openness to thewhole. This arrangement is very economical and a very convenient one giving practically the advantages of both a two-story and a one story house, and making possible a variation in the heights of the ceiling of those of various sizes eliminating the unpleasant proportions that sometimes arise from carrying through the same level from large rooms to small rooms, and at the same time getting the feeling of openness and distance, an in addition an emphasis as pleasing in building as in any art. From the single house we will go to the problem that arises when we have two families to consider. Advantages to each can be gained if they work together. A striking example of the feeling of spaciousness to be gained by intelligent use of the space at one's command is given by walking down one of the streets of Evanston where the lots and houses of approximately the same size are all placed at the same distance from the other, the only idea being to get the most out of one's own lot no matter whatthe consequences to the neighbor. As a consequence they all look crowded and cramped for yard space, till we come to two houses that were built at the same time with the intention of making a bit of music, instead or noise. Here in spite of the fact that the size of the lots and houses is the same, we suddenly feel that there is ample space for garden and setting, and all because the two houses have thrown their open space together, and have located themselves on the further sides of their respective lots. Thismeans of course that an architectural problem must be solved, so that the living rooms of each house may have equally desirable exposures, but there is no difficulty about [Note: ==== Beginning of page [180] ====] [Note: Supplied title: Unidentified structure This illustration is located at this point in the text in the New-York Historical Society copy.

[Note: ==== Beginning of page 181 ====] [Note: Continued from page 179] this if one is but willing to take the pains. It means of course that the one house cannot as a rule be a duplicate of the other. With this arrangement each house has an open space to look out on twice the sizeof what it has with the other method. The manner of solving this problem varies with the size of the lots, and the nature of the buildings to be erected, but there is always an advantage to be gained by working together. Allen Ravines [Note: Decatur, Illinois] was the pleasant problem of a piece of property owned by a family [Note: the Mueller family] of brothers who, with their wives and children, wanted cottages fortheir summer outings, and decided to build on this charmingly picturesque bit of woodland. Each family by this arrangement has its own cabin secluded to be built so as to destroy as little as possible of the wild beauty and so as to get as great a view as possible of the river with trails leading to each cabin from the large building nearer the main road which serves for accommodation house and entertainment quarters for the whole group. Here is the common garage and caretaker's home in connection withwhich is the farm for raising vegetables, fruit, etc., for the whole group. Next is the small suburban group far enough out from the city center to make land values low enough to use for garden farming - a group of five farms [Note: Emory group, Wheaton, Illinois] with buildings so placed as to bring service portions together making it possible to emphasize the park-like effect of the whole. We are able now to make some comparisons that will in a rather surprising way illustrate the main point we are making. As in the time art, the bringing together of sounds does not constitute the making of music, so in Town planning the sub-division of space into units cannot be considered as anything but noise, and is not Town Planning at all until these units have all been brought together into harmonious relation to each other, and this law of conservation of space has been observed as in music the soundwave must be conserved. Some illustrations will make this clear. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 182 (typescript) / 181 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . MR. HOLLISTER .

Kruty \"Walter Burley Griffin in America\" (1996) p. 37 refer to a John Dickinson House built in Hollister, California.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 183 ====] Ridge Quadrangles [Note: Evanston, Illinois] is a really startling example of what a little geometry will do. I shall not blame anyone who refuses to believe what I say because we ourselves could not believe our eyes till we measured and counted over and over again. However we have had similar evidence so often that we are beginning to take it as a matter of course that the more reckless we are in insisting on our ideals the more economical is the result in terms of cold cash. In other words it is only when we work for ideal ends that we achieve practical results. When brought into the office it had been laid out asshown by the small scale drawing. The alley so unnecessary in a residence district had been left out. It was the intention to build two-family apartments on all the 50 foot lots. The long axis of the houses was placed parallel to the street and the houses staggered giving light and outlook on 3 or 4 directions instead of the usual 2. By substituting domestic ways for one thoroughfare and somewhat diminishing the depth of lots one acre parks in the smaller blocks and a five acre park in the larger block were obtained. Theincreased value given to all the lots would probably build a comfortable club house. In contrast with this residence subdivision on perfectly flat land is the one at Grinnell [Note: Iowa] where the somewhat rolling ground of the town as a whole becomes ravine like in character. This again offers a striking illustration of the impractical nature of the so-called practical ways of doing things which method, fixing the attention on a few immediate issues fails to see beyond its nose and, curiouslyenough, fails in consequence to accomplish even the ends it is centered on. Another illustration of the fact that a part cannot be right unless the whole is right, the health of the parts being dependent on the health of the whole. The real estate man having decided that the rectangular method of sub-division is the one which gives him the best results and being a thoroughly practical man, continued the straight streets across this property, and had actually sold [Note: ==== Beginning of page 184 ====] several lots before he realized the difficulty he was getting into, for when it came to putting in service, as sewers bumping up hill and down dale with the streets it became evident that it was prohibitively expensive as the pipes for the higher lots would have to be lowered to the lowest point or there wouldbe backing up of the sewage in the lower houses. So the problem was brought to a technical man for solution. By making the streets follow the bottom of the ravines these difficulties and extravagances were entirely overcome. By recognition of the nature of the location which made it essentially a residence district the waste of alleys and unnecessarily wide pavements was eliminated. When the lots were laid out it was found that instead of 57 lots half of 75' frontage and half of 50' there were 66, that is9 more and all but two of them having the larger frontage of 75', the average depth being the same as in the previous arrangement. That is there was an increase of 30% in the salable frontage which, taking the prices previously set increased the profits of the sale by $15,000. In addition all the houses were located on the higher land, none in the hole, and the whole took on the look of a park and became in consequence the most attractive district in the town. Page 777 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoAnd so it goes. In Vanderhoof, [Note: British Columbia,] Canada, desiring to squeeze the last penny of profit out of the sale of lots first ignoring and afterward respecting the nature of the ground, they were laying out the streets with narrow blocks, cutting the property to pieces with cross streets necessitatingsteep gardens in numerous cases and with no park space. In these days such niggardliness is not to be tolerated even if the profits are to be increased but again that was not the case. By placing the civic center and municipal centers so that they could be reached directly by a system of radiating streets following the ravines many of the gross [Note: cross?] streets became entirely unnecessary, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 185a ====] easy gradients were obtained everywhere, the depths of the blocks were increased till almost without exception all the blocks had interior parks, while at the same time the private allotments were increased from 130' to 150' in depth, and when the count of lots was made there were still as many as before. So naturally the clients would have no objection to the advantages to be offered to buyers, nor to the economies in road construction. Out of another purely real estate proposition on the flat range lands of [Note: Idalia,] Florida, without losing any lots, we squeezed in for the benefit of the community a central park, a civic center with ample grounds, circular gateway park and open vistas down several of the streets, across the widest expanse of the river. We go from this to a problem that is frequently before our big municipal centers, the Quarter Section. [Note: A very similar essay on \"Architecture\" will be found in Section II, No. 23., pages 374-381.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 185 (table illustration's placement here is based in part on the location indicated in the New-YorkHistorical Society typescript.

The religion of democracy requires that the opportunities for complete development shall be open on even terms to all human beings born into this earthly sphere. The basis essential for accomplishing this is that natural resources - made by no man therefore no man's property - should be open to the use of all. In a society based on this simple justice all children would find ample facilities for such constant contact with nature as to assure them physical health, mental stimulus and moral enlightenment. Failing in this, the least we can do is to provide all children with access to open spaces for the play which is a vital necessity for their development; especially when we find that such playgrounds can be provided without any increased expenditure at all. The accompanying are illustrations of two methods of subdivisions of city property, one the generally accepted method providing no playground space at all except the streets, and the other providing suchplayground space. The slight modification as shown in this illustration gives playground space in direct connection with every home, five acres in the interior of the large block and one acre in each of the smaller blocks. This increase in common playground space is obtained by modification of the street system which leaves the same number of allotments on which are the same number of houses of the same dimensions, and slightly diminishing the depth of the allotments. In this subdivision there is ample provision for thorough traffic in the exterior roads. The domestic uses to which the property is put renders the cross road unnecessary for rapid traffic and becomes [Note: ==== Beginning of page 187 (table of contents) ====] RIDGE QUADRANGLES .

For the eliminated thoroughfare there was substituted a T shape of lanes eliminating interior thoroughfares and establishing 3 interior parkplaygrounds. In the resubdivision there are the same number of allotments. The children do not have to cross any dangerous roads to reach play grounds or school. Buildings ordinarily have outlook on only two sides. With preplanning they can have outlook on all four sides Page 779 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: This page is from the second copy of the Art Institute of Chicago's typescript (AIC2).] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 189 ====] [Note: Continued from page 186] purely a menace to the children, an expense in useless pavement, a nuisance in barrenness and dust.The rearrangement, recognizing the domestic character of the district, while keeping the opposite building lines the full 60' apart to maintain as much openness as in the case of the wider street, reduces the width of pavement to that required by the service of a domestic community. By placing the buildings crosswise instead of lengthwise and staggering them, instead of getting light on only the two narrow sides of the building, we get light, ventilation and outlook from at least three and usually four sides ofthe residence, giving every lot, through this openness, the appearance and advantages of greater size. This arrangement places the playgrounds under the eye of every mother, and no street has to be crossed by the children in reaching it. Since these playgrounds have no street frontage and have not increased the lengths of the streets and service systems, these playgrounds have cost nothing and the money saved by the decreased pavement required can be used for the development and upkeep of these parks. One of these lots can well be used for a community House for the use of the whole neighborhood giving facilities for reading, music, drama, dancing. When we realize that such advantages can be gained in our communities with no increased expenditure our neglect to provide our community with lungs becomes inexcusable.

Their not having been done simply goes to show that human beings amble through life without bothering to think. What we usually dub thinking in an off hand way is purely an automatic process. Indeed even highly developed reasoning may become automatic. But here we are not considering ordinary thinking but creative thinking, thinking which diverges from the straight beaten paths into curves, devious, surprising, charming; thinking that calls for action and consummation in deeds. Wemust learn to think in terms of the future. But now we meet with magic. Nature is so full of magic that one wonders how men can be so hum-drum. But it is only because man standing as he does outside of nature can choose either way, the stupid or the inspired. Here it was that I was awakened to the magic that can lie in town planning if it escapes from the boundaries of what is being done. The plan as originally brought to Mr. Griffin for co-operative development for 200 families in 100 two family buildings had, to be sure, eliminated the wasteful alley giving that much additional living outdoor space. A common heating plant for the group was also incorporated which facilitated other community services. An equipment duct extended continuously through the basements of the buildings involving no additional excavation, obviating not only street pipes but all stubs and connections, accessiblethroughout, conservative of heat and preventing of all leakage of other forms of energy or deterioration of the pipes. Griffin gave one look at it and handed it over to me with instructions to carry the center street only half way and there put a transverse street across the property, reducing the widths of these streets since they were no longer thoroughfares, and to make the lots 100 feet deep. I did so and found there had sprungup three interior parks, seven acres in all. I counted the number of houses, now [Note: ==== Beginning of page 193 ====] staggered instead of all on one building line and found there were the same number, including the clubhouse, as in the original plan which had no park space nor but a tiny alley like strip if you reducedthe lot depths to 100 feet. Thinking I must have counted wrong I added them again. The same answer. I presented it to Mr. Griffin expressing my astonishment but there was no surprise there. It was, \"Yes of course.\" It took no more than that to make me accept immediately when it was later presented to me, the fact that the Spirits of Mathematics are the great primeval creative Spirits - the Elohim.

TWO FLAT BUILDING [Note: The New-York Historical Society illustration indicates that this two flat building was designed for Albert Cohn.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page [195] ====] TOTALITARIANISM VERSUS WHAT Totalitarianism versus what? On that \"what\" our modern type of thinking has shattered. One would be in despair (as apparently all our communities are) if one hadn't glimpsed the fact that, though rational thinking does not suffice for the solving of life problems, there can be creative thinking. Some time ago rational thinking was discovered by two men independently, Abraham and Aristotle. That kind of thinking sufficed for a millennium or two, supplemented occasionally by genius (a kind of intuitive thinking, really a gift of the gods). Nowadays no one understands intuitive thinking so the godsare ceasing to give these gifts. Now we have to learn them. And rational thinking cannot solve life's problems. Rational thinking was necessary for a period to accomplish a quite different end, to make Page 782 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagofreedom possible. But now the creation of a new type of thinking is as urgent as the creation of rational thinking was for the periods beginning with Abraham and Aristotle. To comprehend totalitarianism it is necessary, as with all polarities, to know its polar opposite. Without down there can be no up, nor an inside without an outside nor matter without spirit. Totalitarianism is but the latest phase of Hebraic thinking, of rational thinking. To get rid of Hebraic thinking, if current methods were to be generally adopted, one would have to banish from the earth all westerners as versus Easterners whose gods are multiple whereas the western God is unity, the God of Abraham, the God of nature, the Father God. This oneness is the God to which logical thinking leadsus. It is the Hebraic as versus the Christian God. With the coming of the Christ the concept of Threeness arose in religion. Two thousand years have passed and men have not grasped it yet. For some 1,500years faith sufficed to carry humanity, but the last 500 years have destroyed the power of faith. Rational thinking has no place for faith and under [Note: ==== Beginning of page 196 ====] the domination of logic our human communities are now disintegrating. Our only sound foundation, the next step in evolution to succeed faith, is knowledge, and rational thinking does not lead to knowledge, it leads only to self-confidence, a necessary step in evolution as it is the basis of free will , but free will can function only destructively unless supplemented by knowledge . That is the twoness, the duality, essential for this period of human evolution. Now what is the present foundation stone of knowledge? It is the concept of trinity. The primordial concept of Trinity was the gift of the God Christ. (In the period of the Greek civilization.) All knowledge derives from concepts. Animals cannot gain knowledge because only to man was that primordial concept directly given, the concept - causality. That was the gift of the Father God and through perception (also directly given) all nature is the school through which we can gradually come to a comprehension of causality, oneness. Two was the number first created, the creator and the created -two. (Before that there was neither unity nor multiplicity.) From this we derive the concept of one. With these developed we can attain to threeness numerically first and later, with divine help, to Trinity which constitutes a true unity, as in a circle which consists of a center, a radius of definite length and a circumference - a true unity. The gift of the Christ was the concept of the Primordial Trinity - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (that light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world). From that time there ceased to be different races, only individual differences. So the polar opposite of Totalitarianism, of oneness, is Trinity, true unity. The time is ripe for our developing our Societies on Christian instead of Hebraic lines. And nowhere do we see that being done for all our states by whatever name they are being called, are Totalitarian. They divide into two groups,one efficient and so arresting our attention and very convincing to our logical habits of Page 783 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 197 (table of contents) ====] ENTRANCE GATES TO MUELLER GROUP [Note: The New-York Historical Society illustration adds to the end of the title \"M.M.\" The MuellerHouses are in Millikin Place, Decatur, Illinois.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 198 ====] thinking - including Russia, Italy, Germany; the other muddlers with no convictions so no clear thinking nor purpose, including America, England, France, consciously or unconsciously moving toward the logical conclusion. In all alike there is no way for the three functions of a society to carry on in accordance with their own peculiar necessities and laws. We have however an example of the healthy working of a trinity placed before us in the constitution of man himself where the Father God, whose gift is natural man, has established the assimilative and limb system to do the work of the body as it does in the animal; where the Christ has given us the heart system to maintain balance, equity; where the Holy Spirit has given us the head and nerve system to develop pure thinking and to comprehend brotherhood. With this pattern before us we should at least be willing to accept as proved that a trinity is practical and workable and in the face of the chaos about us give it a trial, and nowhere are conditions so favorable for a trial as in America, the land of adventurers. You will notice that man has no central organization. He is not a being who has but a being who consists of the interplay of three independently functioning organizations, body, soul, and spirit, though the fruits of the activities of each are used by all. So must it be for health in a human society, as so must it be with a circle, or a tonic chord. Abraham's rational thinking led him to a oneness as God, and to this religion we are still subscribers, unity as versus multiplicity, the West versus the East. Aristotle's thinking led him into the material realm and his logic gave the same answer there - causality. Both functioned in the realm of cause and effect where cause precedes effect, the realm of rational thinking, one centering on cause, the other on effect. But man does not belong here. He forms a purpose. The effect precedes [Note: ==== Beginning of page 199 ====] the cause. The mineral kingdom lives in the past, the animal in the moment, man in the future. To these, the one the concept of the material, of the body, of individual abilities, and the other the concept of cause, of thinking, of the Spiritual, we must add the balance, the Christ, the concept of equity, of morals. With the word \"Altruism\" more than a century old now, we should begin to act on that concept and establish our societies accordingly, a trinity with each organization manned by the whole Page 784 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocitizenry of the country, first a Political Organization whose function and only function is the maintenance of Rights, that modern conception of equality of man in the Rights realm. Only so can man's moral nature function in the solution of social problems - through having an organization which can express the moral standard of the community, expressed by the majority, democratic in its form and not muddled by conflicting elements which have their proper field elsewhere, as liberty, but which have no place in the realm of equity, of morals. Thus it could become apparent that the difficulties arising in the realm of capital derive from lack of clear thinking. The problem is how to transform the circulation of capital, not its distribution, so that it may not be something oppressive. The evils of capital derive not from capital per se, not from its ownership by private individuals as versus ownership by the community as a whole, or the State, but from its ownership as versus the right to use it. And we should grasp that capital, and so all the advantages that come from it, can be created only bythe spiritual capacities, or the abilities, either spiritual or physical, of individuals and therefore that capital for use should be available for all ability, but not ownership which would give the iniquitous (the inequitable) privilege to individuals or State of placing capital in the hands of those who have not the ability to use it advantageously, productively. Of all forms of Capitalism, the State owned capital is the most disastrous [Note: ==== Beginning of page 200 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . ROBERT MUELLER . Marion Mahony & Herman Architects [Note: ==== Beginning of page 201a ====]and ultimately can have no efficiency. And so we should understand the necessity for a second organization, that of Abilities, whose concern would be that everyone should be completely free to use his own abilities in his own way for only he can have any means of knowing what they are or how they can be used. Ability is a function of the individual, not of the state. This, the Body Organization, would not concern itself at all with morals or equity. Its whole interest, its whole value, is in the realm of Freedom which has no connection with Equity. The Political Organization, the State, the Moral Organization, would require that capital be kept in constant use, as well as money. The Trinity - man - consists of Spirit, Soul and Body, so in a Society a third organization is essential, the Co-operative Organization holding a middle position between the moral realm, that of Equity, that of the Christ, and the realm of liberty, of man's rational thinking powers. This Third Realm, that of buying and selling, is bounded on the one side by Nature, the Christ (The Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof) demanding in the last resort that all men shall have Equity in this realm; and on the other side by Capital which is the manifestation of man's spirit in the material Page 785 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagorealm. This third realm is where Thinking safeguards Nature. So we attain Equity, Fraternity and Liberty each in its totality where it has any significance. The realm of Abilities in form is necessarily hierarchical as ability derives from the individual.The realm of Economics is that of Mutuality and consists of the interplay of multitudinous Economic Associations and, in its totality, contains exact knowledge, based on experience, of all sides of Economic affairs. I sell to you because it is to my advantage to get rid of it, you buy because it is of advantage to you to have it. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 201b ====] Thus the alternative to Totalitarianism is the Threefold Commonwealth . Through this we can satisfy the moral requirements of our time based on Equal Human Rights , can attain complete Freedom in the use of individual abilities and an Efficiency not possible in either a muddled or an enslaved community. We can have that which is not possible in a Totalitarian State, democracy and a planned community for the latter is a function not of the Political but of the Economic Organ and can be either national or international. With the control of money in this latter and so constituted that it will grow old like thecommodities it measures, it will become a true medium of exchange and it will be possible to establish true prices, for money in this realm cannot be played with for it will not be based on abstract numbers as it is at present but expressed in terms of tangible values, as so many pounds of wheat, etc., which will take the curse out of it. In order to attain economic efficiency, for a community to be efficient, it is not necessary that individuals should own capital which method gives rise to a tendency to pass capital on to inefficient people. What is necessary is that individuals should have the use of capital. So the elimination of the ownership of capital so long as it is complete and abolishes State ownership as well as private ownership will bring about not only as efficient but a more efficient social system. Access for use can and should be given in as large amounts as are required for maximum efficiency. Thus if an entity has a function to fulfill, itmust have an organ to fulfill it. If it has 3 different functions to fulfill it must have 3 organs to fulfill them. So it must be with human societies. Thus is the conflict between the East and the West brought to an end, the polarity resolved into a trinity, the Earth become a true Unity. At the present moment the soundest step would be the co-operation of America and Asia bringing together the Political and Economic elements leaving the madness of Europe, the Will Group, to cool and ultimately take its placein the WORLD ORGANIZATION.

Walter Burley Griffin before the VICTORIAN ARCHITECTS . AUSTRALIA Engineering is the basis of architecture under the American system and has been till very recently the dominating influence. The great advance that architecture has made is not in the field of academic and scholastic architecture but in engineering feats, and the complaint I have to register is that these engineering feats have not been accompanied by adequate architectural development, that they have not been led by architecture and made to express architecture or the fundamentals of architecture. Our education in architecture is a reminiscence of Feudalism, as Louis H. Sullivan has expressed it, which iscarrying into a time of democracy, the real essential mental attitude of the Middle Ages, looking to authority for our beliefs and thoughts. To my mind democracy should be the essential of our thought. We have realized the democratic trend for a long time now in politics especially but we have not begun to follow it into other phases of life where the necessity is not so plain. Democracy as I define it is independence of thought. Democracy in politics is independence of action, but action must be dominatedby thought, and unless our thought is independent we are still in a feudalistic environment. The trouble with our education is that it has brought conventions in as authority and these conventions are the first thing that the student is taught. The first thing that he is brought into contact with in architecture is the classic \"order\" universal in European civilization. It was my own experience. I went through the mill and I would probably have followed the lines others had if I had not had the advantage of contact withan independent thinker in Chicago, Mr. Louis H. Sullivan. His emphasis was always laid on the essential connection between the structure and the use to which the building was to be put, and the expression of it in form. In other words \"Form follows function\" is the slogan Sullivan laid down years ago, evolved in his own experience [Note: following reading from N-YHS] gained in practice as a draftsman with freedom from trammels [Note: ==== Beginning of page 205 (table of contents) ====] Page 787 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 of ChicagoLIVING ROOM . ROBERT MUELLER [Note: ==== Beginning of page 206 ====] in his early days, coupled with a brief training at the Ecole de Beaux Arts for general laws. The basis of my idea is an assumption that I have seen laid down that every child born onto the earth is a genius in one of three directions, either as a scientist in the observation of nature - an investigator of the truths of nature - or an inventor - an experimenter and contriver of mechanical processes - or an artist who gives form to these utilitarian things. And teachers in the primary stages of education are willing to corroborate that assumption. They find numerous evidences. There has been poetry composed by immature children equal to anything that is written in the language, but a few years of school training isall that is required to obliterate any sparks of ingenuity or any gleam of truth of expression in those children. They are taught that the other man has set an ideal, that the other man has expressed a thought, and that he is unapproachable. After this has been sufficiently impressed on the mind of the pupil it is enough to kill any originality or freedom to do good work. We have our necessities in construction which are well recognized. Our materials have changed even in the last ten years. In the last 25 years conditions have altered so completely from those of preceding times that we can hardly find a way to adapt the preceding architecture to the present conditions, yet the greatest ingenuity of architects of the present day is just in that direction. The results are usually incongruous, very difficult to explain or excuse. Nor with the idea that the Greek or Goth or some other highly educated peoples have said the final word in architecture are we going to be able to express ouridea in steel and concrete. We are building better buildings to-day, finer inside and out, then any people that we have any knowledge of in history and yet we acknowledge that the architecture of those buildings cannot approach anything in Medieval France or in Ancient Greece. With that attitude we cannot [Note: ==== Beginning of page 207 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . ADOLPH MUELLER . Marion Mahony & Herman von Holst . Architects [Note: ==== Beginning of page 208 ====] get very far ahead. I take it we shall have to abandon the hypothesis. The difficulty is to put that into practice in the schools. I have heard it said, \"What would you do? Would you give students blank pieces of paper and expect them to concoct magnificent designsforthwith without looking up the books?\" I would not expect anybody to create a magnificent design in the beginning, and I do not think the pupil need to set out to do such a thing. I was taught, and the education of my time was, that the students should have big problems to work out to give themselves a chance to express the best there was in architecture before they were forced to go into a life of building Page 788 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowarehouses, residences and railroad stations. I think the sequence ought to be reversed. My first problem in actual practice was a poultry house. (laughter) If I were to go in for teaching architecture I would put that difficulty, or something similar, up to a pupil as his first example and then let him buildup from the bottom. It would not tax his ingenuity probably to build a poultry house a little better that he had seen. (hear, hear, and laughter) And after that he would take a second step in architecture. My second problem was a stable, a small one. (laughter) That was fortunate. It was the right process. I did not have to borrow anything to start with, and I started with necessities alone. The total investment was 60 dollars in the first building and 300 dollars in the second. If you divide those figures by five you willknow what they represent in your money. (laughter) Convention is not a proper basis for art. Art is not something that is put on to buildings or on to canvas or anywhere applied but it is the doing of some necessary thing in the best way that can be devised to do that thing; and erecting a building in concrete, for instance, will mean the investigating of the possibilities of construction, of surface treatment, of economical handling, of scale, of color, of form,rhythm, and proportion that can be brought to [Note: ==== Beginning of page 209 ====] apply on the material for the particular purpose it has to serve. I said I was glad that the schools in the United States had been so closely allied with the Engineering Schools, and I think therein will be their salvation; not that engineering will dominate, but that it will be just the other way when its essential relationship to architecture has been understood. The jerry builder, I take it, is a natural product of architecture as it is taught. (laughter & applause) In the first place the architect does not stoop to solve the problem of the jerry builder's attempts to get the maximum result for the least money, but when the architect does get really down to that bedrock principle he is able to drive out the jerry builder. I have had some experience in putting enough time into the study of a \u00a3400 working man's cottage to make it cheaper than the jerry builder could make it, andget more results for the same money, and that sort of thing has led to a repetition of that particular design. Then I found that combining house units and working them out in what appeared to me to be the most economic way the largest problems could be solved, with results no jerry builder ever thought of, in the correlating of groups for convenience and effectiveness [Note: N-YHS substitutes \"attractiveness\"] around the garden cities of England, where an effort to compete has been made, thejerry builder's sale sign does not bring its result. The people are going into these communities that have been carefully, economically and scientifically planned, and are leaving the jerry builder high and dry. Architecture, as it has been taught, is based on convention, and is thus a cult which the man on the street is not initiated into, and while we suggest the glory that was Greece, or the splendor that was Rome, he knows nothing of what we are driving at, and consequently becomes disinterested in the whole subjectand indifferent. It is a remarkable fact that savage people build well and beautifully. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 210 (table of contents) ====] Page 789 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright . ADOLPH MUELLER . LIVING ROOM [Note: ==== Beginning of page 211 ====] We cannot find a sample of savage building or even or animals erecting such monstrosities as some of our structures. They have no architectural cult. Architecture is so real and necessary a thing in primitivelives that the average man takes an interest in it, which accounts for the beauty of a Polynesian village as compared [Note: \"with\" inserted in N-YHS] the Colonial Settlement alongside. Everywhere that primitive man has constructed he has done so with the idea or beauty of architecture, hand in hand with the idea of construction, proving to me that there is an intuitive quality in the human mind, that the human mind has the faculty of judging rhythm, of rhyme, of these beauties that are poetical; that itdemands those things in its work, but when it is diverted in its appreciation of architecture, to things which are irrelevant, it becomes confused, and finally it abandons the whole thing to the architect or takes what it can get without the architect, because it does not understand what the architect is trying to give it. The architect is trying to teach [Note: reach?] too much. Ferguson [Note: James Fergusson?] said that architecture died in the year 1500, and I think that the corroborative evidence is very strong.Before that time architecture to count had to be homogeneous. If we are going to have architecture count for anything in a city we shall need to have a common basis running through all buildings. Where the architect is permitted, as he is by his cult, to take his authority from wherever he pleases, he is bound to disagree with his colleagues as to which precedent to adopt, and will put his Gothic design alongside the other's Classic building, and we have not seen a place where we have been able to prevent that. Sowhatever beauty one has got into his own building is nullified by the contrasting beauty of an adjoining one. No wonder \"the man in the street\" is \"up in the air.\" He gets no effect. He sees 2 buildings, and we cannot get him into the habit of looking at one facade at a time. He is very apt also to look at the back end of the building. Another hypothesis taken, which is [Note: ==== Beginning of page 212 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . ADOLPH MUELLER . GARAGE [Note: ==== Beginning of page 213 ====] not borne out by the facts of the case, is that architecture is confined to the one side. (laughter) The question of genius, it seems to me, answers itself when we go back to the year 1500, and see architecture as it was practiced without cult or without self-consciousness, and where the average is highthere genius does not appear, and does not have to appear. Perhaps the word genius is simply an expression of low average. (laughter) The basis of our study, I think, is Nature itself. If we can go into Nature that has been undefiled by man we can get beauty equal to that of any primitive architecture, or we have the architecture of the plants and of the animals, where nature's laws are allowed to work themselves out. These laws are inviolate in the emphasis of structural necessity, and taking advantage of Page 790 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagonatural conditions, and expressing those conditions with the maximum possibility. The law of the survival of the fittest dictates that. (hear, hear) [Note: ==== Beginning of page 214 (table of contents) ====] TURN ABOUT OF STUB END STREET [Note: The caption to the New-York Historical Society illustration reads in part, \"Mueller Turn About . 3 Dwellings on Each Side of Stub End Street\".] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 215 ====] THE JAPANESE TYPEThe Japanese type with the overhanging eaves brought low to form the window heads is about the only thing we see in [Note: Frank Lloyd] Wright's work except where he saw say some European architect doing something quite different in which case he jumped in with some such form in order to claim it as coming from himself. But such work as Le Corbusier's is properly speaking not architecture at all. It is engineering, bare bones, and though it may meet the physical needs of men does not solve the spiritualproblem at all. It lacks the spirit of mathematics, the spirit of music. The overhanging roof takes two forms, the hip and the gable. Which is used depends on the fenestration. It cannot be reduced to a rule of thumb. If the plan in developing results in corner piers grace can be most easily attained by using a gable roof whereas with windows grouped in the corners the hip can be used without forcing an extreme overhanging which is really a refusal to recognize naturalstructural laws, in a sense an uncalled for defiance of the noble laws of gravity. When the roof recedes to form the wall line it is in essence a flat roof though the method of the disposal of the water requires slopes which may sometimes be visible as a hip. With the very simple forms often imposed by a small flat roofed house they are often much more effective, powerful, in reality than can appear in a picture rendering, as in the case with the Egyptian pyramids. In the reality they are breathtaking if the spirit ofmathematics is there. When a true creative work has been done it is a permanent thing. It consists in bringing into form harmonious with cosmic laws the other etheric formative forces. From that time on this creation is accessible to all human beings, in the material world if they are limited to observation by their physical senses but in the etheric world if they can function inspirationally. It is a curious thing how unfruitfulWright's work has been apparently because of the poison of his spirit of personality and [Note: ==== Beginning of page 216 ====] possession which kills the spiritual things. This is a great pity but the influence of [Note: Louis H.] Sullivan and Griffin has spread far and wide and now that the Wright incubus has been shed modern architecture, creative architecture, is taking root. It is long overdue. The men of this period should be Page 791 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothinking creatively, spiritually, though creative work is always in the nature of sacrifice. It is the giving of oneself and to be wholesome must be wholehearted, not niggardly. And the world should not be buffaloed by claims to spiritual works, they are the gift of the Gods not the work of men. The difference in the two attitudes is expressed in the difference of the constitution of the two offices. Griffin's office from the very start was completely democratic, that is based on equity with no hang-over of European imperialism. The draftsmen were always free to do their own work in their own time in or out of the office knowing it would arouse no objectional feeling but would get helpful advice if they wanted it. When a draftsman developed a clientele of his own he could enter into a democraticpartnership with the office so that he did not have to cease earning a salary and face the risks of the early stages of establishing a private practice. Later he was under no compulsion if he wanted to separate from that partnership. The resulting standard of the outgoing or instaying young architects was remarkable. One who went out was Mr. Taylor who sat in the offices in America of Hollywood designing sets which have had great influence in the architecture. One who stayed in was Mr. [Note: Eric M.] Nichollswho in his early days did some remarkable things, one a multi parallelepipedon pyramidal design for a war memorial, and who is now carrying on a fine practice in Australia based on the no compromise with one's principles, which was true of the whole of Griffin's lifetime practice.

The top of the cove is placed 17 inches below the ceiling. There is a total wattage consumption of 200 watts, or .67 watt per square foot.This furnishes the entire illumination for the room, with an easy reading intensity of light. The piano portable lamp is for use when it is not desired to illuminate the entire room, but simply to read the sheet music. In the illumination of the home, the architect and illuminating engineer comes closer in contact with his client than in any other branch of his work. He is given a chance to work up many original anddecorative ideas embodying special features which will harmonize with the general decorative scheme of the various rooms. Until recently, practically no attention was paid to the lighting of these rooms when drawing up the specifications. This matter was left to the owner, who generally seemed to hold the opinion that the room which is best lighted is most lighted. As a result, a great many of our otherwise beautiful homesare glaring examples of inefficient lighting, which are not even comfortable to sit in. Corrected practice dictates that some way be devised to conceal the bare lamp from view. It is also believed that well diffused illumination very largely minimizes the effect of glare and deep shadows making for a soft, efficient light.

Play is what we do for the sheer joy of doing it, the fascination of using our abilities. These two, natural resources and human ability, create values and are the source of wealth - land plus spirit. We recognize that land is a gift of the Gods and the fairies and can belong to no man though each and all have equal right to use it so long as they do not injure nor destroy it. The fairies build the vegetable kingdom but it takes the great primal spirits of mathematics to create the crystals - the universes. To whom do we owe our abilities? Certainly not to our descendants. Nor to our ancestors, but to our own development in past incarnations. The direct attack of labor on land suffices for mere existence. It gives us certain primal commodities for exchange, but not wealth. But with the introduction of spirit, of creative ability, we get capital which can be accumulated; we get technique which brings about division of labor which enormously increases wealth and we get diversified means of production which are the expression of ability , of spirit, in the economic realm. To whom do these means of production which are the result of ability, of play, belong? To our ancestorswe might say. But how can this be put into actual practice, how can we pay this debt? We owe our abilities to our ancestors through inheritance or to the Gods who give these gifts or to our own endeavors in past incarnations for no man during his lifetime originates abilities, he can only develop them. We experience the truth of this in waking out of sleep with a full-fledged invention or aproblem solved. At one time he plays one game and again another. But each one knows those [Note: ==== Beginning of page 223a ====] Page 795 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoparticular abilities were there from the beginning, and no two human beings are alike. We owe our opportunities to develop our abilities to the educational systems established by our predecessors, that is to the community which is the manifested result of the conduct of life of those whohave lived before us. We owe to this community the inspiration that comes from all the creative work they have done in the development of their capacities, in the arts, in science, in religion, that is their manifested life on earth. We owe to the community all we have the opportunity to make use of in the form of tools, of industrial plants, of accumulated inventions, of inspirational undertakings, of means of circling the earth and of choosing our place and mode of life. We owe none of these things to our descendants who gave us nothing, but to the community which is the creation of our ancestors we owe whatever we may have achieved in the way of means of production as our small contribution to their accumulated gifts to us because means of production are the combination of land and ability. Other achievements as works of art, commodities, etc., we have a right to place in the hands of our descendants as an expression of affection if we wish but means ofproduction belong to the community whose duty it is to place them in competent hands so that their management can make them most fruitful. When we recognize this basic fact we shall find the community eager to place in our hands all means necessary to develop ability to the utmost and it will not lay down what line of ability shall be used by any man nor measure his value by the monetary returns that derive from his abilities. Whatever heachieves whether spiritual satisfaction or great wealth will be his so long as he lives. When he dies it will belong to the community who made it possible for his abilities to function, and it will be used to give similar opportunities to all members of the succeeding generation. This will make it possible for the children of the rich man to develop wholesomely, which is rarely the case now [Note: ==== Beginning of page 223b ====] at present, for they will know that only by developing their faculties will they be able to attain great things in any line, accumulation of wealth or otherwise.

In our first lesson we made with our arms the shape of the Cosmic Circle which holds all things.We then drew the shape and inside it made as many drawings as possible, the sun, the moon, the stars the sea, us, etc., in color. (The teacher had prepared large sheets of paper before-hand on which she had drawn with a compass the circle, the drawings were therefore co-operative ones.) Outside the circle we painted blue (water-color). When this was finished we again made the circle shape with our arms, and became acquainted with (a) circle-like motion. (b) Our eyes contain a tiny copy of the circle. We found the secret in the circle, the vertical line, and as this series of lessons was to lead to plant drawing we found as follows. A large piece of paper was given to each child, they creased it down the middle, and painted along the crease (in a color) a vertical line. We made this line swell and grow sideways, teacher painting one side for them, children carefully painting the other side. After this the children invented the first shape themselves. We developed last lessons by making the shape grow as shown(a) a family of shapes (similar to each other) (b) Changing its shape as it grew. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 225 ====] Note - Teacher also drew her shapes on board, using the underlying shapes of leaves, so that children would recognize these again when at a later age they found them in botany. (c) Making the growing shape burst as it grew. Page 797 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago(d) Added to the original shape one of the 4 formative force shapes, using first [Note: sketch of a circle] and then [Note: sketch of an equilateral triangle]. Children invented variations of these (e) and also broke the leaf shape itself into these shapes (f) [Note: sketches of a crescent and a square] (e) (f) They also made free growing patterns with these 4 shapes as basis. We drew these shapes [Note: blank space in N-YHS] on the board and tried completing them with [Note: blank space in N-YHS], and combinations of these, etc. (g) We noticed fairies at work (g) in periods of activity and rest. We tapped out the rhythm. Lastly we invented flower shapes and fruit shapes, using the 3 formative shapes - Kenneth, one of the boys who has always shown a great interest in these and last year's lessons said to me at the beginning of the holidays at the end of the term, \"Please give me the very biggest piece ofpaper you can find, I want to draw the four fairy patterns all through the holidays.\" He brought it back covered with the patterns mostly plant shapes. [Note: This page comes from the second copy of the Art Institute's typescript (AIC2).] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 226 ====] Teacher mentioned to children on last day of term that if they kept their eyes open during the holidays they would find the patterns the fairies had made on the plants, etc. Dear Marion, at present I am very busy having signed a contract with one of the banks to make 36 perspective drawings of new homes for them. 12 to 16 years Geometry (All drawings on colored paper.) We started with the primordial triangle, the equilateral triangle, the artistic triangle from which all other triangles spring. The geometric construction was explained and drawn by girls. The equilateral triangle is capable of perfect growth and the \"opposite\" form of growth was constructed, mention being made of crystalline expansion following this procedure. 4 equi-lateral triangles were next constructed and used as the basis for a perfect pattern - that is - all sides to grow similarly. Pattern colored. Upward growth of equi-lateral triangle, whereby we obtain isosceles triangle.

An online image of the mural can be found at http://www.artic.edu/aic/students/mural_project/pages/M_armstrong.html from The Art Institute's online educational resources project, \"Chicago: The City in Art.\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 229 ====] Initial . Dwelling . Harry E. Gunn . Chicago [Note: See the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.] WITH THE FAIRIES Art is the result of free human nature, and the sense of duty ripens when the human impulse to activity commands materials artistically and with inner freedom. Rudolf Steiner FEEDING THE HERONS When asked to do a mural by the graduating class of June 1931 of the Armstrong School of Chicago, the first thoughts might be of appropriateness from various points of view. From the technical point the work must be correct, that is it must be kept in two dimensions with no creating of illusions as to there being no wall there by clever three dimensional stunts. This is the best lesson in the painting realm that the artist could give to the children because the art of painting has been degraded by this working with Page 799 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothree dimensions which belongs to the arts of sculpture and architecture, just as music is the one dimensional art, sequence. These are the universal languages of space, spirit and time. Color is not a material thing. It is the mediator between spirit and matter, as is the rainbow. This conclusion is confirmed by spiritual investigation through which we learn that painting derives in pre-rational times from direct perception in the etheric realms, the realm of color - two dimensional, non-substantial. And our own experiences of supersensible living pictures confirm this. Such experiences enable us to understand that the superb decorative work of ancient civilizations derive from that different kind of thinking which is now so important for us to learn to use as a supplement to reasonwhich works in only one dimension, for these same etheric forces are the ones which enter into the vegetable kingdom, the life forces which distinguish it from the mineral kingdom. When we have become aware of, can perceive, these forces we are in a position to carry our scientific investigations on from the mineral into the vegetable kingdom, the life realm, which rational science, so-called natural science, cannot do. Not even [Note: Charles] Darwin attempted to go there. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 230 (table of contents) ====] BRINGING FISH TO THE HERONS [Note: The drawing may be a detail of the mural, \"Feeding the Herons,\" at IV.10.228.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 231 ====] \"By art alone is intellect awakened to true life-giving Joy in Earnestness, and Strength of Character in Joy; for Knowledge to be of value, must be permeated with a Love of Knowledge.\" This is why it is so important for children from seven to fourteen to be taught only from the imaginative point of view - through the Arts. Imaginative work does not bring fatigue. Science, Geography, History, should all be presented in art forms. Mathematics too for geometry should precede arithmetic. Since all physical creation consists in pattern making, the mural must hold and stir the mind by its pattern. The children will thus be helped to rest satisfied with their own work only when they themselves have created a pattern in the presentation of their subject. The result will be that observers will not be satisfied with a passing glance and thereafter forget to look again but that every time they pass the picture they will be caught and held and moved by it, and their own creative faculties, which have become almost atrophied in our concentration on mechanization during the so-called scientificperiod will be awakened. Indeed form is the essence of matter, form held by reciprocal forces. The smashing of the atom has confirmed that for they find no matter in the atom - only forces. And then the appropriate subject - the out of doors, the creatures of the open and the spirits that work and rule there, these spirits despised and scorned by the sophisticates of the 19th century but with which the children of the 20th century must come in contact if they are to carry on the evolution of humanity,something by which we can portray these fundamentals to the eye and heart of the child. And what spiritual facts can convince the child. Not wordy moral precepts but a personal intimacy with the Page 800 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoelementals, the tiny ones, for the children love tiny things. So the fairies that up to a certain age any child can see and that we grown-ups can learn to see if we will - the fairies who show the plants how to transform inert mineral matter, the rocks [Note: ==== Beginning of page 232 ====] themselves, into living matter without which no other creature, animal nor man, can exist - the fairies who help the plants to build up cell by cell all the various shapes and colors to carry into effect the designs which great and powerful beings have created and stored within the magic seeds. Again we must convince the minds of the children, warped by the superficialities of our present-day thinking, that they are surrounded not only by a world that they can see and hear and touch with theirphysical senses aided so wonderfully as they are these days by mechanical instruments to extend their field of operations but which can never reach beyond the world of effects; but that they are also surrounded by another world, the world of causes just as diverse, just as rich, just as full of adventure, which they can learn to perceive and in perceiving to enter, and in entering to become a creator in this realm of creation, the world of life. For the same faculty which enables one to see the fairies is the faculty which enables one to do original work in all human realms, and to transform our community, so rich in toys and tools, into a real civilization thereby attaining great and worthwhile ends. For this, human beings must develop their spiritual powers of perception, the basis of a new form of thinking which will enable them to know causes as precisely and as thoroughly as at present they know effects. Painting the mural decoration in the Armstrong School was great fun. One boy said to Miss Reynolds, the principal, \"You sure did hire a good one when you hired Mrs. Griffin. \"I didn't hire her,\" she said, \"I got down on my knees to her.\" And this was the splendid spirit all the way through. The subject was a group of fairies high in a birch tree helping the mother heron to feed the babes in her nest, the father heron winging his way from a distance helped by other fairies to carry more supplies of fish. It was fivefeet high and twenty feet long and I stood on a table to paint it. Miss Reynolds let the youngsters get all [Note: ==== Beginning of page 233 (table of contents) ====] AS DELICATE AS A SPIDER'S WEB [Note: ==== Beginning of page 234 ====] they could out of it and there were daily processions from the various rooms to watch its progress, and free were the discussions, as with the children in my sister's room [Note: Georgine was a teacher at Armstrong], as to whether there really were fairies. One small boy asked Miss Reynolds as she came in the room whether she believed in fairies. \"Why of course I do,\" she answered. One small six year old agnostic was reported to me so I took issue with him. He said his father said there were no fairies. I Page 801 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosaid, \"But who made the flowers and the leaves of the plants?\" He said \"My father said God did.\" I said, \"But if your father manufactured chairs, he would have to have many helpers in his factory; so God has to have many helpers with the many things he creates.\" Two small girls were heard by thelunch-room cook discussing, as they sat on the curbstone, whether there really were fairies. The mural was finished shortly before graduation and Miss Reynolds was good enough sport to let me give a talk to the graduating students in which I explained to them that the kind of thinking that enabled them to see the fairies was the same kind of thinking that made people able to function as geniuses so, if they wanted to be among the geniuses in their work, they must be ready to develop that kind of thinkingwhich someday would enable them to see the fairies. THE WEAVING OF FAIRY AND SPIDER After this visit home with my family in Chicago I returned to Castlecrag to find that one of our young citizens had lost her new baby daughter within a few weeks of her birth. She came to me soon saying she could find no consolation and hoped I could give her some help. She found no comfort in herchurch. She had heard our Mrs. [Note: Edith] Williams speak of Anthroposophy but Mrs. Williams was no longer there. We had been in a German class together so I suggested that we carry on our German study by translating together Dr. [Note: Rudolf] Steiner's lecture on prayer, which we did. I had found much delight in her two older children and we often had discussed Annette's baby reports of the fairies she saw [Note: ==== Beginning of page 235 ====] now and then as they took their excursions over the bluffs, along the foreshores, in the caves, among the ever-blossoming shrubs and trees. Frequently Annette would stop, calling the attention of her parents, exclaiming, \"Oh look at that little fellow,\" pointing him out with excited interest. Mrs. Trinick had told me these things because I knew there were fairies and had told her of the nature of their work in building up plant life - the gnomes in breaking down the rocks for the penetration of the tender roots; theundines the chemists who built up stem and leaves; the sylphs forming and painting the flowers; the fire-fairies building fruit and seed. A MOON CHILD - ANNETTE The child Annette was a beautiful thing, looking indeed like a child of the Moon. Later on when she had lost this faculty, as most children do now when they pass their third year, she still remembered,doubtless because her parents had been sympathetic and receptive, and so sometimes she asked why she didn't see the fairies any more. We told her that in these days people as they grew older had to learn to see the fairies. In discussions that arose with other children when her school days began, she quite overmatched an occasional small rationalist who contemptuously said there were no fairies by answering flat that there were fairies - she had seen them. This usually ended the argument for what onehas seen one knows and her conviction based on experience was convincing. One day instead of her coming up to read with me, I went down the hill to see Mrs. Trinick. As I approached I saw someone going into her house, a tradesman, so I stopped before going on till he was Page 802 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagogone. As I stood on the hillside scattered over with yellow hawksbill blossoms I thought what a lovely thing it would be if I myself could see a fairy, of how the reporting of such an experience to her who was such a lover of children would help her to realize the reality of the spiritual world and of spiritualbeings. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 236 (table of contents) ====] THE MOON CHILD . ANNETTE [Note: The child may be Annette Trinick.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 237 ====] So I did a little concentration exercise on the plants and presently of a sudden the whole hillside blossomed out with lovely brilliant blue little beings moving about, dashing here and there between the plants - millions of them like living blue flames almost filling the space all over the hillside between the flowers. It was a lovely and wonderful sight. It was the undines I saw at their work. When I checked on this later with others who had seen them they confirmed in detail what I had seen. I was happy to beable to report this to Mrs. Trinick and felt that they had shown themselves to me because they too wanted to comfort a loving and grieving mother. At other times I have seen the fire-fairies, the salamanders, who like little golden comets dash about condensing the light to feed and form the fruit. I have never seen the other fairies though there are, among my friends, those who have. The mothers on Castlecrag divided up the week in taking charge of the small children, one specializing on pottery, one dancing, one on botanical jaunts and so on. In my Saturday morning art lessons, if lessons they could be called, with babies up to their sixth year, we gave free reign to our fantasy to which knowledge lent wings. The qualities of numbers figured large in our plays and the children thrilled to it, fresh as they had come from the great Spirits of Mathematics. Wholeness we swung and drew and painted, the red circle of the primal warmth condition of our universe. And in our great circleswe dotted sun and stars and earth and moon. We went straight from that to trinity which they adored. It was an endless source of games and pictures and discoveries, this threeness which is true unity. For years they brought me new trinities, never once three indiscriminate things, always a true trinity, and with such rapture - clover leaf or a newly discovered flower, the butterfly's wing and drawings of angel's wings, and fairies' wings. And what excitement there was in the Guy family when the calla lilyopened and was no sooner open than Bronwen discovered the threeness [Note: ==== Beginning of page 238 (table of contents) ====] PANDORA'S BOX [Note: ==== Beginning of page [239] ====] Page 803 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 BOX Mrs. Dorothea Jorio writes: - \"I was looking at a picture of yours the other day, a delightful piece of work - at the Monty Grover's - \"Pandora's Box.\" She told me that Septimus Power (a painter) offeredany one of his in exchange but that of course she wouldn't part with it.\" [Note: In the New-York Historical Society copy this page appears as page 239 and again as page 242a; in The Art Institute of Chicago copy it appears as page 243 (the first page of chapter No. 11.). The word \"caption\" is at the top of the New-York Historical Society page 239, and the page has been placed at this point so that it immediately follows the illustration.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 240 ====] [Note: Continued from page 237] of the tip of the pistil. Truly a surprise the fairies had given her and the news went round. From threeness to fiveness where we stand now. Spread their feet and stretch their arms and we have and draw it just so in its simplest form, and we have there in our own bodies the story of where we came from - the stars. \"When I first put my feet on the Earth,\" said young David and atheistic parentssometimes objected to the positive statements the youngsters made at times about angels and spiritual beings. Nor could they understand why the babes couldn't be drawn away from their, to the adult mind, incomprehensible paintings but I knew and the babes knew they were getting real information - about life - for which they are so eager. That's how the planets are formed, I told Glyn [Note: Nicholls?], a five year old who had been building up intersecting circles within a big circle. \"Is that how it's done,\" he said. And you could see the satisfaction he took in his creative work. And this five-year-old spent the whole afternoon working out some dozen designs, really interesting, in circles of various sizes. Later we had twoness, the oval and the crescent moon, and dad's eyes stuck out when his four year old daughter told him you couldn't have an up without a down, nor an inside without an outside, nor the visiblewithout the invisible, nor matter without spirit. He felt his own materialism breaking down under the assured statements of his baby girl. They learned that all animals' bodies and man's own are a twoness that came when their divine origins were compressed from the circle to the oval, and with swinging movements we drew on the black-board fish and birds, horses and tigers, and with the wave - the crescent moon, the origin of twoness, the dragon, the hissing snake and swan and so on. After the Guys had moved onto their farm and mother and Bronwen were making me a visit, mother telling me that daughter was winning praise in school for dancing and drawing both a part of Castlecrag life. Bronwen said, \"You taught me how to draw bodies.\" She was quite [Note: ==== Beginning of page 241 ====] conscious of the advantage of basic knowledge. Page 804 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoI called the attention of a two year old to the seed pods on a tree and they were a constant fascination for her for years to come. \"Why the apple is a seed-pod,\" she told her mother. And the fairy lore of the bush, the scribbly gum, the Eucalyptus Haemastoma, where the fairies wrote their messages. Such fun! And how they loved secrets. The secret in the heart of the triangle which we discovered by folding the equilateral triangle in two three times to form a pyramid and painting the forms within the hexagon with alternate blue and red - a sixness - that lovely floral form. \"The secret in the mother's heart,\" I said. \"A boy and a girl,\" said Kaaren [Note: Deans?], and then with their equilaterals they built the hexagon, that bond between the physical and the spiritual (for you can't make a solid from hexagons) with which onecan do so many lovely things - the pattern on the turtle's back, endless flowers, new stars and suns in combination with the trinity itself. And the dragons on the blackboard appeared again with father and child, father and child swinging as a great dragon down the hillside - the children's idea not the fathers'. At the welcome home party when I returned to Australia, the poet-laureate of Castlecrag, six year old Wanda, greeted me with her poem:- Welcome home to this brush [Note: bush] of thine Where fairies play and creepers twine Where beautiful flowers in shady nooks Welcome thee with the songs of brooks. The news has spread in fairy land And the fairies dance all hand in hand For they were told by a little gnome That Mrs. Griffin had come back home. [Note: There is no page 242 in the Art Institute copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 242b ====] We can see that liquid does not really belong to the mineral kingdom; water for instance when it solidifies expands. We can see this in the forms its crystals take, the frost on the window pane, foretelling the vegetable kingdom. the tree form follows the form of light movement, triangular. We find early form in Australia. The fern with spores has become a tree there. They came up from the South pole. The Auracaria too so formal in its growth, the precursor of the pines. The water lily foretells the cactus. The vegetable kingdom transforms spirit to matter, mathematics to life. The ethers shape the leaves, from circular to triangular. Australia's Archangel was the greatest of artists playing with forms. Griffin emulated him in playing with forms. We find lovely painting in the coloring of the barks vivid in the Angophora Costale. Which requires the greatest intelligence the building of a bridge or the building of a tree?Plants do not consume food, they create it. Science knows only the mineral kingdom.

[Note: ==== Beginning of page 247 ====] LIBERTY & EQUITY Walter Burley Griffin The issue between Liberty and Equity is stressed as the Crux of out time by Dean [Note: Teachers College Columbia University] William F. Russell's \"So Conceived and So Dedicated\" in the May Atlantic, also by Albert J. Nook and Newton D. Baker in earlier issues. These writers site diverse earlyauthorities but not the late Dr. Rudolf Steiner who succeeded, through extending the sources of data beyond obvious physical laws, in showing that although these conditions are mutually exclusive, it does not follow that we must choose the one and do without the other, nor compromise by subtracting one from another to obtain the insignificant remnant of opposing forces; for each has a clear field in which it is a paramount necessity. There need be no greater conflict between Liberty, Equality and Fraternity in the genus humanity than there is between then as willing, feeling and thinking in the species individual man himself. The difficulty arises out of incapacity to recognize authority except as a unity whereas it can be conceived of as a trinity. The human being is of spirit, soul and body and his threeness is a wholeness, made up of distinct elements: - the assimilative system exemplified by the stomach, the regulatory system by theheart and the nervous system by the head. Where one of these systems interferes with the operation of the other, disease ensues. But just so are our states trying to carry on. The intuitive cry of the French Revolution recognized the threefold needs of the social body, but not how to meet them. We can enjoy social health only as we learn how. A society whose institutions arebased on its threefold nature will be able to function properly like a human being, each one of whose three systems traverse the whole body: - Liberty the function of an individualistic creative and productive cultural activity, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 248 ====] Equality the function of a democratic Political organization, Fraternity the function of a co-operative Page 808 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoMercantile system. We can enjoy each principle to the full in the realm to which it belongs and has its value where each may supplement the other two just as do our free voluntary metabolic and limb activities, the moral impulseof our feeling and the logical laws of our thinking. Toleration toward the idea of a single world economy and codes worked out by various industries under the National Recovery Act [Note: National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933] began to illustrate the inevitable trend toward segregation of authorities according to functions and the relinquishment by the States, to competently constituted institutions, of all powers not strictly implicit in formulating andmaintaining standards of human rights according to the degrees of moral consciousness obtaining in the respective communities. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 249 ====] AMERICAN BOURGEOISIE ALL INCLUSIVE When I was leaving Chicago to start my course in architecture at Boston Tech [Note: later the Massachusetts Institute of Technology] my beloved companion, Aunt Myra [Note: Perkins], recognizing my sanguine temperament advised me not to take all the courses the university offered; but on my return home I found my own home was offering the same temptations. My French Club pal, Katherine, always said she never thought of Mother's dwelling as a home but rather as a community. Mother herself, principal of the Komensky School, in addition to being the whole support of the family of five children from the time the youngest was four, was really the precursor of such developments asuniversity extension giving art courses to her teachers during the years and decades, attended by many teachers from other schools and repeated in her home for the neighborhood on Saturdays, and undertaking to make livable quarters out of the barracks that our schools are (How could they be otherwise under the control of a political organization) which in her case she transformed into a real art gallery through loans made by friends usually becoming permanent, stained glass windows, etc. So thatyou never went through its halls without seeing children gazing here and there at some work of art, for here one found a statue and there the colored glow from a window or a whole story on the stairway wall of [Note: Louis-Maurice] Boutet de Monvel's Jean d'Arc and such, and a very fine collection of European posters brought from various vacation trips. One incident in connection with the Saturday Art class might throw some light on Mother's family. One afternoon I was practicing on the piano when my brother Gerald came home. We nick-named him the \"smiling telegraph pole\" though his normal expression was serious as that of a judge. Not liking the sounds I was making, he ordered me to leave the piano. Naturally I didn't obey his instructions so he lifted me off the stool and put me on the other side of the room. Naturally again I immediately returned to the piano and after a second attempt [Note: ==== Beginning of page 250 ====] Page 809 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoto settle me elsewhere returned and without looking at me caught me by the braids hanging down my back and hauled me unceremoniously across the room to the front door. On opening this to put me out he became aware of a shy stranger coming to mother's class and simply with a lift of his hand put meinto an erect position and left me to deal with the situation. With my quite natural sweetness I greeted her and invited her to come in assuring her that Mother would be home at any moment, but she managed to find some excuse and disappeared never to return. The home program was always a full one so it was usually impossible to change the day of the week for any function since every day was packed. In the daytime everyone left for a day's work but the sparetime was filled full. There was not only the art class on Saturday afternoon and a general round up of friends of my sister, who was the belle of the neighborhood, on Sunday afternoons to stay for bread and coffee and on into the evening with songs and nonsense till Mother's alarm clock went off as a hint to the young folks that it was time to go home, which hint was as a rule not taken seriously. Monday would be filled with the rehearsals of the dramatic club which after a few years of presenting not tooambitious plays settled down to the study under Mr. Blake, and the presentation, for he insisted we never would give proper finish to a work without presenting it, of Shakespeare's plays which we carried on for the rest of the 15 years of our existence, some of our members graduating to the professional stage. I took part in this as I did in all the functions, the rest of the children being more choosey. So I had the fun of being Portia and Beatrice and Olivia and Cordelia and so on through the years. Another evening would be given over to the little orchestral group, for Aunt Myra was a pianist who filled another evening too with a study group for listeners-in to the Saturday evening [Note: Theodore] Thomas concerts. And another evening a group gathered for the study of poetry, Mr. Blake reading it, himself a master of English verse and a writer of plays. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 251 (table of contents) ====] MARION MAHONY [Note: ==== Beginning of page 252 ====]One of the interesting things he did was a series of experiments in versification based on plotted mathematical curves. He would take the same motif and put it into some normal metric form and then put it into the geometrical form and, without telling which was which, have us express our preference. Itwas surprising how frequently we chose this new experiment. He and I had many a pleasant quatre d'heure in comparing our arts, mine being architecture. When either of us found a basic principle we passed it on to the other to find how it applied there. It was a great lesson to find how these discoveries could be applied to advantage in either art, in all the arts. All children should be brought up to express themselves in all the universal languages - the arts. It is no harder to learn them all than to learn one. Thearts are play and they play into each other. They are lonely without the companionship of their fellows. Our ridiculous idea of experts these days is a deadly thing. Of course in the realm of time we may spend most of our time in one or another. Page 810 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe oldest of the children was Jerome. The kernel of antagonism between him and myself may have started when Mrs. [Note: Ella Flagg] Young, who was a bit of a tease, on one of her visits to Hubbard Woods flung an arithmetic problem at Jerome which he could not answer, quite likely because of a bit ofstage fright, and she turned to me, listening in from across the room and said, \"Well Marion can answer that,\" which I promptly did. One might say that Jerome was the immoral member of the family and perhaps I myself was the prude for our conflicts in later years were largely of such a nature. Jerome was brilliant and widely informed and I remember a New York friend dropping a line to Mother saying she wondered if Mother knew what a cultured gentleman her son was. I myself no matter how great the rowhad been could never resist, when Jerome came home from work, the temptation to slip down and sit on the stairs, when I was too angry to go near him, to listen to his sparkling account of the day for no matter how stodgy the office he [Note: ==== Beginning of page 253 ====] was in, or whether he was without a job, the day had some picturesque adventure as seen through his eyes. He was one of those Americans whose work, if the United States had been democratic instead of imperialistic in those days, would have gone a long way in this last half century toward establishing friendly relations and economic unity in the Americas. Our imperialism means that we are still under the domination of Rome, under the Spirit of Addition, interested only to get and get and never give whereas by now, with all the advantages America has had, we should be well under the influence of the Spirit ofSubtraction, the impulse to give and give and never get. Really Jerome's impulse and abilities and trend in Mexico were of a colonizing nature. He and his wife were of those who would have aroused friendly feelings instead of enmity. Instead of the Americans' helping, President [Note: Woodrow] Wilson, awakened one night by some official urgency authorized (to his later regret) the sending of soldiers down to Vera Cruz. TheseAmerican soldiers captured some scores of Mexicans, lined them up the next morning and shot them. Naturally this aroused feeling throughout Mexico and Jerome was one of those who were taken to prison. The personal feeling of those with whom he had been working and living was illustrated by one Mexican's pleading with the soldiers to take him instead, that Senor Mahony was a good man. But they threw him into prison and every day for about a week they brought him out, stood him against the wallto be shot and then sent him back to his cell, and finally released him. A strain to the nerves indeed but one could not blame the Mexicans but only deeply appreciate their having finally released him. The blame was of course America's. One can see that if the economic organization had not been mixed up with the political the work of such a man would have been of common advantage to both Americans and Mexicans, for the nature ofeconomics if it is not supported by monopolistic powers granted by the states [Note: ==== Beginning of page 254 (table of contents) ====] Page 811 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] C.H. WILLS DETROIT . Marion Mahony & von Holst [Note: ==== Beginning of page 255 ====] in that liaison of our present system, is fraternal, the very continuance of economic relations depending upon mutual advantage to both parties. The economic stream could not continue to flow if there were notadvantage to both buyer and seller. It is time we quit bandying words and took action for the establishing of democracy by freeing the political organization from its unwholesome alliances such as economics and education. The mere fact of universal suffrage does not bring about democracy. Nor is it possible with the complications which we pile on our political organization to get anything in the nature of an intelligentexpression from the people. Jerome remarked one day on the frequent statement that women didn't have enough brains to vote, saying that he went in once and looked up and down a long complicated list on the voting paper given to him and gave up trying to find what to do and never again went to a voting booth, his conclusion being that neither did men have enough intelligence to vote if intelligence was the thing called for. I myself have gone through life the same way. I went to vote once and realizingafterward what a foolish thing I had done never went back again till after I was 70 years of age. Jerome was married when he was quite young and went with his wife to spend five years in Europe. They systemized their journey and spent about a year in each country during which Jerome concentrated on getting hold of the history of the country. When he returned he took an examination to teach in the evening school. He failed in the history examination. Naturally his answers were not the text bookanswers. He tried to get a job in Chicago, but the firms he went to wouldn't take him on because he was out of the country five years during which his life was not recorded by the official records. Nothing he could say or anyone else could say for him as to character and occupation during those years could make any difference. They simply wouldn't employ him. He started a factory in Minneapolis [Note: Minnesota] which he carried on for several years [Note: ==== Beginning of page 256 ====] and got a thorough understanding of how life can be more difficult for the employer than for the employee. After having sunk considerable funds he gave it up and started out with a quarter of a dollar in his pocket and beat his way across to Montana. He \"rode the rods [Note: rails?]\" under the [Note: railroad] cars and earned his way picking up odd jobs here and there when he could. More than once he went for more than seven days without food. He said that after the second day you don't mind it. One of the most trying situations he ever had to face was when a companion he was on good terms with suggested a partnership and explained the nature of his business which was stealing, and showed him his apparatus to safeguard himself in case of emergency. That, Jerome insisted, took more tact than anyother situation he ever had to face since he really had to convince the man that he was one of his own kind and that there was no danger of Jerome's giving him away. Arriving in Montana, he got a job as cow-boy on a ranch and later established himself on a ranch of his Page 812 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoown. One of his heart breaks was the upsetting of the boat in the turbulent river in going to this new ranch and not being able to recover his violin which for so many years had been his boon companion. Circumstances brought him back to Chicago some years later and his next adventure took him downinto Mexico. In our childhood there was really almost a sixth member of our family for our only first cousin Dwight [Note: Perkins], a few years older than Jerome, was with us much of the time. It was in his office that I had my first architectural experience. Many years later he remarked that it seemed odd to him that he had never known me, the most Bohemian person he had ever come in contact with, to be guilty of anyimpropriety. In his mind there seemed to be something irreconcilable about this. In my business partnerships I had at times traveled with my partner. Questioning the propriety had never entered anyone's head. It was one of the natural things that have succeeded in establishing wholesome relations between man and woman in America. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 257 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . C.H. WILLS . PLAN [Note: ==== Beginning of page 258 ====]The adventuresome nature of the typical American was expressed in one of the events of the Hubbard Woods summer vacations. The two younger boys, Gerald and Leslie fourteen and ten years of age, packed a lunch early one morning and went off to the lake. They had made up their minds to build a raft.With this constructed before the morning was over they ate their bit of lunch and started to paddle around on their raft. It was not long before they were caught in one of those occasional currents of Lake Michigan and, paddle as they would, they couldn't get back to shore. They passed one pleasure boat the voices from which they could distinctly hear and called out to them for help but no one paid any attention to them. Naturally, we felt afterwards that anyone seeing small boys so far out should havebrought them in even without their asking for help. Toward evening Mother went down to the shore but not finding the boys assumed they were somewhere around in the woods. However as the twilight deepened into darkness she became very anxious and the neighbors gradually gathered to spend the night out in the storm which had arisen, searching the woods having at times that curious experience of walking in circles. The next day theword went far and wide. Friends came out from the city, among them Mrs. Young [Note: Ella Flagg Young?]. I remember that when it had occurred to her that the boys might have been picked up by some boat going into Chicago, I went up with her to run ahead to hold the train about due so that no time should be lost in following up this possible clue. I set her a pace indeed and when I tackled the conductor telling him he must hold the train which he said he couldn't do, my breathlessness helped mycommanding will and he waited until Mrs. Young, scarcely able to breath, climbed onto the train. She went to John R. Walsh who proceeded to get in touch with the various boats for it was the 4th of July and no boats were coming in or going out. Page 813 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe afternoon was drawing to a close when the men told me to persuade Mother to leave the Lake shore so they could drag the Lake. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 259 ====] We had of course been telegraphing far and wide and as Mother mounted the steps of the station platform a telegram came through saying the boys were found. When Jerome had gone down to the Lake there was a bit of a board raft on the sand which he had kicked contemptuously aside saying the boys would never have tried to go out on a thing like that. In fact they had worked well on the raft they had made having nailed four logs securely and this bit of a sieve had weathered the storm all through the night, the storm which the boat captains said no small craftcould possibly live through. It was so dark that Gerald had to keep reaching out his hand to feel if Leslie was still there. A huge vessel almost ran them down but their screams of terror were not heard and the ship went on its way. In the morning they were so far out they could not see any land so had to wait till the sun rose to know which way to paddle. They had hung onto their paddles so as dawn came, in spite of their exhaustion, they paddled in finally reaching the shore. They started to walk but when they spoketo a man he wouldn't believe them when they said they had come from Hubbard Woods twelve miles away and went on his way leaving them to get along as best they could. They would walk for a while then sleep for a while. They passed through a picnic group and asked for something to eat but nobody paid any attention to them. They went on and Leslie who seems to have an inborn genius for finding money found a penny and they went into a shop and bought the biggest thingthey could buy for a penny. It took them nine hours to make the first six miles, half the way home when, as they were passing a railroad station, the agent spoke to them to see if by chance they were the missing boys. They were packed on the next train for home. So frightfully sunburned were they that a touch was agony and that first night Leslie ran a bit of a temperature. But two days later a friend came out from town to see the boys and couldn't believe his ears when Mother greeted him telling him the boys werenot in, they had gone down to the lake. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 260 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . C.H. WILLS . INTERIOR [Note: ==== Beginning of page 261 ====] Gerald, 6 foot 3 inches tall, who was the engineer of the family, worked his way through college - the Armour Institute [Note: of Technology, Chicago]. He belonged to those fortunate days before high finance, when banking business was run on some such lines as would be universal if there were an Abilities Organization. So he was able to get financing on purely personal credit, no security, to run a factory. Later he spent some years in the making of transformers in one of the towns on the St. Joe Page 814 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: St. Joseph] river. Getting homesick he bargained with his domestic sister, Georgine, to keep house for him if he bought a home. Some time passed and she had begun a course of training as a nurse when a telegram came up, \"If I buy a house will you come down.\" She couldn't very well drop her workoff hand so I feeling ready for a holiday from drafting telegraphed - \"Gene can't but I will if you'll have a piano as well.\" Everybody was filled with consternation when they found Gerald was to be in the hands of a professional woman instead of his sister Georgine. They were sure he would starve to death. That was in the early days of women in the professions when such ideas were prevalent. I suggested to Geraldthat of course he couldn't expect to be provided with a dinner when genius was burning, but he was ready to accept any proposition I made for he had gotten his eye on an old, left over farm house which the town had grown up to and around and which was right on the bank of the St. Joe river, and the bank of the Elkhart river just across the street in front. The friend with whom he had been boarding suggested a carpenter he ought to consult to get advice about fixing up the house. He replied that his sister was anarchitect and would do that, to which she replied, \"Oh but she won't know about Elkhart [Note: Indiana] ways.\" Sometimes perhaps he thought he would have been less exploited in the carpenter's hands for he always insisted that I ruined him. But such fun as we both had! A big brick fire place in the living room with odds and ends of architectural modeled plaster work built into it. Before the scaffolding was out, though it was a hot day, we crept in under to build a fire and sat there hugging our [Note: ==== Beginning of page 262 (table of contents) ====] OFFICE OF WALTER BURLEY GRIFFIN IN THE ATTIC OF THE MONROE BUILDING CHICAGO [Note: Griffin moved his office to the Monroe building (104 South Michigan Avenue) on its completion in 1912.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 263 ====] CAPTION While the Monroe Building in Chicago was under construction Griffin found no use was being made of the attic space. Always a space saver Griffin took this space for his office. This later became quite a custom in down town buildings. A seed planted grows. He and a number of the young Chicago School of Architecture had already made similar use of the attic space in Steinway Hall building of Dwight Perkins. A considerable number of the young Chicago School moved in here, [Note: Robert C.?] Spencer, [Note: [Note: Myron?] Hunt, etc. Wright whose early work was without distinction was only just out of Sullivan's office and only now was following the Japanese emphasis on thehorizontal [Note: \"Japanese inspired horizontal\" in N-YHS] line which had considerable influence on the whole group.

This was Griffin's first plan of a whole Municipality. [Note: Griffin drew up plans for an addition to the port of Shanghai for Wong Kai Kah (1860-1906). The drawings were lost when Mr. Wong died while returning to China.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 264 ====] [Note: Continued from page 261] knees and gloating over it. A second story over the one story kitchen made a grand billiard room, and over another ell made a sumptuous studio room; and the huge old fashioned barn picked up, moved over and dropped downover the riverbank formed a boathouse below with the whole huge hayloft above converted into a screened pavilion open on three sides, with commanding views up and down the river. It served for community life in Elkhart somewhat on the lines of Mother's home though tending more to water delights than land-lubbers' interests. I found the children bathing in this dangerous river with those wicked little water wings and taught them all how to swim. Here I had a chance to teach all my married friends how not to keep house, but really to live. Here in the hay-loft Rachel and I rehearsed and painted the scenery - Florence as seen from the heights of San Miniato, and disgusted Gerald by ripping off the side steps of the house to aid our imaginations in the balcony scene of Alfred de Musset's play which had been presented in Paris by Sarah Bernhardt and Agar [Note: Leonide Charvin Agar?]. I did the strolling minstrel and learned howto thrum the guitar for this special occasion. Mr. Blake had translated it for us into beautiful American verse. Later on we transported the scenery to present the play in Chicago. Great fun we had for nearly three years and then Gerald had to go down to the Tierra Caliente of Mexico to erect a sugar mill and to carry on with the management for some years. This again is an instance of years wasted for lack of an Economic Organization for this splendid business on an ideallocation came to an end and is utterly wasted because of the totalitarian states. The Elkhart house was closed for a while but afterwards for many years served as the ancestral homestead for the family for vacations and a place to which we could fly with the children for country air. My niece, Clarmyra, whom I took down there when she was three years old, when we returned from our first afternoon prowl, sat down on the step and announced - \"My nebber going in the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 265 ====] house again,\" and that became the rule for the year or two I spent there with her, her Mother coming down for the weekends. For the tradesmen and the other familiars never tried the house doors first but always came around to the river bank fairly sure to find us there. Later, after his marriage, this treasuredplace became Gerald's home again and still is. Page 816 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoHowever, before this return he had given this homestead to Mother. Now one of mother's favorite pastimes was reading the wills in the papers and she always got herself insured when traveling and every time made a new will having great fun apportioning this manufactured inheritance. She wrote meshe had willed one of her houses to Georgine and the Elkhart one to me. At this time we were trying desperately in Australia to unify the Castlecrag estates for which end the Haven estate was very important, so I wrote her that since she wasn't using the house I would greatly appreciate it if she would sell it and send me the money instead of willing it to me. Learning of this Gerald's wife's father bought back the house [Note: \"Gerald bought back the house (which he had given her)\" in N-YHS] from herand the total price was sent over to me. - These Irish - This made a tremendous difference in our carrying on this undertaking and proved a source of income which met all sorts of needs. Gerald having bought the place twice over was again able to occupy it himself. Jerome again went down to Mexico and spent the rest of his life there, Gerald's plantation being near the Gulf and Jerome's near the Pacific Ocean. Gerald too was one of the outside plantation managers whowould never carry a gun though there were 700 men on the plantation, half Mexican and half Chinese. The boys had at that time made the journey from Puerto Mexico to Salina Cruz, bathing in the two waters on the same day. Here is where the Panama canal should have been for the crossing is practically at sea level for the whole distance. Had there been a world Economic Organization there would have been no barriers for such a rational arrangement. [Note: At this point in the New-York Historical Society copy appear two pages (numbered 265b and 265c) which contain a letter from Jerome Mahony to his mother. In The Art Institute of Chicago copy the letter does not appear here, but in the next chapter, No. 12., on pages 273a and 273b.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 266 ====] We talk of opportunities being over but that is nonsense. We simply have to wipe out, by setting the example ourselves, the imperialism which comes from state ownership of nature and capital, theconsequences of which have come to their inevitable conclusion in Europe, which catastrophe there is no way of escaping except by eliminating the cause in ourselves - the totalitarian form of community organization, substituting three organs for Security, Economics and Social Requirements. I got one of my thrills while in Australia on reading an article in the Freeman [Note: periodical title]. Though no name was used I found myself reading about this brother Jerome of mine. The writer hadfound himself in this remote and isolated region - in Tehuantepec - waiting for hours at a little railroad station and was so excited to have encountered here \"one of the most interesting men\" he had ever met that he made an article of it and here I was on the other side of the world making connection with my family anew. The world is not so big. It won't be difficult to make a unit of it so long as we don't expect different groups to have the same moral standards, nor individuality to be eliminated. Let's wipe out the\"Prince of the World\" idea and realize that it is nonsense to think of any of the European communities as democracies. My sister Georgine was obliged to give up her undertaking of being a nurse because of a heart difficulty which perhaps had resulted as the outcome of acute attacks of rheumatism through her childhood. Doctors pronounced it a leaking valve and incurable saying she probably could not live through her Page 817 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoteens and it would not be possible for her to live to the age of thirty, that she must be very quiet putting no strain on her heart. Her response was to dance and run and climb, for in those romantic years death had no terror but rather a romantic appeal. She did however go on a unique diet which may have causedMother some anxiety in those days which feared the foods we now consider [Note: ==== Beginning of page 267 ====] most important. One might say cucumbers were the chief of her diet. Anyway it was what would now be called an eliminator diet, and she would have nothing to do with the meals set before the family. I am inclined to attribute to this as well as to her spirit the fact that all the signs of her physical disability disappeared and when in her fifties these doctors saw her, they asked to be permitted to listen to herheart and found that the leak had disappeared. However she went into teaching instead of nursing and like her Mother before and her daughter after her, was a genius in this realm. Her experience in nursing was of value to herself and her friends. She was one of those who functioned and was looked upon as an angel by those who came into her environment though, as Mother said, in her girlhood she could make the Angel Gabriel angry if she wanted to. Leslie was the babe of the family and didn't have a fair start because with Father's death he was put into school at four years of age so that, since this was before kindergarten days, he got the intellectual work so destructive to the body if prematurely used. These etheric life forces up to the sixth year of age are required for building up and establishing the physical body. If they are diverted, before the change of teeth, to head work which is their natural field from that time on, they leave the physical body depletedfor the rest of one's life. So Leslie was too thin and short of vital forces all his life but so far as success, as generally understood, is concerned he was the one who attained it. As a youngster he had taken great satisfaction in the fact that he, as he said, had \"friends among the rich and the poor.\" That faculty served him well and as manager of the sales Department of Explosives he broke the record of the du Pont Company in spite of the fact that depression came during his term of office. Of Mother a family friend, Anna Ickes, said she was the only person she knew who held the center of her stage to the day of her death which came when she was eighty-five years of age. She had retained her [Note: ==== Beginning of page 268 ====] position as principal until she was seventy six still full of vigor and able to do physically what none of her teachers could do - go from the top of one of her four story buildings down to the first floor and up to the fourth floor of the other building and address a class without stopping to catch her breath. She resigned against the wish of her teachers about half of whom were so disgusted with the principal who succeeded her [Note: \"a man\" inserted in N-YHS] that they left the school to go to other districts. There is a requirement in Chicago that the principal and superintendents mark the teachers. A new superintendent learning that Mother always marked all her teachers 100 in everything said that was insubordination, a defiance of the system. Gossip brought this to Mother's ears and she tossed her head Page 818 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosaying he was welcome to visit her school any time he chose. When he did come she let him go from room to room making his own choice. By the time he had visited three he could keep quiet no longer but said he had never heard such work in his life. All the school work was on exceptionally high standardsbut as it happened he was a singing superintendent and Mother's school was in the Bohemian district, the children when they entered not being able to speak English, her teachers were mostly Bohemians and consequently they and the children were practically all musicians. With part singing of lovely music it was no wonder that he was astonished. Mother never heard any more complaints about her marks of her teachers. In our youth a charcoal drawing of my Aunt Myra's hung on the wall, a life-sized head which I always thought was a portrait of Mother. Not till I was grown up did I learn that it was Beatrice Cenci. I was interested years later in a confirmation of this resemblance. An Italian draftsman in the office once came to me a bit mysteriously and asked if I knew Beatrice Cenci. I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"You like her?\" I said, \"Yes, I think she was very beautiful.\" \"You have the same outline,\" he said, \"You have the sameoutline.\" I had been prepared not to give too much weight to that remark by another friend who had said that he and I [Note: \"Beatrice Cenci\" was a Renaissance noblewomen executed with other family members for murdering her abusive father. Her story has been the subject of works in literature, music, and the visual arts.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 269 ====] were designed by a genius but one who was sadly lacking in a classic education. And indeed by another friend who had said to me very earnestly, \"You are like my wife, you know you are a very plain looking woman.\" So there you are. What wonderful things friends are. So as we settled into our work, Mother's family was scattered from Chicago to Wilmington, Delaware, to Mexico, to Australia and India. Now I am convinced that in this second half of the 20th century thestream of immigration to the United States should flow on and Americans should emigrate to all parts of the world teaching the things that have been ingrained in their blood through the two centuries of the experience of democracy and should spread the knowledge of it throughout the world for elsewhere democracy is unknown.

One might say that America had been reserved by the Gods to perform great tasks for the coming millenniums. Her first real adventure was in the 18th Century in the political field, establishing Equity as the foundation of Political Government. Her Page 820 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoadventure in the 19th Century was in the Economic Field culminating in the present decades and now being carried to the world - Mutuality. Her present task - of the 20th Century - is Liberty, and calls for the emigration of Americans to all parts of the world. The meaning of the word is practically unknown elsewhere. To build this arch requires the two foundation stones of Equity and Mutuality - i.e., democracy in the Political Realm and fraternity in the Economic realm. It calls for the development of every individual's ability throughout the world. It is the opposite of imperialism and is well expressed in Mr. [Note: President Harry S.] Truman's great speech in Berlin of 20 July 1945 - where he spoke of \"a better world, a peaceful world, a world inwhich all people will have the opportunity to enjoy the good things of life - and not just a few at the top.\" He said, \"Let us not forget that we are fighting for peace and for the welfare of mankind. We are not fighting for conquest. There is not one piece of territory nor one thing of a monetary nature that we want out of this war. We want peace and prosperity for the world as a whole. We want to see the time come when we can do the things in peace that we have been able to do in war. If we can put thistremendous machine of ours, which has made victory possible, to work for peace, we can look forward to the greatest age in the history of mankind.

If the matter is in any way brought to your attention I hasten to explain that I have arranged to remit those funds from here. (Which he did.

I will have a splendid start for further operations and would be really quite well off if I stopped andsimply farmed the finca [Note: estate]. For a long time the people here thought I was a tramp, then they began to be afraid I was not, then they thought I was a bluffer, now they have for a moment, definitely made up their minds that I am a millionaire. This carries with it the punishment that is meted to millionaires and reputed millionaires generally. The next property I will take over will be on the sea, in front of the Las Conchas ranch I am taking over Page 821 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagonow. Of course I do not know how far I can go and one's difficulties increase as the operations get further extended. So for the present I shall simply do all I can on the ones I have started on and commence turning the land into cash a little later on. [Note: the phrase \"and commence . . . later on\"crossed out in N-YHS] The headquarters here I will always keep and also one finca of 5000 or 10000 acres. So I now have, if there is no slip, and always will have, a big \"estate\" really here and you can step from the train to within a few feet of headquarters and drive out to the finca. From the Conchas you can see the spot where Cortez built his ships, the ancient town of San Francisco is as quaint as a corner in Spain. Many of the roads are along the sea and made of the shells andconsequently look like Boulevards. There is not probably an estate in England which has as many deer on it as has our Las Conchas and there are but few places in the world where such enormous quantities of fish can be hauled out with a net. I am putting the houses, fences, etc., in order and one of the servants will be the \"hunter\" who brings in fresh [Note: ==== Beginning of page 273b ====] fish every morning and venison whenever required, a deer a day if it could be eaten, for a salary of $4 a month. You can get all the fish and meat you can get away with for yourself and a gang of men for $4 a month. The place is a grove of palms and over the most of it one can ride at a gallop. No underbrush. I expect to plant thousands of cocoanut trees a few at a time and have in time some thousands of cattle. Living generally here is cheap. One can live like a king here if he wants to for very little. I want you to come here soon. Mexico has much of the charm of Europe. This valley is old, old, old. Its roads, itschurches, its costumes are ancient. For my part I love it. It is a veritable sleepy hollow. Love and love, Jerome. His wife is still there.

He always did pride himself on what he called honesty. You see he had had his first love affair with a beautiful and charming young woman [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright's sister, Maginel?] and in the face of the two alternativesbetween which men customarily choose after such an experience, he did not hurry into affairs with other Page 822 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowomen but set aside the idea of woman. She had been on holidays from her professional work for some time and was keeping house for her brother in the perfectly good substitute for an ancestral homestead on the banks of the beautiful St. Joe[Note: Joseph] River and had invited Socrates down for week-end camping trips on this magic stream, so had learned his weakness. He had been brought up in an inland suburb, had longed for the water but been forbidden by timorous parents to go on or in the same when he went off with the boys bent, as they suspected, on reaching some distant pool. Of course he disobeyed them. What a blessing for humanity that children are not overburdened with too great respect for the opinions of their elders. Xanthippe, who was practicing architecture in partnership with one of the other members [Note: Herman von Holst?] of the school of independent design in Chicago, in the same building as the office of Socrates, with the wisdom of the serpent, suggested one day that they buy together a canoe and explore some of the nearby streams. Little did she know what she was in for as a consequence of that innocent remark. Like the ancestors of her own family Socrates was, in every domain of life, anadventurer and thrilled with the idea of pioneering. She had simply been aware of the fact that men are dependent creatures and felt that if Socrates got used to being [Note: \"Xanthippe\" was the wife of Socrates. Her name has become an eponym for a shrewish, scolding wife.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 275 ====] with her the need of her would grow in him. But he immediately saw worlds to discover and conquer and then and there their doom was sealed. She watched him in amazement as she did for the rest of their lives. He hadn't in the least made up his mind to marry her (though she had and that perhaps made a difference) but that was of no importance and could not for a moment be allowed to stand in the way of the undertaking for undertaking it was - to rediscover domains in the same pristine state of loveliness as in centuries gone by when [Note: Rene-Robert Cavelier] La Salle and [Note: Jacques] Marquette journeyed through the Mississippi Valley. And nothing but the untoward thing that happened a few years later which took him to the other side of the world, as will develop in this tale of adventure, kept him from taking these discoveries and constructing from them a most lovely thing to bring into the consciousness of his community to develop and to add to the glories of his native city - a community plan for Chicago and its environs, i.e., the stateof Illinois [Note: 1913 City Club of Chicago competition?]. The lovely thing lies there still unrecognized and unused awaiting the return of his magic breath. Xanthippe's business arrangement with her architectural partner was that she should have complete control of design. Thus it was recognized that creative work can spring from one mind only who must have full authority and final decision in all matters of design and construction. The arrangement workedvery well but was not the complete and logical one that was later developed in the office of Socrates. For indeed it would usually be necessary for the designer to have the contact with the client to be able to mold his mind in the give and take so necessary in the solution of a problem where the client always wants more than he wants to pay for. Page 823 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe half dozen or more under her in the drafting room worked well and enthusiastically, for here was one of the few places where the ice was being broken for the freeing of the profession from the apron strings of stylistic architecture, a movement so wonderfully started and established by Louis Sullivan,and which received such a deadly set-back in [Note: ==== Beginning of page 276 ====] the very heart of the movement in the Chicago Columbian Exposition, the whole nation being seduced by the superficial beauty of that wanton thing. Her natural bent was toward independence and the girlhood motto - to live as always to be able to respect herself - had been the cause of her failing in design in her [Note: Boston] Tech course due to her repugnance toward the required custom of going to the libraries for designs. The ultimate leniency of the beloved head of the department, Mr. Chamberlain, due to the fact she did well in her other work, and possibly that she was a woman, recognizing the difficulty of suppressing revolution in a woman and the only one in the course at the time, were probably at the bottom of her not failing to get her degree, though the presentation of her thesis won the praise of the head of design, M. Depradelle [Note: Desire Despradelle (1862-1912)], whose joy had been exceeding great over a caricature of her by an under-class man depicting her, back view with a halo around her head, with toes turned widely out (a habit which it took years for Socrates to correct to make her walk straight footed like any proper Indian of the forest and right he was for with her black hair straight down, a band around her head, she would be taken for an Indian anywhere) walking straight toward the temple of fame in the distance while thestreet on both sides was lined with brass bands bowing and blowing their heads off. \"Yes, yes,\" said Monsieur, \"Yes, yes to the temple of fame.\" In the drafting room was Mr. McArthur who has since been doing fine creative work in the Western States, who complained that she was very strict when she jumped on him for altering the design - the story height, of a house while working on the drawings, without referring the matter to her. But sheimpressed it on him that a design cannot be worked to two ideas, and to attempt it was the unforgivable offence. Mr. [Note: Roy] Lippincott too, who years after, won the competition for the main building of the Auckland University, built it and established his profession in New Zealand, was just out of Cornell University and followed her wherever [Note: ==== Beginning of page 277 (table of contents) ====] UNIT HOUSE [Note: The structure is the Gunn House in Chicago.] EMORY HILLS GROUND PLAN [Note: Emory Hills was located in Wheaton, Illinois.] Page 824 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 278 ====] she was drawing so as to get in first on the educational side of the work, designing, detailing and rendering. Later he followed her to Socrates' office and to the Antipodes (married to Socrates' sister)whence he branched off to his own practice. And unforgettable was the expression on the face of the engineer, the third member of the firm, when he saw an instance of her method in the office, when she leaped at a draftsman and said, \"Oh, you naughty little thing. You have done that wrong,\" where he would have cursed and fumed. But her method was effective where his would probably have failed except on the surface. For all the draftsmen young andold were most painstaking and untiring in their work. In fact many times she told the younger ones not to work too hard, that the important thing was to keep themselves alive and wide awake. Many years later she learned in very truth how this is the essential requirement in entering the whole realm of spiritual realities, to become in fact an independent and creative being, to enter the supersensible with fully alive and wide awake self-consciousness instead of trying to penetrate it by trance or medium orblindly not knowing what one is doing nor how. By these fully conscious methods the doors to genius are open to every human being. A strenuous week and Saturday noon arrived and two wicked little runaways dropped their canoe into the Chicago River at the Van Buren street bridge. The canoe was taken by their loving hands and launched at the point nearest to the station where it arrived from the East and then and there its journeybegan which was to last in weekly installments through the succeeding years, never retracing its steps, till the misfortune of fame called them to far distant parts. Allana they named the beautiful creature - Allana - Beloved - and she was left high and dry on the shores of Lake Michigan where their last week-end adventure had ended before they started out to conquer single-handed the most powerful and menacing empire of the present day. Socrates had provided two canvas sleeping bags with blankets.Xanthippe had provided bread and bacon and [Note: ==== Beginning of page 279 ====] frying-pan and pail. They were both of them working to the limit of their strength in their architectural work and could spare no time outside of the usual Saturday afternoon and Sunday. Xanthippe had expected to start on Sunday because that would give them a whole day for the outing. But waste a half a day when Allana was thereon the water and waiting! Such a thought was intolerable to the logical mind of Socrates and we must remember logic started in humanity with Socrates. How could so frail a thing as Xanthippe - and she was frail - stop the most powerful force that had yet come to human beings in the long, long course of their development. Not yet was she aware of the still more powerful force that is developing in this new century. Well she couldn't and so through their lives logic won in the battle royal between Socrates andXanthippe even to the taking of the hemlock. Where in the world but Chicago could such an undertaking have been carried out, at the southern end of Lake Michigan with radiating streams from the surrounding districts pouring their waters into it, and such a system of radiating and belt lines of railroad as is to be found nowhere else. For they were hard Page 825 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoworking young people and had to be at their tasks all through the week. And entering a totally different world it was when they left the grime and noise of the big city and dropped into the sights and silences of the ages. For the canoe is not like the auto which keeps one to the haunts and sights of man and hisworks. The infinite wisdom of the Creator makes it necessary for farmers to leave strips of forest along the river banks or their land gets worn away and acres may be lost. So many times they paddled for days with no consciousness of mankind. What a blessed relief! Only Socrates and Xanthippe. Of course she came to seem a part of the wonders of creation to him. And of course all other humans were simply humans. Up the Chicago River they paddled (not primeval beauty there) and even with the Hades of the modern city about them, though at times their [Note: ==== Beginning of page 280 ====] eyes were rested by the majestic architecture of grouped silos, they began to meditate on other universes to be entered and as they slipped past the suburban limits and as the darkness of night and a brewing storm gathered, each in his own mind with no word spoken determined that nothing should turn themfrom this escape from the grime of our modern civilization into endlessly varied paradise - except that other conquest in creative architecture to which their souls were dedicated. Finally Socrates, with that command of geography which was his by instinct and industry, said they would rest on their oars for, as he knew but she did not, they were at the spot where the Des Plains River in a sweeping bend comes a very close to the Chicago River. So after a most uncomfortable night(they were still amateurs in this realm) with unceasing rain the two, ill-prepared, inexperienced and soft, portaged across to the Des Plains, turning their canoe up stream. Let no one think a canoe is light and easy to handle, anyway for white folks. But in their ignorance Xanthippe took her end to carry - the prow - and not till weeks later and after numerous portages was it discovered that that was the heavy end as it would be of course to make it right for one in the stern whenalone to be able to paddle without lifting the prow too high out of the water. With bones so small that her mother used to try to prevent her from lifting even a tea-kettle from the stove with a - \"But your poor little wrists\" - it certainly was some task, these portages and carries, which an indifference to the use of these streams for pleasure made so frequently necessary, a stretch of shallows, a ruthless dam, a barb-wire fence thrown across by some self-centered farmer to keep his cows from wandering aroundthe end. On one such occasion Xanthippe's world famed peculiar talent manifested itself when a typical picture-book Yankee came rushing down to the further bank and threatening them for, as he supposed, cutting his fence which they were taking great pains not to injure. So Xanthippe rose in her wrath and drowned him out with equally picturesque diatribe [Note: ==== Beginning of page 281 ====] to the effect that putting his fence across the river was against the law and since he was so sassy about it they would take much pleasure in giving him the experience of the pinch of the law. The old man stood Page 826 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagosilent and with jaw dropped till they disappeared up stream. Probably he had not had any experience with truly Greek eloquence certainly not being the kind of a man that a Xanthippe would bother with. As Sunday drew to a close and train had to be caught back to the city Socrates, in passing through a small town, chose a house on the river bank and asked if the canoe could be left there till the following week-end. Thereupon began their universal (with one exception) experience with the sweetness of human nature, for throughout the three years of this adventure whomsoever they asked whether farmer or summer-house occupant or bridge tender, whether in poor or comfortable circumstances, no one ever refused to take Allana in and care for her and sometimes it meant real trouble. Once a storm arose andthe rising waters started her off on a jaunt of her own, but she was brought back. Sometimes as the cold season approached, they would say they expected to be back the next week-end and then the winter ice would close the stream and she would stay till Spring. And there after months they would find her. And no one would ever accept any compensation for this service. The one refusal was from an Institution well fitted to give her shelter - the Naval Quarters on the shore of Lake Michigan. They were sent fromsubordinate to higher up and so on to still higher ups and refused and they, on the lake where a canoe is not really safe even under the best circumstances, were sent out into the blackness of the night. They have been pacifists ever since. Militarism breeds beasts not humans. No one else was ever inhuman to Allana. Back to the office and the drafting board; and pleasant work Xanthippe was doing in partnership with Mr. Von Holst - residence for Mrs. [Note: David M.] Amberg, Grand Rapids; for the Adolph and Robert Muellers in Decatur; for the home of Henry Ford in Detroit - but somehow the work of that \"pink [Note: ==== Beginning of page 282 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . F.L. MOORE [Note: Morse?] . STILL CLASSIC BUT FREE drawing reads [/] Ithaca - of page 283 ====] haired\" (so called by my 5 year old niece) blond of a Socrates was gradually capturing her imagination. So one day, after they had got a cart to carry Allana over to the head waters of the Fox River and had dropped her into the waters of Grass Lake just when the great creamy yellow Egyptian lotus flowerswere in bloom and stretching as far as the eye could reach (Socrates' Daemon would always land him at such a spot at the very right moment) they slipped along, so soft, so still, through the huge lotus leaves without even a sound (so close were the pads) of the drip from the paddles to frighten the birds away. And so near they let them come! Only three places in America where these grow, brought in some mysterious way by some people of the remote past from where? Perhaps from Atlantis from whence theEgyptians also might have taken them. So this landscape architect told her, who knew the flora of his country from a to zed as they say in the antipodes. Afterward they got into the roaring rapids of the lower reaches where Xanthippe in the prow had hung Page 827 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoin the air over a three foot drop shouting back, \"We can't go here! We can't go here!\" only to hear from the stern - \"We've got to.\" And after waking very early in the cold morning to slip on down toward the Illinois, they watched veil after veil of the mists rise from the bluffed and forested banks, each veil as itrose revealing a new and ever more beautiful universe. Indeed the way to God, the Father God, is through a close and intimate contact with nature. What hope is there for our city-bred people. What does [Note: Rudolf] Steiner say, [Note: Albert] Einstein's with his talk about a cylindrical universe, but that there are as many universes as there are crystalline forms. A crystalline form is a primal work of a deity - a Primal force which cannot but express itself in a universeof consequences. And so after a rest on a sunny bank while he took a dip in the refreshing stream, Xanthippe said, \"Why don't I join you in your office?\" for Xanthippe was well known for her renderings, her presentation work, and the work of Socrates was lying hidden away known only to the immediate clients. Said he - \"I never [Note: ==== Beginning of page 284 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . SYDNEY . ROMANTIC [Note: The structure is the David Pratten House.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 285 ====] CAPTION The illumination of the garage as well as of the front entrance is a grille, grilled lanterns.

[Note: This page is not in the Art Institute of Chicago copy and is transcribed from the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 286 ====] [Note: Continued from page 283] dreamed that you would do that.\" Said she, \"All right I'll arrange it.\" And so they drew a bit closer together. Xanthippe had watched with interest the transformation of the work in the office where she had worked before, when Socrates, the Town Planner, had gone into partnership with Frank [Note: Lloyd] Wright, beginning to realize what has become clear beyond question as time has gone on, that architecture cannot be practiced properly unless based on the foundation of Town Planning. Just as Town Planning withoutArchitecture becomes nothing but real estate business squeezing the life out of the earth, so architecture when not combined with Town Planning in the same individual cannot solve the problems of architecture. Page 828 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoAnd now on coming into his office she had revelation after revelation, thrill after thrill. Problems which she had seen struggled over in office after office and never solved were being solved one after another. Inspiration, the source of information, had been tapped and she watched Socrates as Xanthippe alwayswatches Socrates with awe and amazement and understanding. Perhaps the fools would understand Mrs. Abraham Lincoln better if they had the wit to realize that true love is not based on friendly feelings but on feelings \"more closely related to enmity.\" It is time we got rid of this sloppy stuff about marriage. The small house, the minimum, the inexpensive house the most difficult of all architectural problems, were solved with the precision of a mathematical problem and with the exquisiteness of a Greek temple,and one after another laid before her delighted eyes. So they put their heads together and schemed a method of presentation. Uniform size, 18 by 36 inches on colored satin with the careful outline work of an etching and finished in transparent water-colors mixed with glue and a complete exposition of the building - plan, perspective, section, decorative details, worked together into a unified mural panel. Whenever the pressure of current work gave a moment's breathing spell these were continued till laterthere was a good sized roll for Socrates to [Note: ==== Beginning of page 287 ====] tuck under his arm and take over to Paris to be exhibited in the Palace of the Tuileries, and so they have been in constant use from that time to this. A democratic form of partnership was entered into which made each equally independent and responsible, the separation of personal clients with profits proportionate, to make the responsibility fordesign an individual matter, proved to be a splendid basis of future partnerships with the young people growing in the office which gave them a fine incentive for open, enthusiastic and thorough work and a possibility of working into responsible positions or into independent practice that does not exist in the usual architectural office. And then into the midst of this busy life was thrown the bomb which has made these full and busy times seem like leisure days - the announcement which Socrates had been on the watch for during the ten years since the Federation of the Australian States - an international competition for the Capital City - and Socrates applied for and received the information and the data for it. Weeks passed and months passed with no break in the usual tenure of their way. Week-ends took them from the Fox to the \"Fair Illinois\" as Xanthippe's father [Note: Jeremiah Mahony] had called it in his poem \"The Marriage of Michigan to the Fair Illinois,\" dedicating the opening of the first canal; but the powerful stream began to add an element of awe and dread to the occupants of the frail shell so, after sweeping past the precipices of Starved Rock the old Indian natural fortress, with the current, for it would have been impossible to paddle against it, Socrates turned Allana's nose into the Illinois-Michigan canal and they began that strange tour back to the lake through regions some of whichhad doubtless not been seen by man for 50 years or more. The new canal, the old canal, swamps. They thought at one time they would have to rig up some sort of wheel support - so often had the old canal disappeared as nature resumed her sway - to get Page 829 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 288 ====] from one stretch of water to the next. All obstacles were of a nature that could easily be overcome by an outer park body [Note: i.e., system or organization?] so that the whole of this three year route could become a wonderful pleasure jaunting field for the immense population of Chicago and all Illinois couldthey but have had time and strength for a detailed statement of the geography and nature of these waterways. Someday perhaps with young blood running swift! At last the head waters of a stream again, the Calumet, which they followed to Lake Michigan and here was where they realized the full force of the phrase - \"All the world is beautiful and only man is vile.\" For from the wonder and perfection of the natural stream they passed to town after town in thisindustrial region incredibly sordid, with the waters thick with the poisonous by-products of the mills, where it would have been the easiest thing in the world to have kept the river and its banks as permanent playgrounds for the growing communities. Was ever any civilization so stupid, so barbarous? Then with a 45 mile paddle in one day the lake was reached. This does not mean that Xanthippe paddled all that day for the canoe is an ideal toy for two of unequal strength, the strong one in the stern with fullcontrol whether the other paddles or not; so Xanthippe would paddle, then stretch out in the bottom and snooze; then up and paddle again. But Socrates would never stop. He never would at any time save by some insuperable force of nature or by the force of Xanthippe. 'Twas so in the office where his great ideal was to break Xanthippe of her homing habit. Always one more thing could be done or a still lovelier spot for landing could be found a little farther on. One night paddling up a swampy stream inflood time the moon rose and the moon set but still Socrates paddled on, and wonderful it was if you had the strength left sufficient for the registering of the perceptive faculties. Continuous rain set in and sang songs with the drip and drip of the paddle. Finally in the pitch dark they turned in to a group of trees for where the bank of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 289 ====] the river might be no human could tell and feeling around with their hands to see if there was any ground finally decided there was a bit, pulled Allana up on it and went to sleep in the canoe. Socrates himself thought the land would probably disappear with the rising waters and that such sound sleepers would be safer in the canoe. So they spread their rubber blankets over the canoe, it took the two to reachfrom end to end, and went to sleep. One can easily imagine what kind of a night they spent by picturing two people on a cold night sleeping in a bath tub with the plug in and the water turned on, for the weight of the rain gradually depressed the blankets to form a reservoir and the crack in the middle formed a perfect outlet from the reservoir into the canoe. Needless to say they were on their way early in the morning, slipping up the first canal to afarm house where they left Allana and in their sopping wet clothes walked ten miles to the nearest railway station and so home and on to the office. One learns from a succession of such experiences that one doesn't catch cold from exposure. This like most diseases is the consequence of living in houses.

[Note: Rudolf] Steiner says that on looking back over his life one can see things he has done and said that he was quite unconscious of the significance of at the time but that seen from the later point of viewbecome full of significance. When Socrates was a little fellow in school, and he was smaller than the average (These short men have the advantage they say since as a pumping machine the heart doesn't have anything like the task it has in the long fellows) he quite consciously made up his mind that when the older boys teased him he would make no sign, on the theory that if he didn't cry they would find no fun in it; and so it was. They soon left him alone. Fine discipline for the punishments he was to receivein his fight against the inertia of his time, especially in bureaucratic [Note: ==== Beginning of page 290 (table of contents) ====] CLARK MEMORIAL FOUNTAIN .

WORKING DRAWINGS [Note: The illustration is the verso of that found on page 290.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 292 ====] [Note: Continued from page 289] controlled communities, but what a handicap it gave Xanthippe. Such evidence of preparation in former lives for the work he was to do in this was instanced by the demand on his part when he went to the Illinois university for a course in Town Planning, for noUniversity in the world would offered such a course at that time. The basic religion of Town Planning requires the preservation of natural beauties, a respect for the works of the creator. Its practice at present entails perpetual fight with all the elements of the community. The weeks slipped by and the months slipped by and nothing was done about that competition. But on with the tale of Allana. What an experience that 45 mile spurt was! Going up a bit of a stream Xanthippe, eagerly absorbing all delights that were offering, for she was of a sanguine temperament, ecstatic in her enjoyment of all lovely and gracious things, with head bent low between her arms, pulling with all her strength for they were in a current so swift that they could scarcely make progress against it, called, \"Oh, look at the myriads of gastropods [Note: i.e., mollusks, snails] on the the bottom.\" \"Don't look,\" said \"Paddle!\" \"But \"They are so darling.\" \"Provoking person!\"said Socrates. And those are the harshest words he ever said to her. Once years after, she said, I'm like Ben Bolt's Alice. I laugh with delight when you give me a smile and tremble with fear at your frown.\" And he said, \"Did I ever frown at you?\" and with a still amazement this provoking person said, \"By Page 831 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoJove I don't believe you ever did.\" At one place where the stream had many shallows they had to get out and wade to lighten the load so that Allana could slip over the surface waters. A municipal gas plant, taking the privileges bureaucracieswill take that would not be tolerated from a private organization, had let its waste material flow into the stream, a black, sticky mass and such a waste of byproducts, again typically bureaucratic, and soon they found that they couldn't really clean their legs so that when [Note: \"Ben Bolt\" was poem written by Thomas Dunn English and later set to music. The words mention \"sweet Alice\" \"Who wept with delight when [Ben Bolt] gave smile [/] And trembled withfear [his] frown.\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 293 ====] later in the day they reached the lake they still left their legs bare and exposed to a blistering sun. The consequences later - Oh! let them be forgotten! They were now at the very southern toe of Lake Michigan but no rest was to be till Socrates had reached his predetermined goal, a group of camping hikers on the shore at the Dunes where late in the evening they arrived. This was the organization founded by eight or ten young seers, one of them Socrates, another Xanthippe's only first cousin, Dwight Perkins, which interested rapidly increasing number to take long and ever longer hikes over the region surrounding Chicago, and later over the State, always under strict discipline to injure nothing and to pick not even a leaf; and under informed leaders to discover and inspect and select the beauty spots and to press for their resumption by Chicago or the State forpermanent public play spaces and beauty reserves. Thus Chicago achieved the finest outer park system in the world. The work even overlapped into two states getting Illinois and Indiana to join in saving the unique and lovely dunes which were rapidly not only being occupied but destroyed by using the sand for concrete and other structural purposes. After this was stopped it proved just as easy, probably easier, for great sand suckers to get all that could be wanted from the bottom of the lake. The next day was the hottest any of them had ever experienced, the sand as hot as the top of a stove, and they all spent the whole day in the water even eating their meals there, getting out just to snatch a handful of food and scurrying back to eat it with only hands and heads above water. Perhaps it was the torture of those sunburned legs, perhaps it was just that well known mean disposition of hers or perhaps it was those spiritual advisers, of whom Xanthippe was unconscious at the time, thatsaid to her - \"We can't do anything with that Socrates without some human help. Won't you do something to make him get a start on that [Note: ==== Beginning of page 294 ====] important matter he has in mind?\" or perhaps it was the suggestion of the Devil himself as Socrates was later inclined to think; anyway the storm of wrath broke over his head on some such lines as follows:- Page 832 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago\"For the love of Mike when are you going to get started on those Capital plans? How much time do you think there is left anyway? Do you realize that it takes a solid month to get them over there after they have started on their way? That leaves exactly 9 weeks now to turn them out in. Perhaps you can designa city in two days but the drawings take time and that falls on me. Five weeks! It isn't possible to do them in nine weeks. Perhaps I am the swiftest draftsman in town but I can't do the impossible. What's the use of thinking about a thing like this for ten years if when the time comes you don't get it done in time! Mark my words and I'm not joking either, either you get busy on that this very day, this very minute (with rising tones) or I'll not touch a pencil to the darn things. Serve you jolly well right if Irefused to take it on now.\" (No, not jolly. Such language only came later.) And Socrates said nothing (He was such an amiable man) but started sawing wood. Oh my, Oh my, And so a new adventure was started. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 295 (table of contents) ====] No. 13. ROCK CREST & ROCK GLEN . DWELLING . J.G. MELSON [Note: In the New-York Historical Society copy a small photograph of the house is superimposed over the drawing. Rock Crest-Rock Glen is located in Mason City, Iowa.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 296 ====] CAPTION I had just entered into partnership with Griffin when Mr. [Note: Joshua G.] Melson, who with Mr. [Note: James E.] Blythe had recently bought a bit of Mason City [Note: Iowa] property through which a river flowed, came to me to design a house for him. This unoccupied stretch of land lies on either side of the river close to the down town district of Mason City. Mr. Melson, looking quite melancholy when he came to me, had had a dream and it wasn't coming true. He had asked [Note: Frank Lloyd] Wright to design a house for him but Wright had no TownPlanning sense and had designed just a house to set by the roadside. So the poet in Mr. Melson wasn't satisfied. He came to me. You know I had a romantic look. But instead of taking up his suggestion I told him that this was a Town Planning undertaking and suggested he talk it over with Walter Burley Griffin which he did on the site and was taken off his feet with the suggestions made for the general layout and for a dwelling for himself carrying up an oldquarry wall to form one wall of his home. In addition Griffin suggested an artificial precipice by encouraging the city to dump rubbish under quite a stretch of the bridge and facing it with the local stone thus adding 3 building lots whose outlook would rake up the river, and so on. When Mr. Melson's home was finished Griffin himself climbed up the wall from river bottom to roof. Page 833 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe house is a lovely blossom in the natural terraces of the river bank, with a secret afternoon-tea terrace on the level of the floor of the billiard room accessible only from it. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 297 ====] ROCK CREST & ROCK GLENHe was known as Don Melancholio. He got sketches for his home from one architect after another, including F.L.W. [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright], but nothing satisfied him though one at least was charming enough as plans go. But still he wandered on. At about this time I had settled myself in the office of Walter Burley Griffin. One day the Don came in and asked me if I would make him sketches for his house. I begged off saying Mr. Griffin's office waspressed with work and I felt in fairness to him I couldn't take time off for other work. Then he revealed his problem. He and Mr. Blythe of Mason City had bought 18 acres on the banks of the river in their home town and would I make a perspective drawing of it. The spark caught and I said I thought I could do that but if it was a landscape scheme he ought to talk with Mr. Griffin about it, and I showed him some of Griffin's houses, etc. He had a talk, had Griffin godown to Mason City for a day at the end of which the two gentlemen signed away their so-called liberties in a contract which bound each of them to do nothing on the property without Mr. Griffin's approval. The two men had bought this property because they thought it a lovely spot for a home. The rest of the river frontage had been ruined. Below was a miserable factory, above a rubbish dump. The banker andthe business man then put off and put off building each mistrusting what the other might do. To such impasses does this fetish of personal liberty, misplaced liberty, lead us in our chaotically conceived social system which refuses to recognize that a human community has three functions to fulfill and so requires three complete community organs to fulfill them, one for equity, one for liberty and one for mutuality, a political, an ability & an economic organ each consisting of the total citizenry. The TownPlanner would be an impartial arbitrator whose only personal interest would be to maintain the high standard of the whole property. [Note: ==== Beginning of page [298] ====] [Note: Supplied title: North Elevation Bridge Rock Crest & Rock Glen This illustration is not listed in the table of contents.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 299 ====] And Mr. Griffin came home with the job of designing the home of Mr. Melson, our Don, in his pocket. The other architects had handled the house simply from the architect's point of view locating it at the Page 834 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagonormal building line distance from the street frontage, but Griffin as soon as the house was mentioned inspected the property to select a particular lot and advised an abandoned quarry site on the river bank and drew a picture in Mr. Melson's mind of a house perched at the extreme back of the lot on top of thequarry precipice, continuing and giving finish to the quarry face, and commanding views up and down the river. Melancholy flew out and an enduring enthusiasm filled its place in our Don. Only once did it seem for a moment to have returned when the old \"sad face\" appeared in the office saying he was going to have to charge up his electric light bills to Mr. Griffin for - and then the smile crinkles began - everyone, and that was the whole town, who crossed the bridge - which connects \"down town\" with theresidence district - whether pedestrian or motorist stopped to look up the river at the fascinating sight of Rock Crest's initial building - a castle indeed for it was a unity with the whole precipice - completely reflected in the smooth waters above the old dam; and he couldn't resist the temptation of keeping his whole house lighted up to make the most of a spectacle of it. A location was also selected for Mr. Blythe's home - on the opposite bank - a gentle wooded slope, charming and gracious, extending from the house to the river, a complete contrast to Mr. Melson's site. Operations had scarcely begun when the town approached the owners to buy the property for a park but they realized they should have done this long before and rather than interfere with the men of vision in whose hands the whole would be better safeguarded than in the hands of the officials, instead of using their right of eminent domain they would perhaps take on the restitution of other parts of the riverfrontage, perhaps converting the dump into a park.

Of this Domestic Community Development Griffin says:- Rock Crest & Rock Glen occupy the two sides of the valley which Willow Creek has carved out of the rocks within 3 blocks of the central square of Mason City, Iowa. In common with many such beautiful pieces of nature it has been neglected during the growth of the community in favor of the commonplace sites all around it, awaiting the day which seems to be approaching when the imagination of the people is sufficiently stimulated by opportunity for unique development in those instances where long abuse has not been, as is generally the case, coincident with the neglect. This example comprises 18 acres ofthe creek frontage between two bridges. That at the north is a permanent masonry arch carrying an important thoroughfare route and fixes definitely the boundary in that direction but the western footbridge is merely a temporary structure and its removal in the near future is promised for the opening up of another 5 acres up-stream of a territory where rock and dell have still different forms of expression to be preserved and respected. The vertical bluffs of Willow Creek alternate from side to side of its sinuous course. In the portion illustrated they comprise the south and west banks, opposed by a gentle slope of meadow and open woods extending gradually up to almost equal elevation north and west within the limits of the tract. Wherever this rise has been less than that naturally, it has been augmented artificially by grading and filling to form a commanding hill at the north-east corner with lesser mounds and ravines masking thesouth embankment of the State street bridge [Note: ==== Beginning of page 303 ====] approach and finally with a considerable rockwork precipice covering the bridge abutments, matching in a way the bluffs from which the concrete arch springs on the east and forming the semblance of acanyon.

Unfortunately his young assistant [Note: Barry Byrne] in Chicago in whose charge the Chicago office had been placed wasinfluenced, by the so-called architect [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright] whose vanity and malice killed the so-called Chicago movement in architecture, not to forward these drawings but to send down his own Page 837 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagodesign for the building they were about to erect. They erected it but were disappointed that it was so out of keeping with what they were doing that nothing further was called for from the Griffin office. Fortunately they afterward continued on the lines on which they had begun. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 306 ====] METHOD OF DESIGN . Marion Mahony Griffin In entering my second office I was graduated from pure drafting to experience and began to function in my first stage of design in a realm fairly natural to me, that of the art of the painter. Not till years later was I to learn the radical difference between the art of painting and the art of architecture. Painting andsculpture are depictive arts sculpture to be sure including a sense of movement. But architecture is a spatial, a structural, art and requires a quite different impulse and type of comprehension. In this second office, that of F.L. [Note: Frank Lloyd] Wright, we were, to be sure, practicing as architects but were really functioning as artists, as painters. I became sort of subconsciously aware of this difference when Wright told me to design a flat roofed residence. This meant the building must havethe feeling of a home but must have a flat roof. I completely failed in this as did Wright himself. The most difficult of all architectural problems, the inexpensive dwelling was never solved in that office. But when I passed from that stage of my education into what might be called a post graduate school, in Griffin's office, I was brought to a comprehension of spatial principles, structural fundamentals, and the expression of soul requirements, or of human requirements if you prefer to put it that way, and began towitness the practice of architecture in this our 20th century. This was in Griffin's office about 1910. I will illustrate by one instance, amplifying by another instance in present day world architecture. I havespoken of the first requirement in the primal landscape conditions of the Melson house of Rock Crest. These conditions determined the placing of the house on the top of the quarry precipice. This precipice determined the building material, the local stone. The river facade of the building continued the sheerprecipice to the top of the house. That there should be no incongruity the roof was flat. When the house was completed the rough stone treatment made it possible for Griffin to climb the whole precipice [Note: ==== Beginning of page 307 ====] from river level to roof. This river frontage is 3 stories high. The lowest story is the billiard room whose floor forms a continuation of a bit of a terrace of the cliff which thus becomes accessible from the house, and only from the house, from the side French windows of the billiard room, for outdoor seclusion or hide away, or for afternoon tea guests. Next above are the living rooms. The steep slope on one side of the house means you can reach out over the windowsill of the dining room and pick wild violets or other seasonal blossoms flowering at the Page 838 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagolevel of the window sill. On the other side the more gentle slope opens up lovely more distant views. From the front windows you look out to the river and step out onto a balcony veranda cantilevered out from the house so from here your view rakes up and down the river, and looking down you see the flatriver bottom land with its garden laid out as a huge water lily, the paths separating the petals, and lily pads of sward surrounding the flower display. The top story is bed rooms and the garage, for to this level the drive can be brought, so this is the level of the entrance to the house. A painter living in this home could earn his living without ever leaving the house, the views are so varied and so constantly changing. To dwell in such a house is to be a livingbeing. Most houses contribute only death forces to their inhabitants. In this house Griffin originated a motif which has had a world wide influence. Here we are up against the problem of the flat roof. So simple a means as making tall heavy triple stepped projecting keystones over the upper windows does the trick. They function as well as ornament, which is an expression of affection, of feeling, of joy in your work and in your profession. They give the feeling of substantiality,of 3rd dimension, of structure, of spatial reality, a very satisfying feeling to us mortals. Griffin used this idea in many ways. Interestingly enough when one has done creative thinking, this becomes a permanent contribution to [Note: ==== Beginning of page 308 (table of contents) ====] NEW MEXICO UNIVERSITY . ELEVATIONS & SECTIONS [Note: ==== Beginning of page 309 ====]humanity, and this whether he has had the opportunity to put it into actual construction or not, and this is especially gratifying in the art of architecture where whether a design in carried into construction or not depends not on the architect but on others, on the client. They [Note: creative designs] are accessible because the imaginative forces are permanent in their nature and when once brought into creative form ina creatively thinking being they remain for all time for they are of the nature of duration, of other, and are not perishable. One who has the power of consciousness in these etheric realms can have access to these forces and bring them down to use in the sensible realms. This faculty is the essence of genius. The first office building for which Griffin made use of this motif has an interesting history. There was a custom in Australia when giving a foreigner a job, of requiring that he accept a partner whose only realfunction was to collect half of the fee, a manifestation of patriotism. The working drawings of this building as accepted by the clients when put to the city authorities for passing bumped up against an objection to a certain projection of a roof feature 10 stories above the street. This by the way was the first tall building erected in Australia. So Griffin made an alternate design of the facade using the stepped pier motif rising above the roof line and by their depth taking away the thin feeling of the usualcity building, since city buildings frequently present only their front face to the public. At least that was the case before the stepping back above certain heights was required for light for the streets below. Page 839 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe clients called upon the partner for advice as to whether this design should be accepted. He was awake to its possibilities so advised against accepting it. He then got to work with the Building Council and got the first design passed which was then built. Before many months had passed he built a citybuilding using the Griffin design. It was not a handsome building but the motif was there. [Note: In Section II, No. 3., page 28ff, MMG relates a similar story involving the Capitol Theatre in Melbourne.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 310 ====] You will see it all over the world now. As our steamer came into Madrid [Note: Madras] in India I saw it there, an office building nearing completion, and used very charmingly. All around about one seesbridges so designed, very handsome. The most impressive building of the recent New York Exposition [Note: New York World's Fair 1939-1940], not counting the replicas of ancient National types, was the Russian building, this same motif, and so we find it in other buildings classed as modern architecture. Much is the effect of creative design. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 311 (table of contents) ====] No. 14. BLYTHE DWELLING .

Since it was on the lower levels it was flat roofed to least obstruct the views of the dwellings above. It is built of the local lime stone. The garage and front entrance with the library above form an imposing feature balanced on the opposite side by a conservatory living veranda with a sleep-out porch above and its corner flower boxes.

Walter Burley Griffin Color is an essential element of all that exists in form. Without light and color life is a term devoid of meaning. Possibly it is indicative of subordination to objects other than life itself that modern civilized existence is the drab, sooty and monotonous thing our city-dwellers know so to hate, and get away frominto the country whenever a chance offers, if only to witness others' sport and play or even horses run or, at great expense, trouble and annoyance, to spend a few hours somewhere in the open at the week's end.

The colors of nature are exuberance itself and play [Note: \"play\" crossed out in N-YHS] infinite in variety of combination and ever changing during the passage of the sun. No painting on the wall can be an acceptable substitute for a glimpse of a mountain view or a garden, and no place here in Australia need be too small to afford for every day something of actual animate nature if no more than a wall garden. The obstacle that stands in our way in our home is the wall, a necessary evil we assume but not one Page 841 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoincapable of mitigation if we try. Verandas are popular because they afford an escape on occasions though, unfortunately, rare in many situations in our climate. One or two ordinary guillotine windows do not suffice, however, to make daylight and life our own. Upper sash must be almost continuallyblinded off to reduce glare. To appreciate the value of eyebrows in windows, compare the clearness and brilliance of coloring of nature viewed from under a low spreading tree and then from out in the open. The proper objective in a house should be as continuous a belt as possible of windows between the landscape or garden outlook and the point of view of the eyes when seated or standing, and with no more glass than in one double-hung window, two or three times as much [Note: ==== Beginning of page 316 ====] prospect from our rooms is obtained with a single tier of sash, whether single-hung, pivoted or swung. Otherwise the house is the lifeless prison we generally have to put up with and accept as punishment for indifference to nature's harmony and for submission to the rapacity of land exploiters who would increase their income by herding us closer if they possibly could. Of course full benefit cannot be expected from landscape windows if there is no outlook but, in few, if any, cases is it necessary to accept such a position at the time the house is planned. There are possibilities of making landscape outlooks all the way from window boxes, suntraps and courts, to so informally grouping our buildings (otherwise than in rows cheek by jowl in stockaded pens) as to preserve to each whatever common outlook there may be of gardens, parkways or distant views. Then too, relative proportions and open connections between rooms have much to do with their sunniness and liveliness and in overcoming the feeling of confinement in cells. Doorways generally afford the sole communication but partitions, windows, rails, screen walls and loges [Note: N-YHS reading] and gallery effects must become the rule instead of the exception if we are ever to know in ourselves the romance we merely observe, through these means, in the settings of the stage or the screen, where the necessity for romantic expression is always recognized. To reflect into the interior itself the colors of daytime, the most important element is the carpet, whose reflection supplies most of the light from the sky out of doors. Nothing is so good for this purpose as the glowing green of the lawns or the buffs of the grain fields or the yellows of the sands to which shades in similar relation to the eyebrows, we are accustomed by our hereditary constitutions and which colors are by reason of their universality in nature the most neutral in their effects on our dispositionsand psychology. Then too, they are economical of the light having high reflecting power, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 317 ====] whereas the dingy reds, browns, and nondescript mixtures most commonly in use on our floors are veritable robbers of life giving light. The walls are next to the floors in importance as daylight reflectors in most cases; and their importance Page 842 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoin this respect is less often overlooked. But, apparently since white can be more or less maintained on these surfaces, it is accepted in its rawness or, almost unquestionably, in the form of pasty tints as a substitute for whatever colors we may want. This seems to me radically wrong for flat flour-pigmenttints are a feeble compromise at best, except with sheen or bloom such as are found only in flat coverings beyond reach of the ordinary householder, including tapestries, silks, metals and marbles. These are available only for incidentals. There are, however, wall textures of rough plaster or gritty artificial stone susceptible of brilliant tints and rich shades derived from the tints in the middle range of the spectrum. These textures can beproduced at no greater expense than the ubiquitous hard, cold, cheerless plaster of paris, and it is with them that the main possibilities of interior decoration lie. How such a sepulchral finish as the plaster could have become accepted in the community it is not easy to see for it as devoid of practical advantages as of aesthetic adaptability. It is fragile and always becomes chipped; it is absorbent and hence never free of finger marks and all kinds of smudges andsmears and it cannot be cleaned. It necessarily abounds in cracks almost from the beginning and these have a clear smooth field in which to exhibit all their vagaries; and finally, it affords no adequate or permanent foothold for paint, paper or fabric covering so much demanded by its inherent hopelessness. Given however, a decent structural basis of floated lime or cement plaster or a wire-scruffed burned clay, all that is necessary for the maximum of elegance and finish in the interior walls is either a glaze ora stain of some pure hue containing a large proportion of yellow. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 318 ====] The result may be tan, orange, salmon, yellow, olive, or sage, or anything within the gamut of the sunshine colors but nothing nearer to either end of the solar spectrum can be expected to carry sufficient brilliance to be tolerated where God's day light is the objective. The problem of the ceilings is different. These surfaces have the least effect on the lighting in the daylight but are the all-essential reflectors of artificial light at night. That, however is another story. It is sufficient to say that, for such purposes they should invariably be tints and as may be deduced from what has been said, warm glowing tints.

A HILL DEVELOPMENT [Note: The caption to the New-York Historical Society illustration reads: \"Griffin's 1st Town Plan & 1st Structure - Water Tower - in Australia\".] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 320 ====] Page 843 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoCIVILIZATION & ITS FURNITURE . Walter Burley Griffin In its furnishing, are the standards of our requirements based upon utility, comfort, and appreciation of nature's own artistry? Or are they merely the expression of a machine-ridden era and of a more or lessindifferent public? The Western peoples have necessities more or less artificial and arbitrary which it may take some thousands of years to eradicate: we have yet to grasp the simplicity of a really old and fully developed civilization without even beds or chairs for instance. Among the longer civilized races domestic ornament in generally restricted to single or significant objects of interest; it is not, as with us, anobjectless accumulation with few, if any, outstanding features. It is gradually becoming recognized now that the less furniture a house contains, consistent with its needs, the better. This is a phase of aesthetics which has been most evident among the people of the Orient. Australia is an Oriental country, and if our civilization embraces adaptation to environment, climatic influences may eventually bring about a corresponding reaction on the part of the people. CONSIDERATIONS OF COST Although the tendency of modern furnishing has long been toward excessive elaboration the question of the beautiful and infinitely varied household effects of Europe, dating in style from the Middle Ages, is denied us by reason of high cost. The best we have been able to attain in that direction is a monotonous procession of machine-made imitations of \"period\" furniture. The result is seen in the mass of low quality impedimenta exposed in the shops and offered as achievements of the art of furnishing. Even the cost of the upkeep of this \"period\" trash, despite the use of various mechanical devices for cleaning and refurbishing, is so serious a matter as to make inevitable some steps towards a rational equipment for living in accord with modern conditions. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 321 ====] MISUSE OF BEAUTIFUL MATERIALSIn the first place the machines that turn out hard mechanical reproductions of highly wrought designs, are surely capable of doing within their limitations more perfect, accurate and highly finished work in lines adapted to machine methods. There is an inherent beauty in all natural materials that can be brought out by mechanical working in a higher degree than any other way and this is the feature that should be sought rather than the intricaciesof man-made design, which only the continuous operation of creative imagination can keep alive. It is to the pattern of the marble, the grain of the wood, the weave or pile of the fabrics and textiles, and the patina of the murals, the luster of the glass that we have to look now instead of to the cunning of the craftsman, otherwise the grinding tedium of the operation is too obvious. It intrudes all too noticeably and the result, despite a mathematical precision, is disappointment and dissatisfaction. It is an art that istoo admittedly \"faked.\" For simple lines and plain surfaces the beauty is in the greatest degree provided Page 844 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 The Art Institute of Chicagoby the material itself; nature's contribution, beyond all effective imitation. Here are texture, mottle and color in endless variety that our facilities can bring to the surface if we don't attempt to overlay or off-set them by meaningless decoration. THE FUNCTION OF FURNISHINGS With furniture whose charm lies in qualities of nature's providing a vaster scope than in the days of handicraft is opened up to the modern home builder. In a consistent singleness of motif an individuality of the home as a whole comprising ground, house, furniture and furnishings there is in fact a scope for design open to our age that was never possiblebefore the invention of machinery. The aesthetic function of the furniture and furnishings is not now to attract attention to itself or to its [Note: ==== Beginning of page 322 ====] individual specimens but to carry out and express a larger creature of the imagination a home as unique in general conception as in all its parts. Such a scheme in the first place should rest upon a given measure of rhythm or module, the necessary condition of harmony supplying the scale of all the appurtenances as well as the envelopment and the structure itself. FIXTURES A great deal of what has been and is being carted from house to house in the incessant migrations of our present day life represent sheer waste of effort and wear and tear since certain features are essential tocertain rooms which should never be built without them. For instance no bedroom can be a bedroom without a wardrobe which, integral with the structure, takes up a fraction of the space and represents a fifth to a third of the initial cost of the much less effective and more troublesome and clumsy transported encumbrance to which our British communities are inured. Kitchen cabinets are coming to be seen in this light too and book cases, fuel bins and settees, which are not frequently taken into account in thebuilding but require to become general to rid the community of a large share of the bugbear of moving day. Already, fortunately, lighting and cooking and heating equipment are not necessarily nor even generally portable and are therefore recognized elements of the home in its fixed environment and as such make for that opportunity of individuality in each case which machinery and organization offer to replace themore restricted scope for inventiveness and expression that belonged to the handicraft era. Little use as yet is being made of the greater scope because evidently we are still restrained in our minds, however free may be our hands, and so the forms even of indirect lighting today mostly ape the lamp shades of yesterday. However, there is no need for any home builder to follow in the rut for in his own building he can complete these Page 845 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 323 ====] [Note: Supplied title: Windows Hung with Curtains in Rich, Plain Colour.

The interior is of the Felstead House.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 324 ====] features to his own free will provided some antiquated arbitrary bye-law does not happen to intervene, as is often the case. CARPETSThe first item after the building is the carpeting, the design of which must usually precede the wall decorations because the field of selection and the bounds of cost, and available materials are usually more restricted. Only of late has anything been offered in our shops so suitable as the perfectly plain rugs, without borders even, in rich autumn shades and, as yet, nothing is better where the conditions of use aresuitable. But, of course, there is sometimes a practical objection to these in the matter of keeping clean and it is fortunately becoming possible to find now and then two-tone or unostentatious all-over patterns in subdued coloring that are not imitative and do credit to factory looms. HANGINGS As to hangings there is now a wealth of wonderfully beautiful textiles in all fabrics to meet every sort of requirement as to economy or richness in plain or decorative weaves and in \"texture\" patterns that need little or no hand work adornment to provide all the liveliness and interest that can be desired. It is remarkable that opportunities in this direction are not made much of in our houses where often portieres [Note: curtains hung over open doorways] are better adapted to the necessities than doors or blinds or shades or screens and they give an atmosphere of comfort and completeness not matched bythe much more expensive alternatives. Wall hangings, on the other hand, suitable enough for nomads and tents and hutments for armies or Arabs, are not properly a feature of the modern fixed house which lives up to the opportunities of modern construction since nothing so flimsy as paper or cloth laid over the more substantial structure of the building itself can share the dignity, strength and permanence that inhere in the exposed surface ofintegral materials of the building whether stone, clay, mortar or timber. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 325 ====] Page 846 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoSTONE DWELLING . ITS LOCATION ON LOT [Note: The structure is the Cox House, Castlecrag.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page [325-2] ====] FURNITUREBedsteads presumably must long continue to be portable, but the sooner they more nearly approximate couches than the old four-posted canopied affairs from which they are gradually degenerating the better for our health and convenience and the more variously useful and spacious will our apartments be for oriental couches afford in fact the most comfortable and sociable and flexible seating accommodation possible. Either over-stuffed or wicker chairs are more adaptable as yet to a style of our own times than the machine products of wood which latter are economically made in larger numbers and require more thought then the factories yet give to design or other than imitative lines. Grace in the simple wood work frame is all that is required but this is most over-looked in the craze for pretense. Wooden tables are essentially massive and simple enough to permit of their manufacture to order for any particular home that aims consistently toward individual homogeneity without increase in cost. For the finish of the furniture, as in fact for the finish of most of the woodwork of the house on these lines, wax in some form affords the only surface coating that will conserve to the maximum the natural qualities for which we have started out. APPLIANCESThere is not much room for 'objects d'art' complete in themselves in our homes for the multiplicity of already accepted needs in dishes and useful devices and instruments and in the receptacles for a profusion of plants and flowers give in themselves more scope for affectionate interest than can be distributed so widely. Especially is this so in Australia. Simplicity, evident lack of effort, alone in a great majority of all these effects is the key to restfulness in the aggregate. The very especial features to which attention may be attracted are properly the craftsman's product easily designed or chosen in any time and place in character with the individuality of the home. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 326 ====] FROM CHICAGO TO THE ANTIPODESWhat an American learns in Australia and how difficult it is to impart to others is the theme of this record. If it were not so important one would not attempt it. But when one sees the consequences manifest, as they have done at the end of a quarter of a century in frightful wars encircling the globe, and more terrible things lying in our near future unless cures are provided, one dares do no less than make Page 847 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright The of Chicagothe attempt [Note: \"to\" inserted in N-YHS] pass on to the coming generations the information gained through what may be called the unique experiences of one man. After all man is a unique being. He is not just a digit in a genus or species nor any longer in a race. For the course of evolution of humanity has been toward the development of a complete individual, and the time has come, however recent it may be, when we are as likely to find a great creative molder of humanity among one people as another. It may be a [Note: Leo] Tolstoy in Russia or a Sun Yat-sen in China or a [Note: Thomas] Jefferson among Anglo Saxons or a Dr. [Note: George Washington] Carver among Americans. Here we find a clue for our story, for America (the United States) is a unique thing in the world - a great natural region where for many generations, running now into several centuries, but organized only since 1776, any human being could come and live, earning his living and practicing his religion on even terms with anyone else, not barred from even the highest office in the land. Only in this deadly century did the community degrade itself by putting up immigration barriers. But the very nature of democracies opensthe doors to mistakes but at the same time makes it possible to rectify them. With a world organization now pending there may come a solution of this problem which will naturally melt down these barriers without calling for so high a moral test as the present rescinding of those acts of cowardice. After all people are home lovers. The Gods are certainly holding their breath to see what the beings to whom they greeted that incredible gift of free will do in this testing time. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 327 ====] [Note: Pages 327-329 are essentially repeated in No. 15, pages 337-339 (below). In the New-York Historical Society copy these three pages appear only once, at No. 15 on pages 337-339.] Griffin's post graduate course of education began with the Canberra incident, a unique thing in many ways but chiefly in the fact that it united two poles of the earth - Chicago and Canberra. I would like to make an appeal to the imagination. If you could see what I have seen you would see a child born with avision. He fashioned it through into a reality though he had to \"Jamb it down their throats.\" He died under the power of an Indian Oriental spell, at least our Indian gardener thought so - thought that the Gods had accepted Walt's life in the place of his wife's. And in his return to earth in a new incarnation he sees humanity falling to pieces because men of our time will not heed the message seers have given them. Is it ever thus with our seers? Can we never learn to listen and give heed? The Sun was in the zenith when Burley Griffin was born - high noon - which would bind his life - as the orientals among our European peoples think - with the antipodes as in other polarities where up is bound with down or inside with outside. If you project a line from America through to the center of the earth it will hit the realm of the ancient Lemuria whence Australia sprang. There at about the same time another man was born. James Alexander Smith was ruled by the Midnight Sun which bound him to theland of his birth though he was much better known in other lands than in his own - a great creative scientist to whom many doors were opened in the Western Hemisphere among them a complete laboratory and to do as he liked by our Westinghouse Company. Page 848 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoBut to fulfill their vision these two men had to come together. The Australian early determined to make a nation of Australia. Griffin while still in the grades was laying down the basic plan for its Capital City. Two people working together can transform the world. Dreams come in a flash but one must fight thewhole past to the death to make them come true - \"sweat and tears and blood.\" Australia's favorite slogan \"Australia for the Australians\" rang from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern and was taken up there [Note: James Alexander Smith (1862-1940) was a noted consulting engineer and a member of the board for the Canberra design competition.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 328 ====] by the Indian cry \"India for the Indians.\" Well do I remember the astonishment in the face of an Australian friend when she expressed surprise that the Indians there approved of the Australian slogan, and I answered - of course they do, that means India for the Indians. We had a glimpse of what may come of this during our year in India. The answer does not lie in such limited visions, such self-centered hopes. Mr. [Note: John (Joseph)] Curtin, the present Prime Minister has taken further steps which I'lltake up later. This one man Smith working, as he did all his life, behind the scenes gathered others about him, suggested here, directed there and brought about the Federation of the States and, written into the constitution was the requirement that the location of the Federal Capital must be determined within ten years. In the mean time from a baby following his mother through the garden patting the flowers lovingly as he went, from a schoolboy held back in his grades a year because he spent his time drawing city plans, laying down their basic principles, eliminating their conflict as seen in every modern city yet built, solving simultaneously the problems of occupation and of communication, from a youth going to his state university in Champaign, Illinois and demanding a course in Town Planning which they created forhim thus establishing the profession of Town Planning in modern times, Griffin came to manhood. Just at this moment Smith's triumph was flashed around the world. Australia was a nation. Griffin took note of this and having complete confidence in his rational powers, from that day he watched all the architectural publications for the announcement of an international competition for the designs for this capital city. This was truly humorous for it was the last thing in the world the British Empire intendedshould happen. But seen from his logical mind - there were no planners in the world at large so the only way a planner of the town could be picked would be by means of a competition. The story of how J.A. Smith accomplished that is a story [Note: ==== Beginning of page 329 ====] indeed. The two men won for after all, in human affairs, all initiative and all creative power lies in the will of individual men. What a man sets his will to he can accomplish (especially if he gets a pal to work Page 849 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagowith him). In this interim Burley Griffin had added unto himself a wife and \"very sensibly\" as she overheard a client of his saying to him, \"had picked an architect\" and indeed a useful slave she proved to be. A yearpassed and there, to her unbelieving eyes, was the announcement. On request, complete data for the same was received from Australia. But the office was busy and weeks and months passed till 9 weeks before the drawings would have to be sent the Mrs. performed that valuable Xanthippe function for which the wives of great men are famed. During my early life I was led by the passing Will o' the Wisp in what I did - drawing, dancing, drama, architecture. Not so after my marriage - Yes even before, when I suggested to my friend Walt that he might find me a useful person in his office in the matter of the presentation of his work. I presently became deeply centered in the task of lending a hand in all the various emergencies that arose. Truly I lost myself in him and found it completely satisfying. That is the normal difference between men and women though the task of each is now to become a complete human being - both receptive and creative.Australia and India gave us our greatest joys as well as our greatest agonies.

The garage in this case is on the level of the street. Even these two groups - Trier Center and Mason City - to say nothing of Australia and India show Griffin's endless versatility whereas what variations arose in [Note: Frank Lloyd] Wright's work, even to the raft foundation about which he has had so much publicity, came from other sources.

It was Griffin who brought the Thomas house up out of the ground with an English basement and a right angle plan, etc., etc. The enthusiastic and able young men as proved in their later work were doubtless as influential in the office later as were these early ones but Wright's early concentration on publicity and his claims that everybody was his disciple had a deadening influence on the Chicago group and only after a quarter of a century do we find creative architecture conspicuously evident in the United States.

Nothing is more trying to our nerves or displeasing to the eye than to have a lot of heterogeneous motives huddled together, for a design is an expression of an emotion and the jarring effect of a lot of indiscriminate visual motives is quite as great though not at present so clearly understood as would be the throwing together of snatches of music of different character as pastoral, and jig, and hymn and dirge. The Japanese are right in using from their stores only one decorative ornament as jar, picture, statuette, flower group, at a time set off by the simplicity of the general treatment of surfaces. The room itself should be beautiful before anything is brought into it. The confusion to which we doom ourselves when we use figured wall papers, figured rugs, figured curtains, figured upholstery, is responsible for much of the weariness of the women who spends so much of their time in the house, for peevishness of children who cannot he expected to understand thecauses of their discomfort, and for grouchiness of men who need rest when they come home from a day's work, who would resent being obliged to listen to discordant notes constantly jangling in their ears and, if sufficiently intelligent to understand the cause of their discomfort, would recent being subjected to discordant visual notes. We understand this fact of harmony or discord in music. In the course of the centuries it finally dawned on us that there was a law in accordance with which sounds were pleasing or displeasing to us. We studied into the nature of the law and then we entered into the great, new, limitless world of music, a heaven of measureless delights. As the Kabalistic writings say - \"When we name a new angel and know [Note: ==== Beginning of page 333 ====] its duties we become its master,\" or as it is put in accordance with the modern manner of thinking - when we know a law and its functions to that extent we gain control over nature and become powerful accordingly. We have discovered the Angel of Color. We are just beginning to learn its functions. But the Angel of Proportion, the significance of line and angle and form, the meaning and value of motif Page 851 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoand design we are hardly aware of. But a building is line, form, motive, and until we realize that they must be used in conformity to law to be pleasing we will get occasional satisfying results as are found in barbaric music but no great orgrowing architecture and as all things act and react on each other so the very development of our character, of our souls, is dependent on these laws of nature which are spiritual as well as physical in themselves and in their effects. A motive in design must therefore be used with great care, we can take a simple theme which alone may give relief to what might otherwise be a monotone too severe to be entirely desirable. Such a note can bevery charmingly introduced in a home by a bit of design with perhaps a touch of color in the window glass. Any evidence of affectionate treatment of any useful element in a structure is very pleasing. This same motive, or developments of it, can be carried into the case doors and illumination fixtures. There is no limit to the elaboration possible and beautiful in following this plan. The design can be carried into a rug or the draperies or the china but always the designs must be related to each other either byconformity or contrast. It is not possible to say that any one degree of elaboration is better than another. Each one is a song. Only to overdevelop one part and neglect another would be as bad as to put the treble of a symphony with the base of a finger exercise. Balance of all parts [Note: ==== Beginning of page 334 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING . MR. RULE . ROCK GLEN [Note: ==== Beginning of page 335 ====]is essential. This matter of balance depends primarily on the arrangement of the plan of the house. The necessities of the small house holder are totally different from those of larger establishments and the introduction of elements which are most convenient in the latter case into the former problem resulting from lack of realization of the difference in the problem often leads to waste, extravagance and actualinconvenience. This often happens when a pantry is being considered where there are several servants to prevent too great confusion in the one room, to enable the housekeeper to have a place to work where she will not interfere with the cook, or to separate the confusion of a room where people are working from the dining room, but in the bungalow where one does one's own work or at most employs one assistant, it means added steps, inconvenience in getting at implements and materials, waste of space. Asmall kitchen properly arranged with cupboards on the walls is not only an economy in building but a most desirable arrangement for the housekeeper. When we stop to think what meals can be turned out of the tiny kitchen of a dining car we are brought to a realizing sense of the wastefulness and inconvenience of our ordinary domestic arrangements. Again the space used for hall and stairway in a large house become most inconvenient in a bungalow. The plan should be so arranged that in a compactand restricted area access can be given to all the various parts of the house as entrance, living room, kitchen and second story while maintaining the privacy of each and avoiding making a thoroughfare of any. The grand stair way appropriate enough in a palace with its functions of pomp and parade become an absurdity in our domestic life, a manner of living totally unknown two centuries ago. Page 852 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoThe flexibility of a small house is much increased by throwing the living rooms together so far as possible, for no matter how small the family there are many times when for social purposes it is necessary to have a large room. Nor does this arrangement interfere with [Note: ==== Beginning of page 336 ====] the proper fulfilling of the separate functions of living and dining room for the nature of these two rooms is such that when one of them is occupied the other is empty. The economy of throwing the space of the two together is obvious. The necessity of separating guests from the confusion of elaborate service does not exist. Such separation of dining table from living quarters as might occasionally be needed can be easily effected by the use of a screen. On festivaloccasions the whole space can serve as dining room, arranged with tables which can be easily removed leaving a fine big room for frolic when the feast is done. Indeed I have known very small houses that could entertain on a much larger scale than really big houses, simply as a consequence of a well thought out plan. Small rooms, each capable of being cut off from the others, is an arrangement no longer called for by the old difficulties of heating, nor by the old difficulties in housekeeping which made it easier to keep one room immaculate, ready for the reception of the occasional guest. We live too close to each other in these days, too intimately, on too [Note: reading from N-YHS] democratic a footing to make us wish to have a little show spot. We open our homes as our hearts and are not ashamed of our occupations. It is no doubt convenient to have one room, call it a reception room or den or grouch or study or office, whereseclusion is possible but under ordinary circumstances this need is subordinate to the more constant and pressing needs of our everyday life where more and more we are becoming conscious of harmonizing and unifying the interests of all the members of a family, men and women, old and young - a movement permeating all our community as we see evidenced in our movements for equality of opportunity in education and business and politics, as we see it in the social center movements unifying the social lifeof old and young, bringing together all the elements of a community. Walter Burley Griffin [Note: ==== Beginning of page 337 ====] [Note: Pages 337-339 essentially repeat the text found in No. 14, pages 327-329 (above).]UNITING TWO POLES Griffin's post graduate course of educating the profession of the world began with the Canberra incident, a unique thing in many ways but chiefly in the fact that it united two poles of the earth - Chicago and Canberra. I would like to make an appeal to the imagination. If you could see what I have seen you would see a child born with a vision. He fashioned it through into a reality though he had to\"Jamb it down their throats.\" He died under the power of an Indian Oriental spell, at least our Indian Page 853 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagogardener thought so - thought that the Gods had accepted Walt's life in the place of his wife's. And in his return to earth in a new incarnation he sees humanity falling to pieces because men of our time will not heed the message seers have given them. Is it ever thus with our seers? Can we never learn to listen andgive heed? The Sun was in the zenith when Burley Griffin was born - High noon - which would bind his life - as the orientals among our European peoples think - with the antipodes as in other polarities where up is bound with down or inside with outside. If you project a line from America to [Note: \"through\" substituted in N-YHS] the center of the earth it will hit the realm of the ancient Lemuria whenceAustralia sprang. There at about the same time another man was born. James Alexander Smith was ruled by the Midnight Sun which bound him to the land of his birth though he was much better known in other lands than in his own - a great creative scientist to whom many doors were opened in the Western Hemisphere among them a complete laboratory and to do as he liked by our Westinghouse Company. But to fulfill their vision these two men had to come together. The Australian early determined to make a nation of Australia. Griffin while still in the grades was laying down the basic plan for its Capital City. Two people working together can transform the world. Dreams come in a flash but one must fight the whole past to the death to make them come true - \"sweat and tears and blood.\" Australia's favorite slogan \"Australia for the Australians\" rang from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern and was taken up there [Note: James Alexander Smith (1862-1940) was a noted consulting engineer and a member of the board for the Canberra design competition.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 338 ====] by the Indian cry \"India for the Indians.\" Well do I remember the astonishment in the face of an Australian friend when she expressed surprise that the Indians there approved of the Australian slogan,and I answered - of course they do, that means India for the Indians. We had a glimpse of what may come of this during our year in India. The answer does not lie in such limited visions, such self-centered hopes. Mr. [Note: John (Joseph)] Curtin, the present Prime Minister has taken further steps which I'll take up later. This one man Smith working, as he did all his life, behind the scenes gathered others about him, suggested here, directed there, and brought about the Federation of the States and, written into the constitution was the requirement that the location of the Federal Capital must be determined within ten years. In the mean time from a baby following his mother through the garden patting the flowers lovingly as he went, from a schoolboy held back in his grades a year because he spent his time drawing city plans,laying down their basic principles, eliminating their conflict as seen in every modern city yet built, solving simultaneously the problems of occupation and of communication, from a youth going to his state university in Champaign, Illinois and demanding a course in Town Planning which they created for Page 854 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagohim thus establishing the profession of Town Planning in modern times, Griffin came to manhood. Just at this moment Smith's triumph was flashed around the world. Australia was a nation. Griffin took note of this and having complete confidence in his rational powers, from that day he watched all thearchitectural publications for the announcement of an international competition for the designs for this capital city. This was truly humorous for it was the last thing in the world the British Empire intended should happen. But seen from his logical mind - there were no planners in the world at large so the only way a planner of the town could be picked would be by means of a competition. The story of how J.A. Smith accomplished that is a story [Note: ==== Beginning of page 339 ====] indeed. The two men won for after all, in human affairs, all initiative and all creative power lies in the will of individual men. What a man sets his will to he can accomplish (especially if he gets a pal to work with him). In this interim Burley Griffin had added unto himself a wife and \"very sensibly\" as she overheard a client of his saying to him, \"had picked an architect,\" and indeed a useful slave she proved to be. A yearpassed and there, to her unbelieving eyes, was the announcement. On request, complete data for the same was received from Australia. But the office was busy and weeks and months passed till 9 weeks before the drawings would have to be sent the Mrs. performed that valuable Xanthippe function for which the wives of great men are famed. During my early life I was led by the passing Will o' the Wisp in what I did - drawing, dancing, drama, architecture. Not so after my marriage - Yes even before, when I suggested to my friend Walt that he might find me a useful person in his office in the matter of the presentation of his work. I presently became deeply centered in the task of lending a hand in all the various emergencies that arose. Truly I lost myself in him and found it completely satisfying. That is the normal difference between men and women though the task of each is now to become a complete human being - both receptive and creative.Australia and India gave us our greatest joys as well as our greatest agonies.

Water for instance when it solidifies expands. We can see this in the form its crystals take, its frost crystals foretelling the living vegetable kingdom. The pine family originated in the South Pole. The Auricaria in Australia shows the early form. Note the similarity of the water lily and the cactus blossom. The vegetable kingdom transforms spirit into matter, mathematics to life. The ethers shape the leaves - in Page 855 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe light sharply triangular (see the photograph of light), in the shade the crescent or double crescent of the chemical ether, water forming. Australia's Archangel was the greatest of artists playing with color and form, in barks and leaves as well as flowers. Which requires the greatest intelligence a tree or abridge? Plants do not consume food, they create it. The 19th century knew only the mineral kingdom. Before life it confessed itself ignorant. Spirits conceived life into the triangle and ellipse archetype. Goethe sensed this. FOURNESS MATERIALIZED - A. WARMTH . HEAT . SPHERES [Note: This drawing is located beside the following paragraph in the text.] To understand a tree, or anything else, we have to know where it came from and who made it. So for trees we have to search the universe and we look out and see the sun and moon and the stars. Now then we look at a child, say all bundled up for a cold winter day we see her clothes and not the child herself so when we look at the stars, and the nearest and so to the eye the biggest star is the sun, we see thegarment of the Sun Being, the most powerful of all the Beings that we know anything about. These starry Beings are Fire Beings, great spheres of fire, so we can picture them by drawing a great circle. And we can show these great Fire Beings working and playing together by [Note: This page is transcribed from the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 341 ====] drawing many circles -A-. In working together these Spirits of Fire form ideas. You see here already they have formed the idea of plant life, of the leaf form - of the clover leaf - and, as the great poet Goethe told us and as all the scientific world now knows, the leaf form is the original parent of all plant life. We call that parent form the archetype. FOURNESS MATERIALIZED - B. C. LIGHT . GAS . TRIANGLES [Note: Drawing \"B\" is located beside the following paragraph in the text. Drawing \"C\" is located at thebottom left of this page.] Then the Sun Beings laughed with joy and said let us tell all creation what we have done and the Sun Beings joined the Fire Beings who had come down from the great primeval Saturn, the origin of the Solar system whose rings still tell us the story of the origin of substance which the smashing of the atom has now confirmed. They sang - Let us illuminate the world so that all may know of this lovelything and all the lovely things we do. So they created radiating light. They illuminated the world -A- [Note: \"-B-\" in AIC]. They sent out great radiating streams of light, for from heat we can't get light. Not until the great Spirits said, \"Let there be light.\" So with light a new form was created - the triangular form -B-. Now these Beings love to work in rhythms, we call that the music of the spheres for all music, all sound, comes from rhythm. We call it vibration. So there was Light and then when the Spirits rested they called in the Spirits of Sound. The light ceased for a time and then there was darkness which is just Page 856 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoas real a thing as light. This was the creation of the Moon Beings. In it the Moon Beings play. They are -C- [Note: Beside the text on the rest of this page is a drawing labeled \"C\".]restless Beings always in movement so they were perpetually throwing up waves and music filled the universe for these waves are sound waves. The shape of these waves is the half circle or the crescent. We know that the other side of the moon which is turned away from the sun, is dark [Note: This page is transcribed from the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 342 ====] so the real nature of the Moon is darkness. So when the Moon Beings threw up their crescent waves against the radiating light they got the forms built up by the interplay of light and darkness and these are the living things for the Spirits of Light and Darkness keep things moving and growing all the time, the light filling things with color and the dark filling them with sound so they can be both seen and heard -D-. FOURNESS MATERIALIZED - D. E] [Note: Drawing \"D\" is located beside the following paragraph in the text. Drawing \"E\" is located four text lines below it; \"E\" is not listed in the table of contents and has no title.] Let us watch how these forms grow. Higher and higher the waves are tossed, taller and taller the radiating triangle grows. In the meantime the different stars have played another game. You see all ideas are created by the Fire Beings. The Stars have been throwing their radiating beams across the sky and intheir crossings a new form has been created, and then many new forms. Let us see how it works -E-. A star is a point in the universe. Each Star throws out certain beams, sometimes one kind of beams sometimes [Note: Beside the remainder of this paragraph is drawing \"E\" -- two stars and a quadrilateral.] other kinds of beams. Let us watch their play. Two Stars send out a message each a living thing and a quadrilateral is created. All these great beings have children and we human beings call these children of the angelic Beings Fairies. We have spoken of the Star Beings, the Sun Beings and the Moon Beings but now we have come to the Earth Being whose children, the gnomes, help her to live and grow. For when the Earth has come into existence as an idea of one of the Fire Spirits the other Fire Spirits become interested and begin to sendout their rays and the quadrilateral is formed, the gnomes get busy to keep this form fixed, a solid material body and as the stars create form after form -F- the Gnomes gather them together and build up the solid Earth as we know it. [Note: This page is transcribed from the New-York Historical Society copy.] Page 857 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 343 ====] For as the stars send out rays and rays they build up all the wonderful crystal forms in creation and the solid earth is made up of all those lovely crystals that the star beings imagined. Then all the fairies got together in council to see if they couldn't bring all the lovely forms that the heavenly beings were creating to the Earth where they could use the crystals to build up all sorts of lovely living, shining, moving, singing creatures. FOURNESS MATERIALIZED [/] F. MAGNETISM . SOLID . POLYGONAL [Note: This drawing is located beside the following paragraph in the text.] So now we all show you what children can do. For the children of men can do wonderful things as well as the children of the angels. These began to build up a tree. They first of all had to have the idea of a tree for no one can build even a chair without first having the idea of a chair. So they watched and listened to the angelic beings till all of a sudden the Undines shouted for joy for they were the children of the Moon Beings and they had seen the lovely forms the Water Beings weretossing up into the triangle of the Airy Beings, the Light Beings. So in council they told the fairies and they all agreed to help bring these forms into the Earth which had now be become a solid body with water and air and warmth around it. The Undines being water fairies had to ask permission of the gnomes to transform some of their crystals into liquids. The gnomes agreed and began to design passages in the rocks so that as the Undines, who were the chemists, worked they could help them tochange the form of the crystals from the usual forms to the forms of water crystals, the frost, which grows and spreads out branches, and the gnomes made it possible for these forms to last for quite a while, not as long as the earth crystals for you know how quickly [Note: This page is transcribed from the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 344 ====] FOURNESS MATERIALIZED - G. LIFE . THE TREE [Note: This drawing is located down the entire length of the left side of the page. Just below the drawing is a small circle, and, underneath it, the words, \"MATTER . 3 DIMENSIONS . FORCES NO DIMENSIONS [/] VEGETABLES DON'T NEED FOOD THEY CREATE FOOD.\"] the frost disappeared but still longer than water crystals could last by themselves. And then they got busy making channels in the rocks for the tender roots of the plants to develop in so that the plant couldkeep its upright position as the Undines built the stems and leaves enabling the plants, as the years and centuries passed, to climb higher and higher till we got trees as tall as the Sequoias of California or the gum trees, the Eucalyptus trees, of Australia. One of the very first trees ever created was the fern tree which we still find growing in Australia. At first this is a very low and widespreading triangle, but now some of them are higher than a house. This fern tree has no seeds but just little spores on the leaves like other ferns. The Sylphs, who are the Page 858 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoAir fairies, and the Fire Fairies saw what a wonderful time the Undines and the gnomes were having so they offered to help. So the Sylphs designed all sorts of flowers and painted them all sorts of colors for they are the light fairies so they contributed not only the air for food but also condensed the light intotiny comet like bodies and fed it to the plants making it possible for the flowers to develop. [Note: This page is transcribed from the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 345 ====] And then the Fire Fairies built the fruits and seeds so that myriads of different kinds of trees and plants could come into the earth world. And it is as well that they did so for the earth itself, the crystals, neither animal nor man can eat. Only the plants are smart enough to transform crystals into food and of course they could not do it if the fairies didn't show them how. The Fire Fairies have command of the formative forces which is the warmth ether which as I told you creates spherical forms so they could not do much for the plants at first. We recognize their work in the fruits which are mostly more or less spheroid. Sometimes we see that the sylphs have helped them as in the seed of the pine tree which is a triangular pyramid. We seehow they helped the Undines too in building the tremendously tall triangle of the trunk of the fern and the pine so very symmetrical in form. Especially in these early works of the fairies was the work of the first hierarchies, the star beings and the sun, evident in the form of the plant as a whole. Fairies built the fruits and seeds so that myriads of different kinds ofplants and trees could come into the earth world.

These are the bakeries, restaurants, barber shops, laundries, paint, plumbing, and carpenter shops,photograph studios, and garage. 1.1126 Bulk Storage and Supply Units. - On the least valuable circulation avenue are placed the larger industrial units of wood-yard, fuel and building material supply depots, and possibly a community heating plant. 1.12 As an Integral Industrial Group.1.121 Manufacturing Site Plant. - To suggest the adaptability of a quarter-section development in connection with its own manufacturing industry, assume the triangular [Note: ==== Beginning of page 360 ====] quadrant of 40 acres lying along a steam railway frontage on the west side of the tract. The accessibility of switch tracks is evident, and with buildings disposed along the community frontage, the railwayoperations would be faced off. 1.2 DOMESTIC FUNCTIONS 1.21 As Part of Chicago. - Considered thus it seems advisable to develop independent communities within the limit of local acquaintanceship, apart from the external disturbing influences. 1.22 As Integral Domestic Group. - As the internal attractions will have to compete with those of the external city, they must be so organized as to raise the popular standards and minimize the evil influences found [Note: in?] a multitude of time-killing pursuits. 1.221 The Community Unit. - In the center of the tract, its most accessible point, is provided a community group, consisting of the common with music pavilion set in a reflecting basin with bordering aquatic gardens, tree-shaded promenade, and public gardens setting off refectory, assembly buildings, library, and amphitheatre, and a colonnade connecting four eight-room public schools eventually necessary. 1.222 Educational Units. - The four schoolhouses are placed at one community center for economy of administration, within range Page 866 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoof a quarter-mile of separate continuous children's playgrounds radially disposed.

An allotment of 30 feet will allow a house of two good rooms in width, with entrances at the center of one side, leaving street and garden frontage free for outlook, and when staggered, a vista from the twosides also. Verandas are thus free in the rear where house fronts are maximum distances apart and free from intrusion. These lots are 100 feet deep, with additional backset of 15 feet belonging to the city, but planted and maintained as an individual holding, and securing a spacing of 60 feet between building lines. Gardening is not a universal avocation here as in England, so that less private yard recreation space is to be provided. Hedges and irregular shrubbery constitute the better means of separating and beautifying the neighborhood lawns in one harmonious parklike ensemble. For sunlight in all rooms each day an arrangement of houses with diagonal points of the compass is most important in our climate; seventy percent are here so placed. Inside the house, the concentration of entrances and stairways utilizes the space least useful for occupancy. Here a back alley approach becomes unnecessary and rear outbuildings functionless.

COMMUNICATION. - This phase considers the means of connecting the specialized sites with the general facilities for transportation, being tributary to the existing surrounding system, yet discriminating as to the kinds andquality of service desired. 2.1 EXTERNAL TRAFFIC. 2.11 Boundary Highways. - The prevailing boundary highways of 66 feet width are here maintained, also the continuity of the abutting streets, to avoid confusion. It is inevitable that there will be some distinction in importancebetween the existing street car lines, determining the most valuable part of the tract, in which the development will begin, and from which it can progress normally without intervening vacant spaces, as is apparent from the geometric plan. 2.2 INTERNAL TRAFFIC. 2.20 General. - A minimum width of 60 feet is here fixed between frontages on communication ways serving as access to buildings, giving a suitable backset from actual public ways, whose widths are determined by their transit needs as inferred from their length, character of occupancy, and tributary feeders. 2.201 Nomenclature. - A simple system of nomenclature is important, and is possible here. 2.202 Equipment. 2.2021 Vehicle Pavements. - These are to be considered of ample width at 25 feet in the more important ways, and at 18 feet in the lesser ways, being sufficient for a vehicle to pass one backed against the edge. 2.2022 Pedestrian Pavements. - Sidewalk pavements are 4 feet for purely residential routes allowing promenade two abreast.

The low entrance hall and bathroom ceiling emphasized the flanking rooms whose effect is further increased by the fact that the Page 869 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocorner closets and cupboards are stopped at doorhead height and form flower boxes (the plants were not yet established when this photo was taken). The supporting columns at the entrances are carried above the roof height and topped by flaring tangents to form lanterns adding charm to the total composition. This design illustrates how the cheapest home may out-rival its expensive neighbors. The roof is concrete thus adding living space. It commands magnificent views down the valley.

The pathways of the playgrounds are 4 feet wide, a minimum amongst shrubbery. 2.2023 Parkings. - A parking of but 2 feet width will permit planting of evergreen creepers for easy maintenance, and can be omitted entirely at road intersections where additional vehicle width is welcome. 2.2024 Trees and Shrubbery. - Residential ways are both natural and dignified, being short, straight avenues lined with different species of trees and massed shrubbery, all confined to the abutting allotments. 2.2025 Illumination. - Illumination of narrow ways can be sufficiently diffused from relative low standards, possible of execution as ornamental concrete lanterns. 2.2026 Conduits. - A public service conduit in each trafficway is here contemplated, to be built of concrete in the trenchexcavated for sewer, furnished with stubs and manholes, and equipped with all public service mains. 2.21 Distribution. - The functions of internal lines are to reach the homes quickly and to meet the needs of distribution and Page 870 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagocollection to and from these homes. Study of this project shows it to be continuous for such service, without being attractive to thoroughfare usage. 2.211 Segregation. - It is important to arrange internal lines to seclude the domestic community from industrial circulation. No streets are therefore allowed to pass through without diversion. 2.212 Congregation. - This function is for periodic domestic social amenities, in contradistinction to the streets of a general city which are for concentrating and circulating traffic in large numbers and drawing trade. Filtered [Note: ==== Beginning of page 371 ====] through the segregating system, cut off from through traffic, this function is only periodically operative, as for the children at certain times of the day and for the adults at evening. 2.2121 Private Congregation. - This reassembling of the individuals first takes place within the buildings in the family and club and inn groups. 2.2122 Neighborhood Congregation. - The garden [Note: reading from N-YHS] fronted park, play fields, play courts, and gymnasium courts of various sorts are supplemented by an informal winding scheme of paths with irregular shrub and tree plantations, forming a circulating pedestrian parkway suitable for children and for infants' go-carts. 2.2123 School Congregation. - The advantageous location of the schools at the internal ends of the bisecting centerways makes the shortest possible distances between home and school, which are thus not more than two blocks apart. 2.214 Associations Congregation. - In general these features are cross linked for interfellowship by the octagonal circuitway with two objectives terminating a vista at each turn. 2.2125 Community Congregation. - The location of this function in the geometric center is established for reasons of accessibility, isolation from external influences, and to emphasize its importance to the city as the unified social expression of a 6400 community. The central functions are joined together by a protected passageway as a promenade for students and visitors, overlooking the public gardens setting off the pool with its central feature of anopen pagoda designed as a music pavilion. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 372 ====] ECONOMIC REVIEW OF THE PLANS by Page 871 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoRobert Anderson Pope The high degree of intensity or this plan is shown by its 1224 lots, with their average dimensions of 37 x 100 feet, and is commendable, yet this intensity has been accomplished at the lowest cost of any of the plans submitted. It has not secured this result at the sacrifice of park and playground spaces , which are situated in such a way as to enhance land values very materially. The arrangement of houses secures formany the maximum possible exposures. Therefore the intensity has not been achieved at the expense of sunlight and air. The distribution of community objectives along the boundaries of the quarter-section is certainly desirable as far as the commercial units are concerned; but it is improbable that for an area of this size such a large percentage of community features would be economical. Therefore a location of these commercial objectives along the two car lines, instead of on all sides, would seem to be the better design. It is especially good designing from an economic standpoint that the non-commercial community objectives are splendidly distributed to secure a high economic value. The street system of this plan, from the standpoint of convenience to the external objectives or car lines, is only about one-third as efficient as the theoretical ideal which would project all blocks and streets perpendicular to the car line, were other considerations not more important . This point is the only major economic deficiency of this design. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 373 ====] From the standpoint of convenience of reaching by this street system the interior objectives, we find a very high degree of efficiency, and therefore of economic worth. Again, this design has accepted the definite hypothesis stated in the introduction, i.e., that the through thoroughfare is economically detrimental to a residential area - as this plan has only two streets that would have any tendency to invite cross traffic and, even if invited, such traffic would be negligible onaccount of the extent of detour involved by the central public space - a detour which would, of course, be saved by the use of the thoroughfares flanking this quarter-section.

Though Griffin established and emphasized the 2nd story sill line his methods of handling it were by no means uniform, and power is as often expressed as simplicity. In the interior as well as in the exterior they served as decorative featuresinstead of simply holes punched in indiscriminately. The corner fenestration groups used by him - revolutionary at that time - were by no means offensive to the eye giving a feeling of instability, but gave distinction and power to the design. The dignity of design and permanence of construction, the house including roof of concrete, made possible the location of this low cost dwelling in the outlying Gold Coast district of Chicago withoutcomplaint or opposition from the wealthy neighbors. Note the engineering revolution in the corner groups of windows which has become so general now after a quarter of a century but which is treated architecturally, graciously, instead of being the bleak thing it is in the hands of modernistic builders. The mullion having become a special structural feature is treated as such adding human interest to the structure. So treated it does not give the feeling of a facewith the front teeth knocked out. Nature can run riot about this concrete home and the burned tile fireplace front designed by the architects brings a touch of it into the living room. This landscape decoration which forms the breast of the fireplace is burned tile. [Note: This page is from the second copy of the Art Institute's typescript (AIC2).] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 376 ====]ARCHITECTURE INCOMPLETE WITHOUT TOWN PLANNING Gutzon Borglum likens methods prevalent in the practice of architecture to a prostituting of the profession, the architect subsisting on the life blood of his draftsmen. The taste for this sort of thing is whetted and the conscience salved by the fact that in this unreasonable social system of ours it is only too common to find the man who works starving while, through some special privilege, the man whodoes not work feeds fat off the fruits of the other man's labor. Our predecessors, our teachers, our ancestors should not be drags, parasites feeding off the tissue of our spiritual growth, causing arrest of development or degeneracy, even as physically the parents of many of our children do in factory towns. They should be inspiration and incentive to a geometrical progression in achievement, rejoicing in the greater accomplishment of those following. A teacher is no teacher at allunless the work of his pupils exceeds the quality of his own and each generation is under obligation not only to do its own work but so to teach the succeeding generation as to cause progress. And here is the only value of tradition. In the work of radical architects we find constant resemblance to the work of other men and other people even Oriental, Aztec, Moorish, Japanese, Greek, Gothic and primitive. But their difference from thecopy-book school is that they employ the same natural method and do not consider external form first Page 873 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoand shamefacedly hide behind it as best they can the element of use. They glory in the laws of nature where everything has its purpose, and \"Form\" becomes satisfying only when it best fits and expresses that function. They believe not in art for \"art's sake\" but that art consists in doing necessary things in thebest possible way - that art except as a result of need, physical or spiritual, is degenerative instead of progressive; that in this creation of ours the ideal must be based [Note: Gutzon Borglum (1867-1941) was an American sculptor, most famous for carving the faces of four U.S. presidents on Mount Rushmore, South Dakota.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 377 ====] on the real; that nothing is practical except the ideal.The concept of \"freedom\" is infinitely attractive and the influence of the first man who definitely stated and expressed it in the architectural field in America, Louis Sullivan, has been very widespread in his own country and elsewhere. It must not be confused with the idea of democracy which is purely the realm of Equity. Mr. Sullivan's intelligent comprehension of the principles he was working on made his own work a continuous progression and gave it a remarkable variety whereas an interest simply in one'sown achievement leads gradually to an imitation of one's self and a stereotyping of manner and motives which, bit by bit, transform even rational architecture into personal architecture. For problems are ever new and one's work must be either static or developing. The fact that similarity of conditions and materials and methods of construction will, if rational methods are used, lead to similarities of form is what develops the styles of various times and peoples. For styleis perceptible only in the large, is no concern of the individual designer, but only of the historian. We find also the intermediate men who, though following this method of thinking, would deny this right to others making claims as grotesque as those of Bottom [Note: in Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\"] who would be the lion too. The consequence of this greed was that the development of this movement was seriously handicapped in the neighborhood of its origin. In the intellectual or imaginativeworld we must recognize the right of every man to the use of his own thinking powers. Priority in claim no more gives a man a right to monopolization than it does to the land or the air. How deadly is the effect of such claims we can see when we consider what would have been the consequence to the development of Gothic architecture if the man who claimed first to have used a buttress had been able to deny others the right to use it, or if at any stage, say when the flying buttresswas used, any such attempt had been tolerated. There never would have been any Gothic architecture. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 378 ====] The development of a style anywhere at any time is dependent on freedom to use all the powers of nature - physical, intellectual, spiritual. It is, however, not sufficient that man use his reasoning powersfor this faculty can disport itself in fantastic fields entirely unproductive. If his efforts are to be fruitful he must learn the laws of nature and act in conformity with them. The old Greek fable is forever true. Page 874 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoMan loses his strength when he takes his feet off the earth. To know is his chief obligation on this earth. He must, therefore, not only have the courage to depend on his own faculties but he must develop them and must take the pains to learn all the facts which may have a bearing on his problem. Our thoughts to be moral must conform to cosmic laws. We must not think personally where causes are cosmic. All forms in matter or thinking derive from the chemical ether which is the manifesting force as compared with the spiritualizing forces of warmth and light. It is the central region of America that is ruled by the chemical ether whose basic manifestation is liquidity with its moving wave forces, the great Mississippi valley, and there we find the founders of creative thinking in the arts, the modernists - Lois[Note: Loie] Fuller and Isadora Duncan in the dance, George Bernard [Note: George Grey Barnard?] in sculpture, Leo Masters [Note: Edgar Lee Masters?] in poetry, Louis Sullivan in Architecture, Walter Griffin in ground planning, town planning or whatever you wish to call it. Though all new movements derive from one individual since ideas arise in the human mind, when that has happened the way is open to all humanity to carry on the work. The foundation has been laid. Louis Sullivan laid the foundation ofmodern architecture. His influence was felt as early in Europe as in America and even more powerfully in the early decades. His successors vary in degree of creative power but they are not founders. The delay in the development of creative design was largely due to the malicious vanity of one [Note: Frank Lloyd Wright] who had been inducted by Sullivan himself. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 379 ====] The necessity of preserving the life of the Earth is a prime duty in every field of life, in every occupation; and taking maximum advantage of its gifts is the task of the designer. The power of a conscientious consideration of all the elements of a problem was brought home to me when I saw the revolution in methods and results that took place when landscape was made a part of architecture, when Griffin entered into partnership with [Note: Frank Lloyd] Wright. It meant not only a broadening of view but a positiveness of action arising from the firm foundation of definite facts determining thegeneral scheme before taking up details of internal requirements. Landscape architecture does not mean gardening as an afterthought to a building but means consideration of the external elements before starting to plan or build [Note: reading from N-YHS]. Not only natural conditions but the character of the surrounding buildings have sometimes to be taken advantage of, sometimes to be overcome. We must consider not the mere personal point but must look to the advantage to everyone affected, for it iscuriously true that a thing to be a permanent advantage to one must be of advantage to everyone, just as in animal or man a sound organ is of vital importance to all the organs. Human society is an organism and the individual can benefit only from what is of benefit to all since all are independent as root, branch, leaf and flower of a tree. On the whole in America as well as elsewhere a building, a residence, was a parallelogram. Nothing else was done. The Greek thinking was back of this, a religious recognition of the 4th period of our present human cycle as the pyramid was a recognition of the 3rd the Egyptian period. Once the parallelogram was established the almost automatic thinking of our times flowed on in the same old grooves. After all the mechanical is the idol of the present age so why not leave our mind to its tendency to work automatically. Page 875 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 380 ====] Now in this 5th period the tradition was finally broken down. The plan was not necessarily a parallelogram, and freer forms developed to be carried on later by Griffin in an endless variety ofcrystalline forms for he conceived of buildings not as facades but as three dimensional. This is creative thinking. We learn that there are as many universes as there are crystalline forms each created by a great primal Spirit of Mathematics.

Marion [Note: ==== Beginning of page 389 ====] THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD As a friend said - \"Now we have 5 minutes let's discuss the history of the world.\" We have indeed to go back to the beginnings to catch up with the ends, to understand the ends. For the world and its creative forces do not work on straight lines like rational thinking. Creation works in circles and spheres. Go on the straight line through the center of the earth and we land in Australia which fills us with amazement but we can understand nothing. Let us take a circle and encompass a sphere and we can learn, and so shall be able to accomplish what is necessary to accomplish in our time. For we have come to a time when isolation will not work. Humanity must be treated as a unity. We traverse the Pacific Ocean, the great realm of fire on the earth, practically the whole volcanic realm. We remember that warmth was the original substance of the solar system still functioning here on earth as are unicellular beings so that man may read the story of evolution. Politically, or shall we say from the latest step in the evolution of human society, we start from the end - America - take the plunge and find the beginning. We have perhaps flown, taken the modern way, traversed the realm of the air, the 2nd condition of matter, the realm through which we experience light and color - the rainbow and its reflections in the creations that follow. We come down in the great ocean - the whole southernhemisphere almost - the 3rd condition of matter, and find the very earliest bit of solidity still existing - the 4th condition of matter - Australia, which has indeed run into the extreme of fixity, the wooden pear [Note: an Australian tree] a type of all its fruits - a time when the angels didn't have to provide for the feeding of human beings on earth. On this continent we find the forms of creatures of the watery realm fixed on land in the vegetable life - the sea cucumber in a great Sterculia tree - and in one of the Sterculias the octopus with its thick body and its waving outstretched arms now living on dry land - the Page 879 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 390 ====] Angophora trees on the bluffs of Sydney harbor, pink barked like a child's cheek, lovely yet gruesome till you understand and learn to adore, records of the ancient Lemurian continent and the origins of thevegetable kingdom, coming out of the watery realm up into the airy realm. Here in the human community we find the most ancient aboriginal people taking degrees in the stiffest Sydney University courses, proving that differences in race have ceased to exist since Christ gave that \"light\" to every man that cometh into the world. The English lads and lassies love to become as dark as our negro people through basking in the sun of this earthly paradise. And the custom of competition forprizes in the Queensland schools was given up because usually the schools of the aboriginal children overtopped the others. Here in Australia we find that wickedly ingenious device of imperialism - the parliamentary form of government which makes the functioning of democracy impossible though seeming to be its implement. From this hoax America was saved through the genius of its founders who know of their ownexperience the nature of this evil form and invented a new one - the Congressional - under which dictatorship can be made impossible. And yet here we find Mr. James Alexander Smith, a most highly developed individual, functioning in full freedom and - almost single-handedly - defeating these powers behind the screen and consummating the unification of the Australian States and the establishment of a Federal Capital City, Canberra whichis the only modern city in the world. This is one of the greatest stories of modern times. All the imperial interests were against it - all the big interests. But we'll skip that for the moment. The end, our aim, is to find a way to cure our sick civilization, to make it possible for our communities to function wholesomely, free from disease. This cannot be done unless we have a [Note: James Alexander Smith (1862-1940) was a noted consulting engineer and a member of the board for the Canberra design competition.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 391 ====] properly organized community. And this cannot be attained unless our children are properly educated. This is not possible unless all the children have access to nature, natural continuous contact throughout childhood - all of them. Otherwise they cannot develop inventive or creative powers to say nothing of health. The geniuses come from the rural districts not the urban. To give the children this is not possiblewithout community planning which facilitates decentralization, puts an end to overcrowded cities and an end to wide open spaces too sparsely occupied. It interlaces the urban and the rural. And only in Australia has this been done on a scale to make it tell. Not only Canberra but several other municipalities which Griffin planned before he went to India where he found these depths of the Orient immensely interested in modernism. Those are greatly mistaken who think India could not function oneven terms with the rest of the world in a World Economic Organization.

TOWN PLANNING BEGINS WITH ONE LOT [Note: This illustration is a 1909 garden plan for Mrs. J.W. Bolte, Hubbard Woods (Winnetka), Illinois. In the New-York Historical Society copy the following is handwritten on the verso of page 392: \"The ground always as completely [/] and perfectly designed as the building[.] [/] Native & local plants predominating[.]\"] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 393 ====] MAN'S EVOLUTION In the course of perfecting the rational faculty, necessary to give men confidence in their own decisions as a basis for free will, the power to receive revelations was necessarily withdrawn from men for a time. Through Anthroposophy, the Twentieth Century science, which, along with the smashing of the atom in the atomic bomb, revolutionizes thinking for this century as material science did the thinking of the nineteenth century, this power of receiving information directly from the spiritual realms can again be developed but it must now be in a Christian form and not pre-Christian if it is to be wholesome anddevelopmental. This difference of method is of vital importance and is but little understood today so that many unfortunate things are happening through the longing for direct knowledge of spiritual realities without any comprehension of the nature of Christian requirements. Since the creation by the Christ was the creation of a being who could attain to responsibility which is dependent on free will and, since with His coming into the Jesus being where He dwelt for three years,He gave to man the individualized Ego (which he gave to every man that cometh into the world) which marked man's maturity and readiness to function in free will, the power to develop the faculties necessary for the reception of revelation must reside in each individual human being. But since the all important factor is the retention and development of free will, no method must be used now which dulls man's fully awake consciousness nor which interferes in the slightest degree with thefree action of his will. The only form of occultism recognized by natural science is hypnotism, but these scientists know nothing of what they are actually doing nor can they know its dangers nor its serious or even fatal consequences. The process used is to substitute another's will which is an attack on the manhood [Note: ==== Beginning of page 394a ====] itself of the one hypnotized for will is the faculty of the spirit (spirit is that which creates) and the Ego is the man. The methods used in all pre-Christian times, when man had not reached his maturity so that he was still under the guidance of Angelic beings were all dependent on this dulling of consciousness and depression of the will and had to be carried out with great care. They were used only in the mysteryschools and with specially chosen and developed individuals under the guidance of the initiates. The underlying principle is like that of hypnotism and was appropriate in those past preliminary civilizations, Page 881 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoand the precautions necessary were understood. They all entailed dulling of the normal faculties. The use of those methods today is harmful and often very seriously so and serves no useful purpose. They belong to the past. They solve no problems. We are familiar with them in various forms, Yogi,mediumship, spiritualism, etc. However, the awakening and making use of the perceptive organs of the Etheric body in full consciousness and with no dulling of any of our normal faculties is urgently necessary at the present time. A new revolution in thinking is as necessary in the Twentieth Century as that of the Nineteenth Century was in its time. The knowledge thus gained can be checked with the same precision as knowledge through perception in the material realm and the problems of our time can not be solved without this supplementary information which is appropriate to this period of human evolution. I have stood before an object and said to a fellow Anthroposophist, \"Do you see what I am seeing?\" and she has responded by describing the appearance of the ethers moving, rising, forming, changing tones, conforming exactly as she spoke to what I was witnessing. In Australia, I have stood looking over thevalley and suddenly seen the cloudlike formation of the chemical ether outlining with a wide band all the trees and shrubs, a phenomenon checked by thousands of [Note: ==== Beginning of page 394b (table of contents) ====] SANDSTONE TERRACES FROM SYDNEY TO PORT STEPHENS [Note: ==== Beginning of page 395 ====]others which can be experienced at will again and again if your etheric eye has become active. These things cannot be seen by the at present normal eye. One not trained standing by does not see these things at all. Indeed our own physical scientists have already transformed all the so-called atoms into each other in the laboratories of our universities but they are very shy about publicizing this fact. In California I askeda University Professor to show me their atom smasher. He said, \"Yes if you can call it an atom.\" Since with the coming of the Christ the first half of man's evolution, the descent into matter, was completed, it is now our task to bring about the ascent into spirit. With the Light (He was the Life and the Life was the Light of man) now in man it becomes his task to carry on evolution, and the Earth's evolution as well as his own becomes his task [Note: \"man's task\" typed over?] though the Christ willbe with us till the end of the Earth period. Since man is now mature enough to function as a responsible being, since the period of faith has led on to the period of knowledge, the Angels can no longer be permitted to guide men as they did in the past. He must make his own decisions. Otherwise he could not carry on his evolution as a free being. He can become fully cognizant of his nature only if the consequences [Note: \"of\" inserted in N-YHS] his deeds fall upon him. So in the latter decades of thenineteenth century the Archangel Michael, who in biblical times functioned as the Countenance of Page 882 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoJehovah, took over the rulership of intelligence in the Cosmos. In a way he now functions as the countenance of the Christ and he will not compromise. Now if human beings want the assistance of the Angelic Beings they must come to them [Note: \"him\"?] for guidance out of their own free will; they must use all their powers and faculties to solve their problems and then come to Michael of their own free will and he will give them help. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 396 ====] [Note: Rudolf] Steiner tells us that there is the present chaos in World Affairs because men will not recognize the Spiritual Beings. The Spiritual Beings are not permitted to come to the aid of humanity unless and until men recognize them, until they come to them for aid having used all their own powersto solve their problems. And men today are not functioning helpfully even in their thinking. Each kingdom is dependent for its sustenance on the kingdoms below, the vegetable on the mineral and so on. The Angels are dependent on man for their sustenance, on his significant thinking, and at present they are starving. Significant thinking we need that arouses the will and culminates in deeds. Today they know not where to turn nor what to do. Each step now in material science which was the hope of the 19th century but lowers the standards and provokes man to greater and greater destruction. Unless material knowledge is supplemented by that other help, spiritual knowledge , man's work cannot be constructive. Anthroposophy is applied Christianity, Christianity applied to every side of life. As Aristotle, a master of the knowledge of the period in which he lived, established rational thinking and the foundations for all the knowledge necessary for the period to follow [Note: reading from N-YHS], so with Steiner who has laid the foundations for the knowledge necessary for the period in which we live. In ancient India, Religion, Art and Science were a true unity. In the time of Egypt religion first appeared, religion as a separate thing. It became the controlling factor of life. In the Greek period Art wasseparated out. It became the dominating factor. Religion was expressed through Art. In our own period Science has become the dominating factor and the gap between it and religion and art has become ever greater. Out of this separation all three have gone astray. Science has become dogma and functions through the Will whereas it belongs in the thinking realm and should clean itself [Note: ==== Beginning of page 396b (table of contents) ====] ARCHITECTURE FITS NATURE [Note: The structure is the Fishwick House.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 397 ====] of fanaticism, superstition, beliefs. It is religion that should function through Will, deeds, and as a unit in Page 883 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoa trinity dogma ceases to exist. Art is functioning in the thinking realm. We find all sorts of thought out tricks and devices taking the place of genius in Art where feeling should rule. Religion has become nothing but the expression of feeling whereas its realm is will, deeds. The task of this period ofEvolution is to reunite the three into a true unity, when they will again function in accordance with their true nature. Thus can Christianity become a reality functioning in every department of life. The Earth is a living Being and at present we are killing it. With the Christ event the further evolution of man and the Earth was placed in man's hands. The barometer itself proves that the earth is a living breathing being for there is no other way of explaining the double recording of high and low pressures of thisinstrument. What our time needs is a little more confidence in facts and a bit less theorizing. What then is the constitution of the Earth Being where the Christ now dwells. To our physical senses there are 3 conditions. There are however 4 cause forces in action and they create 4 conditions of matter. The primal ether expresses itself in the condition of matter called warmth. This forms the outer sphere of the earth. This information is but just confirmed through aeronautics, the study of the stratosphere. Scientists have said that as one goes out from the earth temperatures falls. That has never been the case at night when the chemical ether is breathed back into the earth but until recently no attention has been paid to that fact. Now a student hears it spoken of as temperature reversal. But what spiritual science has observed is now being corroborated by high fliers who even in the daytime reach a level where the temperature begins to increase. Physical scientists are likely to begin to the theorize and generalize aboutthat. Already I have seen an article by a scientist saying [Note: ==== Beginning of page 398 ====] that we'll probably have to give up our plans for flying to the moon because we'd probably get fried before arriving. But the exact science of the supersensible, never based on hypothesis but on perception, informs us that when we go on from the earth's warmth ether realm though the warmth material no longer exists, the ethers themselves exist in the reverse order. This phenomenon of reversal, of turning inside out, expresses the basic difference between the organic and the inorganic. That the Earth is an organic being is again evidenced in another reversal as we go toward the center. It is of course impossible to enumerate the consequences of these facts. The knowledge of them lays the foundation for a new and useful development of all branches of science. The aim of living beingstherefore should not be perfection which entails something finished, fixed, dead. Instead their aim should be growth, development. The great work of the physical scientist was the establishing in the minds of modern men the fact of evolution. That their conclusions were topsy turvy, that they followed always the straight line of reason in the reverse direction from what really took place concluding that man derived from the animal instead of the other kingdoms from man does not alter the fact of the valueof their contribution. They arbitrarily limited their observations to what can be perceived by material sense organs. We do not need to limit ourselves in any such way. The time has come when the further advance of civilization hangs on our using all our perceptive organs, physical and etheric. Australia's young Shelley, Sylvia Brose, whose drama in verse, Mirrabooka - The Southern Cross - Page 884 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagobased on the very beautiful Australian native mythology [Note: See III.24.443 (above)], was a new member in the Anthroposophic Society. She was full of questions, among them questions about the Sun. Now physical science here again tolerates in itself ideas in complete conflict, first that the Sun is aburning ball of gas, [Note: ==== Beginning of page 398b (table of contents) ====] TERRACED HOME AT HEAD OF VALLEY [Note: The structure is the Fishwick House.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 399 ====] then that it has an attractive power 5,000,000 times as great as that of the earth. But scientists know that gas has no magnetic, no drawing power. Its nature is outflying. I told her that physically speaking the interior the Sun was a vacuum; it contained no material substance. But it was filled with life ether. She repeated this to her uncle, Professor [Note: Henry L.?] Brose, who had charge of the Rockefeller laboratory in Sydney and who had worked with Rutherford and Einsteinin Europe. He told her that was nonsense, if that were the case everything would be falling into it. The burning ball conception means that they consider the great radiations shown in photographs to be flames reaching out from the Sun. Within 6 months news came through that 2 young astronomers, in Kentucky I think, had for 2 years been taking moving pictures of the Sun which revealed a movement inward to the Sun. The life ether being the creative cause of solidity in which gravity manifests is naturallyattractive force itself. I myself at one time had the impulse to concentrate my attention on the Sun and suddenly saw its as one does in photographs, with the luminous radiations and the whole interior sphere, or disc as I saw it, lilac, the life ether color, the color I had seen rising from the seed. These Sun forces act on the earth vertically, whereas the Moon forces act horizontally as is checked by physical science which finds the magnetic forces of the Moon at their maximum from the horizon.Physical science would reasonably conclude that, like the Sun, it would have its maximum influence from the Zenith. But this is contrary to fact. These polarities are expressed in physical creatures in the typical horizontal backbone of the animal versus the vertical backbone of man, hence their different types of consciousness. One might say that the Sun is the Ruler of Plant and Man, the Moon of the Animal. As the Sun makes its diurnal path around the Earth and its a annual path from north to south and back, corresponding movements [Note: ==== Beginning of page 400 ====] of the ethers take place from which we can learn something about what is called the instincts of animals of which science can say nothing. It uses a word and rests satisfied with that. In fact that is what all our Page 885 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothinkers have been driven to - nominalism. They might as well answer every question that arises with the - \"Quien sabe?\" of the Spanish. But today we must not rest short of the answer to questions. Otherwise the chaos that we see on our horizons will become world wide. Anthroposophy consists inthe capacity to ask questions and to recognize the answers when they come. When the great seasonal migration of the birds takes place how does this come about for we know that even the new season birds can take these great journeys. How do they know the route is asked? But they don't know the route. The seasonal movements of the Sun set flowing great and powerful streams of the Ethers, the North and South currents. These the birds are aware of and they follow the currentseven fighting against heavy storms and powerful air currents. I went to Cowes Island [Note: Phillip Island?] in Melbourne's harbor to witness the coming of the Mutton birds from the South Pole continent in the spring. When the day arrived I was much perturbed at the coolness of the hotel-keeper whose coach was to take us to the particular point of the shore. I didn't want to miss the spectacle. But he said afternoon would be soon enough. After lunch I pressed again for starting. But he said if we started athalf past two we would be in time. We arrived at the appointed spot. No sign of birds and he said they wouldn't be along for 20 minutes yet. In 20 minutes they came blackening the sky indeed they came in such numbers. You see they had an even more accurate clock than ours, the Sun itself, for their time-keeper. So with the rise of the sap to the top of the trees. This is another phenomenon on which science has given up guessing. Discussing? It isn't done. For they know that the pressure of the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 401 ====] atmosphere, so called, is not sufficient to raise the liquid to these heights nor is osmosis nor any power known to science. But the Chemical Ether with the rhythm of the Earth's breathing and with its liquid creating power effects this movement and carries it on, not only the diurnal movement but the seasonal which for a time each year diminishes and increases this flow of the sap.

But Mr. Griffin is also keenly interested in the problem of small house construction, and in the following columns he presents a brief description of what he has termed segmental architecture. It is a system that employs building units of special design, and its object is to reduce the cost of buildinghouses - particularly small homes - at the same time scorning monotony and providing for an uncommon style of residence. The Segmental System The Segmental System is the outcome of ten years' effort to simplify the complex processes of building now in vogue. It is realized that the machine-made product must eventually supplant the hand-made inhousing and the Segmental System is a contribution toward that idea. On the other hand no one wants to live in a \"stereotype\" house, and the idea that first comes to mind when we think of machine made is monotonous repetition. Where concrete houses are cast monolithic in form, economy demands a high degree of uniformity; likewise the large slab units that have been in use put severe restrictions on variation. Now elaborateness obtained at the cost of endless repetition would be still more distressing even than the barnlike plainness to which the older methods of building in brick or stone or timber have accustomed us. In the case of inexpensive small houses that is the only alternative because every projection or corner or opening or other departure from the square box economic ideal is an expensive luxury in labor costs [Note: ==== Beginning of page 404 (table of contents) ====] KNITLOCK DWELLING . W.R. PALING . 2 story building on hillside [Note: An additional caption in the New-York Historical Society copy adds \"Roof Tile as Wall Tile Griffin's Invention . Concrete . W.B.G.\" In the New-York Historical Society copy the following is handwritten at the left of the illustration: \"Griffin also solved the problem of leaking roofs in Aus. [Australia]\"] LIVING ROOM [Note: This illustration is lacking in the New-York Historical Society copy.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 405 ====] Page 887 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothat do not provide any additional room. But Segmental Construction is not designed as a substitute for timber, brick or stone, artificial or natural, or concrete plain or reinforced, nor for any other substance in its usual and proper uses. If one wants tohave his house of the types suitable to any of these or within their limitations for the amount he has to spend, then he can dispense with the segmental system. Segmental Construction, however, by eliminating the extra cost of outside walls, of wings, angles and bays and buttresses, of openings for doors and windows, and cupboards, through eliminating cutting and fitting and plumbing and aligning, makes possible the convenience and beauty and infinite variety ofsuch features within the limits of expense of our commonplace boxes or more or less dark cells which we have been driven to by sheer necessity. The ordinary types have to struggle to attract interest by such devices as varying the front covering with clinker or blue bricks, or spatterdash stucco, or by alternating hip and gable roofs or departing from the shape of the \"classic\" veranda pillars to bulbs or pyramids, or by attaching \"gew-gaws\" to entrances or window frames, or fancy, but non-transparent, \"lead-lights\" inthe sashes. Technically there are only two types of segments - vertebral, which lock together to make the framework or skeleton, and tesseral, which lock together for two-ply curtain walls, attaching to and stretching between the vertebral columns. The double wall provides for lap joints everywhere, and between the inner and outer layers there is an insulation layer of bitumen or aquella, as well as a proportion of air ducts in the interlocking keys, which allow for cooling by convection where the exposure requires it. In these flutes also are concealed gas and electric conductors. In erection, the segments are simply slipped together from above. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 406 ====] With the manufactured half segments all the openings and corners work out accurately so that, without cutting or fitting, the grooved frames of the doorways and windows and fixtures are likewise slid into place and made fast with grouting, with all the essential fittings thus inserted true to fixed standard dimensions, they can be completely prepared and coated in the shop, and their essential parts are carried in stock, much quickening the building operation. The unit of dimension in each direction is six inches which leaves ample variety of size and shape for all the features of the house. Internal surface consists of six-inch squares with all the possibilities open to tile work for panels or pattern decoration, in colors or ornament applied in stencil or imprint. Externally the segments appear mainly as twelve inch chequers with tuck-pointed joints, the effect at Castlecrag being cut stone, the colors being supplied by the sands selected for the surface - white,purple, pink, yellow and yellowish green. Page 888 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoAlmost unlimited modeling of the masses is rendered practicable by the lightness and stiffness of the construction which spans openings without lintel members, and projects without extra supports to form balconies, oriels and turrets. Buttresses, pylons and crenellations are almost inevitable features, and theuniform supporting power of interior and exterior walls invited the introduction of courts or the breaking up of the mass of even the smallest house into terraces or tower rooms. Such freedom to deal with the general proportions, making an articulate pile out of the smallest type of building, is the great characteristic of Segmental Architecture. And this opportunity is, of course, the fundamental of all architectural design; the basis for real diversity, with neither superfluous nor arbitraryfactors.

The William A. Storrer Catalog Number (3rd edition, 2002) is S.216.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 408 ====] CAPTION Imitation of Walter Burley Griffin Knitlock without its structural features. This architect was visited by Mr. [Note: George A.] Taylor who after calling me into his office in the early days in Australia to inform me that Mr. Griffin was to do as he told him (which of course he neverdid) and who spent an amazing amount of time vilifying Griffin even going to the Prime Minister Mr. [Note: William Morris] Hughes. Mr. Hughes was not so easily handled however and simply handed over Taylor's papers to Mr. Griffin. Largely impelled by his venom he visited the United States and called on various architects who gave him much material for his magazine. Wright did not give him any but he listened to the knitlock storyand shortly after built this structure in California. He was always quick on the uptake. This however except in superficial appearance has not structural resemblance to knitlock and no structural value. He also followed the hint Taylor gave him about floors solid on the ground and used the idea but with no structural basis, which of course Taylor couldn't give him, so of course the water poured in and the floor had to [Note: be?] supplemented with another. Griffin's method of construction was not grasped. Griffinlaid an asphalt layer under the whole house with 2\" x 4\" strips cut in two with the narrow edge upward [Note: and?] laid it in flush with the top so that when the floorboards were nailed to these strips there was no air space below so no chance of rot. Griffin also solved the problem of leaky roofs in Australia where with their horizontal driving storms the Marseilles tile was no good. His is a concrete tile set diagonally.

Each of these is placed where several railroad routes come together all being below the surface level. The Metropolitan air field was shown in the lake which idea has now been adopted. Each of the municipal plazas has a surface Air Landing field to supplement the underground railroad station giving rise to a natural municipal center so that the practical needs of the outlying districts are metminimizing the excessive crowding of the metropolitan center. Sydney, Australia is an example of such a grouping of metropolis and surrounding municipalities which are independent politically as well as officially. The arrangement works well.

Neither must be imposed on the other. COMMUNICATION - Chicago - Location in the center of the continent brought about emphasis on communication - with the splendid though too complicated radial system with branches and belt lines.Major Thoroughfares - Since Chicago is a 60% occupied city we have accepted with but slight modifications its system of major thoroughfares, railroads or other types, modifying their widths and construction, depressing the high-speed railways and at many intersection points flooring the railroads over, as also the rail-road yards, so that no occupation space for structures or air-planes is lost as in Mr. James Alexander Smith's suggested Melbourne railroad center. [Note: See II.12.173-174] These intersection points, usually from one mile to three miles apart, form natural locations for Community Centers . These should be handled as natural small towns within the Metropolitan area. They have been denoted simply by a conventional oval shape to indicate their locations and not to determine a routine form. Their development and individually should become a matter of local pride and rivalry - crystallizing in widely different and beautiful forms. (See Community Center - Leeton, Australia). These rail-road yards floored over could be used as local Air Ports also which on the whole are [Note: \"I have\" is crossed out] placed near the Community Centers.

It has evidently impressed itself on the ethers for it has appeared in various connections all over the world. It appeared impressively used in the Russian Building in The New York Exposition [Note: New York World's Fair 1939-1940]. The most beautiful example I have seen was in Madras, India under construction in 1937.

Motor Cars - Where the winter frosts go deep, they should come in onto a lift which will drop them down to basement space. No parking on streets should be allowed. Minor Thoroughfares - The streets at half mile intervals between the Through Routes form convenient business districts and these distances apart can be adopted as proper for the minor thoroughfares which can be shorter or longer as happens as the result of their contact with major routes. They serve local purposes. (See Neighborhood Community) OCCUPATION - Our young folks are becoming delinquents, cripples, criminals, with no chance for genius to sprout nor enthusiasm to develop; death and disease are rampant. Between the thoroughfares there should be no speedways, no short cuts, no wide streets. On the other hand there should be no stub end streets but direct access, for everyone within, to the business circumference - shops, movies, etc. The whole will be safe. Children can go to the interior schools or to the circumferential shops without danger. The omission of alleys and the narrowing of the streets and the carrying of none through willaccomplish these and many other things. It will give 16 parks to every quarter section where contact with nature, people and sports will make humans of the growing generation.

Just as the solution of Town Planning lies in separate but simultaneous attack of the problems of Communication and Occupation, plus the mathematical special requirement of eliminating acute angles, and the spiritualrequirement of conserving nature, so with the administrative problem. It has three elements - Political - Economic - Social. This has now been recognized in the organization of the United Nations. 1st - The United States is outstanding among the major nations in that it stands on this correct foundation of equity . Welfare the slogan of some is a totally different thing and leads to war.The State is just a hang over from the rivalries of the group of states before the revolutionary war. State lines serve only to revive tariff walls and other evils. The Nation should require the collection of the land values. The spending of the land rentals should be in the hand of the Social, or Abilities, organ. 2nd - A City is essentially a business . At its head should be a City Manager - selected by the citizenry. His function is to manage the practical affairs of the community but not private business. His renewal or replacement should be on the initiative and referendum plan. Since he has no control over affairs of Equity a long term has no dangers. He would be replaced on the basis of efficiency and economy. 3rd - The Social or Abilities is of the nature of the Teachers and Parents Organization in whose hands would lie the land rentals [Note: The illustration listed as being on page 426 in the table of contents: ROTUNDA . SMALL SHOPS . ENGINEERING BATTERY is lacking in the New-York Historical Society copy.

No Board of Education under either Political or Economic control. The three Organs are as interdependent as the Center, Radius and Circumference of a Circle.

These two offer endless opportunities for employment if the development of them is not shut off by some MONOPOLISTIC or DICTATORIAL POWER. Our problem is how to get the maximum from these two without destroying Nature. What form of SOCIAL ORGANIZATION most facilitates the maximum employment without menace to future humanity, to the development of rational, free beings capable of using free will constructively and without menace such as devastated the wilds of the United States during the past? What measures must we take to attain our ends? The Economic system is really running ahead in this realm for it has established a system of DIVISION OF LABOR which gives maximum and cheapest production. This is about the only up to date elementin our communities. Here, with no intrusion of morals, Altruism has established itself for in this system each one produces for someone else.

This is urgent for there seems to be a subterranean influence working for the perpetuation of the worst of all forms of government since all kinds of tyranny can screen themselves behind it - the Parliamentary form, the froth of which comesup even in our Universities in America. It took a war of revolution for the United States to free itself from that form. It is dust in the eye to say that it was a king from which we were escaping. It is the most urgent question in the reconstruction of the world at the close of the war. The writers of the American Constitution knew the evils of the Parliamentary System of their own experience. This menace is far greater than that of Communism for the latter is openly controlled by the bureaucracy whereas theparliamentary form is just as completely controlled but so cleverly that no one seems to be aware of it. But the consequences are there and can be measured by a comparison of the welfare of the people of Europe and America.

They are ripe for reorganization. Experience of life under each form, the Congressional and the Parliamentary, makes clear the radical difference between the two which is understood by almost no one, yet is the chief issue today as it was in the 1st World War. It is the basic issue of employment since it is the issue between concentratedPower and Democracy. Only under the Congressional form of government do the people have the opportunity, if they chose to use it, of selecting their executive. The electoral system [Note: US Electoral College?], a hang-over from the past, should be ended. The power of amending the constitution puts that in the reach of the masses of the people. Under the Parliamentary system the powers behind the scenes, the bureaucracy, can determine the Page 895 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoexecutive from the start or at any time after the election by throwing out the elected party whenever it wants to which gives it a powerful influence over members even without overthrowing the party. They vote as they are told to vote or out they go, and the whole complicated and expensive business ofelection has to be gone through again. No wonder the people are dejected. Naturally the more businesses that are put in the hands of the government the easier it is for the officials to control everything so socialism moves swiftly to communism which is simply perfected - call it what you will - communism or imperialism. This means that after this war Americans should use every possible means to direct the reorganization of Europe toward the congressional form, and the basic principle laid down as EQUITY.

Capacities couldbe highly developed and efficiency enormously increased and the whole field of education broadened and extended. Education would be provided throughout the lifetime of the citizenry so that any changes in employment, due to invention or other factors, could be provided for by open opportunities for education in all fields throughout a man's life instead of his being thrown out of work and reduced to lower standards of living. Having recognized that in the Political Realm the idea of Equity is the opposite of Welfare which but leads to war since it rests on the idea that might is right and that conquering a country is a benefit to the common people of the conquering community, we look at the realm of ECONOMICS. ECONOMICS - Having recognized the Community's obligation to provide the opportunities for every man to develop his own abilities in his own way, we turn our attention to the Economic Organization ofthe community which has to function in a totally different realm to meet the bodily needs of men. In this everyone in the community is concerned either as producer or consumer, as manager or worker, agriculturist or technician. It is essentially international.

Only so can we get rid ofdelinquency and crime and disease. At present each block is a war zone. Children prevented, for safety, from crossing the streets are considered enemies if they do cross and the battle is on. We must make communication adequate and safe. All, even children, must have close access to the requirements of daily life yet that access must be safe as well as the access to education and sport. Since Chicago is an existing city we have, on the whole, accepted its diagonals. Except for their own intersections, the acute angles, so wasteful of space and so objectionable in construction, have been eliminated. In minor streets coming into the radials, when a geometric plan takes the place of the gridiron, these can easily be eliminated. Each quarter section has half its streets lined with the cardinal points of the compass and half with the intermediate compass points so the perpendiculars can easily beeffected.

This illustration may be associated with the United Provinces Exposition in Lucknow, India.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 438 ====] AIR - To Chicago's Air Port west of the city we have added one east of the administrative Center in the Lake, completing the central communication center - the air, the river, and all Chicago's Railroads (some of their present terminal stations becoming local stations). This makes this truly Chicago's Entrance Gateway. At intervals of two or three miles, in proximity to local Community Centers, Air Ports are located usually at junction points of Through Routes or Rail Yards. Where the covered over space below is not used for the Rail Roads themselves, it may well be used for public garages for either private or public vehicles - buses, etc. These are usually placed fairly close to the Community Centers whose buildings will not run to the heights of the Lake Shore Retail, Office and Flat districts along the Lake Front, butwhere intersecting Through Routes bring people from considerable surrounding areas. WATER - The Water ways are pretty well completed in Metropolitan Chicago, with supplementary canals, etc. We have accepted them on the whole and also the Industrial Districts on their shores and canals. Beyond the Metropolitan limits, where it is not too late, we would require the river and its natural banks to be preserved for the use and delight of the citizens, sometimes formalizing it as in Griffith (New Page 899 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of ChicagoSouth Wales, Australia). By safeguarding the run-off of the water, deviations could be made and canals used for industry. These levels could be maintained in the canals more easily than in the streams themselves. This is a wet climate district and enormous quantities of water are wasted, often menacinghuman communities. The T.V.A. [Note: Tennessee Valley Authority] should be repeated all over the nation.

There is ample space to the west of Chicago for industrial development, advantageous to Chicago if properly planned. Chicago could properly and profitably extend as far west of itsENTRANCE GATE as it has to the North and South. LAND Chicago has an unusually complete system of Railroads, appropriate to its central location on the continent, and of diagonal avenues. We have made no distinction between these except in the matter of the time of construction. The building lines on them all should be 200 feet apart that they may be readyfor the introduction of depressed central rail lines in the future when required. In the mean time, on the whole, only the 8 rail Through Express routes call for the use of all that width for vehicular traffic. All these thoroughfares should be treed and gardened ways. The evaporation serves as a very noticeable cooler on hot days. On the whole the radial routes, varying in the weight of their service, have been retained. In only a few places have they been removed. Sometimes there has been a slight deviation here and there to bring together unnecessarily close lines thus simplifying the problem of satisfactory occupation. A surprisingly large area of Chicago is unoccupied. Land value taxation would put an end to that. We assume that all the latest improvements will be made use of. Instead of the present type of steam, or even perhaps of Diesel engines there will be single rail lines with trains suspended while in motion between the wire above and the rail below for we have recently Page 900 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoawakened to the advantage of Tom Johnson's invention [Note: Tom L.

In competition with air service the surface, or rather depressed service of Railroads will have to be modernized. At crossings one express should go deeper - under the other. A city is immortal. All these changes need not therefore entail heavy expenditures but can come with the timely and natural restoration of the properties involved. The external roads of the quarter and half sections will be fast traffic but local rather than express so generally the present widths are sufficient.Passenger traffic here should be buses which can pick up the passengers at the curb minimizing danger. There may be exceptions to this where new 200' thoroughfares will be used. The freight trucks should be so constructed that they can be switched onto Rail lines thus minimizing the crowding of streets. The problem of the safety of surface traffic at intersections of thoroughfares has been worked out in Chicago and is being established by either center circulating parks or over and under ways. INTERIOR - Segregation of Occupation and Communication divides communication into exterior and interior. The Neighborhood streets, the opposite of thoroughfares, should be narrow and devious though this does not mean indirect. No stub ends and no curly streets. Their use will be purely for domestic service - some 18' and others 25' wide. This narrowing of pavements - for the building lines can be set at a width of 50 or more feet - and the elimination of all alleys, except the one back of the shops on the Section lines, on the circumference of the Neighborhoods, will mean that this system of occupation will entail no extra cost but be a saving to the community. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 443 ====] The Elevated roads should gradually be eliminated. Subways are called for only in the main Retail and Office centers North, and later South, of the Cultural and Administrative Center and in CommunityCenters. Irregular spaces along the through routes will supplement the Industrial and Manufacturing spaces or be Page 901 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoused for flats.

DIAGRAM [Note: This illustration may be related to the Better Chicago Contest sponsored by the \"Chicago Herald American\" in 1945.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 445 ====] OCCUPATION ENTRANCE GATE TO CHICAGO ADMINISTRATIVE & CULTURAL CENTER In accordance with the general principle or locating Community Centers, this center of Metropolitan Chicago is placed where all 8 of the Through Routes come together. Its location has been indicated diagrammatically. It lies between Halstead [Note: Halsted Street?] and the Lake and between Roosevelt Road and 26th Street. Into these 8 routes pour all the railroad main and branch and belt lines. One canreach it directly from anywhere. Within this district all the Railroads and Stations will be below grade and completely floored over. (In Sydney the Railroads of the whole metropolis are underground, very elegant and offering enough safe and comfortable space to house close to the whole population of the city in time of war.) This is not a terminal station. All lines are through routes. It is about the center between the North and South limits of Chicago. The South Side, since through it pours a stream from the intensely occupied Eastern States, bids fair soon to become as important as the North Side. It requires only proper handling within and beyond the City limits to become so. We therefore suggest the expectation of a Retail Trade and Office development district to the South comparable to that to the North especially as this South East region continues to have the Lake Shore. The State line boundary line [Note: i.e., between Illinois and Indiana] means nothing. Three Routes come in from the South. The other Through Routes come in from the West and North. Trade and Office building may naturally extend Northward in this district beyond the River. Beyond the area to the North of the mouth of the River along the Lake Shore is, and may well continue to be, the tall flat building district with a more or less transient occupancy.

The significance of State lines will gradually disappear as the State has no real function. It is merely a left-over from pre-revolutionarytimes. In the United States, as in the world, all purely artificial boundaries should be broken down. The three natural divisions are the world , the Continent and the City . A difference between races really no longer exists. As people go to the Tropics they become dark, in the Temperate zones they become fair andtoday the individual recognizes no boundary lines. Indeed America's especial task in the coming decadesis to migrate to all parts of the world carrying along the concept of democracy whose foundation stone is Equity . A democracy is a community organization whose function, and only function, is to maintain EQUITY. A separate organization of the same people is necessary to maintain FRATERNITY(mutuality), that is an economic organization, and still another to maintain LIBERTY a social organization financed by land taxation to supply education through man's life. The meeting point of Land, Water and Air transport, if properly handled, should establish a spectacular Architectural Center - a true Urban Cultural Center. A deviation of the river could take freight traffic west of this center. This natural Center offers the opportunity for a beautiful expression of the genius of the City as the representative of the present civilization. The construction of this center should not be too hurried. The Field Museum and the Planetarium are already there. The drawings of buildings presentedin THE MAGIC OF AMERICA but suggest the variety and range that could make this center of Metropolitan and State and Federal government's executive, administrative and judicial functions a superbly beautiful Center with a background of tall buildings.

ARCHITECT [Note: ==== Beginning of page 451 ====] OCCUPATION RETAIL TRADE AND OFFICE BUILDING INTENSE OCCUPATION Chicago as a whole is a community which contains within it other communities. We discuss this as a present and future problem. The present retail and office building district lies to the North of the proposed Entrance Gate extending west from the Lake and tending to go beyond the River. The originaldifficulties of the site have been overcome and its location at the confluence of the river with the lake is properly the determining factor of its location. This Central City, free from radial lines is a natural Retail and Office Building Center. Provision is made for the extension of this central down-town area by extending it Westward to Halstead [Note: Halsted] Street. Its business is improved by the intense flat district to the North and the Entrance Gate on itsSouthern Boundary and the bringing of all Through Routes to this Center which is not a terminal station. Much use will be made of the underground of all this district. The present terminal stations will remain but as local stops. We suggest nothing revolutionary for Chicago's business center. As time goes on, multiple buildings will be replaced by single buildings occupying a whole block, with interior courts, etc., and they willtend not to become higher but to become monumental and beautiful. Open squares will be left so that the surrounding buildings may be seen to advantage. Such spaces cost nothing when held by the community. Through this district the river flows and the property adjacent to it will be held by the community and gradually the river will be parked [Note: developed into parks?] on either side to become spectacularly beautiful, and offering [Note: ==== Beginning of page 452 ====] space enough to see the buildings to advantage. The River within this central city should be entirely freed from anything that would hamper its stateliness and beauty. It would be well to set immediately the building line boundaries on either side of Page 904 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagothe river to ensure a park along both its sides from 25th Street to its mouth. Rentals cost the city nothing as they belong to the community as a whole. Where there are monumental buildings these could be allowed to remain. To the South we forecast a similar Retail and Office Building area developing gradually from the Entrance Gate. Such a district might develop in the two sections (about a mile southward by two miles from East to West) to the South though they have been drawn as ordinary residential districts. Three of the Express Through Routes (No.1, No.2, and No.3) carry from the South and the Southwest districts through this district into the Administrative Center and the Retail Trade and Office District tothe North. The South Side, if properly handled would have a population as profitable to Chicago as the North districts beyond the City limits are. We begin that by making Lake Calumet a New Venice. The intensely occupied flat district along the Lake to the North can be left as it is on the whole. It will be occupied by transients or elderly people. Families with children or young folk will move into the neighboring districts where life can be full of interest. Apartments will also appear in the spaces adjacentto thoroughfares. Bit by bit we are breaking away from imitative architecture and designing with a free hand which can be beautiful and interesting and worthy of a bit of speciousness for a soul developing influence. The industrial buildings themselves can become [Note: ==== Beginning of page 453 (table of contents) ====] INCINERATOR [Note: ==== Beginning of page 454 ====] impressive and even majestic features as the grouped silos are in some cases now. Cleanliness can become universal. With so many radiating Through Routes the citizenry can easily reach any of the outlying districts. The River should be used and broadened for grandiose building frontage. TheN.W.R.R. [Note: Chicago & North Western Railway?] and the Opera buildings have set an example. But promenades along both sides of the river should be provided with gardening effects. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 455 (table of contents) ====] No. 24.

It made and it will destroy it if allowed to be the controlling factor. Chicago should be a London only modern . London is made up of many separate municipalities. If Chicago's extension into the lake East of the mouth of the Calumet River (whichperhaps Nature's piling up of the sands might make possible) is not feasible at least pains should be taken there to form an enclosed harbor whose outer shore should be park and pleasure ground for thecitizens, restoring to them what industry has destroyed. Chicago is a natural Industrial and Commercial Center. Whether it is living or dying depends upon its citizenry first and the transients secondarily. The beautiful lake district South and Southeast will attract as high class a citizenry as have the beauties of the North Shore and should not be despoiled. There is plenty of room to the west for expending industry but its expression calls for pre-planning. We take forgranted that Chicago will presently do as other places have done and prevent industry from polluting either the air or the water. All its by-products can be made use of even the heat which can be used as in Oak Park [Note: Illinois] for community hot water systems. A FAIRLY GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF INDUSTRIES IS DESIRABLE as it affords employment to a considerable proportion of the population who should therefore live as close aspossible, and whose standards can and should be as high as anyone's and whose home environment and opportunities for the children should be on a level with any other citizen's. This has been the natural cause of Chicago's growth so we find industry scattered throughout the Metropolis, and on the whole we have left that as it is as we have also that of the radial transport system. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 457 (table of contents) ====] INDUSTRIAL BUILDING [Note: This illustration is associated with the United Provinces Exposition in Lucknow, India.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 458 ====] There is endless opportunity for extension of industry to the West. It is no more important to Chicago that it should be within the municipal limits than that the North Shore residential districts should be.What is necessary is that it should be pre-planned, each and every square mile. Each district may be a particular problem. The successful planning of each district will contribute to Chicago's development as a continental center. The great work of the young people of the 1st decades of the 20th century gave Chicago a magnificent outer park system of reserves. But this has met but the one necessity of preserving nature within thecommunity boundaries. It was done with no town-planning system except the rescue of as many lovely Page 906 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagospots as possible. Its work extended over the State and even beyond. In a way it was outside the realm of Town Planning as we have defined it - i.e., the problem of occupation and communication. Its motive was simply \"to the rescue\" of Mother Nature. That must be followed by district planning. The waterways can be kept pure, as can the air, by Imhoff tank [Note: a kind of septic tank] systems, incinerators, etc., which can be used on any scale from the single house to communities as a whole in which case the buildings housing such functions can be monumental structures, an honor to any neighborhood and no menace. (See illustrations of incinerators.) The manufacturing districts would naturally, and may properly, follow the through routes. This again gives easy access of their employees to them and to the domestic Centers. The irregular spaces caused by not having preplanned the Through Routes could well be used for such purposes and for tall flats. Manufacturing could also use some of the minor distributive thoroughfares depending on its nature. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 459a (table of contents) ====] No. 25. CLUB HOUSE . NILES .

The Central District is supplemented by the Community Centers the underground space of which along with that of the Community Air Ports can provide areas for railroad yards, community garages, etc., aswell as temporary parking space for shoppers, etc. - those things which do not need sunshine and where artificial light and ventilation, etc., suffice. These Community Centers are located from one to three miles apart throughout the Metropolis. All the Major and minor thoroughfares from the quarter-section circumferences to the Express Rail Routes (smokeless) will be business and flat districts which with an organic plan, will inevitably locatesuch elements, the business naturally starting from through route intersections major and minor. The through routes have been the only thing that has defied rectangles but they have neglected the occupation requirements. So between the two (surveys and transportation) our communities - well, as the old man said, \"Confuse is Hell and my wife is all confuse\" - our communities are ..... all confuse.

BALCONY [Note: The structure is the refectory rotunda of College.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 461 ====] CAPTIONThis great central domed hall in Melbourne is a unique type of construction. I believe there is one such in India. Strictly speaking it is not a dome. The structure is a series of great circular intersecting arches which eliminate the dome type of strains. At their lower contact point Griffin placed the highly ornamental torches, making all the lighting indirect. So effective was it that the oculist member of the board of directors could no longer complain when he found that he could read the tiniest print on his eyetesting chart. The coloring of the walls and arches of this hall is wonderful. The rough surface of the intersections add richness, and the varied pattern of the intersecting arches which could be colored in different shades of gold and orange and green. The design of the whole is a unique thing in the world and though by no means Gothic holds its own with the beautiful structures of Europe. [Note: ==== Beginning of page 462a ====] [Note: Continued from page 459b] now is that of an industrial people (no longer inspired but dependent on their rational faculty) who must tackle their problem or the answer will be delinquency, crime, disease, degeneration. We must recognize the consequences and responsibilities which arise from the division of labor. In Chicago which really has a superb system of radial, branch and belt Railroads, we have accepted on the whole the through routes. The intersection points determine the proper location for Community Centers. On the whole we have chosen those at two or three mile intervals where a Center one mile long will include two or more different through route intersection points. Within this area not only will the tracks go underground but the stations as well. The fact of locating these natural places for concentratedservice will develop a rivalry that will tend to make them all beautiful. The Community's collecting of rental values will prevent the holding back of development. The neglect of this in early days was the Page 908 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art of Chicagocause of the perversion of [Note: Pierre-Charles] L'Enfant's plan of Washington which sent the development of business where it was not intended. These Centers can combine, with business, other functions of general community interest as Civic Buildings, Libraries, Memorials, Aquaria, Museums, etc. The form used is but to indicate the location. Individual initiative as well as local use of Town Planning advice will lead to interesting variety in the solutions of these problems, as it would in suburban and outlying communities, as the importance of preplanning becomes understood. Main thoroughfares radiate from these Community Centers. CALUMET - A NEW VENICEJust as the Skokie [Note: wetlands?] was a special problem whose opportunities were ignored and so lost to the coming generations, so now is Lake Calumet threatened. We are only now just beginning to realize the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 462b Griffin . (Minimum Cost) This illustration is not listed in the table of contents. The structure is the Mower House (Casa Bonita).] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 463 ====] disastrous consequences of canals in draining swiftly the waters in nature's reservoirs to pour their seasonal waters into the streams below causing loss of life and much other damage. Such natural features should be dealt with by humans, but not to desecrate as is being suggested for Calumet, but touse in beauty, for Nature rejoices in being in partnership with man, but if desecrated She destroys him, if not by violence then by disease. Work with Nature and She grants genius. In Calumet there is ample water. It should be conserved. Space can also be conserved by using flat roofs entirely. They can be used for gardens only, which keep the buildings cool in summer, or for garage or other services. The development has been suggested diagrammatically though quite possibly it may bethe best way since wriggly roads on flat land are intolerable. On the main radials, business etc. will develop as on the Quarter Section lines. Within them will be purely domestic roads and canals. In the Center the schools.

DWELLING . SOUTHERN STATE . G.B. COOLEY . LOUISIANA [Note: The house is located in Monroe, Louisiana.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 465 ====] OCCUPATION DOMESTIC OCCUPATION Town Planning and Architecture are inseparable even down to the case of the private house on a single lot. Whether it should be low lying and set back or lifted up with ground floor instead of basement depends on its adjoining neighbors. Architecture is one half of the problem but in Chicago only the problem of communication has been tackled and only half of that - the major communication lines. No consideration has been given to what should be done for interior distributive lines. The consequence is that except for the retail trade and office districts and the occasional large parks, Chicago is completely slums. Our problem is to get the correct answer which can be attained only by combining mathematics and art. In nature we have an illustration in the triangle or hexagon - the snowflake with its myriad enchanting forms. What the adult is depends on what the child has been. Only in proper wholesome surroundings can one grow up complete, healthy, happy - fully developed in body, soul and spirit. All other issues are secondary. Only if the problem of occupancy is solved can the coming generation grow up healthy, wealthy and wise. Since Chicago is an established city we approach the problem so. We find that all the streets are thoroughfares. No consideration has been given to occupation except in the location of various isolated parks. These are right and fine but do not in the least meet the needs of small children and their parents for daily and hourly use for the thousand and one purposes that the prisons of house and school cannot offer. In communication we must consider topography. Its basic requirement is directness but this must be considered with topography which it must not defy. In occupation in the residential [Note: ==== Beginning of page 466 ====] districts the basic factors are accessibility, safety and seclusion. So no solution can be universal. Each particular part must be given individual attention; to both these problems the preservation of nature is basic. It is of first importance that we should eliminate delinquency. The children should be safe and have wide contact with others while growing up to be complete and satisfied human beings. In Chicago no attention has been given to this half of the community problem. The issue is not centralizing or Page 910 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagodecentralizing. Even intensely occupied areas may be safe but all the other requirements should be met too. Even if our domestic units should be crowded (which we should not permit) they still would be safe for the domestic functions of children and parents. The type pattern set for Quarter and Half Sections sometimes conform to present quarter-section lines and sometimes are set diagonal to them. In each case this could be determined by investigation of the particular district. In all cases the present Quarter Section lines could be retained if it was found to be important to do so. In no case need the changes within the Quarter Section lines be revolutionary. We can do as they have done in Metropolitan Sydney to get rid of the hopeless confusion of traffic on itsnarrow streets. There a new building line has been set. When a new building is erected it must conform to the new line. This entails no extra expense and really gives added style to the new buildings, attracting attention and custom. Or we could do as was done several times in Los Angeles - move buildings on to new lots. The ultimate building lines could be set and when present owners decided to rebuild they could be allocated a new lot on the plan as determined. In many cases about half of the streets would remain where they are at present, just their width and treatment would be [Note: ==== Beginning of page 467a (typescript) / 467 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING .

A circular stairway gives access to the 2nd story which is devoted entirely to sleeping accommodations. A feature of the stairway is a stained glass window. The garage piers serve as huge lanterns serving to illuminate the garden and paths. Flower boxes put an artistic touch to these unique features.

The amount of street frontage remains practically as it is except in some of the Half Sections where the treatment is shown to be on an ampler scale. Consideration of each district would determine whether the quarter or half section would be used. If, as is sometimes suggested, the interior streetswithin the Quarter Section are placed closer together and the back yard space eliminated and perhaps one common park substituted, this does not meet the requirements for plan and congregation space. A quarter section with practically no parks, or one or two parks and with round about access to commercial streets is but going from bad to worse and would make hopeless slums. In this general study the present location of important buildings has been given no consideration. This can be taken care of just as the present parks have been cared for within the special Quarter Section in which they occur. In bringing order out of the present confusion each detail would be given careful consideration. No scheme should be used [Note: \"given\" typed over] that gives less park than shown in the special case considered under the title of - A Neighborhood Community - Newton Center. We have considered Cemeteries as valuable open spaces which ultimately will become accessible gardens, eachwith a memorial building with tablets of those buried there. With ample access to nature and ample provision for sports the necessity for tubercular institutes, etc., would disappear. Intermediate spaces between Quarter Sections and Through Routes could be used for such group requirements as Universities. We count on a continual great increase in the number of people going through the Universities. The scientific nature of our civilization calls for this and provision should bemade for the use of these institutions throughout a man's life. Science and Culture should go hand in hand and could do so in a properly planned community in which the distinction between the so-called working-man [Note: ==== Beginning of page 469 (table of contents) ====] INCINERATOR & PARK MUSIC PAVILION [Note: The structure is the Unley Incinerator in Wayville West, South Australia.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 470 ====] and the \"privileged\" would be wiped out. The Purpose of Town Planning is to get rid of dirt and noise. To do so restores Health and Sanity which calls for close contact with Nature. It makes it possible for parents to know their children and children their parents. This restores to the HOME a community of interests in work and play. The school life itself should be close to and under the eye of the parents. The seclusion and safety of the interior of the Quarter Sections make these things possible. Isolation of children in their homes destroys the broadening of their souls and genius. The crowding of them together in the drill chambers of huge schoolrooms destroys their originality. Theremust be interplay and interwork. The safety of the inner Quarter Section accomplishes this.

The quarter of the Quarter Section could be indicated by the cardinal points of the compass N; S; E; W; or NE; SE; NW;SW. To this would be added the house number on the particular type of street - Circle Way; Octagon Way; etc. Thus an address would be:- No1 - N - Octagon Way 27. Chicago, Illinois Whether the Quarter Sections should be normal or diagonal to the Cardinal points of the compass would be determined by the local existing factors.

ILLINOIS [Note: ==== Beginning of page 472 ====] NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY PROBLEM PREVENTIVE OF DELINQUENCY & CRIME Any scheme of development that is to serve during a considerable period of time must first be \"elastic\" to accommodate as many contingencies as can be predicted. But a development that is to suit the simplest requirements of modern community life can be neither amorphous nor arbitrary nor with autocratic restrictions. Its elastic adaptability will not be secure unless founded on a simple articulationof functions with careful attention to distinctions that are fundamental and specific, and to correlation that may be considered of vital organic necessity - generic. To arrive at these relationships it is necessary not only to study present civic conditions - failures as well as successes - but to trace their historical development from our earliest knowledge to ascertain tendencies that may be expected to affect the future. Thus only can we hope to deal broadly ingeneralization without running into mere speculation unrelated to reality. The method of this project follows an assumed primary distinction between the needs of suitable site conditions for individual or specialized Occupancy on the one hand and those of social and general Communication on the other. Co-operative industrial site requirements are reciprocal with the most general accommodation and family social and private requirements. With the level land and other conditions so generally typical of not only a large part of Chicago but of a majority of our growing towns of the Central West we may emphasize quite literally and diagrammatically the general structural significance of the scheme and, in practice, eliminate many non-essential though important variations that would have to be considered in the event of execution for any particular site. Page 913 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: ==== Beginning of page 473 (table of contents) ====] BOUNDARY SHOPS WITH OR WITHOUT DWELLINGS ABOVE [Note: This illustration is associated with the United Provinces Exposition in Lucknow, India.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 474 ====] The general tendency of most of Chicago implies, for the Quarter Section, adaptation to predominantly residential function. There is, however, an important modification of the normal considered here as an alternative. This involves a development in connection with a manufacturing concern to provide home and social advantages primarily for the employees of the contiguous works. The most typical additionalassumption for that condition would be railway facilities on one side of the Quarter Section in place of the future streetcar lines otherwise predicted. On the basis of an ultimate population of the Quarter Section, that frontage - 1280 x 4 or 5120 feet - will doubtless prove excessive as compared with business frontage in average towns of that population and, accordingly, only about 5/8 of that frontage conferring transfer points and principal centerway entrancecorners for stores and shops; and less accessible frontage for supply yards, garages, storehouses, etc. Since the traffic point will be the most useful business site it is suggested that the most general local industries can be accommodated there, beginning with the existing transfer corner as the first arcade courts structure. Built full to the street inter-section line such a building will sacrifice none of the most available shop frontage. We must realize that a high organism only will lead to great and real freedom for artistic expression. For analogy, the whole city may be compared to a tree with its unified circulating system of industry represented by the stem, roots and branches, the rootlets and the leaves, all continuous and constantly interoperating to augment, repair and maintain the system's integrity. In the great industrial city we have all that now, more or less efficient, in this way and just as certain to end disastrously if limited to thesepurposes as in the case of a tree without its Floral expression of [Note: The illustration listed as being on page 475 in the table of contents:ART GALLERY .

For the flower and the family too, doubtless, the most efficient unit is the considerable organized group for purely domestic purposes represented by the all-conquering, youngest Page 914 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoand most vital order of the floral kingdom - the compositae [Note: the Asteraceae (aster) family?]. The civic organism may best survive with grouped domestic organisms such as are possible to a segregated purely domestic community development. The established general skeleton not only in Chicago but predominant in America is the gridiron of main thoroughfares at half mile intervals in each direction affording, for typical units of subdivision, quarter-section plats of 160 acres. With the level land and with other conditions so characteristic not only characteristic of a large part of Chicago but of a majority of newer growing towns we can, in a typical scheme, deal very generally with the structural elements of the problem and eliminatenon-essential though important variations that would have to be considered in the event of execution for a particular site. Any scheme of development that is to be extended over a considerable time must first, because of the complexities of democratic life, be flexible to accommodate more contingencies than can be predicted but by no means need it be amorphous as in the usual \"gridiron\" nor arbitrary in restrictions as in the German \"Zone\" systems. Above all we have to avoid running into speculation outside ofreality. Co-operative industrial site requirements are reciprocal with general circulative accommodation and habitation, and domestic social private site requirements demand a reciprocally specialized and distributive communication accommodation. The phase of the general subject that is termed Occupation considers the desirability of relative positionsin the tract for the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 477 ====] various functions and the proportionate areas and suitable plot shapes and aspects for those special uses. The quarter-section site will not be considered as a focal point in the city and our aim may well be to make available the most space possible for specialized occupation that the traffic necessities will permit; to have those spaces adapted by location, size and shape for the specific purposes public or private that are desired. It may be taken for granted that in general a rectangular or obtuse angled plot will bepreferred and that the building plots shall be related to each other most simply, that is geometrically , because only thus can they be grouped architecturally to advantage especially with that degree ofrepetition dictated by economy as well as the aesthetic necessity for restfulness. Where the site is flat and the problem an economic one, expense and difficulties of irregular curves and of acute intersections may, and must of course, be avoided entirely. The circumferential allotments on the boundary streets are for industrial functions . The lots for all these purposes are strictly rectangular, with rear alley shipping frontages as well as street store frontage free from alley crossings and of 100 feet depth. The typical frontage allotment is set at 30 feet as being capable of division into two 15 foot spans, the most economical in construction as well as constituting a reasonable minimum limit for the single store compartments. Two lots can, moreover, accommodatethree spans of 20 feet, the maximum economical construction limit of span, and suitable for large unobstructed stores, with the advantageous double-column line disposition for important emporiums. Apart from the circumferential Industrial allotments the area of this development is to be devoted to home life in the same sense that includes, in addition to private habitats, those features of education, play and social congregation, leisure occupation and rest that Page 915 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicago[Note: There is no page 478 in either the Art Institute of Chicago or New-York Historical Society.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 479 ====] carried on co-operatively. It seems advisable rather to counter-act than to stimulate the prevalent amorphous condition of social life in a great metropolis and rather to develop largely independent unitswithin the limits of personal fellowship. Standing apart and well organized, these internal attractions will be able to exert to the utmost the popular healthy standards of the group as a whole against those of less normal individual types and thus at least minimize the forced or unsought evil influences that account so largely for saloons, for instance, among a multitude of baneful time-killing pursuits and the remote activities of mass groups of the young folk. In the center is provided the Common with music pavilion set in reflecting basin with bordering aquatic gardens, tree-shaded open promenade and Public Garden setting off Refectory, Assembly Buildings, Library, Amphitheatre, Exhibits Building, Gymnasia, Natatoria and Special Training Schools and Kindergartens, colonnaded-connected and continuous with, and essential to, four eight-room public schools that will eventually have to be provided. The center nucleus is a community center for every day and evening, physical and mental training of all classes and ages, for Sunday rest, for esthetic indulgence in the beauty of water, flowers and garden-grouped architecture, also for pageant and celebration, and a Forum for public discussions all real general needs only expensively and ineffectively provided for in our current heterogeneous lack of co-ordination, though not only vital to but possible for a community of six thousand souls. With the advantages of combination of all the schools and their auxiliaries in one Community Center for economy of equipment, control and administration, is combined a maximum range of but two blocks, or a quarter of a mile, of separate continuous children's play grounds radially disposed to be subject to the same supervision .

Schoolrooms are preferably to be so set with the cardinal points of thecompass. On the \"Octagonway\" that links the various parts of the community in the middle are street terminal sites and thirty two additional prominent corners suitable for important structures for local social groups such Page 916 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 The Art of Chicagoas Union Headquarters, Lodges [Note: reading from IV.16.363], Turner Societies, Social Clubs, Residential Inns, Billiard Halls, Bowling Alleys, Religious Associations, Churches. The former category may be accorded those points contiguous to the play fields for setting, for outlook, and forsport under systematic direction. This position similar to that of the associations that most avail themselves of public recreation grounds is to be given these Dormitories, Fraternities, Boarding Houses or Inns and their attendant Cafes. The common standard of family independence and utmost privacy of garden accommodation is to be afforded to some, modest play courts to others, children's play-grounds equipped with apparatus orwater for wading and bathing to others in addition to the larger sports fields. These outdoor features are the substitute for the street area in the fully built up city and the precarious vacant lots of our slum districts and the far isolated palliative play grounds of our slum districts, with the great advantage over all of these of convenience to induce use; and of parental control to prevent abuse without the expense and artificiality of the paid overseer. Their multiplicity is intended to be enough inadvance of any present standard to overcame much of the tendency to boisterous license that results from overcrowding, and to bring out the full use that cannot be attained in centers of greater separation than a block radius as [Note: \"Turner societies\" - Growing out of the German Turnverein movement encouraging gymnastics and physical activity, the American Turners developed organizations which promoted social and culturalservices (along with sports activities) for German immigrants.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 482 (table of contents) ====] DWELLING .

The corner lots generally 60' x 60' divided diagonally into two holdings to make salable all frontage and attain the maximum efficiency from the street system are adaptable for flat buildings because with them the back yard, ofleast utility or desirability for garden uses, cannot be private nor fully efficient in connection with apartments.

When this [Note: thus?] located they contribute most architectural effectiveness in the groups as the strongest terminal elements for eachcombined block-front composition of small units. At the same time they are granted the best disposition for light and air as required by the houses of largest areas. At the corners, however, the larger buildings least affect the [Note: ==== Beginning of page 484 (table of contents) ====] FURNITURE . RUGS . Marion Mahony . MURAL PAINTING .

Hedges or irregular shrubbery constitute the best means of separating and beautifying for every variation between isolated yards and neighborhood lawns in one harmonious park-like ensemble for our rear outlook. Proper planning of even the smallest house can eliminate the need for back or alley entrances and accomplish the aims of specialized functions and convenience with the privacy that distinguishes our lives from those of any other time or nation. A simple system of street nomenclature is important in direct proportion with the high development of the system's organization. Herein as related to the city as a whole the number of the quarter section of the community itself appears. There is no excuse for overhead wires nor poles nor yet for mutilated pavements for when the sewers are excavated it is only necessary to omit refilling of the excavation and to pour concrete into the sides of the trench about a box form as it is moved along! to equip with stub ducts, and to provide manholes forthe concrete pavement when laid overhead, to have, complete, an accessible warm passage conduit ample for all water, gas, and heating and other equipment pipes and wires as needed; all at an insignificant charge of not more than one dollar a front foot as against a dependence on Franchise buttressed public monopolies whose income must provide for duplication excavations, poles, as well as maintenance charges and pavement replacements altogether out of comparison with this single conduitcost. There should be no stub end streets.

STONE [Note: The structure is the Cox House, Castlecrag.] [Note: ==== Beginning of page 487 ====] in numerous needs by distributing or collecting agencies for foods, mail, papers, garbage and ashes. Such needs are uneconomically met in stub streets , loops or the like, for the services are often competitive or, if not, are discontinuous as in mail delivery where retracing steps may aggregate in great loss of efficiency. Study of the internal lines of this quarter section taken as a distribution system graduated in thoroughfare width (from 18-20 feet) as well as in equipment proportionately to the relative tributary areas, shows it to be continuous for such service without being attractive to any more generalthoroughfare usage. The four shorter \"Centerways\" have, however, a special linking function as explained hereinafter. Because of natural gravitation of business to the through line boundaries of the tract, it is important as well as feasible to arrange internal lines to discourage useless artificial intrusion of discordant commercial elements and to seclude the domestic community from industrial circulation. For that reasonentering streets are allowed to pass through only with at least quarter diversion if short, or greater obstruction if exceeding an ordinary block. The congregation function of the internal communication system of these tracts are of special function for domestic social requirements only. The garden fronted park \"Play Courts,\" \"Play Fields,\" and \"Gymnasium Courts\" of various sorts are supplemented by a system of approach paths as well as surrounding internal paths marking the firststage in the public social congregating [Note: reading from N-YHS] system. The internal streets are supplemented with an informal winding scheme of paths with irregular shrub and tree plantations in the external angles not required for sport, making of the whole one continuous circulating pedestrian parkway tributary in use and reciprocating in vistas with the \"Common\" Center. Especially, as relieved from all large vehicle [Note: ==== Beginning of page 488 ====] transit, it is the proper way for the children at leisure times. Since such [Note: each] triangular quadrant of the quarter-section may be taken to require ultimately an eight room school, the most advantageous location of their bisecting \"Centerways\" makes of them in Page 919 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] Copyright \u00a9 2008 The Art Institute of Chicagoconnection with the \"Gateways\" the shortest possible diagonal out routes between home and school that are thus only about two blocks apart in the extreme instances. The location of the domestic center band-stand, pool, park and assembly buildings provide for night as well as day use. This impressive grouping of community buildings must make it representative and establish for it no mean interest to the whole city. Thus as an element in that created social organism it is properly recognized as a foundation for community pride. The intimately interwoven relationships of the Central communal functions can well be joined together only in a protected or enclosed passageway for the students and visitors, the entire promenade having for its outlook the public gardens setting off thepool with its central feature of an open pagoda designed as a music pavilion occupying the geometric center of the tract, as well as with underground conduit-way for their cooperative hydraulic, mechanical and electric systems herein accomplished with utmost economy through disposition in a slightly interrupted circle.

HILLTOP HOTEL [Note: ==== Beginning of page 490 ====]ENVIRONING HILLY DISTRICTS AND OUTLYING COMMUNITIES The outlying features and conditions and the location of Through Routes should be the determining factors in the planning of all outlying districts. Community plans should be mathematical but not mechanical. As the years pass Chicago should continue to acquire possession of lovely open spaces to become parks as it extends its boundaries, and interests, which are one with the State, just as the Hikers did a quarter of a century ago. The citizens should vie with each other in discovering such areas. Between them where thoroughfares have not already been established as they have in Chicago, are the residential districts (see Griffith plan) whose streets would leave the thoroughfares at right angles and meet between them in obtuse angles as desirable for buildings as the right angle, often more desirable, especially for civic structures. The streets within come into these secondary streets at right angles forming, for the most part, squares or parallelograms, never acute angles. COMMUNITY CENTERS There has been much misunderstanding of the basis of Community Centers and consequently much loss to business enterprise and many failures. Only timely Town Planning can prevent this and this Community Planning should include at least the whole state. Surveys should in no case determine the lines of communications but only give the facts necessary for their determination, levels as well asdistances, for to place rectangular roads on sloping ground is as fatal as to place curving roads on flat Page 920 of 923 Supplement to \"The Magic of America: Electronic Edition\" [URL: http://www.artic.edu/magicofamerica/] The Art Institute of Chicagoland. [Note: \"Hikers\" may refer to an informal group (including WBG and Dwight Perkins) who, according to MMG, hiked the Chicago area as well as Illinois and pressed government agencies to set aside parksand reserves.

It also constitutes a districtfree of wind and dust, also perfectly drained beneath as to water, and above as to cooling currents of air, so that the temperature and humidity are the most equable, even precluding frost - all the conditions for the best health. Some years ago the genius of Walter Burley Griffin, architect and town planner, saw the amazing possibilities of the three virgin promontories on the western side of Middle Harbor with their gloriousfour miles of water frontage. His enthusiasm inspired a group of Australian capitalists among his professional clients, and the magnificent amphitheatres passed into the hands of Greater Sydney Development Association Limited. This is literally a case where the last is best, for here is the only harbor frontage free from the threat of commerce and quite out of the field of industrial expansion now in evidence in every other direction. Itis the only waterside development that can be, and will be, protected against flats.

When the land is not level the contours should become a controlling factor (see Leeton [Note: Australia]) but the geometric principles hold. Buildings should be as straightforward solutions of their problems as the layouts of the districts. But this does not mean that they should be stupid and uninteresting repetitions. No natural beauty should be injured but each one taken advantage of. Environing established communities should be considered as centers for express ways and branches to aim toward in order to connect with the radial roads that start from the various towns. Each town will of course require special consideration for its growth. All highspeed through traffic should be depressed, open as a whole but covered over where it concentrates.
