While it will provide general principals, individualized advice and protocols based on Doshas will be given as well. Ayurveda considers inflammation the symptom of a disease, an independent disease, or the complication of a disorder. Shotha or edematous inflammation for instance could be a symptom of a metabolic disorder like diabetes or obesity; it could be a disease in itself caused by imbalances in any of the doshas, or exogeneous factors (Agantuja factors like burns or trauma). It could even be a complication of a disorder like an enlarged spleen or peritonitis. Chronic and degenerative diseases, metabolic syndrome, and cancers share common pathological features and that is inflammation. Earlier, aging was considered to be one of the causes of degenerative disorders but our stressful and irregular lifestyle has triggered inflammation in many younger people who are now at risk for so many of these conditions. Ayurveda believes that Ama (digestive or metabolic toxins) clogs micro channel circulation (Sroto Dushti) and causes inflammation, loss of homeostasis and tissue damage and Ama management is therefore one of the primary ways to deal with inflammation. Once Ama has been removed, in what is called the Nirama (absence of Ama) stage of diseases, appropriate interventions are made. Take the case of the lady with chronic bronchitis. A thorough analysis of her case and a holistic approach would be needed to change her diet and lifestyle; with targeted herbs and therapies, as well as support in quitting smoking, her immunity can be significantly improved. How would it help you to attend a workshop and gain principals to prevent and manage inflammation? Consider the statistics. We often ignore it, but chronic inflammation is a serious matter; in 2015 the CRP levels and mortality rates of 160,000 Scottish citizens were studied, almost two-thirds of them were under 65. It concluded that those with high CRP were two to seven times more likely to die in an 8-year period. 6 in 10 Americans suffer from a lifestyle based disorder that could have inflammation as an underlying cause. This level is not normally measured and we either ignore it or get overwhelmed when we address it or realize its importance. Yet, the fact is that we can manage inflammation very well with Ayurveda. Ayurveda's strength lies in preventative health to ensure that we do not fall sick down the road by inculcating good health practices and an immunity building regimen now. It's comprehensive approach with diet, lifestyle, herbs, and a daily regimen that incorporates yoga, breathwork, and meditation can offer solutions in avoiding and alleviating inflammation and consequent health conditions. For people who have mild to debilitating symptoms as a result, it can significantly improve their quality of life. While our longevity has improved, Ayurveda can help us improve the quality of our longevity and lives through simple yet profound principals to enhance our health "}
