It is much more than a brilliant system of natural medicine. Explore more on the [Saumya Blog](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/blog), selected top Ayurveda blogs and websites to watch. Ayurveda and the Spiritual Path \"To know about Ayurveda, contact Veenaji--because when it comes to spiritual practices, you don't want anything to become a source of hinderance in your practice. Being an expert Ayurvedic doctor, there are now very few, because it requires knowledge of the scriptures, the medicine, but it also requires a great deal of being a sadhaka. (Sadhaka is someone who follows a certain sadhana, a spiritual practice, or way of life.) Without being a sadhaka, an Ayurvedic physician is not a true physician. Because the medicine of Ayurveda is not simply medicine, it is much, much more than simply medicine. The name itself says it, the knowledge, wisdom, the Veda, to know, all about Ayu, life. When you consult with a knowledgeable Ayurvedic doctor, then your body, mind, and your pranic body operate optimally and your sadhana becomes easier, your practice becomes enjoyable.\" - Panditji Dabral Intermittent Fasting in Ayurveda: A Spiritual Approach While intermittent fasting is a health trend, it is actually a practice that has been around thousands of year and is rooted in Ayurveda.

I was haunted by anxiety my whole life, and it's just gone. The mudra, mantra...WOW! This is so cool! I have regained hope. Something wonderful is taking place. You and your knowledge come to me after a lifetime of searching and prayer. I am forever grateful.\" --Mark Hughes, Minnesota \"Veena has literally changed my life. I was struggling with mental and physical symptoms that my doctor had no answer for. I thought I was going crazy and just making symptoms up. With Veena's guidance, with herbs and diet changes, I soon realized that my symptoms were very real. After making the changes, I made small victories along the way, and became better with each appointment with her. Now almost 6 months later, I am a completely different person. I still have some things to work on, but with Veena's help, I know I will be able to take control of my health and not leave it to Western medicine that was giving me little to no help and covering up my symptoms with another medication. Working with Veen has been the best decision I have made for my health. You won't be disappointed!\" -- Maria Fumagalli, St. Paul, Minnesota Veena is a Certified Ayurvedic Practitioner, Meditation Teacher and Monk.
