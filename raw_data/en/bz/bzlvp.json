It is widely accepted that diet, exercise, lifestyle, and behavior affect overall health by impacting organ systems. The impact of wellness medicine on the GU tract is less recognized and less robustly studied, but the principles remain important and impactful. This chapter will discuss: bladder health, including overactive bladder, urinary incontinence, and urinary infections; sexual health, including benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer; and kidney health, including kidney stones. - Type - Chapter - Information [The Handbook of Wellness Medicine](/core/books/the-handbook-of-wellness-medicine/2B33D8651A964A6B08B62BF31D734D93), pp. 98 - 115Publisher: Cambridge University PressPrint publication year: 2020 References [www.urologyhealth.org/patient-magazine/magazine-archives/2014/summer-2014/urinary-tract-infections-learn-how-to-spot-and-treat-them](http://www.urologyhealth.org/patient-magazine/magazine-archives/2014/summer-2014/urinary-tract-infections-learn-how-to-spot-and-treat-them)(accessed April 21, 2020).
