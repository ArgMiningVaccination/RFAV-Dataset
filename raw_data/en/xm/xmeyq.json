Introduction This preliminary report sets out an independent and detailed assessment of Wayne State Universit y's research capacities and possible opportunities for enhancing research at the University , with an emphasis on multi -disciplinary research opportunities aligned with broader needs of the Detroit region as well as broader societal challenges. This assessment is intended to inform and complement the ongoing strategic planning effort for the Univ ersity that President Wilson announced in early 2014. As a foundational analysis for understanding the position of Wayne State University's research enterprise , this assessment seeks to identify existing research competencies at the University as the building blocks for advancing future research opportunities. As defined by Hamel and Prahalad in Competing for the Future,1 a \"competence\" is a bundle of skills and technologies representing the sum of learning across individual skill sets and organizational units. A key premise of this effort is that rather than a \"field of dreams\" approach of simply picking \"hot\" areas of multi -disciplinary research , it makes more sense to consider the base of existing capabilities and excellence at Wayne State University f or identifying opportunity areas. The ultimate aim of this focus on research enhancement is to identify in consultation with University leaders, faculty and other key stakeholders three to five strategic R&D focus areas at Wayne State University to pursu e as well as offer bold but realistic strategic investment approaches for Wayne State University in these targeted opportunity areas . In this preliminary briefing report, a number of the key project objectives are addressed, including: What are the existing and emerging research competencies of Wayne State University ? How can Wayne State University best align these research competencies into strategic opportunity areas advancing multidisciplinary research as well as addressing broader indu stry and community needs in the Detroit region? To provide the independent and expert analysis to inform this assessment, Wayne State University retained the services of the Battelle Technology Partnership Practice (TPP). Battelle TPP is the technology -based economic development consulting arm of Battelle, the nation's largest nonprofit research and development organization, with more than 22,000 scientists, technologists, and specialists at more than 130 locations globally. Battelle TPP has experience wor king with leading research institutions \u2014 such as Carnegie Mellon University, Washington University, University of Arizona, and University of Southern California \u2014 but also has partnered with universities and university consortiums that have a commitment t o their region and local community, such as the University of Massachusetts Boston, Georgia Research Alliance, Arkansas Research Alliance , and the University of Connecticut. 1 Hamel and Prahalad, Competing for the Future, Harvard Business Press, 1994, pg 90 and 217. Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 2 | Page A. Key Findings Battelle's review of Wayne State's research enterprise suggests a current trajectory of decline despite a substantial base to build upon (with not only a high overall research volume but specific areas of research focus and scholarly activity ). The re is a critical need , and opportunity, for Wayne State University to transform its research enterprise in line with the emerging 21st century research paradigm of integrating use -inspired and translational research involving multi -disciplinary approaches grounded in addressing research challenges posed by Detroit's needs a nd broader societal challenges . Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, Battelle applied a rigorous approach that identified 29 specific research competencies at Wayne State University . These research competencies can be grouped into two major cat egories: 19 are in life sciences and biomedical fields and another 1 0 are found across engineering, physical sciences and social sciences. The assessment of research competencies at Wayne State University is the first step to advancing a more forward loo king and transformative research enhancement strategy aligned to the demands for research in the 21st century . Today, each of the research competencies makes significant contributions to the status and stature of Wayne State University in terms of research funding and scholarship output. Looking forward, these research competencies can serve as the building blocks - offering a critical mass of faculty expertise and research assets - for leading -edge multi -disciplinary research platforms at Wayne State Univ ersity. Ideal ly the multi -disciplinary research platforms to be advanced at Wayne State University would comprise: Leveraging of multiple major core competencies, especially those comprising world -class areas of strength at the University A line -of-sight to impacting Detroit Metro Area/Urban industry and community challenges and opportunities. A line -of-sight to impacting global challenges and opportunities. The line of sight to both local and global challenges and opportunities that leverage Wayne State University's existing research competencies fall into two broad categories: Societal Challenge Opportunities focusing on research directed towards societal and community needs involving basic inquiry and encouraging multi -disciplinary translational researc h directed toward advancing solutions to those identified needs. In today's world many of the most pressing societal challenges involve public health, climate change, education, growing disparities, food security, water resources and economic sustainabili ty. Technological Challenge Opportunities that deploy and leverage research to advance the development of transformative technologies that have the potential to re -envision existing products, create new markets, and possibly even foster new industries. Way ne State offers a number of more technologically -based research competencies that have the potential to link Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 3 | Page basic biological and physical research with engineering to create products and services for the future. Often these technological challenge opport unities are termed \"disruptive innovation\" in recognition of how they can offer new possibilities in how we live, communicate and work. B. Societal Challenges Informing Multi -Disciplinary Research Platform Opportunities Significant efforts and building blocks are in place to focus WSU broadly as a leading university focused on use -inspired and translational research challenges addressing \"urban transformations.\" This represents a broad theme and can be further delineated into specific platform areas. I t would involve university -wide efforts to address urban public health systems (environmental urban health issues, health disparities, re -engineering of hospitals and health systems), pressing medical problems (reproductive health, cardiovascular, traumati c brain injury, and cancer), urban behavioral health (child development, lifespan, workplace/societal violence), urban infrastructures (water, transportation) and urban educational systems. Being more specific, f ive areas of focus for multi -disciplinary r esearch platforms might include: Urban Child and Lifespan Development - Examining the challenges, characteristics and needs pertaining to children and adolescents in urban communities. This could encompass a diverse research universe, ranging from fundame ntal studies of gene expression and physiology through to studies of the social, family and environmental conditions impacting children , youth, and aging adults, and learning strategies . It may also include taking a holistic approach to the study of human health, environmental factors and changing physiology across the lifespan, seeking to elucidate childhood and adolescent antecedents to adult disease and changes in health and well -being from the fetus through old age.. Health Disparities - Working to ide ntify and characterize causes and typologies of health disparities and to develop solutions for limiting or eliminating major health disparities, especially in urban populations. Behavior and Behavioral Interventions - Researching the causes and effects of risk behaviors and developing and testing interventions. At Wayne State, this can span a spectrum from fundamental studies in behavioral neuroscience to the development of specific interventions in areas of strength for the University such as: maternal l ifestyles; drug abuse; STDs and infectious disease; violence; and obesity. Translational research can occur not just in the development of effective interventions, but also in the development of novel tools and technologies to facilitate interventions. Environmental Health , Prevention and Livable Communities - Working to identify and characterize elements of the environment that impact health, and to elucidate the relationships, and mechanisms of action, between environmental factors, disease morbidity, and health outcomes. This is becoming a reinvigorated area at Wayne State University with the recent CURES grant award. Looking forward, it offers opportunity for even more broad engagement with the university's strengths including establishing the gene -environment linkage drawing on the university's strengths in genetics and genomics including new diagnostics; prevention leveraging broader behavioral science applications for individuals; and broader community systems to monitor, educate and generate solu tions to deep -rooted environmental health challenges. Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 4 | Page Urban Revitalization and Development - Applying studies of the built environment, social forces, education, economics and other social -science oriented factors that support or hamper economic revitali zation , economic health and sustainability of large urban areas. It is evident that even among the five themes above there are trans -thematic linkages. For example: Disparities in socio -economic status, living environment, etc. have an impact on behavior Disparities in socio -economic status, living environment, etc. have an impact on child and lifespan development Environmental health factors impact child development, behavior and health across the lifespan Urban revitalization and development imp acts the environment, socio -economic conditions and other factors impacting upon the health -oriented themes. Behavior and behavioral interventions will impact incidence of risk behavior impacting child development and health across the lifespan. C. Tech nology Innovation Opportunities As noted previously, the review of core competencies at Wayne State University also identified a series of University strengths pertaining to specific technologies - including the development and application of technologies . In particular, Battelle's review suggests that there are opportunities to leverage Wayne State's technological capabilities to build robust technology -development platforms focused on: Imaging and Diagnostics for Precision Medicine - Wayne State Univers ity has a strong focus on medical imaging to build upon and a more emerging focus on diagnostics from the device to the development of clinical genetics/molecular diagnostics tests. Key resources to be tapped include the MR Center, the PET Center, the App lied Genomics Technology Center, the Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, and specific research programs that are growing in advanced nano -microfluidic devices that offer high content analysis to detect and analyze disease and in vivo molecular -gene tic imaging. These imaging and diagnostics technologies are the backbone for the future of medicine as more specific patient -oriented assessment and treatment plans are advanced. Wayne State University can help lead the way in disease diagnosis and treatm ent targeting from imaging to genomics Immunotherapies - Addressing the immune system to fight off infections is a well - developed approach for medical treatment, involving preventative vaccines, anti -viral drugs and antibiotics. Advances in modern biosci ences - increasing understanding of disease pathways and how the human immune system functions - are leading to a broader range of \"immunotherapies\" to induce, enhance or suppress the immune system for a wide range of diseases from infectious diseases, s uch as HIV/AIDS, to cancers , autoimmune and other chronic diseases. Wayne State University has active efforts involved in the development of cell -based cancer vaccines to improved approaches for antibiotic treatment of medically acquired infections, as w ell as a long standing focus on HIV disease management. Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 5 | Page Data to Decision Systems - This platform focuses on s ensors and sensor systems for real -time data gathering, analysis and decision -making connected to industrial systems applications , logistics and su pply chain, and health care patient monitoring. This multi -disciplinary platform brings together growing activities in large database informatics, wireless networking, systems modeling and simulation and sensor development taking place at Wayne State Univ ersity. Materials for Life Sciences Applications - Utilizing core competencies in chemistry, physics, materials science and biological sciences to develop biocompatible materials, films, coatings, degradable polymers, microparticles and other materials fo r in vivo biomedical applications. Linking Wayne State University's activities in nanotechnology and biomaterials with clinical applications is of critical value. Systems approach to manufacturability - A key challenge for advanced manufacturing is reducing the time for product development through enhanced design; reducing costs in manufacturing processing through less expensive materials, reduced number of parts and alternative fabrication using forming and joining techniques; and reducing component testing and qualification. This involves a wide range of engineering disciplines including u se of computer modeling and simulation , instrumentation for real -time data gathering and performance prediction and non -destructive testing . Of particular importan ce for the Detroit region is applying these systems approaches for manufacturability to the next -generation of automotive systems in specialized areas such as electric vehicle power and propulsion and vehicle safety systems.

The Importance of Research for WSU Research is an integral part of the character and operations of Wayne State University. Classified by the Carnegie Foundation as a RU/VH institution (Research University/Very High Research Activi ty), the highest category of research institution, Wayne State is placed within a prestige group of 108 U.S. institutions (the same peer category as the University of Michigan, John's Hopkins University, Cornell University, UCLA, and Penn State, to name a few). Being highly active in research carries intrinsic benefits for Wayne State University and its key stakeholders: Significant r esearch discoveries enhance the reputation of faculty and the University, serving to enhance the attractiveness of the institution to top quality domestic and international students . The performance of research serves as a practical training ground for und ergraduate and graduate student skills development. Engagement in research keeps faculty on the leading -edge of their discipline and enhances their teaching. Interdisciplinary research crosses traditional departmental boundaries and provides stimulus for the development of innovative trans -disciplinary education programs. Externally sponsored research provides funding to support faculty salaries and graduate student studies, and provides indirect cost support for university infrastructure and services. Research innovations may result in high value intellectual property. Research advancements can improve clinical practice within the academic medical center and bring leading -edge treatments to the clinic. The performance of research can be an important com ponent in the attraction of donor support and philanthropic gifts for the University. As Paul Johnson notes: Some research benefits are obvious - for example, benefits of an economic kind (a new product, technology or service), a social kind (increased kno wledge of relevance to policy makers), of an environmental kind (improved techniques to ensure sustainable food production), of a cultural kind (increased understanding of cultural values or social approaches) or of a health kind (a better understanding of the causes of medical conditions or better means of delivering health services). 2 2 The University of Western Australia - Paul Johnson, Vice Chancellor. Accessed online at: http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201203194542/vice -chancellor/importance -academic -research Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 7 | Page The framework of U.S. research in the 21st century is undergoing significant change. Through much of the 20th century, a typical university research approach , encouraged b y federal funding , focus ed on supporting either basic or applied research activities, which had very distinct goals in mind. The objective of basic research was intended to advance fundamental knowledge and the scientific theories in areas such as matter, physical processes, biological function , and human nature without regard to its practical applications . In contrast, applied research sought to apply well-understood basic research insights in making something work or in solving a practical problem. This lead to the notion of the \"ivory-tower\" where universities pursue a linear, sequential flow of discovery -based research followed by more applied development activities , often divorced from those involved in basic science and undertaken in concert with key industry, healthcare and government stakeholders. Often this \"iv ory tower\" focused on advancing research within specific academic disciplines and created a world of university research dominated by clea r delineations of departments. As James L. App legate explains, \"It is sometimes said that society has problems, while universities have departments.\"3 This dichotomy between basic and applied research is today very much in question with the recognition of \"use -inspired\" research . A powerful insight a dvanced by the late Donald Stokes, a faculty member at Princeton University, is that the linear continuum between basic and applied research is too simplistic and misses the more complex rise of \"use -inspired\" research in how basic science and technology a dvances interact. Stokes cited the model case of fundamental, basic research undertaken by Louis Pasteur as an example of \"use -inspired\" research with the intention of addressing a significant societal need that laid the foundation of microbiology nearly a century ago. What \"use -inspired\" research recognizes is that the relationship between basic science and technological change has been fundamentally altered in today's advanced knowledge -based age. Technology today is increasingly science -based, while science has been increasingly technology -based --with the choice of problems and the conduct of research often inspired by societal needs. An example is the work of the quantum -effects physicists who are probing the phenomena revealed by the miniaturization of semiconductors from the time of the transistor's discovery after World War II. 4 Instead of a split between basic and applied research, university research activities now function in a more complex interwe aving of basic, applied and use -inspired research.5 Perhaps no field of science is embracing this focus on use-inspired research and forcing the barriers between basic research and their applications to breakdown within universities than in biomedical rese arch. The fast pace of basic research advances in biotechnology is reshaping all aspects of 3 James L. Applegate, \"Engaged Graduate Education Seeing with New Eyes, Association of American Colleges and Universities, 2004, page 6. 4 See http://www.brookings.edu/res earch/books/1997/pasteur to learn more about Donald Stokes' assessment set out in its widely acclaimed book, Pasteur's Quadrant. 5 James Applegate, op. cit., page 5. Where does that technology come from?Pure basic researchUse-inspired basic researchPurely technologySource: Stokes, Pasteur's QuadrantPreliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 8 | Page biomedical development \u2014including the way we study medicine, discover and develop therapeutics, and diagnose and treat diseases and medical conditions for both hum ans and animals. At the same time, biomedical sciences development has a unique translational research requirement that calls for especially close connections between academic medical centers and industry . The connection between biomedical product advance ment and clinical care is not simply one of advancing a supplier and buyer relationship. Instead, there is a close and necessary interface of \"bench and bedside\" for biomedical innovation to move forward. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) explai ns that \"information flow at this interface is bi -directional, requiring close interaction between clinical and bench scientists.\"6 For instance, physician observations often provide insights into unmet medical needs or protocol refinements. Those involved in research and product development often find insights for applications from epidemiological studies and conversations with clinical practice professionals. Furthermore, advances in life sciences to treat human health require extensive clinical trials to ensure the safety and efficacy of new medical products, which in turn call for close collaborations between industry and clinicians. Along with the recognition of the importance of use -inspired research as a paradigm for 21st century university research, there is a growing recognition that traditional basic sciences are converging and deep strengths in single disciplines are insufficient to address basic research questions . As the Chronicle of Higher Education notes, \"[interdisciplinary] partnerships are proliferating in academe \u2014and slowly changing the face of science \u2014because they offer the best hope for answering some of the thorniest research subjects including climate change, biodiversity and cancer.\"7 World class university research now depends upon advancing multi -disciplinary basic science teams that recognize this convergence of sciences as necessary for addressing key research problems and applications development. Again biomedical development may be leading the way as it stands out as a convergence point for academic basic research in engineering, information technology, nanosciences, and communications/media. However, t his convergence is occurring across an array of scientific disciplines resulti ng in significant advancements, including , for example : nanotechnology improving how drugs can be delivered; while information technology unlocking a multitude of \"hidden\" insights , from analyzing the human genome to advances in digital technology, which a re improving how we diagnose diseases and monitor patients. Because of this convergence, the biomedical sciences offer enormous potential for linking basic research innovations across a wide range of other disciplines . As a result, there is a strong need f or bigger teams of scientists undertaking discovery and development. The implications of this changing 21st century research paradigm for Wayne State University are transformational - business as usual will result in the decline of the university's resear ch enterprise . Traditional academic schools and departments must become more agile in advancing collaboration or they risk holding back the quality and impact of Wayne State University's research enterprise. Key needs in Detroit , and broader societal ch allenges , are not simply focus areas for \"community 6 National Institutes of Health, Request for Applications for Regional Translational Rese arch Center Planning Grants, page 4, October 2004. 7 Jeffrey Brainard, \"U.S. Agencies Look to Interdisciplinary Science,\" Chronicle of Higher Education, June 14, 2002. Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 9 | Page engagement and service\" but need to be understood as defining challenging research questions to be studied. Wayne State University - in its multiple roles as a leading public research university, signific ant academic medical center and urban -serving university - must identify strategies for combining use- inspired research and translational research in transforming how it advances and enhances multi - disciplinary research strengths that bring together basic and applied research to have greater societal impact . A way to describe this 21st century research focus might be best stated as a \"concurrent strategy for research.\" Stephen Cross, Senior Vice President for Research at Georgia Tech explains their approach to research in the 21st century : While most universities pursue a linear, sequential flow of discovery -based research followed by occasional declaration of intellectual property and subsequent licensing or company formation/spin -out; Georgia Tech pursues a concurrent strategy centered on the core research areas ... selected because they are appropriate aggregations of core competencies represented in over 300 research centers and laboratories at Georgia Tech, their interdisciplinary and trans - disciplinary n ature, the alignment with strategic markets within the region, and the existence of industry partners interested in working with the Institute.8 It is this transformational view of 21st century university research that is guiding the analysis and identification of opportunity areas for Wayne State University. B. WSU in the Rankings While research is, and should be , regarded as a key element of the mission and operations of Wayne State University, it is also an important contributor to the stature of the University and its ranking among academic peers - globally , nationally and regionally. Rankings help to place the University w ithin a peer context, but it should also be noted that they also play a significant role in influencing key decision of undergraduate and graduate students (in terms of where to enroll), faculty (in terms of where to pursue their career), employers (in ter ms of where they recruit), and certain funders (in terms of where they approach for sponsoring research). 1. Global Rank ings At the present time, there is considerable room for improvement in Wayne State University's global rankings. Within the two most frequently cited academic ranking schemata for universities (the \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\" produced by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and \"THE World University Rankings\" produced by Times Higher Education), Wayne State ranks quite far down t he lists: In the Academic Ranking of World Universities, Wayne State has been placed in the 301 -400 ranking category since 2010 (having dropped in the rankings from the 201 -302 category in 2009 and previous years ). 8 Stephen E. Cross, \"Strategic Considerations in Leading an Innovation Ecosystem,\" GSTF Journal on Business Review, 2013, vol. 2, no. 3, 104 -109, Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 10 | Page In the Times ranking of world universitie s, Wayne State places in the 301 -350 ranking category. The Shanghai Jiao Tong University format provides a broad range of rankings across various metrics and these serve to further illustrate Wayne State's comparative position among global universities. S ome key points for Wayne State include: Certain broad subject fields stand -out for having a higher ranking than that for the University overall. Most notably, for 2013 these are: \"Natural Sciences and Mathematics\" ranked in the 151-200 category; and Pharmacy\" ranked at 151 -200, and \"Social Sciences\" similarly with a 151 -200 ranking). Among subject fields, \"Chemistry\" was ranked in the 76 -100 category until 2012, but dropped into the 101 -150 category for 2013. Mathematics and Physics ea ch rank in the 151 -200 category for 2013. Using \"Institutional Income\" (where Wayne State ranks 172nd among 780 ranked institutions , a percentile of 22 ) as a baseline metric for comparing the University across other Shanghai rankings serves to illustrate some strengths and weaknesses of the Wayne State research position: Table 1: Wayne State University Rankings and Percentiles in Metrics Reported within the Academic Ranking of World Universities Ranked Above Baseline of Institutional Income (percentile 22) Ranked Below Baseline of Institutional Income (percentile 22) Number of Doctoral Degree Awarded Ranked 53 among 805 institutions. (6.6 percentile) Institutional Income per Student Ranked 300 among 775 institutions. (38.7 percentile) Number of Academic Staff (Research Only) Ranked 86 among 575 institutions.(15 percentile) Total Amount of Research Income Ranked 203 among 744 institutions. (27.3 percentile) Number of Academic Staff (Teaching Related) Ranked 140 among 869 institutions. (16.1 percentile) Research Income per Academic Staff Ranked 312 among 554 institutions. (56.3 percentile) Total Number of Academic Staff Ranked 99 among 621 institutions. (15.9 percentile) Research Income from Industry Ranked 391 among 711 institutions. (55 percentile) Research Income from Public Sectors Ranked 162 among 753 institutions. (21.5 percentile) Number of Highly Cited Researchers Ranked 362 in the world. Number of SCIE and SSCI Papers Ranked 212 in the world. These data suggest that Wayne State compares favorably in terms of its overall size among global universities, and in attracting public sector funds for research. However, in terms of key research metrics such as overall research income, research income per student and per acade mic staff member , and research income from industry, Wayne State ranks in a lower percentile than in the baseline of overall institutional income. It is also important to note that Wayne State, in the Shanghai rankings , places at just 362nd in the categor y of \"highly cited researchers\".

Table 2 sets out Wayne State University's ranking for total research expenditures from all sources (federal, industry, state, philanthropy, etc.) . It is important to consider, these rankings across all research universities and the smaller subset of public research universities, especially given the difficult fiscal condition of states in recent years. Among all research universities, both private and public, Wayne State University 's rank ing in 2012 stood at 84th. This represents a significant drop in Wayne State University's ranking among all universities since 2007, whe n the univers ity was 73rd . When compared to just public research universities , Wayne State has slipped just four places in its national ranking from 2007 to 2012, from 50th to 54th. This reflects the fact that public research universities across the nation have faced a difficult budget environment with the severe cutbacks due to the recent recession. Table 2: Wayne State University Rankings in Federally Funded R&D and Total University Research Expenditures.

Research Funding Levels and Trends The National Science Foundation also tracks R&D expenditures at universities by R&D field. The NSF reported data for Wayne State are shown in Table 3. Overall R&D expenditures at Wayne State University ha ve grown slightly over the past six years (200 7-2012), ranging from a high of $259.9 million in 2011 to a low of $2 38.7 million in 20 07. A closer examination suggests the general variability of year - to-year growth in research exp enditures at Wayne State with this growing from 200 7 to 2009, declining from 2009 to 2010, growing from 2010 to 2011 and then declining from 2011 to 2012. Nationally, university research expenditures have continued to rise each year since 2007, though the growth in the most recent year, 2011 to 2012, was less than 1%. Still, as predicted by the Vice President for Research and others such as the Dean of the School of Medicine back in 2008 , the growth in research at Wayne State University has been weak10. Over the 9 Accessed online at: https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/profiles/site?method=view&fice=2329 Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 12 | Page period 2007 -2012, Wayne State's total research expenditures rose a mere 3% compared to 27.5% nationally. So over this period, Wayne State University's share of the U.S. in university research expenditures fell from 0.46% to 0.37%.

Figure 1: Wayne State University Percent of R&D Expenditures by Field 2012. Data=NSF. The other key R&D fields, in terms of R&D expenditures, include Physical Sciences and Engineering. In combination, the four categories of Medical Sciences, Other Life Sciences, Physical Sciences , and Engineering account for fully 90 percent of all R&D expenditures at Wayne State University. education; humanities; law; social work; visual and performing arts and other non-S&E fields not elsewhere classified. Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 14 | Page In terms of NSF reported research expenditures for Wayne State, the top 10 specific R &D fields are: 1. Medical Sciences ($137.9 million, 57% of research funding) 2. Biological Sciences ($32.7 million, 13.3%) 3. Chemistry ($10.9 million, 4.4%) 4. Life Sciences not elsewhere classified ($10.2 million, 4.1%) 5. Mechani cal Engineering ($5.7 million, 2.3%) Psychology million, 7. million, 2.1%) 8. Bioengineering/Biomedical Engineering ($4.9 million, 2%) 9. Physical Sciences not elsewhere classified ($4.4 million, 1.8%) 10. Computer Sciences ($3.6 million, 1.5% ) Taken together, these 10 R&D fields constitute $220.8 million (89.8 percent) of the total $245.9 million in 2012 research expenditures at Wayne State University. Several R&D fields have seen significant research expenditure gains over the 2008 -2012 repor ted time period. Among those increasing their resea rch expenditures by more than $5 00,000 over the five -years are: Civil Engineering (+$1.8 million); Mechanical Engineering (+$830,000); Computer Science (+$749,000), and Social Work (+$524,000). Battelle analysts also examined the Wayne State's 2012 research expenditure data for the R&D fields shown on Table 3 in comparison to overall national funding in those fields, and calculated a percent of total national research expenditures in the field co mprised by Wayne State. Overall, Wayne State University captures 0.37 percent of total academic research expenditures across all fields combined. In certain fields, however, Wayne State is capturing a significantly higher percentage, with these key field s including: Medical Sciences (0.68%) Chemistry (0.62%) Social Work (0.58%) Bioengineering/Biomedical engineering (0.56%) Visual and Performing Arts (0.48%) Psychology (0.45%). C. Academic Publications Publications activity is another key measure of schola rly activity. While publications are a common means by which researchers report findings from their grant -funded activities, it is also true that publications, when based on more theoretical work or pilot studies, can be critical in demonstrat ing a body of work to win research grants. Thom son Reuters tracks publications and associated citations in peer -reviewed journals for universities in 1 14 fields involving basic, applied, and clinical research. Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 15 | Page On an annual basis , since 200 7, Wayne State Univ ersity peer -reviewed publications rose from 1, 611 to 1,824 in 2013, representing an increase of 13.2%. This growth in peer -reviewed publications was slightly behind the U.S. average of 1 4.3% from 200 7 to 2013, resulting in a relatively flat share of U.S. publications for Wayne State University from 0.5 9% of all U.S. publications in 200 7 to 0.58% in 2013. It is interesting to note that Wayne State's competitive position relative to the U.S. in peer -reviewed publications is better than in research expenditu res. In research expenditures Wayne State have been growing over the 2007 to 2012 period, but has been well off national growth trends resulting in declining share and lower institutional rankings. The same is not true in peer -reviewed publications activ ity where Wayne State is growing comparable to the U.S. and maintaining its share of total US publications. This suggests that the weaknesses in research activity can be addressed with focused actions since the base of scholarly activity is still in plac e. To examine publication s activity across individual fields, it is important to review over a several -year period to avoid year -to-year variability. Between 2009 and 2014 (through March) the Thomson Reuters Current Contents Connect system lists 11,955 pu blications with a Wayne State or KCI author. This total represents 0.6 percent of all U.S. academic publications for that time period. Wayne State has 33 publishing areas in which its hare of U.S. publications considerably exceeds its overall average, an d seven publishing areas in which its publishing captures more than double the Wayne State average: Neurology (1.21%); Oncology (1.37%); Chemistry Pediatrics (1.53%); Physics (1.59%), and R eproductive Medicine (3.24%).

Looking across more than 2,400 academic journals/publications, Wayne State authors have a substantial presence across several key disciplines and thematic areas (Table 5). Notable evident strengths include: Perinatology, Reproductive Medic ine and Obstetrics and Gynecology Cancer Physics Neurology and Neuroscience Infectious Diseases Mathematics Psychology and Psychiatry Imaging and Instrumentation Therapeutics and Pharmacology Pediatrics, Child Development and Welfare.

It stands among the top 20 percent of universities in terms of size (as measured by number of academic staff), but is lower ranked in terms of its overall research funding and research output per staff mem ber. The University excels in the numb er of doctoral degrees awarded, but is fairly low ranked in terms of \"highly cited researchers\" , one measure of quality . Within the U.S. academic environment Wayne State is classified by the Carnegie Foundation as a RU/VH institution (Research University/Very High Research Activity), and this is re flected in the fact that, with Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 19 | Page over $245 million in NSF -report research expenditures in 2012, the University ranks among the top 100 university research institutions. Still , Wayne State is not keeping pace with the growth of U.S. university research and has shown variability in growth from year -to-year recently. It should be noted that Wayne State University incoming Presidents (in 2008, 2010 and 2013), and the Board of Go vernors, received memoranda and reports anticipating declining research volumes from the VP -Research office and the Dean of the School of Medicine. In contrast, peer -reviewed publications data suggests that scholarly activity remains active at Wayne State University and is growing at nearly the national rate. This suggests that Wayne State University still has a solid underpinning of faculty expertise to grow research in the years ahead, but requires strategic intervention to convert that faculty potenti al into more robust research growth. Within specific fields of research, t he research enterprise at Wayne State University is heavily oriented towards scientific and engineering disciplines - as is the case at most research -oriented universities that have a College of E ngineering and a Medical School. Life Sciences, especially Medical Sciences, are especially important to the University's overall position in national rankings, comprising almost three - quarters (73.5 percent) of research expenditures. In ad dition to engineering, other key contributors of research expenditures are found in the Physical Sciences (especially within Chemistry and Physics), in Psychology and in Computer Sciences. The same holds true in academic publishing, where the key areas of concentration for Wayne State (as measured by percent of U.S. overall publications volume in the discipline) are dominated by life science and physical science (physics) disciplines, with a small number of other significant areas including \"social work an d social policy\", \"language and linguistics\", \"mathematics \"AI robotics and automatic control\" and \"computer science engineering\".

Core Competency Assessment The critical need for strategic attention to Wayne State University's research enterprise is clear. The current trajectory is one of decline. Still it appears that there is a substantial base to build upon with not only a high ov erall research volume but specific areas of research focus. Advancing a more refined and rigorous assessment of W ayne State University's research competencies is a key underpinning to identifying how the university can transform its research enterprise in line with the emerging 21st century research paradigm of integrating use -inspired and translational research invo lving multi -disciplinary approaches grounded in research challenges posed by Detroit's needs and broader societal needs. Research core competencies at a university represent those fields with a critical mass of ongoing activity along with some measure of e xcellence. No one single source of information is sufficient to identify research core competencies. Rather, a variety of integrated and complementary analyses are required to help identify an institution's current position and strategic focus areas across a state's research base. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, Battelle applied a rigorous approach for assessing the research competencies of Wayne State (Figure 2). The key factors used by Battelle to identify research competencies at W ayne State University included: Cluster Analysis of Publications Activity: One key dimension of core competency analysis is to understand the focus and extent of activities through documented activities in peer -reviewed publications activity, a key measure of scholarly activity by faculty across the university. Through the use of a data mining software tool, OmniViz, it is possible to examine \"clusters\" of research areas through textual analysis of the abstracts from publi cations of faculty at Wayne State University. A key strength of this clustering approach is that there are no pre-determined categories, and instead the clustering of publications reflects the actual focus of research. By its nature, this type of analysis is more quantitative and enables the identification of leading research themes across the entire University research enterprise. Extent of Institutional Focus based on Field Interviews : It is also important to understand, probe and analyze the research programs on -the-ground, and to further inform the identification of areas of focus and emphasis through institutional based interviews with academic leaders and research faculty. This more qualitative field interview process can help reveal where the research Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 21 | Page enterprise at Wayne State University is going and not just where it has been as suggested by the cluster analysis of publications. Altogether over 50 university leaders and faculty and were interviewed by the Battelle project team. Presence of Major Grant Awards: Major research grants are an important indicator of research strength and often enable groups of faculty to collaborate. Battelle identified and coded major research grant awar ds of over $500,000 awarded to Wayne State University faculty from 2009 to 2013 relating to each research core competency area. These major grants came from a variety of sources from federal agencies, state government, foundations, industry and other coll aborating universities and non -profits. Publication Fields with a High Share of Total U.S. Publications : Beyond the cluster analysis of peer - reviewed publication abstracts, it is also useful to consider how well Wayne State University performs in identifi ed fields of research based on the types of publications. Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge has developed a set of 116 research fields that it tracks based on groupings of related journals that define a field of study. The share of the U.S. total provides an indication of having critical mass within a research field. Battelle identified 29 specific research competencies at Wayne State University based on this assessment approach. These research competencies can be grouped into two major categories: 19 are in life sciences and biomedical fields and another 1 0 are found across engineering, physical sciences and social sciences. Table 6 lists these 3 1 core competencies. Table 6: Research Competencies Identified by Assessment of Publication Clusters, Major G rants and Field Interviews Biomedical and Life Science-Related Engineering, Physical Sciences, and Social Science-Related Reproductive Medicine (OB/GYN - Perinatology/ Maternal-Fetal Medicine) Cancer Cardiovascular Basic and Behavioral Neuroscience Psychiatric/Neurological Disorders Child and Adolescent Health/Pediatrics Child and Family Development Environmental Health Sciences Health Care Services and Delivery/Health Care Systems (Incorporates Public health) Infections and Infectious Disease Management Metabolism, Endocrinology, Obesity and Diabetes Protein Sciences and Biochemistry Drug Abuse Genetics, Genomics and Molecular Biology Vision Research and Ophthalmology Biomedical Imaging Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Science Bioengineering Gerontology Physics Mathematics Big Data, Networking and Sensing Systems Industrial & Systems Engineering Social Work and Social Policy Materials Science and Nano-based Materials Automotive Research/ Next Generation Auto Economic, Urban and Labor Studies Education Environmental Engineering Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 22 | Page The breadth of these research competencies do vary substantially at Wayne State University. To provide a more refined assessment of each of the research competencies, Battelle has developed a rating system across the factors to help identify which of these research competencies stand out within and across the specific factors as following: Presence in Cluster Analysis of Grant Awards and Publications: Top Tier: Related meta -clusters contain 4 00 or more records Middle Tier: Related meta -clusters contain 200 -400records records No related meta -clusters Cross -Cutting: Presence across more than several -clusters Publications Level (2009 -2014 TD) Top Tier: >1% Share of Total US Publications Middle Tier: 0.7% to 1% Share of Total US Publications Lower Tier: 0.3% to 0.6% Share of Total US Publications and 50 or More Publications Bottom Tier: Less than 0.3% Share of Total US Publications - Not Available: No field listed Presence of Major Funded Grants: Reviews active major grant awards for programs or centers in excess of $500,000. Top Tier: Ten or more funded grants above $500,000 Middle Tier: Five to nine funded grants above $500,000 Lower Tier: One to four funded grants above $500,000 Bottom Tier: No funded grants above $500,000 Institutional Focus: Top Tier: Major centers or institutes at Wayne State, with major cluster of faculty researchers funded in the area Middle Tier: Well-established strength with a cluster of faculty researchers funded in the area Lower Tier: Growing strength with an existing presence and key plans to advance Bottom Tier: Emerging strength still at a nascent level. - No Presence The results from this rating of research competenc y factors do suggest a number of research competencies that stand out (see Table s 7 and 8 for the detailed ratings). Considering from the perspective of a \"balanced scorecard\" there are a few research competencies that a truly stand -outs earning top ratings across all factors, followed closely by a number of upper -tier research competencies and then a broader pack of resea rch competencies that either earn top ratings in a number of the factors or do well across nearly all of the factors (but fall short of top ratings): Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 23 | Page Only two research competencies are top rated across all fact ors: o Reproductive Medicine o Cancer Research Four research competencies are top -rated in 3 out of the 4 research competencies and so stand out as upper -tier research competencies: o Cardiovascular Research o Basic and Behavioral Neurosciences o Psychiatric and Neurological Disorders o Child and Adolescent Health Another ten of the research competencies fall into the \"middle tier\" research competencies with either top ratings in two out of the 4 factors or a middle rating in 3 out of the 4 factors: o Infections and I nfectious Disease Management o Metabolism, Endocrinology, Obesity and Diabetes o Genetics, Genomics and Molecular Biology o Vision Research o Biomedical Imaging o Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Science o Physics o Education Policy and Development o Environmental Health o Health Care Sciences and Delivery The remaining 1 3 research competencies all have aspects that stand out but are more uneven across all of the factors considered. Some of these areas are more emerging, while others are longer -standing areas of research fo cus, but have not risen to prominence. Together this portfolio of research competencies at Wayne State University offers a rich and diverse set of building blocks for strategies to enhance research, with an emphasis towards biomedical research , behavioral sciences and engineering for the life sciences .

From Research Competencies to Strategic Impactful Multi -Disciplinary Research Opportunities The assessment of research competencies at Wayne State University is the first step to advancing a more forward looking and transformative research enhancement str ategy aligned to the demands for research in the 21st century . Today, each of the research competencies makes significant contributions to the status and stature of Wayne State University in terms of research funding and scholarship output. Looking forwar d, these research competencies can serve as the building blocks - offering a critical mass of faculty expertise and research assets - for leading -edge multi -disciplinary research platforms at Wayne State University . A. Approach to Identifying Multi -Disciplina ry Research Platforms Ideal ly the multi -disciplinary research platforms to be advanced at Wayne State University would comprise: Leveraging of multiple major core competencies, especially those comprising world -class areas of strength at the University A line-of-sight to impacting Detroit Metro Area/Urban industry and community challenges and opportunities. A line -of-sight to impacting global challenges and opportunities. As Figure 3 illustrates, an ideal multi -disciplinary research initiative would lie at the intersection of these three elements - leveraging multiple Wayne State University research competencies to make significant progress with global and regional challenges and opportunities. Figure 3: Elements of Ideal Multidisciplinary Research Platforms at Wayne State University Leverage of WayneState Core CompetenciesGlobal Challenges and OpportunitiesDetroit MetroChallenges and Opportunities123Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 34 | Page The line of sight to both local and global challenges and opportunities that leverage Wayne State University's existing research competencies fall into two broad categories: Societal Challenge Opportunities focusing on research directed towards societal and community needs involving basic inquiry and encourag ing multi -disciplinary translational research directed toward advancing solutions to those identified needs. In today's world many of the most pressing societal challenges involve public health, climate change, education, growing disparities, food security , water resources and economic sustainability . Technolog ical Challenge Opportunities that deploy and leverage research to advance the development of transformative technologies that have the potential to re-envision existing products, create new markets, and possibly even foster new industries . Wayne State offers a number of more technologically -based research competencies that have the potential to link basic biological and physical research with engineering to create products and services for the future. Often these technological challenge opportunities are termed \"disruptive innovation\" in recognition of how they can of fer new possibilities in how we live, communicate and work. From the d etailed examination of the research competencies identified at Wayne State by the Battelle research team together with initial discussions and analysis of the Detroit region needs, a set of five societal challenge opportunities and five technological opportunities are proposed for discussion to identify the 3 to 5 multi -disciplinary research initiatives to examine for more detailed implementation planning . Societal Challenge s Informing M ulti-Disciplinary Research Platform Opportunities Significant efforts and building blocks in place to focus WSU broadly as a leading university focused on the use -inspired and translational research challenges focused on \"urban transformations.\" This repre sents a broad theme and can be further delineated into specific platform areas. It would involve university -wide efforts to address urban public health systems (environmental urban health issues, health disparities, re -engineering of hospitals and health systems), pressing medical problems (reproductive health, cardiovascular, traumatic brain injury, and cancer ), urban behavioral health (child development, lifespan, workplace/societal violence), urban infrastructures (water, transportation) and urban educa tional systems. Five more specific areas of focus for multi -disciplinary research platforms might include: Urban Child and Lifespan Development - Examining the challenges, characteristics and needs pertaining to children and adolescents in urban communiti es. This could encompass a diverse research universe, ranging from fundamental studies of gene expression and physiology through to studies of the social, family and environmental conditions impacting children , youth, and aging adults, and learning strate gies. . May also include taking a holistic approach to the study of human health , environmental factors and changing physiology across the lifespan, seeking to elucidate childhood and adolescent antecedents to adult disease and changes in health and well -being from the fetus through old age. . Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 35 | Page Health Disparities - Working to identify and characterize causes and typologies of health disparities and to develop solutions for limiting or eliminating major health disparities, espe cially in urban populations. Behavior and Behavioral Interventions - Researching the causes and effects of risk behaviors and developing and testing interventions. At Wayne State, this can span a spectrum from fundamental studies in behavioral neuroscienc e to the development of specific interventions in areas of strength for the University such as: maternal lifestyles; drug abuse; STDs and infectious disease; violence; and obesity. Translational research can occur not just in the development of effective interventions, but also in the development of novel tools and technologies to facilitate interventions. Environmental Health , Prevention and Livable Communities - Working to identify and characterize elements of the environment that impact health, and to elucidate the relationships, and mechanisms of action, between environmental factors, disease morbidity, and health outcomes. This is becoming a reinvigorated area at Wayne State University with the recent CURES grant award. Looking forward, it offers op portunity for even more broad engagement with the university's strengths including establishing the gene -environment linkage drawing on the university's strengths in genetics and genomics including new diagnostics; prevention leveraging broader behavioral science applications for individuals; and broader community systems to monitor, educate and generate solutions to deep -rooted environmental health challenges. Urban Revitalization and Development - Applying studies of the built environment, social forces , education, economics and other social -science oriented factors that support or hamper economic revitalization, economic health and sustainability of large urban areas. It is evident that even among the five themes above there are trans -thematic linkage s. For example: Disparities in socio -economic status, living environment, etc. have an impact on behavior Disparities in socio -economic status, living environment, etc. have an impact on child and lifespan development Environmental health factors impact c hild development, behavior and health across the lifespan Urban revitalization and development impacts the environment, socio -economic conditions and other factors impacting upon the health -oriented themes. Behavior and behavioral interventions will impact incidence of risk behavior impacting child development and health across the lifespan. Figure 4 provides a diagrammatic representation of the interconnectivity between and across platforms. It also suggests that there is an overarching theme of \"Urban an d Public Health\" that unifies the platforms emerging from many of Wayne State University's core competencies. Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 36 | Page Figure 4: Illustrative Interconnectivities within Societal Challenge Themes Technology Innovation Opportunities As noted previously, the review of core competencies at Wayne State University also identified a series of University strengths pertaining to specific technologies - including the development and application of technologies. In particular, Battelle's review suggests that there ar e opportunities to leverage Wayne State's technological capabilities to build robust technology -development platforms focused on: Imaging and Diagnostics for Precision Medicine - Wayne State University has a strong focus on medical imaging to build upon an d a more emerging focus on diagnostics from the device to the development of clinical genetics /molecular diagnostics test s. Key resources to be tapped include the MR Center, the PET Center, the Applied Genomics Technology Center, the Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, and specific research programs that are growing in advanced nano -microfluidic devices that offer high content analysis to detect and analyze disease and in vivo molecular -genetic imaging. These imaging and diagnostics technologies ar e the backbone for the future of medicine as more specific patient -oriented assessment and treatment plans are advanced. Wayne State University can help lead the way in d isease diagnosis and treatment targeting from imaging to genomics Over-Arching on environmentalhealthBehavioral impacts oneducation, workforceparticipation and other factors impacting development and livabilityPreliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 37 | Page Immunotherapies - Addressing the immune system to fight off infections is a well - developed approach for medical treatment, involving preventative vaccines, anti -viral drugs and antibiotics. Advances in modern biosciences - increasing understanding of disease pathways and h ow the human immune system functions - are leading to a broader range of \"immunotherapies\" to induce, enhance or suppress the immune system for a wide range of diseases from infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, to cancers , autoimmune and other chronic diseases. Wayne State University has active efforts involved in the development of cell -based cancer vaccines to improved approaches for antibiotic treatment of medically acquired infections, as well as a long standing focus on HIV disease management. Data to Decision Systems - This platform focuses on sensors and sensor systems for real -time data gathering, analysis and decision -making connected to industrial systems applications, logistics and supply chain, and health care patient monitoring. This mult i-disciplinary platform brings together growing activities in large database informatics, wireless networking, systems modeling and simulation and sensor development taking place at Wayne State University. Materials for Life Sciences Applications - Utiliz ing core competencies in chemistry, physics, materials science and biological sciences to develop biocompatible materials, films, coatings, degradable polymers, microparticles and other materials for in vivo biomedical applications. Linking Wayne State Un iversity's activities in nanotechnology and biomaterials with clinical applications is of critical value. Systems approach to manufacturability - A key challenge for advanced manufacturing is reducing the time for product development through enhanced desig n; reducing costs in manufacturing processing through less expensive materials, reduced number of parts and alternative fabrication using forming and joining techniques; and reducing component testing and qualification. This involves a wide range of engine ering disciplines including u se of computer modeling and simulation , instrumentation for real -time data gathering and performance prediction and non -destructive testing . Of particular importance for the Detroit region is applying these systems approaches f or manufacturability to the next -generation of automotive systems in specialized areas such as electric vehicle power and propulsion and vehicle safety systems.

Platform Details Urban Child and Lifespan Development General Description: This platform encompasses research that examines the challenges, characteristics and needs pertaining to children and adolescents in urban communities. This encompasses a diverse research universe, ranging from fundamental studies of gene expression and physiology thro ugh to studies of the social, family and environmental conditions impacting children and youth . Given the connectivity between childhood disease morbidity and childhood exposure to environmental factors to later stage adult -onset conditions, research in t his area has implications for health sciences across the lifespan. As such, this platform also includes taking a holistic approach to the study of human health, environmental factors and changing physiology across the lifespan, seeking to elucidate childh ood and adolescent antecedents to adult disease , and changes in health and well -being from fetus through old age. Potential Goals and Outcomes : Understanding of physiological and neuro -psychological development of the child under varying environmental, so ciological and psychological stressors and conditions. Understanding of risk factors and behaviors negatively impacting healthy development of children and adolescents. Researching periods of substantial change in the lifespan process (e.g. birth, infancy , adolescence, early adulthood, middle age, menopause, old age, etc.) Translation of research into policy and practice to positively impact child development and lifespan health. Regional Relevance The Detroit Metro region constitutes a rich research environment for studying the impact of a range of factors on child and lifespan development. Factors such as the impact of: race; socio -economic status; sors, etc. are diversely present in the Detroit Metro, and the development of solutions to pressing related challenges will have significant positive impacts on regional livability. The 2010 Right Start Michigan Report ranked Detroit as \"high risk\" due to the city's rank on indicators signaling a higher probability of developmental delays and health problems in the first 5 years of life. Major Existing Programs/Core Competency Areas : The Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute is a core center at Wayne State focused on this platform, coordinating multi -disciplinary research across a wide -range of factors affecting development, with a lifespan perspective (in collaboration with the Institute of Gerontology). . Focus areas in biological and environmental risk, deve lopmental changes, interventions research, and cognitive and functional neuroscience. Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 39 | Page The Perinatology Research Division also is directly relevant, with a research focus on understanding environmental and maternal health and associated behavior impacts on child health and development. Additional areas of strength identified through interviews and the core competency analysis include: Fundamental, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience and neuro -imaging Child and family development Social work Basic and clini cal psychology Genetics and genomics Population health Gerontology Nursing research in symptom management and pain management across the lifespan. Disparities General Description: This platform focuses on research to identify and characterize cause s and typologies of disparities having a negative impact on health and socio -economic status. It also works on develop ing solutions for limiting or eliminating major disparities , particularly those heavily impacting urban populations. Many inequities represent significant social justice issues for American society. Racial and ethnic health disparities, for example, are evident in areas such as infant mortality, cancer incidence and prevalence, diabetes, incidence of encountering violence -related trauma, etc. S imilarly, disparities are evident in educational attainment, pay, standard of living, and a range of metrics across race, ethnicity, gender and spatial dimensions. Concern about disparities is a thread running across multiple departments and research progr ams at Wayne State University. The immediate needs and challenges of the Detroit region serve as a local environment that facilitates inquiry in disparities, while the depth of regional challenges mean that solutions proven in Detroit will have far reachi ng implications for positive outcomes in other geographies. Potential Goals and Outcomes: Identification and characterization of disparities - their prevalence, demography and spatial characteristics. Understanding of the etiology of characterized dispari ties. Research to understand linkages between disparities and the emergence of increased disease morbidity in focused areas such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, immunological diseases, and infectious disease transmission. Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 40 | Page Research to understand linkages between disparities and societal challenges including: criminal behavior; workforce participation; educational attainment, migration, etc. Regional Relevance The economic and sociological challenges of the Detroit Metro region manifest themselves in a broad range of negative statistics indicative of disparities as a root cause or contributing factor. Just some indications of the regional relevance of the study of disparities include: The poverty rate in Wayne County is 20.5%, and is even higher in the City of Detroit (44%). African American's are demonstrating significantly higher rates of specific diseases, and experiencing higher mortality rates. In Detroit, the majority of families with children are headed by a single female - and, childre n living in female -headed families experience far higher rates of poverty than children in families headed by married couples or by single males. The death rate for Detroit children 1 to 14 years of age was nearly 6.5 times the state rate. For the 15 to 2 4 age cohort, Detroit's death rate was 2.2 times the state rate. Major Existing Programs/Core Competency Areas Research relating to health disparities, either as a public health issue or pertaining to individual diseases, is a k ey thrust of research in mu ltiple departments and programs across the College of Medicine. Population sciences research, prevention research, genetic and genomic analysis, health systems research, pediatric and perinatal research, infectious diseases research, and multiple other me dical arenas, have distinct bearing on health disparities and their effects. Work ranges from basic science inquiry as to physiological and genomic factors influencing disease risk among various subpopulations, through to detailed epidemiological studies and longitudinal studies of population groups. Key strengths identified at Wayne State include: Pediatric Prevention Center with 10 faculty focused in health disparities and intervention development. Active programs with community organizations and region al health workers and professionals. Cancer disparities research and associated population sciences. Population science and epidemiology (and it should be noted that this is also said to be a strength at the Henry Ford Health System) Active research in Hum anities and Social Sciences relating to relevant areas in: population change and demography; sources of disparities; criminal justice disparities; language and communications disparities; technological access, and education. Ranges and urban planning. Impact on disparities of h ealthcare delivery systems and health systems engineering . Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 41 | Page Environmental Health General Description: Environmental health focuses on the understanding the impact of the natural and built environment on human health. At Wayne State there is distinctive sand multidisciplinary work occurring to identify and characterize elements of the environment (especially the urban environment) that impact health, and to elucidate the relationships, and mechanisms of action, between environmental factors, disease morbidity, and health outcomes. Potential Go als and Outcomes: Research illuminating mechanisms of exposure to health -impacting stressors in the urban environment. Research leading to enhanced understanding of the negative impacts on health associated with complex urban industrial environment exposur es. Development and testing of interventions and solutions to environmental health challenges. Applied testing and predictive tools using biomarker identification and bio-repository data. Provision of information on risk. Regional Relevance: The urban and industrial environment of Detroit is \"encumbered with an overabundance of industrial and post -industrial environmental toxicants, socioeconomic strains, violence and housing decay.\"14 The Detroit environment represents a high -need environment for research into urban environmental health, and solutions derived from Detroit regional research will have likely implications for many North American and global industrial and post -industrial cities. Major Existing Programs/Core Competency Areas Institute of Envir onmental Health Sciences (IEHS ) and the associated Center for Urban Responses to Environmental Stressors (CURES) are key components of Wayne States core competency in environmental health. Here research is focused on the g oal of examining how chemical and non- chemical stressors in Detroit's urban environment affect the health of Detroit's vulnerable populations. Key interest groups formed within the CURES Center and its 55 affiliated researchers include: environmental modulators of the immune system; metabolism and metabolic disorders; gene -environment and cancer, and environmental stressors and mental health. Research at the Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute examin es exposures to toxins, drugs, community violence, etc. that affect child development and life -long health and wellbeing.

Karmanos Cancer Institute Behavior and Behavioral Interventions General Description: This platform encompasses multidisciplinary research into the causes and effects of human risk behaviors and in the development and testing of interventions. At Wayne State, this can span a spectrum from fundamental studies in behavioral ne uroscience to the development of specific interventions in areas of strength for the University such as: maternal lifestyles; drug abuse; STDs and infectious disease; violence; and obesity. Translational research can occur not just in the development of effective interventions, but also in the development of novel tools and technologies to facilitate interventions. Potential Goals and Outcomes: Enhanced fundamental insight into risk behaviors , information processing, decision making and pathways to effect ive behavioral interventions . The development and testing of potential behavioral interventions. Translation of effective interventions for risk behaviors into practice across the lifespan. Development of communications and educational technologies and inf ormational materials for effecting behavioral change. Regional Relevance: The Detroit Metro region faces severe challenges related to the negative impacts of human behavior. High incidence rates in terms of interpersonal violence, drug abuse, obesity, contraction of STD's, pre - term birth, educational drop -out, lack of workforce participation, etc. in Detroit are indicative of the need for, and relevance of, effective behavioral interventions. Major Existing Programs/Core Competency Areas : Behavioral and interventional science researchers are found across a range of departments and programs at Wayne State University. Behavioral neuroscience and cognitive behavioral therapy Psychology and Psychiatry Pediatrics, OB/GYN and Perinatology with an emphasis on m aternal risk behaviors (including alcohol and drug abuse) Pediatric Prevention Research Center, conducting behavioral, epidemiologic, biomedical, translational research in the areas of HIV/STD, substance use and misuse, and mental health in both Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 43 | Page domestic and international settings .

Criminology Social Work and Sociology Family Medicine Medical G enetics Psychology Education and the Center for School Heal th in Education Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute , focused on child and family behaviors and associated impacts. Urban Revitalization and Development General Description: There are multiple individual faculty and research teams at Wayne State University focused on a pplying studies of the built environment, social forces, education, economics and other social -science oriented factors that support or hamper urban revitalization and development of large urban areas. It should be noted, however, that Battell e notes that there is a lack of a comprehensive and coordinated focus at Wayne State on urban development, revitalization and sustainability - and that this platform represents a need against which some strengths may be applied - rather than a well -establi shed present cluster to build upon. The fact that Wayne State lacks a focus in regional economics, economic geography and other related disciplines hampers the regional relevance of the institution in terms of regional science and research -based solutions to urban sustainability issues in the Detroit Metro. Potential Goals and Outcomes: Strategies and actions to improve educational attainment Strategies and actions to enhance population workforce readiness, skills and labor force participation Urban and n eighborhood planning and adaptive re -use strategies Entrepreneurial development and research commercialization for new business cluster formation and cluster enhancement. Regional Relevance: The need for innovative, research -based solutions to urban development challenges is acute in the Detroit Metro area. Recent reporting by ABC News, for example, notes that the City of Detroit (now in bankruptcy) has $18 billion in unfunded liabilities and contains 80,000 abandoned buildings.15 The region has sign ificant problems in educational attainment (only 7% of City of Detroit eight graders are proficient in reading), in labor force participation and employment, and has the highest violent crime 15 ABC News.

Technology Platform Details Imaging and Diagnostics for Precision Medicine General Description: The advancement of imaging and molecular diagnostics technologies are ushering in a new era of precision medicine to esta blish more specific patient -oriented assessment and treatment approaches. According to the National Research Council, precision medicine \"does not literally mean the creation of drugs or medical devices that are unique to a patient, but rather the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Preventive or therapeutic interventi ons can then be concentrated on those who will benefit, sparing expense and side effects for those who will not.\" Potential Goals and Outcomes: Research to improve or develop advanced MR . PET and CT imaging technologies - and their combination - as well as the interpretation and analysis systems of these images. Advancing nano -based microfluidics -technology that offers high content information on specific diseases and its progression. Utilizing in vivo molecular -genetic imaging of reporter genes to provi de spatial and temporal information on cellular changes that occur during disease processes. Key advances are needed in the development of new probes and imaging agents, along with emerging new imaging technologies. Advancing new molecular diagnostic tests, leveraging availability of biobanks (including the Michigan neonatal biobank) and core genomic facilities at Wayne State University. Developing the combined approaches in disease identification across population groups by combining phenotype imaging with genomics. Establishing the bioinformatics capabilities to analyze and to interpret the large and complex data sets from across imaging and molecular diagnostics. Regional Relevance: The biomedical industry in the Tri -County Detroit Region (Wayne, O akland and Macomb counties) is one of the region's growing technology industry sectors and now employs over 5,000 workers across nearly 300 business establishments. While still an emerging industry for the Tri -County Detroit Region, it has outpaced U.S. g rowth over the economic recovery period of 2009 to 2012. In examining the presence of innovative emer ging and established companies (as identified through patents, SBIR awards, venture Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 46 | Page capital funding and MEDC awards), there are eight that seem to fall i nto a focus on imaging and diagnostics in the Tri -County Detroit Region - so not a very strong base of activity. As in other emerging bioscience industry clusters with major academic medical centers, much of the growth of innovation needs to be driven in c oncert with Wayne State University. Major Existing Programs/Core Competency Areas: This multi -disciplinary research platform builds upon several research competencies found at Wayne State University, including: Medical Imaging Genetics, Genomics and Molecular Biology Big Data, Networking and Sensor Systems Nano -based Materials Key research centers to be tapped include the MR Center, the PET Center, the Applied Genomics Technology Center, and the Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics. Among spec ific research programs ongoing including Bioengineering faculty involved in in -vivo molecular -genetic imaging, Chemistry and Pharmacy faculty involved in new imaging agents and Electrical and Computer Engineering faculty advancing nano -microfluidic devices that offer high content analysis to detect and analyze disease and Computer Science faculty involved in bioinformatics. Immunotherapies General Description: Addressing the immune system to fight off infections is a well -developed approach of medical treatment, involving preventative vaccines, anti -viral drugs and antibiotics. Advances in modern biosciences are increasing understanding of disease pathways and how the human immune system functions is giving way to a broader range of \"immunotherapies\" to induce, enhance or suppress the immune system for a wide range of diseases from infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and medically acquired infections, to cancers and chronic diseases. Potential Goals and Outcomes: Maintain a national leadership role in clinical research focused on cancer immunotherapies and antibiotic combination treatments - Wayne State has already garnered major grant funding for these clinical research efforts. Strengthen more applied and basic immunology research at Wayne State Univ ersity involving the development of more effective monoclonal antibodies and vaccine technologies, as well as Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 47 | Page advancing technologies to probe immune function, modulation and reconstitution. Create a stronger focus on animal model studies Establish strong er industry collaborations as immunotherapies are becoming an increasingly key focus of industry development for a wide range of diseases from cancers, influenza, hepatitis, and chronic diseases. Pursue emerging areas of science that can help leapfrog advances in immunotherapies, such as glycomics in which some major grants to Wayne State have already been awarded. A 2012 National Research Council Report on \"Transforming Glycoscience: A Roadmap fo r the Future,\" notes that glycans are particularly important in immunity as antibodies are glycosylated proteins and glycans can also be targets for antibody binding and generating immune responses. The National Research Council further notes that while g lycans are important in regulating immunity, they are also key actors in the constant battle between our cells and invading pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and parasites. Indeed glycans are the dominant molecules at this interface. Moreover, the g reat majority of biotherapeutics are produced as glycoproteins, and glycosylation - the process that attaches glycans to proteins -has significant impacts on efficacy and other features of biotherapeutics. Regional Relevance: Detroit's large underserved po pulation has many untreated diseases and so the focus on clinical research is an important public health benefit. Detroit has a high level of incidence of infectious diseases among its residents, including HIV, Hepatitis and even community -based staph infections . Cancer rates are also quite high in Detroit. Major Existing Programs/Core Competency Areas: This multi -disciplinary research platform builds upon several research competencies found at Wayne State University, including: Infections and Infectious Disease Management Cancer Research Key research center to be tapped is the Kormanos Cancer Center. The Karmanos' Immunotherapy Team is a national leader specializing in cancer immunotherapy treatment that combines cell - and antibody - based therapy, or bisp ecific antibody -targeted T cell immunotherapy in combination with initial chemotherapy to remove any remaining cancerous cells. Currently being used for Breast, Colon, Myeloma, Non -Hodgkin's Lymphoma and Pancreatic cancers. A key complement and collaborat or on the Immunotherapy Team is the Bone Marrow & Stem Cell Transplant Program. Among other specific research programs relevant to immunotherapies at Wayne State are the efforts of: the Immunology Department in molecular pathogenesis involving HIV and Herpes, with strong linkages to cancer immunotherapies; the Department of Infectio us Disease in advancing antibiotic treatments for resistant staph infections found in hospitals as well as treatment approaches for HIV; and the Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 48 | Page Department of Pharmacy Practice work on in -vitro modeling and simulation for combination antibiotics as well as the epidemiology of staph and other highly resistant infections. Data to Decisions General Description: Data to Decisions is a particular niche area of a significant transformation taking place today in how information technology impacts society, busine sses and our daily lives, commonly referred to as the new era of Big Data. The driver of Big Data is an unprecedented amount of digital information being generated from digitizing of records, on -line transactions, social networking and Internet searches. These massive data sets are too large and complex for humans to effectively extract useful information without the aid of computational tools.16 It is this continuous use of data to inform real -time decisions that stand out as perhaps the most transformati ve aspect of Big Data in our daily lives. Often referred to as Data to Decisions (D2D), it will require much more complex, emerging technologies in sensor and sensor systems to gather and process data. This continuous use of data to inform real -time deci sions poses significant systems engineering challenges, along with the need for improved data storage, processing and predictive analytic tools to interpret this complex unstructured data. Potential Goals and Outcomes: Digital medical innovation s - Advance the reshaping of health care delivery through the development and use of portable and wireless -enabled patient monitoring systems connected with advancements in biotechnology. Eric Topol, formerly head of Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute and n ow Chair of Innovative Medicine and Director of Scripps Translational Science Institute, provides examples of how the transformation of medicine through digital innovation taking place today builds upon increased understanding of how individual variations in genomics relates to diseases: \"Imagine a genomic panel that indicated a high risk of diabetes mellitus in an individual who therefore now uses a sensor that adheres to the skin that continuously tracks blood glucose levels, promoting lifestyle changes or facilitating tailored pharmacologic approaches. Or imagine a woman with an increased risk of breast cancer who can monitor herself for breast cancer using a smart phone with the capability of acquiring and transmitting ultrasound images. Even today, r emote wireless monitoring can be used to detect previously undiagnosed yet important heart rhythm disorders in individuals who carry DNA markers associated with increased risk for atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachyarrhythmia.\"17 16 Rick Robinson, \"Taming Big Data,\" Research Horizons, Georgia Institute of Technology, Fall '12-Winter '13, pg 6 17 Eric J. Topol, Transforming Medicine via Digital Innovation, Translational Medicine, January 27, 2010, Vol 2 Issue 16, pages 2 -3 Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 49 | Page Industrial Systems and Facilities -- With the increased use of robotics in manufacturing it is critical to create the control and monitoring systems that better sense how equipment is operating and provide prognostics on when components are failing and when product quality is s lipping through real-time monitoring through remote communications to a service center. Financial industry applications of Data to Decisions will include addressing the complexity of securing financial transactions as the use of mobile payment through smart phone applications grow. At the same time, financial services firms are increasingly competing on their ability to make real -time decisions on providing credit to individuals, companies, and other fin ancial institutions, and managing large investment portfolios, which call for use of predictive analytics in making real -time business decisions. Transportation and Distribution - Advance logistics and s upply chain management through the use of sensors t o track and monitor cargo. Of particular importance is ensuring temperature, pressure, humidity and other environmental controls for perishable cargo. Regional Relevance: Data to Decisions will have broad range of uses to industries located in the Tri-County Detroit Region . One of the largest growing industry sectors in the Tri -County Region is hospitals and medical c enters, with an employment base of over 96,000 workers and a growth rate of 5% since 2009. Finding new ways to deliver care more cost effec tively utilizing digital innovations will be important competitive differentiator in the years ahead. Industrial automation also stands out as both a potential user and innovator in the Tri -County Detroit Region. With the large presence of automotive -related manufacturing operations remaining in the Tri - County Detroit region it is not surprising that there is also a healthy industrial automation sector in the region, employing 5,591 workers and growing by 14.8% from 2009 to 2012, as the auto industry rebou nded. Sixteen industrial automation companies in the region were identified as active in innovation activities as measured by patents, SBIR funding, venture funding and local sources. Major Existing Programs/Core Competency Areas: This multi -disciplinary research platform builds upon several research competencies found at Wayne State University, including: Big Data, Networking and Sensor Systems Health Care Services and Delivery Industrial and Systems Engineering Next Generation Auto This multi -disciplina ry platform brings together growing activities in large database informatics (Computer Science), wireless networking (Computer Sciences), systems modeling and simulation (Industrial and Systems Engineering), sensor development (Electrical and Computer Engi neering) and data visualization (Arts) taking place at Wayne State University. Preliminary Draft for Review - Not Edited or Formatted 50 | Page Materials for Life Sciences Applications General Description: Biomaterials are naturally -derived (e.g., blood vessel or a protein such as collagen) or synthetic (e.g., polymer, metal, ceramic or composite ) materials that are used in a wide range of medical devices, implants, transplants, surgical procedures, wound healing, skin treatments, drug delivery, dental replacements and other medical application s. What differentiates a biomaterial from other materials is its ability not to trigger adverse reactions while being able to withstand corrosion from being in contact with bodily fluids and tissues. Potential Goals and Outcomes: Advancing new targeted drug delivery approaches using polymer -based nanoparticles. Advancing implantable biomaterials for tissue engineering and wound healing Advancing new diagnostic and analytical devices using stem cell platforms Regional Relevance: Within the emerging and growing biomedical industry in the Tri -County Detroit Region, there number of innovative therapeutic and medical device companies that may be able to benefit from advancements in biomaterials. Still there are only a handful of such companies in the Tri -County Detroit Region that are identified based on innovation activities as measured by patent, SBIR funding, VC funding and local Michigan sources. As in other emerging bioscience industry clusters with major academic medical centers , much of the growth of innovation needs to be driven in concert with Wayne State University. Major Existing Programs/Core Competency Areas: This multi -disciplinary research platform builds upon several research competencies found at Wayne State University , including: Nano -based materials Cancer Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences Cancer Research and possibly Other Disease Research Areas Wayne State University does not have a dedicated materials research center for life sciences applications.
