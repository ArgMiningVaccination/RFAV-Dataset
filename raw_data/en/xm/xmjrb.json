Massachusetts Biologic Laboratories (MBL) The MBL established in 1894 to serve the public health interests of the commonwealth. From 1959 to 1996, the MBL was administered by the Massachusetts Health Research Institu te, a private, non-profit that was under contract to the De- partment of Public Health to run vaccine development programs there. In 1997, control of the MBL was transferred to the University of Massachusetts. The MBL is one of only a few publicly operated, FDA-licensed manufacturer of v accines and other biologic products in the USA. The existence of the labs has helped to position Massachusetts as a leader in immunization, has afforded the state greater access to needed vaccines, and has saved the state millions by relying less on co mmercially produced vaccines. Meanwhile, the MBL has introduced vaccine s not only to prevent diphtheria, pertu ssis, tetanus and other diseases into general statewide-use but also to emerge business partnerships in India and China.
