Time delays and lags Time delays occur in our reporting of cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and vaccinations due to processing and reporting differences between data sources including laboratory capacities and case reporting processes. The data reporting is incomplete until we receive 90% of the cases, hospitalizations, or deaths for the time-period reported on the dashboard. Vaccinations When health care providers in Washington state (including hospitals, pharmacies, and primary care providers) give a patient a COVID-19 vaccine, they are required to report it to the Washington State Immunization Information System (WAIIS) within 24 hours. Most vaccination data should appear on this dashboard within seven days of vaccine administration. Health care providers started reporting COVID-19 vaccines to the WAIIS on December 11, 2020, when the first Emergency Use Authorization was given. The J&J (Janssen)vaccine was added to the list of authorized vaccines in February 2021. The first doses of J&J (Janssen) were administered March 3, 2021, and data for these doses was included on the dashboard beginning March 10, 2021. As of October 2021, Emergency Use Authorization was given for children 5 through 11 years of age. As of June 2022, Emergency Use Authorization was given for children 6 months through 4 years of age. The \"doses given\" data on the dashboard includes all COVID-19 vaccinations reported to the WAIIS since the first Emergency Use Authorization was given (December 11, 2020). Any doses given to people less than 6 months of age will be excluded from data on people vaccinated. This is based on the current minimum approved age for vaccination and will be adjusted as the approved age expands. Number of infections Public health experts agree that the true number of people who have been infected with COVID-19 in Washington greatly exceeds those who have received positive, laboratory-confirmed results. It is very difficult to know exactly how many people in Washington have been infected to date, since a significant number of people with COVID-19 experience only mild illness or no symptoms. Cases Effective December 16, 2020, case and hospitalization counts include both confirmed and probable cases. Confirmed cases include individuals who received a positive molecular test result for COVID-19. Probable cases are individuals who received a positive antigen test result for COVID-19 from a provider, but no positive molecular test result. Individuals who receive a positive antigen test from a self-administered, over-the-counter antigen test (home test) are considered \"Suspected\" cases and not included in the case count per CDC reporting guidelines. Our dashboard includes antigen test results dating back to June 2020, when these were first reported in Washington. Case Rate 14-day The trend in case rate refers to the trend in 14-day rate of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population. It is calculated by dividing the number of cases with a specimen collection date during a 14-day period by the state population (county population is used in county view) and multiplying by 100,000: Case Rate 7-day The trend in case rate refers to the trend in 7-day rate of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population. It is calculated by dividing the number of cases with a specimen collection date during a 7-day period by the state population (county population is used in county view) and multiplying by 100,000: Hospitalizations A \"COVID-19 hospitalization\" is a Washington resident who is listed in the Washington Disease Reporting System (WDRS) or the Rapid Health Information Network (RHINO) records as hospitalized with confirmed or probable COVID-19. Beginning April 30, 2021, DOH began using data entered into WDRS to assign the earliest hospital admission date. If an investigator doesn't provide a hospital admission date, we will use the earliest hospital admission date from RHINO. Prior to April 30, 2021, we assigned the earliest hospital admission date whether it originated from WDRS or RHINO. Hospitalization Rate The trend in hospitalization rate refers to the trend in the 7-day rate of new COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 population. It is calculated by dividing the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations with a hospital admission date within a 7-day period by the state population (county population is used in county view) and multiplying by 100,000: Deaths Death counts on our dashboard reflect deaths in our official vital records database, which is called the Washington Health and Life Events System (WHALES). If COVID-19 is later ruled out as the official cause of death, we will remove these deaths from our dashboard. We do not report preliminary death information recorded in other systems. Death Rate The trend in death rate refers to the trend in 7-day rate of new COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population. It is calculated by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths with a death date within a 7-day period by the state population (county population is used in county view) and multiplying by 100,000: Hospital Use WA HEALTH is Washington's Healthcare, Emergency and Logistics Tracking Hub. Washington's acute care hospitals use WA HEALTH to submit information to DOH regarding resources available to care for Washington residents. WA HEALTH is a dynamic data collection system that receives data from hospitals daily as information is available. We consider the most recent 6 days of data to be \"incomplete\" because it takes up to 6 days for data collection, quality checks, and reporting. Dashboard metrics are attributed to the geographic location of facilities, not a patient's area of residence. Hospital Admission Rate The hospital admission rate refers to the trend in the 7-day rate of new COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 population. It is calculated by dividing the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations with a hospital admission date within a 7-day period by the state population (region and ACH population is used with Slicers) and multiplying by 100,000: Percent Hospital Occupancy The percent hospital occupancy metric refers to the 7-day average percent occupancy of all adult staffed acute care beds. This metric is calculated by adding the number of adult acute care hospital beds in use during the most recent 7-day period, then dividing by the sum of staffed adult acute care beds during the same period, and multiplying by 100: Percent Hospital Occupancy by COVID-19 Patients The percent hospital occupancy metric refers to the average percent of adults in the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 over a 7-day period. This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of adults with COVID-19 in the hospital by the total number of staffed adult acute care hospital beds, and multiplying by 100: Percent ICU Occupancy The percent ICU occupancy metric refers to the average percent occupancy of all ICU-staffed beds during a 7-day period. This metric is calculated by adding the number of adult ICU beds in use during the most recent 7-day period, then dividing by the sum of staffed adult ICU beds during the same period, and multiplying by 100: Percent ICU Occupancy by COVID-19 Patients The percent ICU COVID-19 occupancy metric refers to the average percent of adults in the ICU with confirmed COVID-19 over a 7-day period. This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of adults with COVID-19 in the ICU by the total number of adult ICU beds and multiplying by 100: Population On September 15, 2021, DOH changed the way we calculate the age-specific rates of cases and hospitalizations shown on the Demographics tab. These rates were calculated by taking the total number of cases and hospitalizations reported in each age range and dividing by the total state population. To increase accuracy, we now divide by the number of Washingtonians in each age range. This change resulted in minor changes to existing trends and a one-time, artificial increase in the rates reported across all age groups. Metrics calculated using population denominators may have changed slightly April 12, 2021. On that date, DOH used Washington Office of Financial Management 2020 estimates to update population estimates on the DOH dashboards ( [April 1 official population estimates "}
