Dissipated my fatigue nicely I have used the Pure Energy oil for 2+ years now and it my staple and signature scent. I have thrown out all perfumes and this is my go to daily! My friends beg for my secret and of course I share....The added benefit of fatigue fighting and the uplifting effect is my favorite A couple drops on my wrist and inhaled gives me a soothing lift & it smells lovely, I had some from the sample kit - used it all and purchased 2 regular size - one for myself and for a gift. Love this brand. I was really excited for the product but the smell is horrible. I attempted to reach out to return the product for a refund but never heard back. Very disappointed. This stuff smells amazing but is 100% not for all skin types as it claims. This broke me out in the worst rash I have ever experienced after using just 2 drops. I was miserable for an entire week and my skin is still recovering. I recommend buying from other retailers with a better return policy such as madewell "}
