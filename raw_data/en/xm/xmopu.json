[[1]](#_note-1) X Research source [[2]](#_note-2) X Research source [ It causes severe bloody sickness and diarrhea, which causes rapid dehydration and dangerous blood loss. Without treatment, the condition is usually fatal, and even with supportive care, the puppy can be left with damaged heart muscles or permanent damage to the gut wall. Instead of the heartbreak and expense of treating a puppy for parvo, prevention is the best option. ](#) Steps Preventing Parvo In Dogs - 1Vaccinate your puppy. Vaccination is the best way to prevent parvo. There are effective vaccines available, and puppies should start injections from six to eight weeks of age. The puppy should have repeat doses every three to four weeks until around 16 weeks of age. [[3]](#_note-3)X Research source - You have to repeat the doses because protective antibodies from the mother may cancel out some of the vaccine's effectiveness. Repeat doses are needed to counteract this effect. - 2Get booster shots. The initial vaccine is only the first step in prevention. To keep your dog protected, you should continue to get booster shots. A booster needs to be given 12 months after the initial vaccine. Then, your dog needs a booster every three years thereafter. [[4]](#_note-4)X Research source - Protocols do vary, depending on the vaccine brand and clinic protocols. - 3Minimize the risk of contamination. Puppies are especially at risk for parvovirus because their immune systems are immature, so even they have started vaccination, it is crucial to avoid areas of contamination or possible contamination. To minimize contamination, don't put the puppy down on the ground in public places or visit dog parks until after the final vaccine. [[5]](#_note-5)X Research source - Keep your puppy away from any dog feces since the virus is spread through feces. - When visiting the vet clinic for the vaccinations, keep the puppy in your arms in the waiting area and do not put him on the ground. - 4Take precautions when parvo is in your area. If you know that there is a parvo outbreak in your area, you should take special precautions around your puppy. Change out of your shoes at the door so that you don't bring the infection inside the house when you walk. Wash your hands before handling your puppy in case you have any parvo on you. [[6]](#_note-6)X Research source - You may even choose to change your clothes, especially if you have touched other dogs. - 5Disinfect any potential contaminated areas. If one of your dogs has parvo, or other dogs have entered your yard, take precautions. If you have a yard where other unknown dogs roam, consider keeping your puppy in a small, controlled area until the last vaccine or wash the yard down with diluted bleach. If one of your dogs has parvo, disinfect any area he has been with a diluted bleach solution. [[7]](#_note-7)X Research source - When washing floors, let the diluted bleach sit for 10 minutes before rinsing. - Wash out food and water bowls with diluted bleach if they may have been exposed to the parvo virus. Make sure to rinse the bowls well with running water. - Most common household disinfectants do not deactivate parvo. Instead, use a bleach solution of ten parts water to one part bleach. [[8]](#_note-8)X Research source - 6Limit the puppy's exposure to other dogs. You should keep your puppy away from other dogs until he has at least the first two vaccinations. This helps protect the puppy from getting the virus from dogs that may show no symptoms of the virus. [[9]](#_note-9)X Research source Advertisement - It is helpful to socialize the puppy with other dogs, but chose those dogs carefully. Make sure you know the dog well and that the other dog is fit and healthy. It is crucial that the other dog be up-to-date with vaccinations. [[10]](#_note-10)X Research source - It is then a calculated risk where you are weighing the benefits of socialization with the slim chance of infection. Depending on how well you know the dog and trust they are well, the risk should be slim. However, do not mix with unvaccinated dogs if your puppy is not yet fully protected. - It is helpful to socialize the puppy with other dogs, but chose those dogs carefully. Make sure you know the dog well and that the other dog is fit and healthy. It is crucial that the other dog be up-to-date with vaccinations. Recognize the Symptoms of Parvovirus - 1Notice any lethargy. The initial sign for parvovirus may be lack of energy as the dog develops a fever. This means your dog may stop participating in normal activities or lay around more. [[11]](#_note-11)X Research source - Your dog may stop eating, which leads to loss fo energy. - Lethargy may also be a symptom for other diseases, so you should pay attention to other symptoms or take your dog to the vet. - 2Look for bloody diarrhea. The main symptom of parvo is explosive bloody diarrhea. The diarrhea is very liquid and may be red in color. It will also have a foul smell. [[12]](#_note-12)X Research source - The feces may be dark in color instead of red. - 3Check for vomiting. The dog will have trouble keeping anything in his system, so vomiting is another sign of the parvovirus. The dog may drink to try and replace fluids but this usually comes straight back up again. The vomiting is usually second to the diarrhea. [[13]](#_note-13)X Research source Advertisement - Dogs go downhill very quickly with this condition and can die from blood loss and dehydration in 24 to 48 hour. Dealing With Parvovirus - 1Take your dog to the vet immediately. Parvovirus is a quick acting virus that can lead to death. If you suspect your dog has parvovirus, seek urgent veterinary attention immediately. A dog may die within two to three days if he has parvo. With early treatment, your dog has a greater chance of making it. [[14]](#_note-14)X Research source - Make sure to alert the clinician about your suspicions before taking the dog inside so that they can make provisions to quarantine the animal so that it doesn't pose a risk to other patients. - 2Treat the virus with supportive care. Since parvo is a virus, there is no cure for it. Instead, the puppy is treated with supportive care. This includes IV fluids to help with dehydration, controlling the diarrhea and vomiting, and treating any secondary infections. [[15]](#_note-15)X Research source - Often, the dog has to stay in the hospital for up to a week. - 3Learn how parvovirus is spread. The virus spreads from dog to dog via infected feces. However, the virus is extremely hardy and can survive extreme heat, cold, and drying out. Even many household disinfectants do not touch it. [[16]](#_note-16)X Research source [This means infection can be spread indirectly by the virus passed by a sick dog many months ago, with the feces now washed away by rain but the virus still lingers.](#) Advertisement - In addition, the virus can stick to shoes and be walked into a house, or clothing may become contaminated when a person accidentally comes into contact with parvovirus. Thus you can pass parvo to your puppy without direct contact with another dog. Expert Q&A [Add New Question] - QuestionCan a healthy dog carry parvo?Dogs that have recovered from parvovirus continue to excrete virus in their feces for three months afterwards. Thus, a healthy 'recovered' dog is a carrier. The virus needs to invade the gut in order to be shed, so a dog that has not been ill is unlikely to be a carrier. - QuestionCan a dog with parvo be cured?Parvovirus is a virus and, as such, there is no 'cure' or medication that kills it. Treatment is supportive, meaning the patient is given intravenous fluids to replace lost fluid and prevent organ failure, drugs against nausea, and antibiotics if there's a risk of secondary bacterial infections developing. - QuestionCan a dog survive parvo?Young puppies are most vulnerable because of their immature immune system and lack of robustness. Adult dogs may survive if given adequate supportive care to prevent dehydration and stop their organs from shutting down. But even then, survival rates are low.
