For cancer patients, acupuncture is commonly recommended as a possible way to help manage symptoms and side effects such as muscle and joint pain, headaches, nausea, dry mouth, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, stress and anxiety. Although further research is required, acupuncture has also showed promise in accessing nerve pathways that can regulate a variety of immune disorders, from rheumatoid arthritis to Crohn's disease. How can acupuncture help you strengthen your immune system? Acupuncture involves penetrating the skin in a variety of strategic immune system points, using small needles. This process stimulates the brain into thinking the body is being attacked by an exterior threat (such as a virus or bacteria, for example). Your brain then orders the release of T-cells and white blood cells to help fight off this \"intruder\", essentially bolstering your body's natural immune defence system. Given that acupuncture can trigger this immune response to secrete antibodies and fight off antigens, this technique also serves as a potential measure to help you avoid becoming sick in the first place.
