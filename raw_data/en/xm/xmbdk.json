Amore Natural Energy Bar I have loved Amore Bars from the beginning. Easy to eat, easy to pick and give me the boost that I need. I love also that they are completely natural. Thank you so much for the lovely review, Hilary. I have recently ridden a three day long gravel bike adventure, and these bars have kept me energized, and very satisfied indeed. I really like their unique flavour and the fact that the ingredients are natural. Well done! I'm training for an ultra marathon and been trying out food to keep me going without upsetting my stomach, and the Amore bars are perfect. Not only that but they're really tasty too, so a treat I look forward to on my long runs. "}
