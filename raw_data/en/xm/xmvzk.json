General PA information Overview For drugs that require PA on Point of Sale (POS) claims: A new evaluation feature of the Oregon Medicaid POS system, DUR Plus, reviews incoming POS claims and issues PA when the drug meets appropriate clinical criteria. For drugs that do not pass DUR Plus review, pharmacies must contact th e prescribing provider, who then requests PA from the Oregon Pharmacy Call Center. Drugs requiring PA - See OAR 410 -121-0040 for more information The Division may require PA for individual drugs and categories of drugs to ensure that the drugs prescribed are indicated for conditions funded by OHP and consistent with the Prioritized List of Health Services and its corresponding treatment guidelines (see OAR 410 -141-0480 and 410-141-0520). DUR Plus review The Oregon Medicaid POS system initially evaluates in coming pharmacy claims for basic edits and audits. If the drug on the claim requires PA and requires DUR Plus evaluation, the claim passes through a series of clinical criteria rules to determine whether DUR Plus can issue PA and allow dispensing the drug to the client. DUR Plus checks the current drug claim as well as the client's medical and claims history for the appropriate criteria. If suitable criteria are found, a prior authorization will be systematically created, applied to the claim, and the c laim will be paid. This interactive process occurs with no processing delays and no administrative work for the pharmacy or prescribing provider. If all criteria are not met, the claim will be denied, and PA will be required. The prescriber will be respo nsible for requesting PA, using procedures outlined in OAR 410 - 121-0060. Oregon Medicaid PA Criteria 9 July 1, 2021 How to request PA For prescriptions covered by the client's coordinated care organization (CCO) , contact the CCO for their PA procedures.

Patients on antiarrhythmics, beta -blockers or calcium channel blockers or with risk factors for bradycardia (h/o MI, age >70 yrs., electrolyte disorder, hypothyroidism) may be more prone to deve lopment of symptomatic bradycardia and should be initiated on fingolimod, ozanimod, ponesimod, or siponimod with caution. A cardiology evaluation should be performed before considering treatment. An ophthalmology evaluation should be repeated 3 -4 months after fingolimod, ozanimod, ponesimod, or siponimod initiation with subsequent evaluations based on clinical symptoms. Patients starting on siponimod therapy must be tested for CYP2C9 variants to genotype before starting contraindicated in patients with a CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype. The recommended maintenance dosage in patients with a CYP2C9*1/*3 or *2/*3 genotype is 1 mg. The recommended maintenance dosage in all other patients is 2 mg. Teriflunomide Clinical Notes: Before starting teriflunomide, screen patients for latent tuberculosis infection with a TB skin test, exclude pregnancy, confirm use of reliable contraception in individuals of childbearing potential, check blood pressure, and obtain a complete blood cell count within the 6 months prior to starting therapy. Instruct patients to report symptoms of infection and obtain serum transaminase and bilirubin levels within the 6 months prior to starting therapy. After starting teriflunomide, mon itor ALT levels at least monthly for 6 months. Consider additional ALT monitoring when teriflunomide is given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Consider stopping teriflunomide if serum transaminase levels increase (>3 -times the upper limit of norma l). Monitor serum transaminase and bilirubin particularly in patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction. Discontinue teriflunomide and start accelerated elimination in those with suspected teriflunomide -induced liver injury and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized. Check blood pressure periodically and manage hypertension. Check serum potassium level in teriflunomide -treated patients with hyperkalemia symptoms or acute renal failure. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Monitor for hematologic toxicity when switching from teriflunomide to another agent with a known potential for hematologic suppression because systemic exposure to both agents will decrease a patient's white blood cell count. In the clinical trials the mean lymphocyte counts decreased by approximately 30% during the first year of treatment with dimethyl fumarate and then remained stable. The incidence of infections (60% vs. 58%) and serious infections (2% vs. 2%) was similar in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate or placebo, respectively. There was no increased incidence of serious infections observed in patients with lymphocyte c ounts <0.8 x103 cells/mm3 (equivalent to <0.8 cells/\u00b5L). A transient increase in mean eosinophil counts was seen during the first 2 months of therapy. Fumarate salts should be held if the WBC falls below 2 x103 cells/mm3 or the lymphocyte count is below 0.5 x103 cells/mm3 (cells/\u00b5L) and permanently discontinued if the WBC did not increase to over 2 x103 cells/mm3 or lymphocyte count increased to over 0.5 x103 cells/mm3 after 4 weeks of withholding therapy. Patients should have a CBC with differential monitored every 6 to 12 months. Cladribine Clinical Notes: Cladribine is not recommended for use in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) because of its safety profile. Prior to initiating cladribine follow standard cancer screening guidelines because of the risk of malignancies. Oregon Medicaid PA Criteria 236 July 1, 2021 Obtain a CBC with differential including lymphocyte count. Lymphocytes must be: within normal limits before initiating the first treatment course and at least 800 cells per microliter before initiating the second treatment course. If nec essary, delay the second treatment course for up to 6 months to allow for recovery of lymphocytes to at least 800 cells per microliter. If this recovery takes more than 6 months, the patient should not receive further treatment with cladribine. Infection screening: exclude HIV infection, perform TB and hepatitis screening. Evaluate for active infection; consider a delay in cladribine treatment until any acute infection is fully controlled. Administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelin es prior to starting cladribine. Administer live - attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting cladribine. Obtain a baseline (within 3 months) magnetic resonance imaging prior to the first treatment course because of the risk of for documented nutritional deficiency or diagnosis associated with nutritional deficiency (e.g., Cystic Fibrosis) Prenatal and pediatric multivitamins are not subject to this policy.

Clinical Notes: How to Discontinue Opioids. Adapted from the following guidelines on opioid prescribing: The Washington State Interagency Guideline on Prescribing Opioids for Pain; Agency Medical Directors' Group, June 2015. Available at http://www.agencymeddirectors.wa.gov /Files/2015AMDGOpioidGuideline.pdf . Selecting the optimal timing and approach to tapering depends on multiple factors. The decision to taper should be based on shared decision making between the patient and provider based on risks and benefits of therapy. Involving the patient in the decision to taper helps establish trust with the patient, ensures patient -focused tapering, incorporates the patient's values into the taper plan, provides education on the risks of opioid use, and establishes realisti c goals and expectations. Avoid insisting on opioid tapering or discontinuation when opioid use may be warranted. The rate of opioid taper should be based primarily on safety considerations, and special attention is needed for patients on high dose opioids or with significant long -term use, as too rapid a taper may precipitate withdrawal symptoms or drug -seeking behavior. In addition, behavioral issues or physical withdrawal symptoms can be a major obstacle during an opioid taper. Patients who feel overwhel med or desperate may try to convince the provider to abandon the taper. Although there are no methods for preventing behavioral issues during taper, strategies implemented at the beginning of chronic opioid therapy such as setting clear expectations, allow ing for pauses during the taper, and development of an exit strategy are most likely to prevent later behavioral problems if a taper becomes necessary. 1. Consider sequential tapers for patients who are on chronic benzodiazepines and opioids. Coordinate c are with other prescribers (e.g. psychiatrist) as necessary. In general, taper off opioids first, then the benzodiazepines. 2. Do not use ultra -rapid detoxification or antagonist -induced withdrawal under heavy ketamine or midazolam). 3. Establish an individualized rate of taper based on safety considerations and patient history. Common tapers have a dose reduction of 5% to 20% per month: a. Assess for substance use disorder and transition to appropriate medication assisted treatment if there is diversion or non -medical use, b. Rapid taper (over a 2 to 3 week period) if the patient has had a severe adverse outcome such as overdose or substance use disorder, or c. Slow taper for patients with no acute safety concerns. May consider starting with a taper of 10% of the original dose per month and assess the patient's functional and pain status at each visit. 4. Adjust the rate, intensity, and duration of the taper accordi ng to the patient's response (e.g. emergence of opioid withdrawal symptoms (see Table below)). Oregon Medicaid PA Criteria 277 July 1, 2021 5. Watch for signs of unmasked mental health disorders (e.g. depression, PTSD, panic disorder) during taper, especially in patients on prolonged or high dose opi oids. Consult with specialists to facilitate a safe and effective taper. Use validated tools to assess conditions. 6. Consider the following factors when making a decision to continue, pause or discontinue the taper plan: a. Assess the patient behaviors th at may be suggestive of a substance use disorder b. Address increased pain with use of non -opioid pharmacological and non -pharmacological options. c. Evaluate patient for mental health disorders. d. If the dose was tapered due to safety risk, once the dos e has been lowered to an acceptable level of risk with no addiction behavior(s) present, consider maintaining at the established lower dose if there is a clinically meaningful improvement in function, reduced pain and no serious adverse outcomes. 7. Do not reverse the taper; it must be unidirectional. The rate may be slowed or paused while monitoring for and managing withdrawal symptoms. 8. Increase the taper rate when opioid doses reach a low level (e.g. <15 mg/day MED), since formulations of opioids may n ot be available to allow smaller decreases. 9. Use non -benzodiazepine adjunctive agents to treat opioid abstinence syndrome (withdrawal) if needed. Unlike benzodiazepine withdrawal, opioid withdrawal symptoms are rarely medically serious, although they ma y be extremely unpleasant. Symptoms of mild opioid withdrawal may persist for 6 months after opioids have been discontinued (see Table below). 10. Refer to a crisis intervention system if a patient expresses serious suicidal ideation with plan or intent, o r transfer to an emergency room where the patient can be closely monitored. 11. Do not start or resume opioids or benzodiazepines once they have been discontinued, as they may trigger drug cravings and a return to use. Counsel the patient on the increased risk of overdose with abrupt return to a previously prescribed higher dose. Provide opioid overdose education and consider offering naloxone. 12. Consider inpatient withdrawal management if the taper is poorly tolerated. Symptoms and Treatment of Opioid Withdrawal.
