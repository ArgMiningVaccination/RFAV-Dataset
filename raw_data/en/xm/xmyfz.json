Synthesize principles from the research, highlighting ethical problems typical for entrepreneurs such as conflicts of interests, bribes, and patent/copyright infringement. Create a written code of ethics for the proposed business. 8) Explore the growth of social responsibility in capitalism by reviewing news reports and journal articles about social entrepreneurship ventures. Create an informative text to define the term \"conscious capitalism\" and summarize how it is a growing business model for entrepreneurship. Business Plan Development 9) Prepare a presentation identifying at least three government or private agencies available for assistance to entrepreneurs and small business owners, to encompass services offered by each agency. 10) Write, review, and revise a business plan for a potential entrepreneurial endeavor. The plan should include: an executive summary, company description, vision and mission Page 2 statements, industry overview, market analysis, marketing plan, operations plan, and financial plan. 11) Construct a market research project for the identified endeavor. Develop a research question, then determine, develop and conduct the appropriate research (primary research, secondary research, scientific method) to achieve the desired a nalysis. Summarize results of the research in recommendations in the business plan overview and market analysis. 12) Develop a customer profile with a detailed description of the potential target market for the proposed business based on demographic, geograp hic, psychographic, and behavioral information. Assess the viability of the profile for the proposed business by determining number of customers, reachability, and desire for product. Include these findings in the business plan's overview and market analysis section. Marketing 13) Prepare a brief outline of the proposed business' marketing plan including pricing, promotion, and service/product planning in the development of customer relationships. Explain multiple pricing, promotions, and product selection strategies for the propose d business. Summarize how one or all of these strategies can directly impact a customer's experience. 14) Enhance the marketing plan with a proposal for attracting early adopters to the proposed product or service.

Make a claim about the correct proportions of the marketing mix, supporting claim with data and evidence and addressing countercla im(s) about alternative methods. Operations 15) Compare and contrast the different ownership options for the proposed business. Identify the legal regulations required for the type of ownership selected. Prepare a sample partnership agreement or Doing Business As (DBA) document that outlines the divisio n of assets, rights, and responsibilities of each owner. 16) Investigate channel management and distribution methods for the proposed product or service. Research possible manufacturers; study distribution considerations of the product or service, (including transportation, storage, handling, and packaging for products or staffing, training, and evaluation for services); cite justification for the channel management decisions, such as cost -saving benefits to the business' bottom line. Prepare a sample servic e contract with a potential vendor for first year of business. Financials 17) Examine startup costs, operating costs, overhead, and personal expenses by researching and developing a financial statement based on models obtained from public records or Page 3 busines s websites.

Projected Balance Sheet d. Cash Flow Create a pro forma projection of a. - d. above. Establish length of view, i.e. first year, 3 -year, 5-year timelines. Generate a breakeven analysis. 18) Investigate potential sources of startup capital needed to secure financing (e.g. equity financing, personal savings, angel investors, partnerships, venture capitalists, and debt financing) and list adv antages and disadvantages of each. Visit or research local banks, entrepreneurship centers, or incubators to determine the most common reasons investors decline to invest in order to ensure business plan addresses typical concerns. 19) Prepare a \"pitch\" to explain the business to a potential investor, including breakdown of necessary financing and requested terms. Justify requested funding, using financial figures with appropriate data and evidence from coursework. Evaluate potential fin ancing offers that may be different from requested terms. Based on the evaluation, choose to either accept or not accept the proposal. For example, based on startup costs needed and future valuation, pitch a request for $100,000 to a potential investor in return for a 25% stake in the proposed business. Then evaluate whether or not to accept a counteroffer of a proposed $100,000 for a 50% stake.
