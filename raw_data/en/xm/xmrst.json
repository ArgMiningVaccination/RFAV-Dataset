UC IRVINE - 2006-2007INTRODUCTION THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA Robert C. Dynes, President The University of California (UC) was chartered as the State's only Land Grant College in 1868. Throughout its first decades, the Uni\u00ad versity's development was strongly influenced by leading educa\u00ad tors and scholars from various parts of the country. Supported by the State and many generous benefactors, the University was responsive to the needs of California while progressing on a steady climb toward eminence in academic and scientific achievement. Today the University system includes 10 campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Among the campuses there are five medical schools, three law schools, a school of veteri\u00ad nary medicine, and professional schools of business administration, education, engineering, oceanography, and many others. The collec\u00ad tions of the more than 100 UC libraries are surpassed in size on the American continent only by the Library of Congress collection. The University is one of the world's largest and most renowned centers of higher education and includes more than 208,000 stu\u00ad dents. The faculty is internationally noted for its distinguished academic achievements, and a total of 49 faculty and researchers associated with the University have won Nobel Prizes. National Academy of Sciences membership numbers 353, greater than any other college or university system. One of the University's unique resources is its roster of University Professors. This title is reserved for certain distinguished faculty members who are rec\u00ad ognized internationally as scholars and teachers. The University maintains a variety of research facilities, agricul\u00ad tural field stations, and extension centers in more than 100 loca\u00ad tions throughout California. Public services include medical and dental clinics, information services for agricultural and urban pop\u00ad ulations, and a broad program of continuing education. Information about UC's teaching, research, and public service mission is avail\u00ad able online\u00b7 at http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/. Governance. Under the State constitution, governance of the Uni\u00ad versity is entrusted to The Board of Regents. The Regents appoint the President of the University, and with the President's \u00b7advice, the officers of the University. Authority in academic matters is delegated by The Regents to the Academic Senate, which consists of faculty and certain administra\u00ad tive officers. The Academic Senate determines academic policy for the University as a whole, sets conditions for admission and the granting of degrees, authorizes and supervises courses and curric\u00ad ula, and advises the University administration on faculty appoint\u00ad ments, promotions, and budgets. Additionally, each campus has a divisional Academic Senate. The President is executive head of the total institution. Each cam\u00ad pus has a Chancellor as its chief administrative officer. Students participate in policy-making at both the campus and University\u00ad wide levels. The names of University Professors, Regents, Officers, and Chan\u00ad cellors are presented in the Appendix. THE IRVINE CAMPUS Michael V. Drake, M.D., Chancellor The University of California, Irvine (UCI) opened in 1965 with 116 faculty and 1,589 students. Since then, UCI programs, faculty il!ld graduates have achieved distinction in virtually every discipline. Two Nobel Prizes in 1995 for founding faculty F. Sherwood Row\u00ad land in Chemistry and the late Frederick Reines in Physics helped to secure UCI's position among the leading American research uni\u00ad versities. In 2004, Irwin A. Rose, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, became UCI's third Nobel Laureate (chemistry). UCI has been ranked prominently along with much older universities for excellence in the arts and humanities, earth system science, management, social sciences, technology, and information systems. For quality of educational experience and caliber of faculty, UCI consistently ranks among the nation's best public universities, and among the top 50 universities overall. Election to the American Association of Universities (AAU), a group of 62 of the most dis\u00ad tinguished research institutions, is another indication of UCI's stature in the academic community. As a research university, UCI challenges students at every level, both academically and personally. While research is critical to graduate education, the research environment also opens up new educational experiences for undergraduates. Students have access to faculty at the forefront of their fields, and they also have oppor\u00ad tunities to participate directly in faculty research projects. In addi\u00ad tion, to empower students for the future in an information-focused society, UCI has integrated computer technology throughout the curriculum and campus life. UCI is committed to the discovery and transmission of knowledge. It makes available to its 24,980 students (19,930 undergraduate, 130 post-baccalaureate, 3,770 graduate, and 1,150 health science students and medical residents and fellows) the education, skills, and credentials which provide the basis for lifelong personal and professional growth. UCI's education and research missions are fulfilled in its academic units, which are described briefly below, and in its formal research units, which are. described in the Office of Research section later in this Catalogue. The Claire Trevor School of the Arts teaches the creative as well as the academic and critical dimensions of the arts. It is concerned with the vitality of the arts in society. Faculty energies are directed toward the refinement, enhancement, and encouragement of stu\u00ad dents' artistic and creative talents and toward the development of the students' understanding of related theory and history. The School offers programs which emphasize extensive studio and workshop experiences, essential theoretical and historical back\u00ad ground studies, and exercises in criticism. There are 1,100 students in the School, including 970 undergraduate and 130 graduate. The School of Biological Sciences is one of the campus' larger academic units, with 3,830 students (3,550 undergraduate and 280 graduate). Faculty research areas include neural plasticity and behavior (which in part encompasses the development of the ner\u00ad vous system, memory, response to injury, and degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's); the nature of cell-cell interactions; pattern formation; the elucidation of ecological conditions and evo\u00ad lutionary histories that have been the driving forces in organism design and functional diversity; tl)e organization and expression of genes; biomolecular structure; molecular pathogenesis; human mitochondrial genetics; and cell biology. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007FROM THE CHANCELLOR Welcome to the University of California, Irvine. As a UC student, you have access to resources that extend not only across our campus, but throughout our state and beyond.

Drake, M.D. Chancellor 5 UC IRVINE - 2006-20076 UCI 2006-07 Introduction The Paul Merage School of Business faculty research and teach in traditional management fields including organizational behavior, information technology, finance, marketing, international business, \u00b7 managerial economics, new ventures, accounting, decision sci\u00ad ences, operations management, strategy, public policy, and health care management. They also focus on how the implementation and integration of technology, combined with information management, are changing the way business is conducted. The School has 220 students in the M.B.A. and Ph.D. programs; 630 in the Executive M.B.A., Health Care Executive M.B.A., and Fully Employed M.B.A. Programs; and 430 in the undergraduate minors ih Man- agement and Accounting. / The Department of Education, with 270 students, offers graduate degree programs and credential programs for current and prospec\u00ad tive teachers and administrators in California's public elementary and secondary schools, as well as an undergraduate minor in Edu\u00ad cational Studies. At the heart of the Department's mission is a commitment to understand and deliver the kinds of educational transformations needed in today's world, a theme implemented in five main areas of research: language, literacy, and culture; learn\u00ad ing, instruction, and assessment; teacher education and develop\u00ad ment; information and communication technologies in education; and educational policy and leadership and their social contexts. The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, with 2,760 students (2,080 undergraduate, 680 graduate), focuses on the analysis and design of physical systems applying modern scientific principles to the development of technology for society. The major research dis\u00ad ciplines are aerospace, biochemical, biomedical, chemical, civil, computer, electrical, environmental, materials science, and mechanical engineering. Research areas include biochemical and bioreactor engineering, earthquake engineering, water resources, transportation, parallel and distributed computer systems, intelli\u00ad gent systems and neural networks, image and signal processing, opto-electronic devices and materials, high-frequency devices and systems, integrated micro and nanoscale systems, fuel cell technol\u00ad ogy, fluid mechanics, combustion and jet propulsion, materials pro\u00ad cessing, robotics, and modern control theory. The School of Humanities faculty have been repeatedly honored for their teaching and scholarly excellence. Included in the faculty's more than 100 research specialties are literary criticism, film studies, philosophical analysis, historical inquiry, art history, and East Asian languages and literatures. The faculty also participate in programs that cut across disciplinary boundaries such as African American Studies, Asian American Studies, Latin American Studies, Religious Studies, and Women's Studies. At the core ofthe educational mis\u00ad sion of the humanities is the goal of imparting to students critical tools of analysis, ways of seeing, knowing, explaining, describing, and understanding, that will allow them to comprehend the world around them. The School has 2,570 students, including 2,150 under\u00ad graduate and 420 graduate. The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) has 1,310 students (1,030 undergraduate and 280 graduate). Faculty are actively engaged in research and teaching in the design of algorithms and data structures; embedded computer systems; net\u00ad worked and distributed and urban crisis response; Internet and ubiquitous computing; advanced technology for software and information systems; com\u00ad puter-supported cooperative work and human-computer interaction; digital arts and embodied interaction; managerial and social aspects of computing technology; and statistics and statistical theory. Interdisciplinary Studies programs provide students with oppor\u00ad tunities to pursue subject areas which derive from the interaction of different disciplines such as Chicana/Latino Studies, Computer Science and Engineering, History and Philosophy of Science, and Transportation Science. The School of Physical Sciences has a student body of 1,430 (980 undergraduate and 450 graduate). Researchers in the School are conducting investigations in atmospheric chemistry (including the discovery of the adverse impact of human-made chlorofluorocar\u00ad bon compounds on the earth's ozone layer), biogeochemistry and climate, synthetic chemistry, laser spectroscopy, condensed matter physics, elementary particle physics, plasma physics, and pure and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. The School of Social Ecology, a multidisciplinary unit established in 1970, is unique to UCI. The School's central objectives are the application of scientific methods to the analysis and resolution of societal problems, and the development of theory and knowledge pertinent to social, behavioral, environmental, and legal phenom\u00ad ena. Among issues of long-standing interest are crime and justice in society, social influences on human development over the life cycle, and the effects of the physical environment on health and behavior. There are 2,920 students in the School, including 2,660 undergraduate and 260 graduate. The School of Social Sciences, with 4,870 students (4,550 under\u00ad graduate and 320 graduate), is the largest academic unit at UCI. The faculty, many of whom are nationally recognized, have exper\u00ad tise in a wide range of specific social science topics, for example, the mathematical modeling of perception and cognitive processes; the economic analysis of transportation; the examination of the impact of society's political system on its economy; the study of social structure and values in different cultures through a rigorous scientific methodology; and the exploration of authority structures and inequality in society. The College of Health Sciences includes the newly recognized Pro\u00ad grams in Nursing Science, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Public Health, and the well-established School of Medicine. The School of Medicine has 1,150 students (370 medical, 620 resident-physicians and fellows, and 160 graduate) and offers one of the country's largest residency training opportunities in primary care and internal medicine and houses some of the most advanced equipment in med\u00ad ical imaging and laser medicine available in the world. The faculty conduct innovative research in the following areas of emphasis: bioethics, biomolecular structure, oncology, cardiovascular and pul\u00ad monary diseases, geriatric medicine, immunology, molecular and human genetics, the neurosciences, and perinatology. Academic Goals UCI offers programs designed to provide students with a founda\u00ad tion on which to continue developing their intellectual, aesthetic, and moral capacities. Programs and curricula are based on the belief that a student's collective University experience should pro\u00ad vide understanding and insight which are the basis for an intellec\u00ad tual identity and lifelong learning. An important aspect of UCI's educational approach is the emphasis placed on student involvement in independent study, research, and the creative process as a complement to classroom study. Indepen\u00ad dent research in laboratories, field study, participation in writing workshops, and in arts productions are normal elements of the UCI experience. In many departments, special programs and courses which involve students in original research and creative activities are integrated into the curriculum. UCI provides an atmosphere conducive to creative work and scholarship at all levels, to exploring the accumulated knowledge of humanity, and to developing new knowledge through basic and applied research. Along with these objectives, UCI has a serious UC IRVINE - 2006-2007commitment to public service. The campus generates research expertise which may be applied to regional and national social issues, and provides humanistic understanding of the problems fac\u00ad ing society. Academic Structure UCI's instruction and research programs focus on fundamental areas of knowledge, and at the same time provide for interdiscipli\u00ad nary and professional study through the Claire Trevor School of the Arts, School of Biological Sciences, The Paul Merage School of Business, Department of Education, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, School of Humanities, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, Interdisciplinary Studies, School of Physical Sciences, School of Social Ecology, School of Social Sciences, and the College of Health Sciences. The Office of Academic Affairs has responsibility for all programs of instruction and research. Along with the Office of Graduate\u00b7 Studies and the Division of Undergraduate Education, Academic Affairs reports directly to the Executive Vice Chancellor. Matters of educational policy, including approval of programs, courses, and grades, are the responsibility of the Irvine Division of the Acade\u00ad mic Senate. UCI Student Affairs supports the University's academic mission from outreach to alumni participation. Student Affairs offers com\u00ad prehensive programs and services to advance co-curricular learn\u00ad ing, foster student leadership, enhance the quality of student life, and promote the general welfare of the campus community. The Division of Undergraduate Education provides leadership in developing policies and programs for the improvement of under\u00ad graduate education in such areas as general education, retention, advising, curricular development, undergraduate scholarship and research activities, international education, academic internship, grant proposals, assessment, improvement of instruction, and improvement of instructional space. Undergraduate Education also administers programs and services affecting undergraduate educa\u00ad tion which require campus-level attention and coordination and which do not come under the direct authority of the heads of acad\u00ad emic units or the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. The Office of Graduate Studies serves as the campuswide advocate for the advancement of graduate education and oversees all mas\u00ad ter's and doctoral programs, postdoctoral training programs, and the postbaccalaureate teacher credential program. The Office of Graduate Studies has a leadership role with UCI's academic units and provides implementation guidelines and procedures related to University policy as it affects the interconnected aspects of gradu\u00ad ate student education, including admissions, student financial .\u00b7 support, enrollment and registration, academic standards, require\u00ad ments for graduate degree programs, student services, and diversity programs. Accreditation UCI is a member of the Western Association of Schools and Col\u00ad leges (WASC). The campus is fully accredited by the Senior Com\u00ad mission of WASC.

The Office is located in 437 Administration Building; telephone (949) 824-7256. The Campus Setting UCI's location combines the cultural and economic resources of an urban area with access to Southern California's spectrum of recre\u00ad ational, scenic, and entertainment venues. Fifty miles south of Los Angeles, five miles from the Pacific Ocean, and nestled in 1,489 acres of coastal foothills, UCI lies amid rapidly growing residential communities and the dynamic international business environment of Orange County and the sur\u00ad rounding region. The famed sailing and surfing beaches of Newport, Laguna, and Huntington are a short bike ride from campus, while hiking trails, desert camping, or mountain resorts for snow boarding and skiing are within two-hour's travel distance from Irvine. The campus itself is a natural arboretum of native species, as well as trees and shrubs from all over the world. Adjacent to the campus, the San Joaquin Marsh serves as a natural classroom or peaceful refuge, with trails for viewing the rich diversity of wildlife. A full roster of intramural sports and recreation events helps to fill the daily fitness needs of students, along with UCI's Anteater Recreation Center. This 92,000-square foot, state-of-the-art facility includes a pool, gymnasiums, racquetball courts, weight room, and jogging track. UCI is also an NCAA Division I campus that com\u00ad petes in men's and women's intercollegiate athletics. Across Campus Drive, and linked by a pedestrian bridge, an area of shops and restaurants also features a movie theatre complex, post office, and other services. Complementing UCI on-campus sports and cultural events throughout the year is the vigorous Orange County arts and entertainment environment. It offers every\u00ad thing from small venues for bands and performers to galleries, museums, the Irvine Barclay Theater, Orange County Performing Arts Center, and Pacific Symphony. And within a one-to two-hour drive are the metropolitan attractions of Los Angeles and San Diego. With plenty of land for growth, UCI is building to accommodate greater numbers of students, as well as to provide the most updated classroom and laboratory space. Current projects include the six\u00ad story Bren Hall/Computer Sciences 3; Biological Sciences Unit 3, with planned research, office, and lecture hall space; renovation and expansion of the Student Center and Cross-Cultural Center; and expanded student housing. On the west campus, the 180-acre University Research Park is attracting private companies such as America Online, Canon Information Systems, and Cisco Systems, that agree to collaborate with UCI faculty and students on intern\u00ad ships, research, and other programs. Due to the high caliber of UCI faculty and scholarship, the campus is home to national organizations including the National Fuel Cell Research Center and the Western Center of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and is a major site for the nationwide cancer genetics research network. For its range of services and research, UCI's Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center is the county's only cancer facility designated \"comprehensive\" by the National Cancer Institute. UCI is noted in fact for its strengths in cancer and neuroscience research, much of which takes place at UCI Medical Center. Located in the City of Orange, 13 miles to the north, the Medical Center is the primary teaching and research hospital for the UCI School of Medicine. Bus transportation makes travel convenient between the campus, UCI Medical Center and major housing areas, shopping centers, and recreation locales. In addition, the campus and surrounding communities are designed for bicycle traffic with trails connecting UCI with student housing and the coast.

UC IRVINE - 2006-2007UCI ACADEMIC SENATE DISTINGUISHED FACULTY BERNARD N. GROFMAN Distinguished Faculty Award for Research, 2005-06 Professor of Political Science and Economics I have an undergraduate degree in mathematics from the University of Chicago, but I am cer\u00ad tainly not a mathematician even though I use mathematics in most of what I do. (As an under\u00ad graduate I really majored in student government and contract bridge.) I have a Ph.D. in politi\u00ad cal science and most of my publications are in political science journals, but I count myself more of a social scientist than a political scientist. I was actually hired at UCI in a slot meant for a sociologist, and I am a Professor of Political Science and Social Psychology even though I have never taken a course in either sociology or psychology. I also now have a courtesy appointment in Economics even though I got a D in the one economics course I ever took. (In fairness, however, during most of the quarter I took that course I was actually in D.C. going over old records to trace the decades long connections between the National Student Association (NSA), on whose national board I then served, and the CIA-part of a story that made the front page of the New York Times six days running.) As part of a long involvement, first with student government at the University of Chicago and then with the National Student Association, I became a professional parliamentarian (i.e., an expert in Robert's Rules of Order) at a relatively young age. At one NSA conference, when I was 26, I was referred to as the \"aging dean of student parliamentarians.\") That student poli\u00ad ti.cs background has led me to a long-standing interest in processes of group decision-making. The research domain in which I have probably made the greatest impact is the study of elec\u00ad tions and representation (especially patterns of minority voting and of party competition), in part because I have testified as an expert witness in about a dozen states on issues related to redistricting, and my research has, arguably, influenced the U.S. Supreme Court. But I got into expert witness consulting largely by accident. My former college roommate had political connections and recommended me to an attorney who was looking for an expert witness in a redistricting case in Colorado. I am sometimes viewed as a \"rational choice\" modeler, which is translated as someone who assumes that we can make sense of the world in terms of choices made by intelligent and informed actors who seek to optimize their utility, but I reject that label. I prefer to bill myself as a \"reasonable choice\" modeler-someone who recognizes that people tend do things for reasons, but not always reasons that they fully understand. I am, like my colleague, A Wuffle, a member of the California (drive-in) Church of the Incorrigibly Eclectic. Recently, drawing on ideas from the thousands of mystery stories I've read over the years, I've been writing papers that see their task as \"puzzle solving,\" i.e., trying to explain some con\u00ad crete and specific set of events that seems mysterious bas.ed on existing theories. Mysteries can be seen as generally falling into three categories: \"whodunits,': \"howdunits,\" and \"why\u00ad dunits.\" In a whodunit the central issue is simply pinning down who committed the crime (i.e., in the social science context, identifying critical explanatory factors). In howdunits, the emphasis is on exactly how the deed was pulled off (i.e., in the social science context, identi\u00ad fying specific mechanisms rather than mere correlations). In whydunits, we are interested in probing the psychology of the criminal (i.e., explaining motivation). Recognizing that myster\u00ad ies come in several forms avoids some rather sterile debates in the social sciences about what it means to make sense of the world. WILSON HO Distinguished Faculty Award for Research, 2005-06 Donald Bren Professor of Physics and Astronomy and of Chemistry My early childhood was spent in Changhwa, a city near the middle of Taiwan, where I received my primary school education. Both my parents were middle school teachers. I remember that I had a great deal of freedom roaming the countryside around our home and UC IRVINE - 2006-2007developed a keen interest in vegetable gardening, growing fruit trees, and raising chickens. It was also a period when I developed my mathematics foundation. My parents believed that there were more opportunities abroad for their four children. In 1965, when I reached the age of 12, my fanJily moved to Rokko, a suburb of Kobe, Japan. Two years later, my family immi\u00ad grated to San Francisco, California, to join my grandmother and two aunts. In 1971, I attended the California Institute of Technology, gravitated toward chemistry, and received a B.S. degree in 1975. Since I had published 11 papers under the guidance of Profes\u00ad sor Henry Weinberg and had taken a sufficient number of courses, it was decided that I should also be given a M.S. degree. I was able to find time to participate in intercollegiate sports: track, cross-country, and swimming. I also remember with fond memories the experiences of carrying out research each summer with different professors: Aron Kuppermann, Wilse Robin\u00ad son, William Goddard, and Henry Weinberg. Surface science was a rapidly emerging field at that time and jumping on this opportunity, I went to the University of Pennsylvania to carry out Ph.D. work tinder the guidance of Professors Ward Plummer and Robert Schrieffer and experienced snow for the first time. During this period, I learned to appreciate instrumentation design and fabrication and became fully ingrained with the belief that advancement in science follows from the development of new techniques. My entire career has been guided by this belief and assurance that something good will come from having an experimental capability that no one else has. In 1979, I received my Ph.D. degree in physics and joined AT&T Bell Laboratories as a member of the technical staff. Being single in the New Jersey suburb and away from academic institutions for the first time, the longing for campus life soon grabbed me by full force. Attracted by the natural beauty of Ithaca, New York, I accepted a position as Assistant Professor of Physics at Cornell University in 1980. I was promoted to Associate Professor in 1985 and Professor in 1991. My group and I continued to develop new instru\u00ad mentation aimed to follow changes in chemistry by monitoring molecules in real time. In the last 10 years, our efforts have shifted to the building of scanning tunneling microscopes to see and probe individual atoms and molecules on solid surfaces. The natural beauty of Ithaca did not come without a price; my wife did not like anything that fell from the sky, such as rain, snow, and sleet, of which Ithaca had plenty. In 2000, through the effort of Professor Douglas Mills and others, we returned to sunny Cali\u00ad fornia and joined the young and dynamic UC Irvine campus and became fully integrated into the cultural diversity of the student body and the city. After spending 20 years at a private uni\u00ad versity, I was attracted in part to UC Irvine because it is a public institution with students coming from different ethnic backgrounds. My group and I are currently combining the two very powerful instruments, femtosecond lasers and scanning tunneling microscopes, in the hope of entering new regimes of measurement and to tread in new waters. We continue to be amazed by the instruments we have designed and built, the ability to see and touch individual atoms and molecules, and the excitement of accidental discoveries and unexpected results in this rapidly growing field of nanoscience. Ultimately, we woul_d like to understand and control how atoms and molecules combine to form more complex systems. The majority of my time has been invested in the education and training of graduate students and postdocs, and I con\u00ad tinue to learn from them. HANS S. KEIRSTEAD Distinguished Assistant Professor Award for Research, 2005-06 Associate Professor of Anatomy and Neurobiology I received my Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. My Ph.D. thesis concerned the invention of a novel method for regenerating damaged spinal cords, and formed the basis of several worldwide patents as well as the formation of a company in 1999 to bring this treatment toward clinical trials.'This work constituted the first demonstration of functional regeneration of the injured adult spinal cord, and for my achievements I received the Cameron Award for the outstanding Ph.D. thesis in Canada. I then moved to Cambridge, England, where I conducted four years of postdoctoral studies at the University of Cambridge furthering my studies of spinal cord injury and beginning studies of multiple sclerosis. I was Distinguished Faculty 13 UC IRVINE - 2006-200714 UCI 2006-07 Distinguished Faculty awarded Canadian and British fellowships to support this work. I received the distinct honor of election to two senior academic posts, Fellow of the Governing Body of Downing College, and Senate Member of the University of Cambridge, and was the youngest member to be elected to those positions. In 2000, I was honored to accept an appointment as Assistant Pro\u00ad fessor in the Reeve-Irvine Research Center at UC Irvine. The Reeve-Irvine Research Center, founded by the late Christopher Reeve and philanthropist Joan Irvine Smith, is a leading cen\u00ad ter for spinal cord injury research. I direct a large team investigating the cellular biology and treatment of spinal cord trauma, research that also has significance for multiple sclerosis and other diseases of the nervous system. In order to bring my treatments to clinical trials, I have founded or partnered with biotechnology companies to fund and conduct pre-clinical and clin\u00ad ical development. In 2005 I was promoted to Associate Professor. The focus of my laboratory is the development of strategies to limit degeneration and enhance regeneration after spinal cord injury. My laboratory is investigating strategies to reduce or eliminate the enlargement of spinal cord injury sites that normally occurs after injury. My lab\u00ad oratory has developed an injection-based therapy that significantly decreases tissue loss if administered soon after injury. Human reagents necessary for clinical trials have been gener\u00ad ated, and a clinical trial using this approach began in mid-2005. My laboratory also investigates cell transplantation therapies for spinal cord injury and was the first lab in North America to gamer human embryonic stem cells for trauma research. My team was the first in the world to develop a means to direct human embryonic stem cells to become a high-purity clinically useful cell population. We then demonstrated that transplantation of this cell population restored lost function, including the ability of coordinated walking, to acutely spinal cord injured rats. This work is the basis of a therapy that is currently being developed for clinical trials, which are scheduled to begin in mid-2006. My laboratory is generating other cell populations that may benefit chronic spinal cord injury and is also researching means to eliminate the glial scar that forms after spinal cord injury and in multiple sclerosis. FRANK LAFERLA Distinguished Mid-Career Faculty Award for Research, 2005-06 UCI Chancellor's Fellow and Professor of Neurobiology and Behavior I was born and raised in Philadelphia, an ethnically diverse city, although I grew up in South Philly, which at that time was predominantly comprised of Italian-Americans. The immigrant roots ran deep there and consisted of many first-generation individuals, like me. Both of my parents were born in a small town in Sicily and emigrated to the U.S.A in the early 1960s. Like many immigrant families, my parents hoped that I would become a physician, and indeed that was my career goal when I entered St. Joseph's University as a biology major back in 1981. It wasn't until after I completed my second year that a unique opportunity presented itself: l was offered a paid summer position as a technician at one of the research labs at St. Joe's. It was there that I was exposed to the new world of experimental science and decided that I wanted to be a biomedical researcher. After graduating from St. Joe's in 1985, I enrolled in the Ph.D. program in microbiology at the University of Minnesota and studied the molecular mechanisms underlying replication of negative-strand RNA viruses. After graduating from Minnesota in 1990, I commenced my postdoctoral training at the American Red Cross Laboratories in Rockville, MD. I initially planned to study the pathogenesis of HIV using genetically modified mice, but instead was attracted to a new field: Alzheimer's disease and neuroscience. Ironically, my laboratory is now devoted exclusively to neuroscience research, despite having received little to no formal education in neuroscience. My lab's efforts focus on understanding Alzheimer's disease, the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder. Alzheimer's disease poses a significant medical and economic burden on our society as roughly five million Americans suffer from this insidious disorder. Moreover, it is estimated that five percent of individuals over age 70 and about 33 percent of those over age 85 are afflicted. As health care advances have helped to extend human lives UC IRVINE - 2006-2007and as age is the most significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, more and more individu\u00ad als are developing this disorder. The clinical symptoms include memory loss, personality changes, disorientation, and poor judgment. The Alzheimer's patient eventually succumbs after a protracted battle that sometimes can last 10 or more years. Presently, there is no cure and the existing treatment options offer minor and short-lived benefits. To better study Alzheimer's disease, my lab introduced three human disease-causing genes into mice. Hence, the mice, which we refer to as the 3xTg-AD mice, are genetically modified and express the human protein products of these three genes (PSI, APP, and tau). The 3xTg\u00ad AD mice develop the two key neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, the 3xTg-AD mice also develop an age\u00ad related memory loss that is induced by the buildup of the plaque protein. We have found that clearing the amyloid plaques with immunotherapy suffices to reduce the early tangle burden, suggesting that the sooner an Alzheimer's patient receives treatment, the higher the probability for success. The 3xTg-AD mice have been extensively used to study the effects of various pharmaceutical agents throughout the world, in both academic and commercial enterprises. ROGER D. McWILLIAMS Daniel G. Aldrich, Jr. Distinguished University Service Award, 2005-06 Professor of Physics and Astronomy Daniel G. Aldrich, Jr. influenced me from UC Irvine's earliest days. As a boy, I watched bull\u00ad dozing for the new campus. UC Irvine's broad vision of service was seen early-1 heard the Los Angeles Philharmonic Symphony play in Crawford Hall basketball arena. Later, as a transfer student, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Physics from UC Irvine (1975). During these times some undergraduates really wanted to demonstrate against an establishment authority. Popular \"Chancellor Dan\" proved an impossible target since he supported free speech issues while persuasively keeping students aimed toward educational excellence. The students' biggest anti-establishment event may have been a mini-marathon \"streaking.\" Even though Chancellor Dan was an avid athlete, he neither attended nor obstructed this event. Before finishing my Princeton astrophysics Ph.D. (1980), I joined Irvine's Physics and Astronomy faculty (with an amusing caveat: I would be fired if the Ph.D. was not finished within one year). Thesis work on experimental plasma physics about transferring electromag\u00ad netic wave momentum to electrons had found substantial interest. That interest lasted enough years to be part of the citation for election to Fellow in the American Physical Society. My research has emphases on ion transport in quiet or turbulent plasmas, and laser development including ion, diode, and chemical oxygen iodine lasers. Most known matter in the universe, such as stars, is plasma (ionized matter). It has industrial uses from microelectronics produc\u00ad tion to lasers. Plasma is fascinating as fundamental science and practical for society. My most important experiments were done for a U.S. Supreme Court case and published in court records; John Roberts, now Chief Justice, served variously as coauthor or referee on these publications. Also, my lab alumni picnics attest to research importance for careers. Having the pleasure of knowing all of Irvine's Chancellors, it is especially meaningful to be rewarded for characteristics deliberately copied from Chancellor Aldrich. Recognizing univer\u00ad sities exist largely to serve others through education, I have helped produce entities raising educational value in permanently satisfying ways for students, faculty, and staff. The com\u00ad bined environment of research, teaching, and service has been especially invigorating and deeply rewarding over my career. I have served as founding Director of the Campuswide Honors Program (CHP) since inception nearly 20 years ago. Almost 3,000 of Irvine's finest undergraduates, from all majors, have come to Irvine because of this program, receiving the excellent education the faculty provides in and out of the honors program. CHP also has encouraged and nurtured upper-division hon\u00ad ors programs for every major on campus. Within Physics and Astronomy I run the senior pro\u00ad ject and thesis program which every student completes, and the departmental honors program. Distinguished Faculty 15 UC IRVINE - 2006-200716 UCI 2006-07 Distinguished Faculty Some years back, I founded the Undergraduate Research Symposium. For its first years it was run within the CHP program with the idea of making it open to every student later on, as now occurs. After getting the symposium going, I proposed and obtained permanent State funding to found the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). I housed UROP ini\u00ad tially within the CHP operation and then separated the programs as UROP developed the abil\u00ad ity to be independent. Another program associated with CHP is the merit-based Scholarship Opportunities Program .for all students, developed and directed by Dr. Audrey De Yore, now peeled off from CHP as well. In all these service activities, widespread enthusiasm and real work provided by people from every element of the campus has produced results from resources crossing every institutional boundary. Chancellor Aldrich's spirit of serving through promoting educational endeavors addressing public need and engaging the University commu\u00ad nity happily continues to motivate many UC Irvine people. DIANE K. O'DOWD Distinguished Faculty Award for Teaching, 2005-06 Professor of Developmental and Cell Biology and of Anatomy and Neurobiology I have had the privilege Of living, training, and/or working at a university my whole life. I was born in Connecticut where my family lived on the campus of Wesleyan University. We moved shortly thereafter to Michigan, again living on campus at the newly established Oakland Uni\u00ad versity. I grew up there during the tumultuous 60s and early 70s, surrounded and stimulated by campus life. At age 18, I enrolled at Stanford University, intent on becoming a physician. However, during my freshman year I discovered that while medicine was interesting, neuroscience research was \u00b7 exciting. I had the opportunity to interact closely with several neuroscience faculty at Stan\u00ad ford, all of whom encouraged me to pursue a career in academics. I received my B.S. in 1979 and being a lover of sun and surf, as well as neuroscience, I enrolled in a Ph.D. program at UCSD. It was there I began the studies that I continue today focusing on understanding the mechanisms that regulate communication between cells in our central nervous system. In 1985, I got my Ph.D. and married Martin Smith, also a neurobiologist, who was doing his postdoctoral fellowship in the adjacent lab. We returned to Stanford in 1986 for postdoctoral training and our son was born two years later. We came to UC Irvine as assistant professors in 1989, our daughter was born in 1991, and we have been here ever since, working in adjacent labs, and having the wonderful opportunity to raise our family on the UCI campus. In my lab we study the activity of living neurons in the brains of both flies and mice. Current experiments are focused on using a mutant approach to gain insight into the mechanisms involved in regulating activity in central circuits that process information during learning and that mediate responses to nicotine. I have always had close interactions with a small number of students directly involved in my research, and I try to impart to them the excitement that I was exposed to as an undergraduate. However, the majority of my undergraduate teaching has been in large lectures, typical of \u00b7 introductory classes taught at research universities. As my children began approaching the age of university students, I started to think more deeply about how we were training these stu\u00ad dents. I realized that traditional didactic lecturing focuses on transmission of facts, akin to an \"information dump.\" With access to large volumes of information, literally at their fingertips, the challenge is to teach today's students to learn the critical thinking skills that will be neces\u00ad sary to evaluate and interpret information they receive. With this goal in mind, last year I undertook the challenge, along with three outstanding assistant professors, to completely redesign our first-quarter introductory biology course. We had the extraordinary opportunity to work with a large number of students at a critical juncture in their lives, the transition between high school and college. Using a variety of interactive learning strategies we have strived to impart a conceptual understanding of basic molecular and cellular biology and how they relate to the broader issues of human health, in an environment that promotes critical thinking, prob\u00ad lem solving, and communication with faculty and peers. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007AMELIA C. REGAN Distinguished Mid-Career Faculty Award for Service, 2005-06 Associate Professor of Computer Science and Civil Engineering I grew up in suburban Philadelphia and was an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylva\u00ad nia. I studied systems engineering and developed an early interest in the transportation indus\u00ad tries. I worked for UPS as an industnal engineering intern while an undergraduate; after grad\u00ad uation, I took a job as a research analyst with the Association of American Railroads in Washington, D.C. I returned to UPS a year later, joining their then new Operations Research Group. While I worked for UPS developing computer-based large-scale routing and schedul\u00ad ing systems, I earned an M.S. in applied mathematics at Johns Hopkins University. After sev\u00ad eral years at UPS, I returned to graduate school to study civil (transportation systems) engi\u00ad neering at the University of Texas. After earning M.S.E. and Ph.D. degrees, I had the good fortune to join the Transportation Group at the Institute of Transportation Studies here at UCI. I have faculty appointments in Computer Science and Civil and Environmental Engineering and am currently serving as the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education for the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences. My research interests have to do with large-scale network optimization. Much of that work has had freight transportation systems (trucking, rail, air cargo, maritime, and intermodal) as its focus. I also have strong interests in general networks, data mining applied to large-scale traffic data, and environmental and economic impacts of freight transportation systems. I got interested in outreach early in my UCI career and have had the good fortune to partici\u00ad pate in many programs involving local teachers. I also teach in the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) program for academically talented high school students. ADAM P. SUMMERS Distinguished Assistant Professor Award for Teaching, 2005-06 Assistant Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology I was raised in New York City and the north woods of Canada. At Swarthmore College I earned degrees in mathematics and engineering, but was not interested in pursuing either as a career. While teaching scuba in Australia on the Great Barrier Reef I met my first profes\u00ad sional biologists. I returned to New York to get a master's degree in biology at New York University then went to the University of Massachusetts for a Ph.D. From the beginning of my research career I attempted to capitalize on my previous training as an engineer to understand the evolution of the mechanical systems of animals. At UC Berkeley I was a Miller Research Fellow working with David and Marvalee Wake on the mechanics of salamander walking and the jaws of a particularly unusual group of limb\u00ad less amphibians called caecilians. While at UCB I was approached by Pixar Studios to help them with the movie Finding Nemo. I spent three years advising on animal movements and biological aspects of the film and was delighted when the hard work of the Pixar folks was so well received at the box office. I came to UCI four years ago and taught my first lecture course-a 400-student survey of human physiology. It was an intimidating experience, but with the mentorship of the other comparative physiology faculty I found that I enjoyed the large audience. With Professor Tim Bradley I designed a new, writing-intensive course in comparative physiology in which students start with an extinct animal and design the physiological systems that allowed it to function. I also enjoy sharing my enthusiasm for the field of biomechanics with a monthly column that appears in Natural History Magazine. My fortieth column was published in June of 2005. Distinguished Faculty 17 UC IRVINE - 2006-2007PREADMISSION MATTERS OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS AND RELATIONS WITH SCHOOLS The mission of the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools (OARS), a division of Student Affairs, is to: (1) optimize UCI's undergraduate enrollments by implementing Academic Sen\u00ad ate, universitywide, and campus policies for the selection and admission of new freshman and transfer students; and (2) stimulate and advance cooperative educational relationships between UCI and California schools and colleges.

Staff regularly visit California community colleges throughout the state and meet with prospective transfer students to discuss admission requirements, academic planning and preparation, and UCI lower-division major and general education requirements. Articulation agreements, which identify how community college courses may be used to fulfill lower-division UCI degree requirements, are facilitated through TSS. Articulation agreements are available online at http://www.assist.org/. CAMPUS TOURS Student-led tours of the campus are conducted weekdays at noon, except during academic recesses; Saturday tours are offered during October; November, and April only. To confirm tour dates, times, and parking instructions and to arrange tours for school groups of 10 or more during the regular academic year, call (949) 824-4636 or visit http://www.campustours.uci.edu. HOWTO USE THE CATALOGUE Because the UCI General Catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the year it covers, changes in someprograms and courses inevitably will occur. The selection of courses to be offered each quarter is subject to change without notice, and some courses are not offered each year. The WebSOC, Searchable Schedule of Classes, available on the Registrar's Office Web site (http://www.reg.uci.edu) shortly before registration begins each quarter, provides current information about course offerings, instructors, hours, and more. Students should consult the appropriate academic unit for even more up-to-date information. (Admission to UCI does not guarantee enrollment in any particular course.) Presentation of information in the Catalogue is divided into six main concepts, as detailed in the Table of Contents: (1) Introduction to UCI, (2) Preadmission Matters, (3) Information for Admitted Stu\u00ad dents, (4) Research, (5) Graduate Studies, and (6) Academic Pro\u00ad grams. Included in the academic program sections are the follow\u00ad ing kinds of information: (a) brief descriptions of the areas that are covered in each school or program and a brief statement of the educational philosophy and orientation of the unit; (b) lists of fac\u00ad ulty members, the institutions from which they received their high\u00ad est degrees, and their areas of interest; (c) requirements for under\u00ad graduate majors and minors and graduate degrees; (d) additional areas of study referred to as concentrations, specializations, or emphases; (e) advice about planning a program of study, and other information relevant to the academic progress and experience of students majoring in fields within each school or program; and (f) courses offered. Course Listings Undergraduate courses are classified as lower division (numbered 1-99) and upper division (numbered 100-199). Courses numbered 200 and above are graduate or professional courses. Lower division usually refers to freshman-sophomore courses, upper division to junior-senior courses. However, junior and senior students may take lower-division courses, and freshmen and sophomores may normally take upper-division courses when upper-division standing is not a prerequisite and when any other prerequisites have been met. A course has no prerequisites unless indicated. Courses with sequential designations (for example, lA-B-C) norc mally indicate multiple-quarter courses; except as noted, each UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Undergraduate and Graduate Degrees 19 UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE DEGREES Degree Title Degree 1 Aerospace Engineering B.S.

When a course is approved for satisfaction of the UCI breadth requirement, the breadth category is indicated by a Roman numeral in parentheses at the end of the description. However, courses which have been approved to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement are not designated in this Catalogue. Rather, they are designated in the quarterly WebSOC, Searchable Schedule of Classes with a W following the number. Students should refer to the WebSOC link at http://www.reg.uci.edu for a complete listing of approved upper-division writing courses. UNDERGRADUATE MAJORS, MINORS, AND ASSOCIATED AREAS OF STUDY Students are urged to become informed of and understand all requirements concerning their intended majors, minors, and associ\u00ad ated areas of study. Special restrictions apply to some majors and minors; for example, some minors require formal application or declaration by students, others may be completed without such for\u00ad malities. Information about the programs listed below may be found in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue. Undergraduate majors are offered in all of the bachelor's degree programs on the list of degree titles; the degree programs are referred to as majors in the following list. In association with these majors, UCI offers a number of minors, concentrations, specializa\u00ad tions, and emphases. A minor consists of a coordinated set of courses (seven or more) which together take a student well beyond the introductory level in an academic field, subject matter, and/or discipline but which are not sufficient to constitute a major. An interdisciplinary minor consists of courses offered by two. or more schools or programs. Generally, all minors are available to all students, with the follow\u00ad ing exceptions: (l) students may not minor in their major, and (2) students may not complete certain other major/minor combina\u00ad tions that are expressly prohibited, as noted in the Catalogue. Minors are listed on a student's transcript but not on the baccalau\u00ad reate diploma. A concentration is a program of interdisciplinary study consisting of courses offered by two or more schools or programs. Concentra\u00ad tions are similar to minors in that they require fewer units of work than majors do, and the area of concentration appears on the stu\u00ad dent's transcript but not on the baccalaureate diploma. Concentra\u00ad tions are taken in combination with a major in one of the schools or programs offering the concentration. A specialization is a program of study which enables students to focus on courses in a particular field within a major. The area of specialization pursued appears on the student's transcript but not on the baccalaureate diploma. An emphasis is a program of study within a major which empha\u00ad sizes a specific area of the discipline. Emphases usually have a defined course of study and are not listed on the transcript nor on the baccalaureate diploma. In addition, the Campuswide Honors Program, various major\u00ad specific honors programs, and Excellence in Research programs are available.

MAJORS AND CAREERS Choosing a Major Many students select their University major, the field of study which represents their principal academic interest, at the time they fill out their University of California Undergraduate Application for Admission and Scholarship. Some students, however, are not ready to choose a major at the time they apply, and still others may wish to change to a different major after they have enrolled. In preparation for choosing a major, students need to familiarize themselves as much as possible with UCI and its academic pro\u00ad grams. Entering students are exposed to a wide range of areas of study, and it is not unusual for students to become enthusiastic about academic disciplines previously unfamiliar to them. At UCI a number of traditionally separate academic disciplines have strong interrelationships, so that the academic environment is influenced by broad interactions among disciplines. As a complement to class\u00ad room study, UCI encourages its students to become involved in a variety of educational experiences such as independent study, labo\u00ad ratory research, field study, writing workshops, computing, and arts productions. Such experiences can help students identify additional areas of interest. The UCI General Catalogue is a good place to find specific infor\u00ad mation about programs available and requirements. Students are encouraged to talk to academic counselors and faculty advisors and to go to any department to learn more about its programs of study, its requirements for graduation, and possible enrollment limita\u00ad tions. (Some majors are impacted, that is, more students apply than can be accommodated. See the Undergraduate Admissions section for information.) While advisors may not be familiar with all fields, they can suggest ways to investigate other areas of study and be helpful in planning a lower-division program which will keep several options open. Courses and workshops designed to assist students in choosing a major are offered by the UCI Career Center, the Division of Undergraduate Education, and some of the academic units. All students are required to choose a major by the time they reach junior status. It is important to look well ahead to this decision and to think about it carefully during the freshman and sophomore years. When considering possible majors, students should keep in mind that some major programs require quite specific preliminary study. At the same time, excessive early concentration could reduce a student's options and could cause the. student to need more than four years to obtain the baccalaureate degree. Further\u00ad more, courses required for graduation need to be considered. For these reasons, it is desirable for students to plan their programs carefully and thoughtfully, seeking a balance between exposure to it variety of academic areas and completion of courses which are prerequisite to a major under consideration. A qualified student interested in two areas of study may graduate with a double major by fulfilling the degree requirements of any two programs. Certain restrictions may apply; students should check with their academic advisor. Each school has its own standards for change of major, and some majors are impacted, as indicated above. Once a student selects a major, or decides to change majors, the student should visit the academic counseling office for their prospective major to obtain current information about prerequisites, program planning, and policies and procedures. In addition, a form called the Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major must be completed. The form is available from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. All schools with exceptional requirements have major-change criteria approved by the Academic Senate and published on the Division of Undergraduate Education Web site at http://www.due.uci.edu/ Change_of_Major.html. Students changing majors may meet the approved major-change criteria of the unit they wish to enter that are in place at the time of their change of major or those in effect up to one year before. Undecided/Undeclared Students Students who enter the University as freshmen or sophomores, who are uncertain about their major, and who wish to explore, experi\u00ad ment, and then decide, participate in the Undecided/Undeclared Advising Program administered by the Division of Undergraduate Education. The Division is devoted to enriching the learning envi\u00ad ronment for lower-division students, especially those in the fresh\u00ad man year. Detailed information about the Undecided/Undeclared Advising Program is available in the Division of Undergraduate Education section of the Catalogue. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Preparation for Graduate or Professional Study Undergraduate students should keep the possibility of future gradu\u00ad ate or professional study in mind as they plan their academic pro\u00ad grams, and they should discuss their career goals with their advi\u00ad sors. Students who have an idea of the direction in which they would like to go should familiarize themselves with the basic requirements for postbaccalaureate study and keep those require\u00ad ments in mind when selecting courses. Furthermore, students should supplement their undergraduate programs by anticipating foreign language or other special requirements at major graduate schools and by intensive work in areas outside their major that are of special relevance to their intended graduate work. Students should consult the graduate advisor or academic counselor in the academic unit corresponding to their area of interest and visit the UCI Career Center which offers a number of services useful to those considering graduate or professional study. General information for prospective graduate students is available on the Office of Graduate Studies Web site (http://www.rgs.uci. e?ulgrad/), while information about UCI's graduate education poli\u00ad Cies and procedures is available in The Manual of the Irvine Divi\u00ad sion of the Academic Senate (http://www.senate.uci.edu). Preprofessional Preparation LAW Law schools want to produce lawyers to serve the entire legal spec\u00ad trum (for example, tax, criminal, entertainment, or immigration law), and this requires a wide range of academic backgrounds. Law schools look less for specific areas of study than they do for evi\u00ad dence of academic excellence. A good. record in physics or clas\u00ad sics, for example, will be preferred over a mediocre record in his\u00ad tory or political sciel)-ce. Most law schools give equal preference to students from all academic disciplines. Courses that help develop writing and analytical skills (logic, writing, mathematics, research methods, and statistics, for example) build skills that are the key to doing well on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) and suc\u00ad ceeding in law school and the legal profession. UCI offers a number of law-related courses that students in any major may take. The School of Humanities offers a Humanities and Law minor, emphasizing courses that require critical reading and analysis, and courses that focus on theoretical and applied ana\u00ad lytical perspectives on ethical, political, and social issues relevant to the law. The School of Social Sciences offers courses in the study of law, international relations, and economics of law and rec\u00ad ommends that students take some political science courses\u00b7 as well. The School of Social Ecology offers many law-related courses in both substantive law (such as environmental and criminal law) and in law and society and criminal justice, and offers its majors the opportunity to apply theories learned in the clas'sroom to actual problems through its field study program. Students should know that law schools look closely at five aspects of a student's application: grades, LSAT results, the applicant's statement of purpose, in-depth letters of recommendation, and extracurricular activities and law-related work experience. Students should be aware that not everyone who applies is admitted to law school. One consideration in selecting an undergraduate major is alternative careers should one's goals change. MEDICINE AND OTHER HEALTH-RELATED SCIENCES Although health science educators strongly recommend that stu\u00ad dents obtain a bachelor's degree prior to admission to the health sciences, there is no preferred major. Many UCI students who plan to enter the health professions major in Biological Sciences \u00b7because much of the basic course work for that major is also Majors and Careers 25 required for medical school admission; however, students may major in any academic field as long as they also take the courses required by professional health science schools. The minimum amount of undergraduate preparation required includes one year each of English, biology with laboratory, general chemistry with laboratory, organic chemistry with laboratory, physics with labora\u00ad tory, and college mathematics, especially calculus and statistics, as well as one semester (or two quarters) of biochemistry. Courses in cell biology, developmental biology, genetics, molecular biology, physiology, comparative anatomy, vertebrate embryology, and computer science are recommended. In addition, some health sci\u00ad ences schools have certain nonscience course requirements or rec\u00ad ommendations, for example, English and/or a foreign language. Facility with the Spanish language is very helpful in California medieal schools and in other areas of the United States with large Hispanic populations. Although many factors ultimately are considered when reviewing applicants for admission, admission committees look carefully at: college grade point average (science and nonscience grades are evaluated separately, and evidence of improvement in work during the undergraduate years is important); results of the Medical Col\u00ad lege Admission Test (MCAT) and other aptitude examination scores; the student's personal essay and/or personal interview; in\u00ad depth letters of recommendation; practical clinical experience in the health sciences, whether paid or volunteer, which is regarded favorably as an indication of exposure to and interest in the health sciences; extracurricular activities which demonstrate the appli\u00ad cant's ability to interact successfully with others; and research experience, especially in a biological, medical, or behavioral science. Since medical programs cannot accommodate all qualified appli\u00ad cants and competition for entrance is keen, it is important to keep in mind alternative career opportunities should one not be accepted to a health science school, or should one decide to pursue instead one of the expanding number of health-related programs now available. BUSINESS/MANAGEMENT The contemporary executive or manager must be a creative thinker, make complex decisions, and have the ability to perceive and par\u00ad ticipate in the full scope of an enterprise while understanding its role in the economy. Effective management requires leadership ability, strong problem-solving skills, the ability to successfully deploy and manage information technologies, effective oral and written communication skills, analytical skills, an understanding of global economic trends, and a basic knowledge of behavioral processes in organizations. UC IRVINE - 2006-200726 UCI 2006-07 Preadmission Matters Although UCI does not offer an undergraduate degree in business, The Paul Merage School of Business offers a minor in Manage\u00ad ment as well as a minor in Accounting as a supplement to any undergraduate major. The Management minor can provide students with a broad understanding of management theory and practice and may be helpful to students in determining whether they wish to pursue a career in business or management or undertake graduate\u00ad level study in management. The Accounting minor provides under\u00ad graduates with all accounting courses necessary to sit for the CPA examination. It also prepares students for careers in the accounting field or for graduate-level study. Students can also supplement their major course work to develop the skills needed for business and management by taking electives such as calculus, statistics, economics, psychology, sociology, computer science, and political science, and are encouraged to take intensive course work in the culture, history, geography, economy, politics, and language of specific foreign countries. For admission purposes, the majority of graduate schools of busi\u00ad ness look at five areas: grades, scores on the Graduate Manage\u00ad ment Admission Test (GMAT), the applicant's statement of pur\u00ad pose, in-depth letters of recommendation, evidence of leadership in school and community activities, and work experience. Substantive work experience is becoming an increasingly important prerequi\u00ad site for many programs. Students from a variety of undergraduate disciplines including lib\u00ad eral arts, social sciences, physical or biological sciences, computer science, and engineering are encouraged to apply to UCI's Paul \u00b7 Merage School of Business. Career Opportunities UCI's academic units which offer undergraduate education leading to the bachelor's degree provide students with opportunities to explore a wide range of interests leading to a career choice or to further education at the graduate or professional level. The lists which follow show the varied career areas pursued by UCI gradu\u00ad ates. Any major can lead to a number of careers. Additional discus\u00ad sions of careers are presented in individual academic unit sections. Arts Career Areas Acting, Advertising, Animation, Arts Administration, Art Therapy, Broad\u00ad casting, Choreography, Composition, Conducting, Conservation/Restora.\u00ad tion, Consulting, Criticism, Curating, Digital Arts Production, Direction, Environmental Design, Instrument Repair/Tuning, Interior/Industrial Design, Journalism, Librarianship, Lighting, Marketing, Medical Illustra\u00ad tion, Performance, Photography, Physical Fitness, Printing, Production, Publicity, Public Relations, Publishing, Set/Stage/Costume Design, Stage Management, Teaching, Tourism, Visual Resources Management, Writing. The exceptionally talented Claire Trevor School of the Arts gradu\u00ad ate may choose to become a professional actor, art historian, artist, dancer, or musician. However, there are many other careers to explore in numerous arts-related areas, or the graduate may wish to combine part-time professional performance with supplemental work. The field of arts administration is an increasingly important career area, offering opportunities to work with opera and dance companies, repertory theatre companies, museums, state and local arts councils, community arts organizations, and arts festivals. Biological Sciences Career Areas Bioanalysis, Biochemistry, Biomedical Engineering, Cell Biology, Chiroprac\u00ad tic Medicine, Dentistry, Developmental Biology, Dietetics, Environmental Management, Forestry, Genetic Engineering, Health Administration, Indus\u00ad trial Hygiene, Marine Biology, Medical Technology, Medicine, Microbiology, Nurse Practitioner, Occupational Therapy, Oceanography, Optometry, Osteopathy, Plant Biology, Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Physicians' Assistant, Physical Therapy, Podiatry, Public Health, Quality Control, Research, Sales, Speech Pathology, Teaching, Technical Writing and Editing, Veterinary Medicine. The health field is one of the fastest-growing career areas in the country. Work sites may include private corporations, educational institutions, hospitals, health care complexes, private foundations, city and county governments, state agencies, the federal govern\u00ad ment, and many others. Engineering Career Areas Aerospace, Biochemical, Biomedical, Biotechnology, Chemical Engineering, Communications, Computer Architecture, Computer Engineering, Computer Software, Control Systems, Digital Signal Processing, Earthq~ake Safety, Electric Power, Electronics, Electro-optics, Environmental Control, Environ\u00ad mental Engineering, Flood Control, Geotechnical, High-Speed Image Pro\u00ad cessing, Hydraulics, High-Frequency Devices and Systems, Land Develop\u00ad ment and Urban Planning, Manufacturing Engineering, Materials, Process Control, Propulsion and Power, Public Works, Reliability, Robotics, Struc\u00ad tures, Traffic, Transportation, Water Resources, Water Supply. These are some areas for employment available to UCI engineering graduates. Career paths typically involve one or more of the fol\u00ad lowing: design, research and development, manufacturing or construction, operations, consulting, applications and sales, man\u00ad agement, or teaching. At UCI they will have had the choice of Aerospace, Biomedical, Biomedical: Premedical, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical, Environ\u00ad mental, Materials Science, or Mechanical Engineering, as well as a general program in Engineering. However, they will frequently find challenging positions in related areas such as industrial engineer\u00ad ing, for which their general and specialty course work at UCI, fol\u00ad lowed by formal or informal, on-the-job training will qualify them. Approximately half of UCI's Engineering graduates obtain advanced degrees from UCI or other universities, and almost all engage in continuing education to keep abreast of advances in technology. Many Engineering graduates build on their engineering background and enter graduate programs to obtain degrees in the fields of administration, law, medicine, physics, or mathematics.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS ACCESS UCI and Summer Session Enrollment Exceptional high school students have two options for enrolling in UCI classes without formal admission to the University: UC Irvine Extension's ACCESS UCI program is ideal for well-pre\u00ad pared high school seniors who have exhausted the curriculum available in high school and who are looking for advanced-level course work, or for students who are seeking an enrichment course or course work not available at their high school. For information, call (949) 824-5414; e-mail: unex-services@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http:i/unex.uci.edu/courses/access_uci/. UC Irvine Summer Session is another option for highly qualified high school seniors to enroll in regular UCI courses. For further information, contact the UCI Summer Session Office at (949) 824-5493; e-mail: summer-session@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://summer.uci.edu. Admission and enrollment in courses either through ACCESS UCI or UC Irvine Summer Session does not constitute admission to UC IRVINE - 2006-200728 UCI 2006-07 Preadmission Matters UCI as an entering freshman student. See the Undergraduate Admissions section of this Catalogue for information about apply\u00ad ing to UCI and the formal admission process. Educational Opportunity Program The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) is designed for stu\u00ad dents with promising academic ability and potential despite a low\u00ad income or educationally disadvantaged background. EOP is based primarily on family income level. All students served by the pro\u00ad gram must be California residents, with the exception of American Indian students. Admission. Counselors in the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools visit high schools and community colleges through\u00ad out California and meet with prospective students, parents, teach\u00ad ers, counselors, and school officials to discuss the admission and financial aid processes, housing, and the academic opportunities available at UCI. Prospective students indicate their interest in being considered for EOP services on the UC undergraduate application for admission and scholarships and must provide the information requested. Appli\u00ad cation fee waivers are available for low-income applicants who meet the eligibility criteria. Housing. UCI guarantees on-campus housing to all new single undergraduates under the age of 25 who meet the housing applica\u00ad tion deadline. Center for Educational Partnerships In 1996 UCI established the Center for Educational Partnerships to advance cooperative educational relationships among UCI and Cal\u00ad ifornia schools, community colleges, and four-year colleges and universities. In collaboration with the academic deans and UCI fac\u00ad ulty, the Center, and its School-University Partners, offer academic outreach programs for K-12 and community college students. Innovative teacher professional development is provided through the UCI faculty and California Subject Matter Projects in the Arts, Reading and Literature, History and Social Science, Mathematics, and Science Projects. The Early Academic Outreach Program, MESA (Mathematics, Science and Engineering Achievement)\", the Saturday Academy in Mathematics, and Upward Bound programs offer academic-year and intensive summer programs aimed at improving preparation of students from under-served groups for success in higher education. COSMOS (the California State Sum\u00ad mer School for Mathematics and Science) and the Gifted Students Academy, recruiting throughout California and the nation, chal\u00ad lenge even the most accomplished young scholar. The Orange County Transfer Consortium, composed of the County's nine community colleges, sponsors programs designed to increase the transfer rate to UC and UCI, and to identify potential K-12 teachers from among potential community college transfers through its UCI TEACH program. Together with Santa Ana College, the nationally recognized Summer Scholars Transfer Institute is offered each summer on the UCI campus. National collaborations for discipline-specific and interdisciplinary initiatives for curriculum reform, professional development, and student academic services include the Ford and Kellogg Founda\u00ad tions, the U.S. Department of Education (GEAR UP), and the National Science Foundation Mathematics and Science Partnership. The Center is the lead for the National Science Foundation/Univer\u00ad sity of California Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Engineering and Mathematics (CAMP), a program offering faculty\u00ad directed research and mentoring opportunities for undergraduates, and a pathway to graduate and professional schools.

CALIFORNIA RESIDENCE AND THE NONRESIDENT TUITION FEE All students who have not lived in California with the intent to make California their permanent home for more than one calendar year prior to the residence determination date for each quarter or semester they propose to attend the University must pay the Non\u00ad resident Tuition Fee. The residence determination date is the day instruction begins at the last of the University of California cam\u00ad puses to open for the quarter, and for schools on the semester sys\u00ad tem, the day instruction begins for the semester. Laws Governing Residence The rules regarding residence classification for tuition purposes at the Uni\u00ad versity of California are governed by the California Educational Code and implemented by the Standing Orders of The Regents of the University of California. Under these rules adult citizens and certain classes of non-citizens can establish residence for tuition purposes. There are particular rules that apply to the residence classification of minors. Who Is a Resident? Adult students (at least 18 years of age) may establish residence for tuition purposes in California if they are a U.S. citizen, a permanent resident or other immigrant, or a nonimmigrant who is not precluded from establishing a domicile in the U.S. This includes nonimmigrants who hold valid visas of the following types: A, E, H-1, H-4, I, K, L, 0-1, 0-3, R, or V. To establish residence a student must, immediately prior to the residence determination date: 1. Be physically present in California for more than one calendar year, and 2. Must have come to California with the intent to make California the per\u00ad manent home. For example, physical presence within the state of Califor\u00ad nia solely for educational purposes does not constitute the establishment of California residence regardless of the length of stay. 3. Students under 24 years of age whose parents are not residents of Califor\u00ad nia will be required to meet the Financial Independence requirement in order to be classified as a resident for tuition purposes. Residence cannot be derived from a spouse or parents. Requirements for Financial Independence The financial independence requirement will not be a factor in residence determination if the student meets one of the following criteria: I. The student's parents are residents of California. 2. At least 24 years of age by December 31 of the calendar year of the term for which resident classification is requested. 3. Veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces. 4. A ward of the court or both parents are deceased. 5. Has legal dependents other than a spouse or registered domestic partner. 6. A married or registered domestic partner student, a graduate student, or a professional student who was not claimed as an income tax deduction by Expenses and Fees 31 parents or any other individual for the tax year immediately preceding the term for which resident classification is requested. 7. An unmarried undergraduate student, not claimed its an income tax deduction by parents or any other individual for the two tax years imme\u00ad diately preceding the term for which resident classification is requested, who can demonstrate self-sufficiency for those years. 8. Reached the age of majority in California while his/her parents were resi\u00ad dents of this state and the California resident parents leave the state to establish a residence elsewhere and the student continues to reside in Cal\u00ad ifornia after the parents' departure. NOTE: Financial independence is not a factor in residence status for graduate student instructors, graduate student teaching assistants, research assistants, junior specialists, postgraduate researchers, graduate student researchers, and teaching associates who are employed 49 percent or more of full time in the term for which resident classification is requested. Establishing Intent to become a California Resident Relevant indicia that contribute to the demonstration of a student's intent to make California the permanent home include, but are not limited to, the fol\u00ad lowing: registering to vote and voting in California elections; designating a California permanent address on all records (i.e., school, employment, mili\u00ad tary); obtaining a California Driver License or California Identification Card; obtaining a California vehicle registration; paying California income taxes as a resident (including taxes on income earned outside California from the date California residence was established); maintaining a California residence in which personal belongings are kept; licensing for professional practice in California; and the absence of these indicia in places other than California during any period for which residence in California is asserted. General Rules Applying to Minors The residence of the parent with whom an unmarried minor (under the age of I 8) lives is the residence of the unmarried minor. When the unmarried minor does not live with either parent, the residence of the unmarried minor is that of the parent with whom the unmarried minor last lived. An unmarried minor may establish his or her own residence when both parents are deceased and a legal guardian has not been appointed unless the unmarried minor is a minor non-citizen who is precluded by the Immigration and Nationality Act from establishing domicile in the U.S. The residence of an unmarried minor who has a parent living cannot be changed by the unmarried minor's own act, by the appointment of a legal guardian, or by the relinquishment of a parent's right of control. Specific Rules Applying to Minors I. Parent of Minor Moves from California. If the California resident par\u00ad ent(s) of an eligible minor moves from California, the minor will be enti\u00ad tled to resident classification as long as the minor enrolls full-time in a California public postsecondary institution within one calendar year of the parent's departure, and remains physically present in California. This classification will continue until the minor has attained the age of major\u00ad ity and has resided in California for the minimum time required to become a resident. The Financial Independence requirement does not apply to this situation. UC IRVINE - 2006-200732 UCI 2006-07 Preadmission Matters 2. Self-Supporting Minor. Minor students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens may be eligible for resident classification if documentation of physical presence, intent to be a California resident, and self-support through the student's own employment or credit is provided for the entire calendar year prior to the residence determination date. 3. Two-Year Care and Control. Minor students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens may be eligible for resident classification if they have lived with and been under the continuous care and control of an adult or series of adults other than a parent for not less than two calendar years. The adult or series of adults must have been responsible for care and control for the entire two-year period and must be California resi\u00ad dents for 366 days prior to the residence determination date of the term for which resident classification is requested.

Undergraduate students who are the surviving dependents of a California resident who was killed in the 911110 I terrorist attacks of the World Trade Center, the Pentagon Building, or the crash of United Airlines flight 93. Temporary Absences If a nonresident student is in the process of establishing a domicile in Cali\u00ad fornia and returns to his or her former home during noninstructional periods, the student's presence in California will be presumed to be solely for educa\u00ad tional purposes and only convincing evidence to the contrary will rebut this presumption. Students who are in the State of California solely for educa\u00ad tional purposes will not be classified as residents for tuition purposes regard\u00ad less of their length of stay in California. If a student who has been classified as a resident for tuition purposes leaves California temporarily, the absence could result in the loss of California resi\u00ad dence. The burden of proof is on the student to demonstrate through docu\u00ad mentation that he or she (or the parents if the student is a minor) did nothing inconsistent with a claim of continuing California residence during a tempo\u00ad rary absence. Steps that should be taken to retain California residence include, but are not limited to: I. Continue to use a California address on all records (educational, employ\u00ad ment, military, among others). 2. Continue to satisfy California tax obligations.

Students must initi\u00ad ate all changes of status before the registration deadline of the quarter for which they want to be reclassified. (Specific deadline dates are listed on the Registrar's Web site.) Students are strongly encouraged to submit their peti\u00ad tion at the earliest possible date in order to expedite the review process. As long as submission deadlines are met, students may be allowed a period of time no later than the end of the quarter to provide any additional documenta\u00ad tion required for residence determination. Incorrect Classification Any student found to be incorrectly classified as a resident is subject to non\u00ad resident classification and to payment of all previously unpaid Nonresident Fees. If a student has concealed information or furnished false information, and was classified incorrectly as a result, the student is also subject to Uni\u00ad versity discipline. Resident students who become nonresidents of California must immediately notify the UCI Residence Deputy. Inquiries and Appeals Inquiries regarding residence requirements, determination, and/or recognized exceptions should be directed to the University of California, Irvine, Resi\u00ad dence Deputy, Registrar's Office, 215 Administration Building, Irvine, CA 92697-4975, telephone ('?49) 824-6129, or to the Principal Legal Analyst, Residence Matters, I Ill Franklin Street, 8th Floor, Oakland, CA 94607- 5200.

For dependent students, an analysis of the FAFSA and supporting doc\u00ad uments determines the amount a student and the student's parents can be expected to contribute toward the cost of the student's edu\u00ad cation. For independent students, the analysis determines the amount a student and, if applicable, a spouse, can contribute to the cost of the student's education. Income, assets, size of family, and the number of family members in college (excluding parents) are the major factors considered in the analysis. Assets include, but are not limited to, equity in real estate other than family residence; stocks, bonds, and other securities; business equity; and cash, sav\u00ad ings, and checking accounts. Income includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and nontaxable income such as Social Security, Veterans' benefits, and foreign income. All undergraduate financial aid applicants are required to apply for a Pell Grant, and eligible California residents are required to apply for a Cal Grant. The application deadline for Cal Grants is March 2 for the following academic year. Special Expenditures. Financial aid recipients who are in need of money for special expenditures (beyond the cost of books and basic supplies associated with certain courses of study) may make an appointment to see a financial aid counselor to explore the possibil\u00ad ity of a budget extension, based on the availability of funds. Exam\u00ad ples of such special expenditures include special equipment for stu\u00ad dents with disabilities and computer purchases. Eligibility Requirements Federal financial aid programs are subject to regulations that define the crite\u00ad ria students must meet to qualify and maintain eligibility for those programs. The regulations state that a student must: (I) be a U.S. citizen or an eligible noncitizen of the U.S.; (2) be accepted for admission to the University; (3) be enrolled in good standing at the University; units taken through the Univer\u00ad sity Extension program are not counted toward half-or full-time enrollment; (4) demonstrate financial need (except for William D. Ford Federal Direct Unsubsidized, Loans and Federal PLUS loans); financial need is the differ\u00ad ence between the reasonable, approved expenses of attending UCI and all available resources, including the expected contribution from parents, the stu\u00ad dent, and any outside aid; (5) maintain satisfactory academic progress for financial aid, as outlined below; (6) be registered with the Selective Service if the student is a male at least 18 years old, born after December 31, 1960, and not on active duty with the armed forces; (7) not owe a refund on a federal grant or be in default on a federal educational loan. Once a student meets the above criteria, disbursement of financial aid funds is made only if the student does not have outstanding debts owed to UCI. UCI POLICY ON SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR FINANCIAL AID Undergraduate and Graduate Students In defining student eligibility for financial aid, the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1986 state that a student must maintain \"satisfactory progress in the course of study the student is pursuing, according to the stan\u00ad dards and practices of the institution at which the student is in attendance.\" Federal regulations of May I 982 state that each institution shall establish, publish, and apply \"reasonable standards\" for assuring that every student UC IRVINE - 2006-200734 UCI 2006-07 Preadmission Matters receiving need-based financial aid should maintain \"satisfactory progress in his/her course of study.\" Final Federal regulations, published October 6, 1983, state that \"in order to receive student financial aid under the programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act, a student must be main\u00ad taining satisfactory progress in the course of study he or she is pursuing according to the standards and practices of the institution in which he or she is enrolled.\" Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements for Financial Aid The following requirements for satisfactory academic progress for receipt of financial aid apply to all applicants for any financial aid awards administered by the UCI Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships who entered prior to fall 2006.

Grade evaluation. As defined below, units for the following grades will not be counted toward meeting the minimum unit/clock-hour requirement. Undergraduate and graduate students: F (Failure), I (Incomplete), NP (Not Pass), U (Unsatisfactory), W (Withdraw), NR (No grade reported), Repeat courses (Repeat of a D grade or higher; repeat of an advanced standing or high school course). Medical students: F (Failure), NR (No grade reported), Repeat courses (Repeat of aD grade or higher). 3. Incomplete courses-medical students. Clock-hours for a grade of Incomplete (I) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress for the quarter/quintile during which the student took the course. If the student fails to meet the requirements for removing the I and the I becomes a grade ofF, the clock-hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the student's satisfactory academic progress record. 4. Courses in progress-medical students. Clock-hours for courses In Progress (IP) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress during the first quarter/quintile of a course requiring more than two quarters/quin\u00ad tiles for completion. Should the student fail to receive a passing grade, after the course has been compl_eted the clock -hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the student's satisfactory academic progress record. \\ Deficiencies in Satisfactory Academic Progress and Their Effect on Receiving Financial Aid The requirements for undergraduate and graduate student satisfactory acade\u00ad mic progress stated above are monitored each quarter and at the end of each academic year. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress will have their financial aid eligibility affected in the following manner. I. Quarterly totals-unit and GPA a. Cumulative GPA below the minimum required total: Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive financial aid funds for that academic year but the GPA deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter of that academic year or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the following academic year will be dependent upon clearing the GPA deficiency. Note: GP.A: deficiencies must be cleared at a University of Califor\u00ad nia campus. b. Unit deficiencies: i. Enrolled in less than the minimum units required but at least six per quarter. Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive financial aid funds for that academic year but the unit deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter of that academic year or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the following academic year will be dependent upon clearing the unit deficiency. ii. Enrolled in less than six units per quarter. Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive campus-based financial aid funds for that academic year but the unit deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the following academic year will be dependent upon clearing the unit deficiency. UC IRVINE - 2006-20072. Academic year totals-units and GPA. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships will verify the cumulative totals for units and GPA after the conclusion of spring quarter. Students who have unit and/or GPA deficiencies will be required to make up the deficiency prior to receiving any future finan\u00ad cial aid funds, including funds that would be used for payment of fees. 3. Quarter limits of eligibility. At the end of each quarter students will be notified by the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships if they are nearing the quarter limit of eligibility for financial aid. The notice will indicate how many quarters of eligibility remain. Students also will be notified when they have completed the maximum number of quarters of eligibility for financial aid. \u00b7 Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals After failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress, a student will be considered for financial aid only when one of the following conditions has been met: (a) sufficient units/clock-hours have been completed and/or the minimum cumulative GPA requirement has been satisfied, or (b) it is estab\u00ad lished through the financial aid appeals process that the student encountered some type of extenuating circumstances during the quarter(s) in question which hindered academic performance (e.g., prolonged hospitalization, death in the family). Appeals Procedure Students wishing to appeal must submit the UCI Financial Aid Appeal Request Form (available from the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships); a letter to the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships stating their reasons for failing to meet the unit, clock-hour, or GPA progress requirements, and whether or not they have solved their difficulties; and any other requested documents. Undergraduate and graduate students may seek the assistance of the University Ombudsman in the preparation of appeals. Medical students may seek the assistance of the Associate Dean of Student and Resident Affairs in the preparation of appeals. They may also be required to submit a degree check, course plan, or letter from their dean. Undergraduate Students-All relevant material will be presented to the Financial Aid Appeals Board (the Board is composed of Financial Aid pro\u00ad fessional staff). Once material has been reviewed, the Board will decide whether eligibility for aid will be reinstated. In the event the Board decides not to accept an appeal, the student will be given the right to a personal inter\u00ad view with the Board. If the student decides to exercise this right, a final rec\u00ad ommendation based upon the interview and written material will be made by the Board and forwarded to the Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships for a final decision. Graduate Students-Appeals are reviewed by (I) the Graduate Advisor of the student's advanced degree program and (2) the Dean of Graduate Studies, \u00b7 who will make the final recommendation to the Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships for a final decision. Medical Students-All relevant materials will be presented to the Committee on Promotions and Honors. If the Committee, after consideration of the appeal, determines that the appeal should be approved, its decision will be forwarded to the School of Medicine Director of Financial Aid, and aid will be reinstated. In the event the appeal is denied by the Committee, the student will be given the right to a personal interview with the Committee. The Com\u00ad mittee will forward the final decision to the School of Medicine Director of Financial Aid for implementation. UCI OFFICE OF FINANCIAL AID AND SCHOLARSHIPS STUDENT WITHDRAWAL POLICY Students who withdraw from UCI prior to completing 60 percent of the period for which they received federal financial aid will be subject to both the UC Fee Refund Policy and the Federal Return of Title IV Funds policy. Title IV Funds are federal funds awarded to a student to meet educational expenses. Examples of Title IV Funds include: Pell Grants, Federal Supple\u00ad mental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG), Federal Direct Loans, and Federal Perkins Loans. Cancellation of Enrollment. Students who cancel their registration or have their registration cancelled by the University prior to the first day of classes will be invoiced for all financial aid disbursed on their behalf. The full text of this official policy is available on the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships Web site at http://www.ofas.uci.edu/. Financial Aid 35 Any student contemplating withdrawing from the University should contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships to speak with a financial aid counselor concerning the financial ramifications of withdrawing. Students who are receiving a Cal Grant should also contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships to discuss the ramifications of withdrawing on their Cal Grant status. Students should check with their financial aid coun\u00ad selor on how they may be able to re-establish a quarter of eligibility for their Cal Grant. Scholarships Scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic ability, achieve\u00ad ment, and promise. They do not require repayment. Although a few honorary scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic excel\u00ad lence alone, many also require that an applicant demonstrate finan\u00ad cial need. UCI offers students with proven high academic achieve\u00ad ment and leadership potential three top honors awards: Regents', Alumni Association, and Chancellor's Achievement. The scholar\u00ad ships have stipends which range from $1,000 to $9,000; or, in the case of Regents' Scholarships, may provide an amount up to full demonstrated need. Entering Freshman and Transfer Students Students who are entering UCI in the fall must complete the UC Application for Undergraduate Admission and Scholarships and submit the application by November 30. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships automatically collects information about applicants' scholarship qualifications. Applications that meet the requirements are reviewed by the Board on Undergraduate Scholar\u00ad ships, Honors, and Financial Aid. Information about the Alumni Scholarship is available in the UC Application for Undergraduate Admission and Scholarships, however separate application is required for the Alumni Scholarship. Restrictive Endowment Scholarships Eligibility requirements for Restrictive Endowment Scholarships vary greatly and are restricted in terms of such student characteris\u00ad tics as geographic location, family background, academic major, and career goals. For the most part, these scholarship awards are based on the student's established financial need. All UCI students will be considered for Restrictive Endowment Scholarships based upon information from the UC Application for Undergraduate Admission and Scholarships and their current academic records.

UC IRVINE - 2006-200738 UCI 2006-07 Undergraduate Admissions UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS The UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools (OARS) is responsible for the admission of new undergraduate freshman and transfer students. Inquiries may be addressed to: UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, 204 Administration Build\u00ad ing, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-1075; World Wide Web: http://www.admissions.uci.edu/. OARS is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday; telephone (949) 824-6703. The information on admission to UCI presented below is organized as follows: Categories of Application Admission as a Freshman Applicant Admission as a Transfer Applicant Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission of International Students Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Credit Application Procedures Categories of Application An undergraduate applicant is a student who wishes to complete a program of study leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science degree. \u00b7 A freshman applicant is a student who has graduated from high school or has completed a California Certificate of Proficiency, an equivalent proficiency examination from another state, or the Gen\u00ad eral Educational Development (GED) Certificate, but has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions immediately following graduation are excluded in the determination of freshman status. The University considers a transfer applicant as a student who has completed high school and who has been a registered student in a regular session at another college or university. Students who meet this definition cannot disregard their college record and apply as freshmen. To be considered as a California community college transfer applicant to UCI, a student must have completed at least 30 semester units/45 quarter units at one or more California com\u00ad munity colleges. A nonresident applicant is a studen\"t whose legal permanent resi\u00ad dence (as determined by the University) is outside of the State of California. Nonresident applicants are generally required to pay Nonresident Tuition and must also present a higher grade point average than is required of California residents. Refer to the Non\u00ad resident Admission Requirements section for further information. An applicant for readmission is a student who was formerly regis\u00ad tered and enrolled at UCI arid who has interrupted the completion of consecutive quarters of enrollment. See Readmission: Under\u00ad graduate and Graduate Students. A second baccalaureate applicant is a college graduate who because of a change of objective wishes to obtain a second bache\u00ad lor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. An international applicant is a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States. Admission as a Freshman Applicant The undergraduate admissions policy of the University of Califor\u00ad nia is guided by the University's commitment to serve the people of California and the needs of the State, within the framework of the California Master Plan for Higher Education. The University's eligibility requirements follow the guidelines set forth in the Master Plan, which specify that the top one-eighth of the State's high school graduates be eligible for admission to the University of California. These requirements, described in detail in the Minimum Admission Requirements for Freshmen section, are designed to ensure that all eligible students are adequately pre\u00ad pared for University-level work. Meeting eligibility requirements entitles an applicant to be considered for admission but does not constitute an offer of admission. In recent years, the number of freshman applicants to UCI has exceeded the number of spaces available. Since the campus cannot admit all eligible applicants, it must use standards that are more demanding than the minimum UC requirements to select students. These standards, which the University calls selection criteria, are used to identify applicants who have demonstrated the highest academic achievement and who have a variety of other qualities that can contribute to the strength and diversity of the campus community. In the case that UCI is unable to accommodate all qualified appli\u00ad cants in their first-choice major, those students who indicate a valid alternate major may be offered admission in that major. Students who wish to change their major after enrolling at UCI must submit .an Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major to the academic counseling office in the school or program of their prospective major. ADMISSIONS SELECTION UCI seeks to\u00b7 select students who have a demonstrated record of academic and personal achievement. The primary criterion for admission to UCI is academic excellence, including the number of college preparatory courses completed; the level of achievement in these courses, including honors, Advanced Placement, Interna\u00ad tional Baccalaureate, and college courses completed; and the qual\u00ad ity of the senior-year program as measured by the type and number of academic courses in progress or planned. Also considered are the high school grade point average (GPA) calculated on UC-speci\u00ad fied -subjects (UCI uses a maximum of eight honors grade points in determining the UC GPA) and the required standardized.\"ni!tional examinations. The level of performance needed to gain admission varies from year to year depending on the size and the academic quality of the applicant pool and the number of enrollment spaces. I A secondary criterion in UCI's selection process is personal achievement outside the classroom. A range of pursuits is consid\u00ad ered, including academic activities, the creative and performing arts, community service and leadership, athletics, participation in pre-collegiate programs that develop academic ability, and other extracurricular activities. Persistence counts more than scattered involvement, while initiative and curiosity are also important. The admissions process at UCI is also sensitive to individual cir\u00ad cumstances and the effect these may have had on the resources available to and the experiences of applicants. While all applica\u00ad tions receive careful consideration, reviewers take note of any extenuating circumstances and/or a variety of cultural and eco\u00ad nomic situations, including students who are the first in their fami\u00ad lies to attend college, who have a low family income, or who have worked in support of their family during high school. The empha\u00ad sis, however, is less on the personal circumstances of the applicant and focuses instead on how the applicant has responded to chal\u00ad lenges while achieving academic success. Two or more members of the admissions committee read most applications, and every attempt is made to become familiar with the unique accomplishments of each applicant. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Students interested in the majors below should be aware of the fol\u00ad lowing provisions. Dance and Music: Applicants to either Dance or Music/Music Per\u00ad formance must audition and be selected by faculty. Engineering: Applicants to any of the Engineering majors must complete four years of high school mathematics, including at least one year beyond intermediate algebra. Computer Science and Engineering (offered jointly by the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences and The Henry Samueli School of Engineering): Applicants must complete four years of high school mathematics, including at least one year beyond intermediate algebra. (This requirement does not apply to other majors offered by the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences.) MINIMUM ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR FRESHMEN . The University defines a freshman applicant as a student who has graduated from high school or completed a California Certificate of Proficiency, or the General Educational Development (GED) examination, and who has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions are excluded in the determination. Freshman applicants who are not residents of California should refer to the Nonresident Admission Requirements section. Applicants who do not meet the requirements for admission at the time of high school graduation may be considered for admission after they meet the requirements for admission as a transfer appli\u00ad cant (see Admission as a Transfer Applicant). Transfer credit will be granted for an acceptable course from an accredited college or university taken while still in high school if reported on a valid transcript issued by the college which conducted the course. The requirements described below represent the minimum acade\u00ad mic standards students must attain to be eligible for admission to the University. Meeting minimum eligibility requirements does not guarantee admission. Admission to UCI and the program of choice often requires students to meet more demanding standards. California Residents There are three paths to satisfying the University's minimum admission requirements for freshmen students: Eligibility in the Statewide Context, Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC), and Eli\u00ad gibility by Examination Alone. Eligibility in the Statewide Context Eligibility in the Statewide Context is the pathway by which most students attain UC eligibility. To be Eligible in the Statewide Con\u00ad text, students must receive' a high school diploma or equivalency and satisfy the Subject, Scholarship, and Examination Require\u00ad ments described below. UC Subject Requirement To satisfy the UC Subject Requirement, students must complete the 15 yearlong high school courses described below. These courses are also known as the \"a-g\" subjects. (A one-year course is equal to one unit; a one-semester course is equal to one-half unit.) At least seven of the 15 yearlong courses must be taken during the last two years of high school. California High School Students: Courses taken to satisfy the Sub\u00ad ject Requirement must be certified by the University as meeting the requirement and must be included on the UC-certified course list of the school the student attended. The high school counselor or principal will have a copy of this list. In addition, the lists are available online at http://www.ucop.edu/doorways. Undergraduate Admissions 39 The UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools will review and accept courses that meet the requirements for appli\u00ad cants graduating from out-of-state schools. Required \"a through g\" Courses a. History/Social Science: 2 years required. Two years of his\u00ad tory/social science, including one year of world history, cultures, and geography; and one year of U.S. history or one-half year of U.S. history and one-half year of civics or American government. b. English: 4 years required. Four years of college-preparatory English that include frequent and regular writing, and reading of classic and modern literature. No more than one year of ESL\u00ad type courses can be used to meet this requirement. c. Mathematics: 3 years required; 4 years recommended. Three years of college-preparatory mathematics that include the topics covered in elementary and advanced algebra and two-and three\u00ad dimensional geometry. Approved integrated math courses may be used to fulfill part or all of this requirement, as may math courses taken in the seventh and eighth grades that are accepted by the high school as equivalent to its own math courses. d. Laboratory Science: 2 years required; 3 years recommended. Two years of laboratory science providing fundamental knowl\u00ad edge in two of these three core disciplines: biology, chemistry, and physics. Advanced laboratory science classes that have biol\u00ad ogy, chemistry, or physics as prerequisites and offer substantial additional material may be used to fulfill this requirement. The final two years of an approved three-year integrated science pro\u00ad gram may be used to fulfill this requirement. e. Language Other Than English: 2 years required; 3 recom\u00ad mended. Two years of the same language other than English. Courses should emphasize speaking and understanding, and include instruction in grammar, vocabulary, reading, composition and culture. Courses in languages other than English taken in the seventh and eighth grades may be used to fulfill part of this requirement if accepted by the high school as equivalent to its own courses. (Students are strongly encouraged to complete three or four years of one language in preparation for the UCI Lan\u00ad guage Other Than English and/or the International/Global Issues breadth requirements.) f. Visual and Performing Arts (VPA): 1 year required. A single \u00b7 yearlong approved arts course from a single VPA discipline: dance, drama/theatre, music, or visual arts. g. College Preparatory Electives: 1 year required. One year (two semesters), in addition to those required in \"a-f' above, chosen from the following areas: visual and performing arts (non-intro\u00ad ductory-level courses), history, social science, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, and language other than English (a third year in the language used for the \"e\" requirement or two years of another language). Courses Satisfying the \"g\" Requirement History: All history courses should require extensive reading and writing. Courses should enable students to establish a breadth of understanding of history (for example, world history, political his\u00ad tory, or economic history) and should provide an understanding of the human past, including its relation to the present. Courses should develop a student's critical thinking, ability to evaluate his\u00ad torical data, and ability to analyze and synthesize evidence. Social Science: Courses should be in one of the social sciences: anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psychology, or sociology, or, alternatively, courses should be interdisciplinary, drawing knowledge from two or more of these fields. Course objec\u00ad tives should inc!ude as many of the following as are applicable to UC IRVINE - 2006-200740 UCI 2006-07 Undergraduate Admissions the field: ( 1) to understand the development and basic features of major societies and cultures, (2) to examine the historic and con\u00ad temporary ideas that have shaped the world, (3) to understand the fundamentals of how differing political and economic systems function, (4) to examine the nature and principles of individual and group behavior, and (5) to study social science methodologies. In order to develop a student's critical thinking, ability to_ evaluate ideas and information, and ability to analyze and synthesize quali\u00ad tative and quantitative evidence in the laboratory and in the field, a social science course must include a body of basic knowledge, extensive reading, and written and oral exposition. Courses which are designed to meet state-mandated social studies graduation requirements are acceptable provided that they meet the above criteria. Courses of an applied, service, or vocational charac\u00ad ter are not acceptable social science electives. English: All English courses should require substantial reading with frequent and extensive practice in writing which is carefully evaluated and criticized. A course in creative writing, journalism, speech, or debate is acceptable if it meets the general requirements in reading and writing stated above. An advanced-level course in English as a Second Language (ESL) or Engiish Language Devel\u00ad opment (ELD) may be acceptable provided it meets the standards outlined under the \"b\" requirement. Advanced Mathematics: Acceptable electives are courses in mathematics with second-year algebra as a prerequisite such as trigonometry, linear algebra, precalculus (analytic geometry and mathematical analysis), calculus, and probability and statistics. A computer science course is an acceptable mathematics elective if it fulfills the following objectives. The course should enable each student to express algorithms in a standard computer language such as C++, Pascal, Java, BASIC, FORTRAN, or COBOL. By the end of the course, each student should complete substantial program\u00ad ming projects in the language used. The course should also involve the study and mastery of various aspects of computer science: how computers deal with data and instructions, the internal components of a computer, and the underlying computer logic. Laboratory Science: Acceptable courses should cover topics from the biological or physical sciences in which students make their own observations and measurements and analyze these data to obtain further information. An introductory science course normally offered in the ninth grade, (such as earth science or physical science) is an acceptable science elective provided it is designed to prepare students for laboratory science courses in the tenth grade and beyond. The course must provide an introduction to the fundamental principles of physical and/or biological science. Laboratory activities as defined above shall be included. (A terminal course designed only to meet gradua\u00ad tion requirements is not an acceptable science elective.) Language Other Than English: It is recommended that elective courses be in the same language used to satisfy the language other than English \"e\" subject requirement. Elective courses in this lan\u00ad guage must have at least two years of the language as a prerequi\u00ad site. In order for a second language to qualify as an elective, at least two years of this language must be completed. Visual and Performing Arts: Courses in this area consist of instruction in dance, drama/theatre, music, and visual arts. Courses should enable students to understand and appreciate artistic' expres\u00ad sion and, where appropriate, to talk and write with discrimination about the artistic material studied. Courses devoted to artistic performance and developing creative artistic ability should have prerequisites (either one year of intro\u00ad ductory course work or experience approved by the instructor) and should assume proficiency beyond the introductory level. Courses must require on average the equivalent of a five-period class per week. Work outside of class must be required; for exam\u00ad ple, portfolio/performance preparation, reading, writing, research projects, and/or critical listening/viewing. Dance courses offered for physical education credit or under any other departmental arrangement are acceptable provided they include content satisfying the above criteria. Courses which are primarily athletic or body conditioning are not acceptable visual and performing arts electives. College Preparatory Electives: The general objectives of the \"g\" requirement are to improve students' analytical abilities, pro\u00ad mote artistic development, and strengthen oral and written skills. The requirement is intended to encourage prospective University students to fill out their high school programs with courses that: (1) strengthen general study skills, particularly analytical reading, expository writing, and oral communication; (2) provide ari oppor\u00ad tunity to begin work that could lead directly into a major program of study at the University; (3) experience, at some depth, new areas of academic disciplines that might form the basis for future major or minor studies at the University. Courses that fulfill the \"g\" requirement should allow students to prepare for college-level work in the subject area, so that the level attained at the end of such courses would be well beyond the intro\u00ad ductory or survey level. Courses that have narrow objectives aimed at meeting specific societal or personal lifestyle goals are not acceptable. Scholarship Requirement The Scholarship Requirement defines the grade point average (GPA) students must earn in the required \"a-g\" subjects and the SAT Reasoning Test (or ACT Assessment plus Writing Test) and SAT Subject Test scores students must earn to be eligible for admission to the University. The University uses an Eligibility Index-a combination of GPA and test scores-to determine if an applicant meets the Scholarship Requirement. The Eligibility Index is available online at http://www.universityofcalifomia.edu/admissions/scholarshipreq. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007The University calculates the GPA in the \"a-g\" subjects by assign\u00ad ing point values to the grades a student earns, totaling the points, and dividing the total by the number of \"a-g\" course units. Points are assigned as follows: A = 4 points, B = 3 points, C = 2 points, D = 1 point, and F = 0 points. Only grades the student earns in \"a-g\" subjects in grades 10-11, including summer sessions, are used to calculate the GPA. Courses taken in the ninth grade can be used to meet the Subject Require\u00ad ment if the student earns a grade of C or better, but they will not be used to calculate the GPA. Honors Courses: The University assigns extra points for up to eight semesters of University-certified honors-level and Advanced Placement courses taken in the last three years of high school: A=5 points, B=4 points; C=3 points. No more than two yearlong UC\u00ad approved honors level courses taken in the tenth grade may be given extra points. A grade of D in an honors or Advanced Place\u00ad ment course does not earn extra points. The courses must be in the following \"a-g\" subjects: history/social science, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, lan\u00ad guage other than English, and visual and performing arts. Also, they must be certified as honors courses by the University. In these subjects, as well as in computer science, acceptable honors-level courses include Advanced Placement courses, Higher Level and designated Standard Level International Baccalaureate courses, and college courses that are transferable to the University. D and F Grades: If a D or F was earned in an \"a-g\" course, the course must be repeated with a grade of C or better. The original D or F grade will not be included in the GPA calculation, and the new grade will be used. If a student repeats a course in which a grade of C was initially earned, the second grade will not be used. Eligibility in the Local Context Under the Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC) pathway, the top four percent of students at each participating California high school are designated UC-eligible and guaranteed admission to one of UC's nine general campuses. \u00b7 To be considered for ELC, students must complete 11 specific yearlong courses of the Subject Requirement by the end of the junior year and, with the assistance of each participating high school, the University will identify the top four percent of students on the basis of GPA in the UC-approved course work completed in the tenth and eleventh grades. \u00b7 The 11 units include: one year of history/social science, three years of English, three years of mathematics, one year of laboratory sci\u00ad ence, one year of language other than English, and two years cho\u00ad sen from among the other subject requirements. The University will notify ELC students of their status at the beginning of their senior year. Students designated UC-eligible through ELC must submit the University's application for admis\u00ad sion during the November filing period and complete remaining eligibility requirements-including the Subject and Examination Requirements-to enroll. Applicants confirmed as Eligible in the Local Context (ELC) will be considered along with multiple factors for admission selection during comprehensive review. Comprehensive information about ELC is available online at http://www.ucop.edu/sas/elc/. Undergraduate Admissions 41 Examination Requirements All freshman applicants must submit examination scores as described below. Students applying for admission for fall quarter should complete their examination requirements during May or June of their junior year or during their senior year, but no later than the December test date. (Typically, this means that students will take either the SAT Reasoning Test or the ACT Assessment plus Writing Test in October or November, and will take the SAT Subject Tests in November or December.) Scores earned prior to March 2005 will not be accepted. Applicants must ensure that reports for all scores have been submitted directly to the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Each applicant must submit scores on an approved core test of mathematics, language arts, and writing. This requirement can be satisfied by taking either of the following: 1. the ACT Assessment plus Writing Test*, or 2. the SAT Reasoning Test* (critical reading, mathematics, and writing). *The critical reading, mathematics, and writing scores must be from the same sit\u00ad ting. Students who take the ACT will be asked to report scores on each section of the test as well as their composite score. - In addition, all applicants must complete two SAT Subject Tests in two different areas: English, history and social studies, mathemat\u00ad ics (Level 2 only), science, or language other than English. More information about these examinations is a available online. For the SAT Reasoning and Subject Tests, see http://www.collegeboard.com. For the ACT Assessment plus Writing, see http://www.act.org. Do not use the score choice option to withhold reporting of SAT Subject Test scores. UC considers only a student's highest SAT Subject Test scores so there is no advantage to withholding scores. NOTE: The Henry Samueli School of Engineering recom\u00ad mends that freshmen applicants in Engineering majors (including the joint CSE major) take the SAT Subject Test in math Level 2 as one of their required subject examinations. UC IRVINE - 2006-200742 UCI 2006-07 Undergraduate Admissions UC Eligibility Index The University uses an Eligibility Index to specify the combina\u00ad tions of GPA and standardized test scores applicants must earn to meet UC's minimum requirements. Because of recent changes in the standardized tests the University requires, UC faculty are reviewing the index. The revised index, along with an online calcu\u00ad lator that students may use to make a preliminary assessment of their eligibility, is av~ilable at http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/ admissions/scholarshipreq. Eligibility by Examination Alone A student who does not meet the requirements for Eligibility in the Statewide Context or Eligibility in the Local Context may be able to qualify for admission to the University by examination alone. To qualify this way, a student must satisfy the same examination request as students who are eligible in the statewide context, earn\u00ad ing high scores on the standardized tests. Because of the recent changes to the ACT and SAT, the minimum scores for eligibility by examination alone are being revised. The new scores are avail\u00ad able at http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/examonly. Students who have completed 12 or more units of transferable col\u00ad lege work cannot qualify for admission by examination alone; nor can students qualify if they have taken a transferable college course in any academic subject that is covered by the SAT Subject Tests. Applicants who are currently attending high school may qualify for admission to the University by examination alone without complet\u00ad ing their high school program. Admission as a Transfer Applicant The University defines a transfer applicant as a student who has completed high school and who has been a registered student in another college or university or in college-level extension classes other than a summer session immediately following high school graduation. UCI considers a California community college transfer applicant as a student who has completed at least 30 semester units/45 quarter units at one or more California community col\u00ad leges. A transfer applicant may not disregard the college record and apply for admission as a freshman. (Transfer applicants who are not residents of California should also refer to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements.) Preliminary Admissions-in-the-Field: UCI's Preliminary Admis\u00ad sions-in-the-Field (PAIF) program offers on-the-spot provisional admission to well-qualified students from participating California community colleges. Although admission to UCI is selective in most majors, through PAIF, admission can be guaranteed for trans\u00ad fer students who meet the selection criteria (see PAIF Selection Guidelines later in this section). SELECTION CRITERIA UCI attempts to accommodate as many qualified transfer applicants as possible. Priority consideration for admission of transfer appli\u00ad cants is given to junior-level applicants (with a minimum of 60 semester/90 quarter units of transferable credit) from California community colleges and is based upon: (1) GPA in transferable courses; (2) depth of preparation toward general education and major requirements; and (3) participation in the PAIF (Preliminary Admission-in-the-Field) program, which requires early completion of a transferable English and mathematics course. Applicants with the strongest academic performance will be the most competitive for admission. Junior transfers from four-year colleges, including other UC campuses, and lower-division transfers will be consid\u00ad ered as space permits. Applicants for fall quarter admission must complete required English composition and mathematics courses by the end of the spring term. Applicants for winter or spring quarter must complete required English composition and mathe\u00ad matics courses by summer or fall terms, respectively. In the case that UCI is unable to accommodate all qualified appli\u00ad cants in their first-choice major, those students who indicate a valid alternate major may be offered admission in that major. Students who wish to change their major after enrolling at UCI \u00b7must submit an Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major to the academic counseling office in the school or program of their prospective major. This is of particular importance to those who apply in majors which are subject to additional course prerequisites and/or have a limit placed on the number of applicants admitted into the major. (See the following list.) Some transfer applicants are selected based upon consideration of the academic criteria in conjunction with the following personal achievement criteria: an exceptionally challenging curriculum; out\u00ad standing accomplishments relevant to academic aims; hardships or unusual circumstances the applicant has faced, and the ways in which the student has responded to these challenges; a strong, thoughtful match between UCI's programs and the student's acade\u00ad mic and career objectives, preparation, talents, and skills; and potential contributions to the campus. The level of performance needed to gain admission varies from year to year depending on the size and the academic quality of the applicant pool and the number of enrollment spaces. Transfer applicants to the majors listed below must complete pre\u00ad requisite courses for the major as specified. Applied Ecology: Junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall and who satisfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission to the Applied Ecology major.

ADMISSION FOR A SECOND BACHELOR'S DEGREE A student whose educational objective has changed substantially after receiving the bachelor's degree may be considered for admis\u00ad sion to a program for a second degree. Admission as a candidate for a second bachelor's degree requires that the applicant be fully eligible for admission to the University and have strong promise of academic success in the new major. All such admissions are sub\u00ad ject to the approval of the dean or director of the UCI school or program in which the second degree will be earned. Students who have not attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should complete the undergraduate application for admission and scholarships, available online at http://www.univeristyofcalifornia.edu/apply. Students who want a copy of the application mailed to them can e-mail their request to ucinfo@ucapplication.net, and include their name and address, the term for which they are applying, and whether they are a freshman or transfer applicant. Students who have attended UCI as under\u00ad graduates during a regular academic quarter should obtain and complete a Second Baccalaureate Application form through the Registrar's Office. Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission requirements for applicants who are not California resi\u00ad dents vary slightly from requirements for California residents. How\u00ad ever, all nonresident freshman and transfer applicants are subject to the same selection criteria as California residents, as explained in a previous section. Refer to the Expenses and Fees section for infor\u00ad mation regarding residence classification for tuition purposes and the Nonresident Tuition Fee. NONRESIDENT FRESHMAN APPLICANT A nonresident freshman applicant must (1) graduate from a region\u00ad ally or state-accredited high school, or complete an appropriate proficiency examination; (2) complete satisfactorily the \"a-g\" pat\u00ad tern of subject requirements listed under requirements for Califor\u00ad nia residents; (3) earn a grade point average of at least 3.4 or UC IRVINE - 2006-2007higher in the required high school subjects (3.0 is equal to a B average); (4) meet the examinati<;m requirement: either the ACT Assessmen(plus Writing Test or the SAT Reasoning Test (critical reading, mathematics, and writing). In addition, all applicants must complete two SAT Subject Tests in two different areas: English, history/social science, mathematics (Level 2 only), science, or lan\u00ad guage other than English; and (5) meet the Eligibility Index for non\u00ad residents. NONRESIDENT TRANSFER APPLICANT The minimum admission requirements for nonresident transfer applicants are the same as those for residents, except that nonresi\u00ad dents must have a grade point average of 2.8 or higher in all trans\u00ad ferable college course work. ADMISSION OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS The credentials of an international undergraduate applicant-a stu\u00ad dent who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States~are evaluated in accordance with the general regulations governing admission. The application should be submitted to the University of California Undergraduate Application Processing Service early in the appropriate application filing period. This will allow time for exchange of necessary correspondence and, if the applicant is admitted, will help the student in obtaining the neces\u00ad sary passport' visa. Official certificates and detailed transcripts of records should be submitted directly to the UCI Office of Admis\u00ad sions and Relations with Schools only when requested. International applicants whose native language is not English will be required to demonstrate their English proficiency. This is most often accomplished by achieving a minimum score of 550 (paper\u00ad based) or 213 (computer-based) on the Test of English as a Fcireign Language (TOEFL), or with a score of 7 (academic module) on the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examina\u00ad tion. Arrangements to take the TOEFL may be made by writing directly to TOEFL/TSE Services Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 6151, Princeton, NJ 08541-6151, USA; mation about the IELTS test, see http://www.ielts.org/. Students must ask the Educational Testing Service or IELTS to forward results of their tests to the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Completion of an acceptable English composition course (as determined by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools) with a grade of Cor better will also clear the Eng\u00ad lish proficiency requirement for international applicants. Students who wish to improve their English proficiency to meet the TOEFL or IELTS requirement may enroll in the intensive Program in English as a Second Language sponsored by UC IrVine Exten\u00ad sion. Information is available from English and Certificate Programs for Internationals, UC Irvine Extension, P.O. Box 6050, Irvine, CA 92616-6050; telephone (949) 824-5991. In addition to achieving a minimum TOEFL or IELTS score, all international students whose native language is other than English must take an Academic English/English as a Second Language Placement Test upon arrival and prior to registration. Based upon the results of this test, students may be required to improve certain language skills by enrolling in Academic English/English as a Sec\u00ad ond Language courses during their first year, with other major course work being adjusted accordingly. Generally, financial assistance and scholarships from the Univer\u00ad sity are not available to the nonimmigrant-visa student. Interna\u00ad tional students must provide proof that sufficient funds will be available to meet their educational commitments while studying in Undergraduate Admissions 45 the United States. International undergraduate students are consid\u00ad ered as nonresidents of California and are required to pay nonresi\u00ad dent tuition in addition to fees paid by legal residents of California. Please direct all inquiries regarding the undergraduate admission of international students to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY OF PERMANENT RESIDENT, REFUGEE, AND INTERNATIONAL (F-1 VISA) STUDENTS: ACADEMIC ENGLISH/ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE Any student (a) whose first or native language is not English, (b) whose verbal scores on the Writing section of the SAT Reasoning Test fall below a set level, (c) who has not satisfied the UC Entry Level Writing requirement, and (d) who has received a letter from the AEIESL Program requiring them to take the AEIESL Place\u00ad ment Test, or any such student without a verbal SAT Reasoning Test score, must take an Academic English/English as a Second Language Placement Test (AEIESLPT) prior to the first quarter of enrollment, regardless of the student's TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score, IELTS (International English Language Testing System) score, or TSWE (Test of Standard Written Eng\u00ad lish) score. Also, any student who is identified as an ESL student through the UC Analytical Writing Placement Examination must take the AEIESLPT. The test is given prior to the beginning of each quarter, during Welcome Week prior to the beginning of fall quarter instruction, and on dates to be announced.

Based upon the results of the test, students may be required to enroll in AE/ESL courses prior to enrolling in any other required writing courses. Students required to enroll in AE/ESL courses must begin satisfying their AE/ESL requirements within their first or second quarter at UCI. They must take these courses in consecu\u00ad tive quarters. The AE/ESL requirements are to be completed within the first six quarters at UCI. Students who have not satisfied the AE/ESL requirements by the end of their sixth quarter will be inel\u00ad igible to enroll for a seventh quarter at UCI. The UC Entry Level Writing requirement must be satisfied during the quarter following the completion of AE/ESL requirements. If the AE/ESL require\u00ad ments are completed during the first quarter of enrollment, the UC Entry Level Writing requirement must be satisfied before the beginning of the fourth quarter of enrollment. AE/ESL courses, offered by the School of Humanities and listed in the School's section of this Catalogue, include classes in writing, speaking and listening, and reading and vocabulary development. CREDIT FOR AE/ESL COURSE WORK Students whose first language is not English may receive up to 12 baccalaureate credits for AE/ESL course work. Students may receive workload credit for courses taken beyond this 12-unit limit but will not receive additional credits applicable to the bachelor's degree. CREDIT FOR NATIVE LANGUAGE Students whose first language is not English may receive credit for course work in their native language and literature, provided such courses were completed at the college level in the country of the vernacular, or at the upper-division or graduate level at UCI or another accredited English-speaking institution. Some restrictions apply; see the School of Humanities section for information. Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Credit Advanced Placement (AP). Students who earn scores of 3, 4, or 5 on the College Board AP examinations will receive credit toward graduation at UCI. The unit and subject credit allowed toward degree requirements assigned to each test are shown in the accom\u00ad panying chart. International Baccalaureate (IB). Students completing the IB diploma with a score of 30 or above will receive 30 quarter units (20 semester units) total toward their UC undergraduate degree. The University grants 8 quarter units (51/3 semester units) credit for certified IB Higher Level examinations on which a student scores 5, 6, or 7. The University does not grant credit for Standard Level examinations. Some higher-level examinations may be used to fulfill course requirements in lower-division major or general education/breadth requirements. For detailed information see the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools' Web site at http://www.admissions.uci.edu/ib_chart.html. UC IRVINE - 2006-200748 UCI 2006-07 Undergraduate Admissions The units granted for IB examinations are not counted toward the maximum number of credits required for formal declaration of an undergraduate major or the maximum number of units a student may accumulate prior to graduation from the University. Students who enter the University with IB credit do not have to declare a major earlier than other students nor are they required to graduate earlier. Duplicate Credit. Students should be aware that AP examinations, IB examinations, and college courses taken prior to or after enrolling at the University may be duplicative. In these cases, the University will award credit for only one of these. Students cannot earn units or grade points at UCI in courses from which they have been exempted on the basis of AP or IB credit. Students who elect to enroll in courses for which they have already received AP or IB credit will have those courses specially coded on their transcript without unit or grade credit. However, some examinations exempt the student from a greater number of UCI units than the number of AP or IB units earned. In such cases, the student may elect to take the final course in the series for credit. Application Procedures The University prefers that students applying for admission use the online application for admission and scholarships, which helps stu\u00ad dents file a more accurate and complete application by using error messages to highlight common mistakes and missing information. Privacy guards help ensure information stays secure. Apply online at http://www.universityofcalifomia.edu/apply. Students who do not have easy online access may download a print\u00ad able application form (available at http://universityofcalifomia.edu/ admissions/download) or request a printed copy by e-mailing ucinfo@ucapplication.net. When requesting a printed application by e-mail, be sure to include name and address, the term to which applying, and the applicant level (i.e., freshman or transfer). A non\u00ad refundable application fee of $60 ($70 for international students). must accompany the application. This basic fee entitles the appli\u00ad cant to be considered at one campus; for each additional campus selected, an additional $60 fee is required. Applicants concerned with admission or application procedure questions specific to UCI should communicate directly with the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-1075; World Wide Web: http://www.admissions.uci.edu/. Office hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday; tele\u00ad phone (949) 824-6703. WHEN TO APPLY FOR ADMISSION To ensure that applications will be considered for admission by both UCI (or other UC campuses) and the student's choice of major or program of study, the completed application and the application fee should be submitted during the priority filing period. Each campus accepts for consideration all applications it receives during this period. Additionally, students required to fulfill the examination requirements for freshman admission should make arrangements to take the standardized tests early. Completing the examination requirement (SAT Reasoning Test or ACT Assessment plus Writing Test and two SAT Subject Tests) no later than the December testing date of the senior year of high school is required for students applying for the fall quarter. Quarter to be Priority Application Admitted at UCI Filing Dates Winter quarter, 2007 File July 1-30, 2006 Spring quarter, 2007 File October 1-30, 2006 Fall quarter, 2007 File November 1-30, 2006 Winter quarter, 2008 File July 1-30, 2007 Spring quarter, 2008 File October 1-30, 2007 After the priority filing period has ended, campuses will accept applications only if they still have openings for new students. Most campuses are unable to accept ;1pplications after the formal filing period closes. Students are advised to check with the UCI Office of Admis\u00ad sions and Relations with Schools to find out if applications are being accepted for winter or spring terms. TRANSCRIPTS The UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools (OARS) requires complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about a student's academic program and work in progress in order to process and respond to the application in a timely manner. The transcript and other documents submitted as part of the application become the property of the University; they cannot be returned or , forwarded in any form to another college or university. Freshman Applicants. Applicants will be notified if a preliminary high school transcript is required. Applicants are also responsible for asking testing agencies to report examination scores for either the SAT Reasoning Test or ACT Plus Writing Test and two SAT Subject Tests to OARS. Once students are admitted and decide to enroll at UCI, an official final high school transcript showing an official graduation date must be forwarded to OARS even if a stu\u00ad dent attends summer session. Official final transcripts should arrive in OARS by July 15 for those students admitted for fall quarter. Those students entering in the winter or spring quarters must have their transcripts sent to OARS within one month of the completion of the term of the school from which they entered. A California Certificate of Proficiency, the results from a proficiency test from any state, or a General Education Development (GED) Certificate can be accepted in place of a high school diploma. Delays in receiving official transcripts will disadvantage students in the acad\u00ad emic advising process and can affect enrollment in appropriate courses. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Transfer Applicants. Transfer students should not send transcripts unless requested to do so. It is essential that applicants accurately complete the self-reported college credit information in the appli\u00ad cation because it will be used for initial admission screening. Once students are admitted and decide to enroll at VCI, an official tran\u00ad script from each college attended and the high school from which they graduated must be sent to OARS even if a student attends sum\u00ad mer session. Final official transcripts should arrive in OARS by\u00b7 July 15 for those students admitted for the fall quarter. Summer\u00ad session transcripts must be submitted by September 15. Students entering UCI in the winter .or spring quarters must have their final official transcripts sent to OARS within one month of the comple\u00ad tion of the term of the school they are currently attending. Delays in receiving official transcripts will disadvantage students in the academic advising process and can affect enrollment in appropriate courses. EXAMINATION ARRANGEMENTS Students should make arrangements to take the SAT Reasoning Test and SAT Subject Tests with the Educational Testing Service; con\u00ad tact the College Board/SAT Program, NJ 08541-6200; World Wide Web: http:/lwww.collegeboard.com. For the ACT Assessment Plus Writing, students should contact the American College Testing Program Registration Unit, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, lA 52243; World Wide Web: http:/lwww.act.org. (Test fees should be paid to the testing services, not to the Univer\u00ad sity.) At the same time the test is taken, students should request that their scores be reported to the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. To prevent confusion or unnecessary delay, it is important to use precisely the same form of the student's name on both the application for admission and the test materials. In 2006-07 the SAT Reasoning Test and SAT Subject Tests are offered concurrently on the following Saturday mornings: October 14, 2006; November 4, 2006; December 2, 2006; January 27, 2007; March 10, 2007 (SAT Reasoning Test only); May 5, 2007; and June 2, 2007. In 2006-07 the ACT Assessment Plus Writing Test is offered on the following dates: September 16, 2006; October 28, 2006; December 9, 2006; February 10, 2007; April 14, 2007; and Ju.ne 9, 2007. Details on testing are available from the College Board, the Ameri\u00ad can College Testing Program, and from most high school counsel\u00ad ing offices. NOTIFICATION OF ADMISSION Most fall quarter freshmen applicants are notified of their status between March 1 and 31. Transfer applicants are usmilly notified by May 1. In some cases for transfer applicants, complete tran\u00ad scripts of course work and/or a mid-term progress report are required before a final decision can be made; such records will be requested by OARS. Note that these target dates apply only to those applicants who submitted their applications during the fall priority filing period (November 1-30). Those students who apply after the priority period will be notified as soon as possible after March '31. Statement of Intent to Register Students who wish to attend UCI must return a Statement of Intent to Register (SIR). The SIR serves to notify UCI of the student's decision to accept or not accept its offer of admission. Before com\u00ad pleting and returning their SIR, students who have applied to more than one campus are advised to take as much time as is appropriate in considering their response to each campus. However, it is essen\u00ad tial that students allow enough time to meet the stipulated deadline. Once they have decided which campus to attend, students should Undergraduate Admissions 49 submit their positive SIR and nonrefundable $100 deposit (if applicable) either electronically or by mail. Students must submit their SIR by the following deadline: Freshmen entering fall 2007: May 1, 2007 Transfers entering fall 2007: June 1, 2007 Freshmen and transfers entering winter 2008: October 15, 2007 Freshmen and transfers entering spring 2008: refer to the spe\u00ad cific date on their admit letter. (UCI seldom accepts applicants for a spring term.) Electronic Filing: Students are encouraged to return their SIR elec\u00ad tronically by accessing the Office of Admissions and Relations with ' Schools Web site at http:/lwww.admissions.uci.edu/ and link to \u00b7 ~ \"MyAdmissionsApplication@UCI.\" Students submitting an SIR electronically are required to pay their $100 Acceptance of Admis- .\u00b7 sion Fee by credit card. Fee waivers are also available online. Filing by Mail: :Students who are unable to submit their SIR online may download and print an SIR from the OARS Web site. Students must return the printed SIR along with the $100 Acceptance of Admission Fee (if requested), made payable to UC Regents, to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, 204 Administra\u00ad tion Building, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-1075. Students who are not able to either submit their SIR electronically or download an SIR from the OARS Web site should contact OARS -at the address listed above and/or call (949) 824-6703. Admission to UCI is not an assurance of receiving financial aid nor does it guarantee assignment to University housing. Separate applications are required of applicants desiring financial aid and/or University housing, and receipt of communications from the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, the Housing Office, or any office other than the OARS does not imply that eligibility for admission has been established. Student Records Access and Disclosure At UCI, an \"applicant\" becomes a \"stlldent\" at the time of submis\u00ad sion of the SIR. Information regarding access to student records and disclosure of student record information (both public and con\u00ad fidential) may be found in the Appendix. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007INFORMATION FOR ADMITTED STUDENTS ORIENTATION Each May information about UCI's orientation programs sponsored by the Office of the Dean of Students is sent to admitted students who plan to enroll in the fall. Student-Parent Orientation Programs (SPOP) are held three times during the summer. SPOP is designed to help new students and their parents with the transition to UCI. Academic advising, housing information and tours, and the registration process are all part of the program. Participants and their parents live in residence halls, and the program fee covers room, board, and program costs. Mini-SPOPs (intensive one-day events) are held in July and August for students and parents who are unable to attend the multi\u00ad day programs. These programs also include academic advising and general campus information. Transfer Success is a unique one-day program geared to the needs of transfer students. Held in early September, the program provides access to campus resources, a graduate school preparation work\u00ad shop, and more. Winter Quarter Orientation is held each January for new incom\u00ad ing transfer students. For more information about all of the orientation programs, visit http://www.dos.uci.edu/orientation; telephone (949) 824-5182; or send e-mail to orientation@uci.edu. Welcome Week features a variety of academic and social activities for new and returning students and is scheduled a few days prior to the beginning of fall quarter classes. For more information, visit http://www.dos.uci.edu/welcomeweek. DIVISION OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION The core mission of the Division of Undergraduate Education is to provide campus leadership, programs, and services which enhance the quality of undergraduate education at UCI. An advocate and steward for educational excellence, the Division works with all academic units, programs, and members of the UCI community to foster a climate of learning, discovery, and engagement for every undergraduate student. Through its diverse and innovative pro\u00ad grams and services, the Division provides support for student acad\u00ad emic achievement, for a rich and coherent curriculum, and for out\u00ad standing teaching through the integration of teaching and research activities and the facilitation of effective pedagogy. The Division of Undergraduate Education is responsible for the following programs and services: the Campuswide Honors Pro\u00ad gram, which also administers the Scholarship Opportunities Pro\u00ad gram; the Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program and the International Opportunities Program; the Peer Academic Advising Program and academic advising for Undecided/Undeclared students; the First-Year Inte\u00ad grated Program; the Undergraduate and Academic Resource Center; Student Acad\u00ad emic Advancement Services; the Testing Office; the Instructional Resources Center and the Instructional Technology Center; class\u00ad room and computer support; administration of the UCDC Acade\u00ad mic Internship Program and the UC Center Sacramento Scholar Intern Program; and the organization of the campus' student orien\u00ad tation programs in cooperation with the Division of Student Affairs. The Division is also responsible for the Freshman Seminar Program where students are introduced to the research university and encouraged to become active participants in intellectual inter\u00ad actions with their peers and professors. The Division's programs and services are described in detail below. The Division is responsible for the administration of the revised Academic Honesty Policy (adopted by the UCI Academic Senate on December 12, 1996; see the Appendix) as it relates to under\u00ad graduates, and for implementing the Student Recommended Fac\u00ad ulty Program, initiated at UCI in 1969. This is the only such pro\u00ad gram in the U.S. that affords undergraduates the opportunity to identify, select, and propose recruitment of nonrenewable faculty appointments in curricular areas of particular interest not repre\u00ad sented at UCI. Call (949) 824-7328 for information. Additionally, the Division's Office of Research and Evaluation evaluates various programs and conducts research on topics related to undergraduate education such as student retention, academic needs, course grades, enrollment patterns, and curricular issues, and also provides data on the characteristics, attitudes, behaviors, and experiences of undergraduates. Academic Advising At the time of admission to UCI every undergraduate student is assigned to the school that offers the student's selected major. Stu\u00ad dents who have indicated \"Undecided/Undeclared\" as a major on their UC application for admission and scholarships receive assis\u00ad tance from the Undecided/Undeclared Advising Program until they select an academic major. Jurisdiction over all questions of academic regulations and acade\u00ad mic standing rests with the dean of the school to which a student is assigned or, in the case of undecided/undeclared majors, with the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education. Each academic unit provides academic advising for its students and processes requests to add or drop courses, waive or change graduation or other requirements, or change majors. Students are responsible for knowing the governing regulations of the school or program to which they are assigned. While each academic unit is responsible for maintaining a system which provides academic advising, these systems differ from unit to unit. In some, all of the faculty serve as advisors; in others, only certain members of the faculty are designated as advisors. All advising offices include academic counselors, professionals who assist students in planning their program, selecting a major, and making progress toward a degree. Peer academic advisors (trained upper-division students) assist students in many of the same areas as academic counselors. In addition, they are able to answer ques\u00ad tions relating to student life issues, providing a student perspective. Responsibility for informing students of the names of their advi\u00ad sors rests with the dean or chair of the appropriate academic unit. This is done normally by letter; however, students may obtain information by telephone from the office of the appropriate dean or chair. Telephone numbers for academic advising offices are listed in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue. New students are encouraged to plan their academic programs with an academic counselor shortly after being admitted. The optimum time to initiate contact with an academic counselor is before the student enrolls in classes. The academic counselor can help the stu\u00ad dent determine whether the classes the student wishes to take are appropriate to the student's level of preparation, whether the pro\u00ad posed classes fit within the student's educational goals, and whether the classes wiii help meet some of the requirements for graduation. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007In some schools and programs, consultation between students and their faculty advisors is mandatory. Regardless of whether or not consultation between student and advisor is required, students are responsible for initiating and maintaining periodic contact with \u00b7their assigned faculty advisor. The actual frequency of these meet\u00ad ings will be determined by the desires of the student, the advisor,\u00b7 and the unit's governing regulations. Each quarter, new students are required to go to the appropriate academic dean's office prior to registration for advice concerning class enrollment. Finish in Four Advising Many UCI entering freshmen graduate in four years, with appro\u00ad priate planning. Students who wish to be assured of earning their degree in a timely manner should contact the academic counseling office for their major to receive information about Finish-in-Four Advising and assistance in developing a detailed curricular plan. Undecided/Undeclared Students Students who enter the University as freshmen or sophomores may be uncertain about which major they should choose and may not feel ready to declare their major or even to identify their interests with a particular school. Such students participate in the Unde\u00ad cided/Undeclared Advising Program which is administered by the Division of Undergraduate Education. This program is located in 256 Administration Building; telephone (949) 824-6987. The goal of the Undecided/Undeclared Advising Program is to help students make the best informed and most rational choice of a major that is possible. All students at UCI are required to choose their major by the time they reach junior status. To make a good decision about what major to declare, students sh.ould know what programs UCI offers and have some experience with them, have a good knowledge of their own abilities and inter\u00ad ests, have clear educational goals, and have a good sense of their vocational goals and of the academic programs at UCI that will provide appropriate preparation. Students in the Undecided/Unde\u00ad clared Advising Program receive quarterly individualized staff counseling that helps them explore the variety of course offerings on campus, become more aware of their own interests and abilities, formulate sound educational goals, and learn how to prepare for graduate education and/or possible careers. Students also meet with faculty. To assist students in choosing a major, the program has created a required course designed to expose undecided/undeclared stl!\u00ad dents to a variety of opportunities and resources available to; them, and to introduce students to each of the schools and majors offered. In addition, students learn about research and career opportunities within different disciplines. Courses in University Studies University Studies 2 UCI-Majors (2).

UC IRVINE - 2006-200754 UCI 2006-07 Information for Admitted Students Honors Opportunities UCI offers many challenging honors opportunities to its most moti\u00ad vated students. These include a comprehensive Campuswide Honors Program, which enrolls outstanding students from all majors from the freshman through senior years; a variety of major-specific hon\u00ad ors programs at the upper-division level; the Humanities Honors Program, also offered at the upper-division level, but open to all majors on campus; and several Excellence in Research programs. These programs offer some of the advantages usually associated with selective liberal arts colleges: rigorous, small, personalized classes and the intellectual exchange that creates a community of scholars. The difference, however, is that UCI's programs have the support and benefit of the resources of a major research university, including a renowned faculty, research opportunities, and the 30.5- million-volume University of California Library system (of which UCI Library collections number some 2.4 million volumes). Honors students are also encouraged to participate in the Education Abroad Program, the International Opportunities Program, the UCDC Academic Internship Program, or the UC Center Sacra\u00ad mento Scholar Intern Program during their junior or senior year. Qualified students are also encouraged to take advantage of resources available in the Scholarship Opportunities Program (SOP) and the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). These programs are described in a later section. Campuswide Honors Program Founded in 1988, the Campuswide Honors Program (CHP) is avail\u00ad able to selected-high-achieving students in all academic majors from their freshman through senior years. It maintains an active ros\u00ad ter of approximately 600 students. Many CHP students have contin\u00ad ued their studies after graduation from UCI at the most prestigious graduate and professional schools in the country. CHP provides talented and successful UCI students with a special honors curriculum consisting of small, seminar-style classes, close interaction with peers, mentorship by UCI's top faculty, and the opportunity to participate in undergraduate research. Enhanced advising support provides students with assistance in applying for prestigious scholarships, internships, graduate and professional schools, and education abroad. Completion of the Campus wide Honors Program is noted on the student's transcript and baccalau\u00ad reate diploma. Admission. Admission to the program as an incoming UCI fresh\u00ad man is by invitation only; all eligible candidates are reviewed and selected by faculty representatives from each academic unit. Trans\u00ad fer and other students are eligible to apply for admission to CHP up until the first quarter of their junior year, if they have a mini\u00ad mum grade point average of 3.5. CHP seeks to admit students who have a demonstrated passion for learning, a willingness to explore and take risks, and academic excellence in a range of disciplines outside of their major area. Curriculum. Students pursue three year-long interdisciplinary Honors core courses (one course per quarter), satisfying various cat\u00ad egories of the breadth requirement. Many of these courses provide an interdisciplinary approach to major subjects and issues. Faculty from a variety of disciplines are. chosen especially for their teach-\u00b7 ing ability and scholarship. Participants pursue original research under the direct supervision of faculty members, culminating in the production of an honors thesis, creative project, or publication\u00ad quality paper. Many CHP students also participate in major-spe\u00ad cific honors programs. The senior honors thesis that is developed and produced through these programs satisfies the CHP research and thesis requirement. \u00b7\u00b7 Freshmen CHP students begin their course of study by taking hon\u00ad ors sections of the Humanities Core Course. Team-taught by pro\u00ad fessors from various disciplines in the School of Humanities, the Humanities Core Course is organized around major themes. Cur\u00ad rently, the focus is \"Associations/Disassociations: The Social Instinct and Its Consequences.\" Faculty from a wide range of disci\u00ad plines exemplify the ways in which humanists approach issues from philosophical, historical, and cultural perspectives. In small discussion sections, students put those perspectives into practice in their own writing and in classroom conversations and debates designed to engage each student intellectually in the examination of law and the regulation of society. The Critical Issues in the Social Sciences sequence is team-taught by professors from the Schools of Social Sciences and Social.Ecol\u00ad ogy. Topics have included human vision; authority (dis)obedience, and human society; decisions and compromises and their rewards and penalties; human language and its disablement; and exotic societies (including our own). The Idiom and Practice of Science interdisciplinary sequence explores the role science plays in addressing socially significant problems. Students develop the ability to understand scientific models and to judge the content, merit, and limitations of many issues of science in the modern world. The development of analyti\u00ad cal and writing skills is emphasized. Topics have included earth\u00ad quakes, chemistry in the environment, radiation/radioactivity, evo\u00ad lution/aging, the mathematics of power, biodiversity/conservation, genetic plant engineering, the physics of music, and calculus. CHP students are eligible to participate in other lower-division Honors courses on the campus, along with other qualified students. These include the following courses: Honors General Chemistry covers the same material as Chemistry lA-B-C, but in greater depth. Honors General Chemistry Labora\u00ad tory is also offered. Honors Organic Chemistry, designed for Chemistry and Biology majors and anyone else interested in a research career, offers a smaller class size and the opportunity for interactions and experi\u00ad ences not possible in the larger Chemistry 51 series. It is usually taken in the sophomore year, after completion of the General Chemistry lecture and laboratory sequence. Honors Calculus, especially recommended for prospective Mathe\u00ad matics majors and others with a particular interest in mathematics, covers the same material as Mathematics 2D-E, but with greater emphasis on the theoretical structure of the subject matter. The Honors Introduction to Computer Science sequence is open to CHP students majoring in Information and Computer Science and other students by consent. The first course introduces basic con\u00ad cepts, fundamental laws and principles of software and hardware organization, program construction, applications, and policy and social issues. The second course covers in-depth concepts of pro\u00ad gramming and mathematical tools for analyzing programs. The third builds on this background with respect to mathematical tools and analysis. Extracurricular Activities. CHP students are invited to participate in many social and cultural activities, including weekly coffee hours, beach bonfires, poetry readings, faculty lectures, movie and play nights, trips to museums, and a camping retreat. Honors stu\u00ad dents also produce a quarterly creative writing journal, and contin\u00ad uing Honors students may volunteer for the Peer Mentor Program, providing assistance to incoming Honors students. On-Campus Housing. CHP students are guaranteed on-campus housing, as long as they meet the Housing procedures and dead\u00ad lines. Freshmen may choose to live in Middle Earth in \"The Shire,\" or in Mesa Court in \"Lorna.\" Sophomores and upper-division stu\u00ad dents who wish to live in Honors housing may also select one.of the Honors houses in Arroyo Vista. These residences offer a valu\u00ad able living/learning experience with other Honors students and the community spirit that is a special feature of CHP. Students bring to UC IRVINE - 2006-2007the living experience their vitality, creativity, and dynamic dedica\u00ad tion to learning.

Center for International Education The Center for International Education (CIE) includes the Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program (EAP) and the International Opportunities Program (lOP). CIE is a comprehensive resource and counseling center which helps students take advantage of the many worldwide opportunities that exist for study, work, internship, volunteering, research, and non-credentialed teaching which relates to their degree programs at UCI. Studying abroad is an important resource for achieving the skills, knowledge, and understanding that will make today's undergradu\u00ad ates effective citizens and leaders in local, national, and global affairs once they depart the University. In today's political and business environment, college graduates must be informed deci\u00ad sion-makers with a capacity to reflect on their own values while understanding the complex identities, histories, and cultures of oth\u00ad ers. Studying abroad provides students with the language skills and cultural competence necessary to meet the current demands of business, government, and educational institutions. Professional staff and international peer advisors, who have returned from an lOP or EAP experience, are available to guide students in making appropriate choices of international programs Division of Undergraduate Education 57 for their educational goals. Group and individual advising is avail\u00ad able every day that UCI is in session. All EAP and lOP partici\u00ad pants are provided with pre-departure orientations, an EAP or lOP Student Guide handbook, and reentry orientations upon their return to UCI. CIE, EAP, and lOP are located in 1100 Student Services II; tele\u00ad phone (949) 824-6343; e-mail: cie@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www.cie.uci.edu/. EDUCATION ABROAD PROGRAM The Education Abroad Program (EAP) of the University of Cali\u00ad fornia offers students the opportunity to experience a different cul\u00ad ture while making progress toward degree objectives. EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with about 150 host universities and colleges in 35 countries throughout the world. Programs are available for students in every\u00b7major. The wide variety of programs includes those offering general curricu\u00ad lum, intensive language study, and programs focusing on a specific academic subject area. Selected EAP programs may satisfy por\u00ad tions of the UCI breadth requirement. A summary of EAP opportu\u00ad nities is available on the next page. Students are advised to plan early in their academic career in order to best match studying abroad with their major to graduate on time. Preliminary guidance is available at the EAP Academic Planning Web site (http://www.cie.uci.edu/academics/academicplanning.html). The cost of studying abroad through EAP is often comparable to the cost of studying at UCI. Participants pay the same education and registration fees normally paid for a similar period at UCI, plus room, board, books, round-trip transportation, on-site orienta\u00ad tion, intensive language program expenses (when applicable), and any other personal expenses. All UC financial aid (other than work-study), including grants, scholarships, and loans, is available to EAP students who qualify. Both need-based and merit-based scholarships specifically for study abroad are also available. Infor\u00ad mation is available at http://www.cie.uci.edu/finaid.html. While abroad, the academic and personal well-being of EAP stu\u00ad dents is typically the responsibility of a UC professor serving as an on-site EAP Study Center Director. The Study Center Director oversees local operations, including in-country orientation, student academic advising and grade assessment, and serves as UC's liai\u00ad son to the host institution. In some countries with small enroll\u00ad ments, the duties of a Student Ceriter Director are performed by a local faculty liaison officer or administrative coordinator. Students interested in EAP should visit the Web site (http://eap.ucop.edu/) to review program options and visit the CIE Web site (http://www. cie.uci.edu), or come to the CIE office for advising and to obtain an application. UCI EAP deadlines are available at http://www.cie. uci.edu/DeadlinesByCountry.html. INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM UCI's International Opportunities Program (lOP) is the link between UCI students and any international educational experience that occurs outside the boundaries of the U.S. and is not a part of the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP). Any UCI student (undergraduate, graduating senior, or graduate) in good academic standing, regardless of major, class level, or foreign language abil\u00ad ity, may participate in lOP. CIE staff provide information and counseling to assist students in finding an appropriate program to meet their needs and interests. Students may choose from academic study (with transferable credit), paid work, paid or unpaid internships, unpaid or compensated vol\u00ad unteer service, field research, and paid teaching opportunities in nearly every country in the world. This includes all academic pro\u00ad grams sponsored by U.S. institutions that occur on foreign soil or UC IRVINE - 2006-2007EAP Summary of Opportunities PROGRAM DURATION ELIGIBILITY ~ ~ .. e .. a = 8 .. = .. c ... -~ EAP ~ e ... \u00b7a E Program** Applications Due ~ ... = = = \"' \" til til til .., til Australia* 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fall: January Year/Spring: April/May Barbados 0 0 0 0 0 All: Janu31)'/Febru~ Brazil* 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fall: January/February/March Year/Spring: April/May Canada 0 \u00b7Fall/Year: January/February Spring: April/May Chile* 0 0 Fall: January/February Year/~ring: AI>_ril/May China 0 0 0 0 0 0 Summer/Fall/Year: December/January Spring: April/May Costa Rica* 0 Year/Spring (San Jose): April/May Spring (Monteverde): October/November Denmark 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Summer/Fall/Year: January Spring: April/May Egypt 0 0 0 0 Year: January/February France 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Year/Fall: January /February Spring: April/May/June Summer: October/November Germany 0 0 0 0 0 0 Year/Fall: January Year/Fall (Berlin, BEST): November to February Spring: October Spring (BEST): April to June Ghana 0 0 0 0 0 0 All: January/February Hong Kong 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fall/Year: January Spring: April/May Hungary 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fall/Year: January/February Spring: April to June India 0 0 0 0 Fall: January Ireland (Re].J_ublic of) 0 0 0 0 Year: November/December Israel 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 programs on hold for 2006-07 Italy 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Summer/Fall/Year: October to January Spring Semester: April/May Siena Spring Quarter: October Japan 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fall/Year: November to February Spring 2006-Meiji Gakuin and 2007-ICU, Doshisha, Meiji Gakuin and Tsuru: April/May Korea (Republic of) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Summer/Fall/Year: January/February Spring: April to June Mexico 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Summer/Fall/Year January/February (Winter _prog.ram also available) Winter/Spring: April/May Netherlands 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fall/Year: January/February Spring: April/May New Zealand* 0 0 0 0 0 All: April/May Phili!JI>!nes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 prog.rams on hold for 2006-07 Russia 0\u00b7 0 0 0 0 Fall: January/February Singapore 0 0 0 0 . .

UC IRVINE - 2006-200760 UCI 2006-07 Information for Admitted Students 2. Enrolling in sections of the Humanities Core Course designated \"S/A.\" (NOTE: Students held for UC Entry Level Writing and enrolled in the Humanities Core must enroll in a S/ A section of the Core Course during their first quarter. Successful completion of the writing component of these sections of this course with a letter grade of C or better will satisfy the requirement. Students who do not receive a letter grade of C or better in Humanities lA SIA in fall quarter and who continue to be held for UC Entry Level Writing must enroll in Humanities 1B SIA during the win\u00ad ter quarter and satisfy the requirement by earning a letter grade of C or better.) 3. Taking English WR 37, WR 39A, or WR 39AP with Computer Lab and receiving a letter grade of C or better in that course. The Pass/Not Pass grade option may not be used to satisfy the UC Entry Level Writing requirement. Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the UC Entry Level Writing requirement. Continuing UCI stu\u00ad dents may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy this requirement. AMERICAN HISTORY AND INSTITUTIONS This requirement may be met by one of the following options: 1. Completion in high school of one year of United States history with grades of C or better, or one semester of United States his\u00ad tory and one semester of United States government with grades of C or better; or 2.

Acceptable UCI courses: United States history-History ment-Political Science 21A. UCI Requirements UNIT REQUIREMENT Credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units, earned by examination, by other evaluation, or course work is required. A course normally offers four quarter units of credit. GRADE REQUIREMENT A minimum grade average of at least C (2.0) is required (1) over\u00ad all, (2) in all of the courses required for the major program, and (3) in the upper-division courses required for the major program. Higher averages than this may be required only in honors pro\u00ad grams. Students who fail to attain a C (2.0) average in courses required in the major program may, at the option of the major unit, be denied the privilege of pursuing a major program in that unit. In this context, \"the courses required in the major program\" are defined as the courses required for the major and offered by the program of the student's major (or programs, in the case of an interdisciplinary or interdepartmental major). A major can include additional courses required for the major in this set, with the approval of the Council on Education Policry. In this case, the list of additional courses is published in the Catalogue with the \u00b7 requirements for the major. RESIDENCE REQUIREMENT At least 36 of the final 45 units completed by a student for the bachelor's degree must be earned in residence at the UCI campus. Exceptions to this rule may be allowed, with prior departmental approval, to students enrolled in the Education Abroad Program, the UCDC Academic Internship Program, the UC Center Sacra\u00ad mento Scholar Intern Program, or the International Opportunities Program with International Study Advance Contract. BREADTH REQUIREMENT Among the many possible purposes for breadth requirements, the one that stands out at UCI is that of introducing students to the basic modes of thought that characterize academic disciplines. In order to know ourselves and the world, we need to know first the ways these can and have been known. Thus the breadth require\u00ad ment at UCI requires students to devote a substantial amount of their course work, especially in their first years, to connected series of courses which provide a coherent experience within such areas as the natural and social sciences, humanistic inquiry and the arts, and the nature of symbolic systems. Several other aims that UCI regards as especially desirable are con\u00ad sistent with this chief purpose and are embodied to varying degrees in the UCI breadth requirement: to cultivate a historical conscious\u00ad ness of society and culture; to acquaint students with fundamental ways of thinking different from their own or that of their gender, class, and culture with a view to expanding their sense of human possibilities and awakening an awareness of the conditioned nature of their own assumptions about the world; to equip students with a broad understanding of the contemporary world and its cultural, political, scientific, and technological problems; to equip students with the skills essential to understanding and grappling with these problems; to establish bridges and to understand relationships between academic disciplines; and to provide students with some intellectual experiences which virtually all can be assumed to have had in common and thus to introduce them to what, after all, a uni\u00ad versity has traditionally been supposed first and foremost to be, an intellectual community. The breadth requirement is\u00b7 a graduation requirement and, with the exception of the lower-division writing requirement, need not be satisfied during only the lower-division years. To satisfy the breadth requirement, courses are required in each of the following categories: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences III. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Mathematics and Symbolic Systems VI. Language Other Than English VII. Multicultural Studies and InternationaVGlobal Issues The specific course combinations and sequences in each area which may be used by students to satisfy the requirement are listed below. A number of the courses listed are available in more.than one academic unit. When a breadth course is cross-listed with another course, that course also is available for fulfillment of the breadth requirement. Students should refer to the actual descrip\u00ad tions of the courses to determine which are cross-listed. These course combinations were selected to ensure that students, in meeting the requirement, be exposed to subject matter, problems, and techniques which would serve as a first introduction to an aca\u00ad demic area, as well as to a connected set of courses which provide a coherent experience in that academic area. With the exception of categories I and VII, a student may count toward breadth no more than a year of work taken within the disci\u00ad pline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy UC IRVINE - 2006-2007may count no more than three quarter courses in Philosophy toward breadth categories II, III, IV, V, or VI. Students fulfill the UCI breadth requirement by completing courses from the list which follows. Students can select from among a vari\u00ad ety of courses, depending upon their area of interest. Some of the course combinations available consist of multiple-quarter courses (such as Chemistry lA-B-C under the Chemistry subsection of \"category II. Natural Sciences\"). Multiple-quarter courses are referred to as being \"sequential,\" meaning that the course work in the earlier courses is prerequisite to the later course work. Students must take each part of a sequential course in alphabetical order (e.g., students must take Chemistry lA before either 1B or lC). Sequential courses are separated by hyphens. Other course combi\u00ad nations consist of single-quarter courses (e.g., Anthropology 2A, 2B, 2C under the Anthropology subsection of \"category III. Social and Behavioral Sciences\") which are related to one another but for which no course in the combination is preparatory to any other course in the combination. Single-quarter course combinations may be taken in any order. Single-quarter courses are separated by com\u00ad mas. Semicolons separate complete course combinations. BREADTH CATEGORIES I. Writing Requirement. Because of the importance of writing in every academic discipline, the University is committed to develop\u00ad ing the writing skills of its students at all levels and in all areas. The Writing Requirement expresses this commitment, but the con\u00ad cern for and attention to clear, accurate writing is expected in all courses. The UCI Writing Requirement consists of three courses beyond the-. UC Entry Level Writing requirement. Except where otherwise noted below, students must satisfy the UC requirement prior to ful\u00ad filling the UCI Writing Requirement. Two of the three courses required must be lower-division courses. Students who have not completed the lower-division writing requirement before the beginning of their seventh quarter at UCI will be subject to probation. Students transferring to UCI normally should have satisfied the lower-division writing requirement before entering UCI; if, however, they have not, they must complete it within their first three quarters of enrollment or they will be sub\u00ad ject to probation. Academic English/English as a Second Language students must complete the lower-division writing requirement before the beginning of the seventh quarter following the comple\u00ad tion of their AEIESL courses or they will be subject to probation. The third course must be an upper-division writing course, and it must be taken only after the successful completion of the lower\u00ad division requirement. Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. Continuing UCI students may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy lower-division or upper-division writing requirements. Lower-Division Requirement: The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). Students may select from the courses specified below: 1. English WR 39B (Critical Reading and Rhetoric) and WR 39C (Argument and Research). 2. English WR 37 (Intensive Writing) and WR 39C (Argument and Research). Recommended students only. 3. Two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course (Humanities lA-B-C) beyond satisfaction of the UC Entry Level Writing requirement. NOTE: Students held for the UC Entry Level Writing requirement and enrolled in the Humani\u00ad ties Core must enroll in a section of the Core Course designated Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree 61 S/A during their first quarter. Successful completion of the writ\u00ad ing component of these sections of this course with a letter grade of C or better will satisfy the UC Entry Level Writing require\u00ad ment. (The Pass/Not Pass grade option may not be used to satisfy it.) For these students, the UCI lower-division writing require\u00ad ment may be satisfied only in the second and third quarters of the Humanities Core Course. Students who do not receive a Cor bet\u00ad ter in Humanities lAS/A in fall quarter and continue to be held for the UC Entry Level Writing requirement must enroll in Humanities lB S/A during the winter quarter and satisfy the requirement by earning a letter grade of C or better. The lower\u00ad division writing requirement will be satisfied in the second and third quarters of the Humanities Core Course for these students. 4. Students who complete English WR 37 or WR 39B with a grade of B (3.0) or better may substitute as the second course of the lower-division writing requirement one of the following courses in creative writing or nonfiction and journalism: English WR 30, WR 31, or WR 38. 5. English WR 39B and University Studies llA-B-C or l2A-B-C, with a grade of C (or Pass) or better in llC or 12C. Upper-Division Requirement: The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). The require\u00ad ment may be satisfied by completing any one of the following: 1. An upper-division course designated on a list of approved courses in the quarterly WebSOC, Searchable Schedule of Classes (http://www.reg.uci.edu) as approved for satisfaction of the requirement. NOTE: All courses approved to fulfill the upper\u00ad division writing requirement should have a \"W\" suffix. Students are encouraged to consult the Searchable Schedule of Classes or their advisor to determine the current upper-division writing requirement course offerings. If a course on the approved list is offered without the \"W\" suffix, it does not satisfy the upper-divi\u00ad sion writing requirement. 2. English WR i09, WR 110, WR 111, orWR 113. Consent of instructor is required. Students may not use such a course to sat\u00ad isfy the requirement unless they have attained a B or better in both courses taken to satisfy the lower-division writing requirement.

If an appropriate means of evaluating competence in a non-English language of instruction does not exist, satisfactory completion, with a C average or better, of two years of formal schooling at the sixth grade level or higher in an institution where the language of instruction is not English will meet the requirement. Appro\u00ad priate documentation must be presented to substantiate that the course work was completed. \u00b7 School, Departmental, and Major Requirements In addition to the University and UCI requirements listed above, each undergraduate student must satisfy the degree requirements for the major and, if applicable, the minor or concentration selected. UCI, school, and departmental or major and minor requirements may overlap; courses taken to fulfill a school or departmental requirement may also help fulfill the UCI breadth requirement. Students are urged to make sure that they understand how many courses are permitted to satisfy more than one requirement. Infor\u00ad mation on specific degree requirements and courses is available in the academic unit sections of this Catalogue. Students must declare a major by the time they reach junior status (90 units excluding college work completed prior to high school graduation), and should make certain that the background and the preparation prerequisite to junior and senior work in, the major have been accomplished. Transfer students should read the section on Information for Transfer Students: Fulfilling Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree. \u00b7 Students should note that with the exception of courses designated .. ,Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used ' to satisfy specific course requirements of the student's school and .'\u00b7 major, unless authorized by the appropriate dean. Additional infor\u00ad : mation on grading is located in the Academic Regulations and Pro- cedures section. \u00b7 Minor Programs 'For certification in a minor, a student must obtain a minimum over\u00ad .. all grade point average of at least C (2.0) in all courses required for \u00b7~ \u00b7 the minor program. No more than two courses applied to a minor f: may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Completion of the minor is noted on a ~\u00b7 student's transcript. (Students are not required to minor in a pro- gram in order to graduate from UCI.) Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student must submit . an online Application for Graduation via the Student Access link at http://www.reg.uci.edu no later than the published deadline. Spe\u00ad cific deadline dates for filing are established quarterly so that can\u00ad didates' academic records can be reviewed to verify that all gradu\u00ad ation requirements have been met. These dates vary among academic units. Students should contact their academic counseling office for deadline and degree audit information. INFORMATION FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS: FULFILLING REQUIREMENTS FOR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE This section provides a guide for transfer students in understanding how their course work from another collegiate institution applies to fulfilling UCI degree requirements. Transfer students should use this information in conjunction with the previous section, Require\u00ad ments for a Bachelor's Degree. Transfer students are required to meet University, breadth, school, department, and major require\u00ad ments described in the Catalogue. The courses and descriptions in this Catalogue may be used by prospective transfer students as a guide for selecting courses of similar content and purpose in their own institutions. No student who has taken a course which is accepted for credit by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools (OARS) and which has been mutually determined with a community college as being acceptable toward completion of the . UCI breadth requirement shall incur any loss of credit in satisfac\u00ad \u00b7.\u00b7 tion of the requirement. \u00b7 . Transfer students are strongly advised to check with the academic counselor in their prospective major or OARS about courses that may be used to satisfy UCI requirements. ~\u00b7Duplicate Credit Prohibited. Students may not receive unit credit 'or earn grade points for college courses in which the content dupli\u00ad cates material of a previously completed course or examination for \"\"\u00b7which the student has been granted college credit. See pages 46-47 for exceptions related to Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate credit. See pages 71-72 for exceptions related to the repeat of deficient grades. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Transfer Students: Completion of the UCI Breadth Requirement Students transferring to UCI must satisfy the UCI breadth require\u00ad ment by completing either: (a) the current UCI breadth require\u00ad ment, (b) one of the options listed in the Catalogue Rights section, or (c) the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum. With the exception of students who complete the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum, transfer students should not feel that the breadth requirement must be completed prior to matriculating to UCI. The breadth requirement, which must be completed prior to graduation, may be satisfied by college-level courses appropriate to UCI offerings and may be met at any time during the undergraduate years, except in the case of the lower\u00ad division writing requirement, which must be completed within the first three quarters of residency at UCI. BREADTH CATEGORIES I. Writing. The lower-division writing requirement is met by tak\u00ad ing an approved one-year sequence in English composition. Courses used to meet the lower-division writing requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). Transfer students may not count any course designed exclusively for satisfaction of the UC Entry Level Writ\u00ad ing requirement toward the completion of the UCI lower-division writing requirement. Any student entering UCI with only one semester or one quarter of English composition through which the UC Entry Level Writing requirement is fulfilled will not have satis\u00ad fied any part of the UCI writing requirement. Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-divi\u00ad sion and upper-division writing requirements. Continuing UCI stu\u00ad dents may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy the lower-division or upper-division writing requirements. II. Natural Sciences. This requirement is met by (a) taking an approved one-year sequence in one of the following areas: general chemistry or basic physics; or by (b) taking two semesters or three quarters of approved courses in biological sciences or physical sci\u00ad ences with the exception of mathematics. These courses may or may not include a laboratory. III. Social and Behavioral Sciences. This requirement is met by taking two semesters or three quarters of approved work in any of the following areas: anthropology, economics, geography, interdis\u00ad ciplinary, linguistics, logic and philosophy of science, political sci\u00ad ence, psychology, sociology, or social ecology. At least one of the courses must be an introductory course. For students on the quarter system, at least two of the courses must be in the same area. (His\u00ad tory, for the purposes of the breadth requirement, is not considered a social or behavioral science but rather an area of humanistic inquiry.) IV. Humanistic Inquiry .. This requirement is met.by taking two semesters or three quarters of approved courses in one of the fol\u00ad lowing areas: arts, humanities, interdisciplinary, or literature. Per\u00ad formance courses in the arts may not be used in satisfaction of this requirement. V. Mathematics and Symbolic Systems. This requirement is met by taking two semesters or three quarters of approved courses in mathematics, computer science, linguistics, or logic. VI. Language Other Than English. This requirement is met by (a) completing the second semester or third quarter of approved college-level study in a language other than English; (b) credit for three years of high school study, or its equivalent, in a single lan\u00ad guage other than English with a C. average or better in the third year; (c) a score of 3, 4, or 5 on a College Board Advanced Place\u00ad ment Examination in a language other than English; (d) a score of 570 or better on a SAT Subject Test in a language other than Transfer Students: Fulfilling Degree Requirements 65 English, with the exception of the test in Modern. Hebrew for which a score of 500 or better is required; (e) completion of an approved course of study in an Education Abroad Program; or (f) the equivalent as determined by an appropriate and available means of evaluation. If an appropriate means of evaluating competence in a non-English language of instruction does not exist, satisfactory completion, with a C average or better, of one year of formal schooling at the sixth grade level or higher in an institution where the language of instruction is not English will meet the require\u00ad ment. Appropriate documentation must be presented to substantiate that the course work was completed. VII. Multicultural Studies and International/Global Issues. This requirement is met by completing one course in multicultural studies (VII-A) and two courses on international/global issues (VII-B). Courses satisfying VII-A specifically address the history, society, and/or culture of one or more minority groups in Califor\u00ad nia and the United States. Courses satisfying VII-B focus on sig\u00ad nificant cultural, economic, geographical, historical, political, and/or sociological aspects of one or more foreign countries. See the breadth course list for alternate ways to satisfy VII-B. INTERSEGMENTAL GENERAL EDUCATION TRANSFER CURRICULUM California community college transfer students may receive credit for the UCI breadth requirement by completing the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) prior to transfer. The IGETC consists of a series of subject/areas and types of courses which, if completed prior to transfer, will satisfy the breadth and general education requirements at any campus of the University of California. Fulfillment of the IGETC does not satisfy the UCI upper-division writing requirement. Students who do not complete the IGETC prior to transferring to UCI must fulfill the UCI breadth requirement in its entirety. In general, students are encouraged to follow the IGETC pattern to meet general education requirements unless otherwise noted by the academic unit at UCI. Please note: (l) IGETC must be completed in total prior to enrolling at UCI; (2) students are responsible for requesting IGETC certifi\u00ad cation from their community college; and (3) the IGETC certifica\u00ad tion should be submitted to the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools no later than the end of the fi.rst quarter of UCI enrollment. Courses used to fulfill the IGETC must be completed with a grade of C or better. (Courses may also be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis provided Pass is equal to a letter grade of C or better.) Lists of specific approved courses which may be taken in fulfill\u00ad ment of the IGETC are available from California community col\u00ad leges and on the World Wide Web at http://www.assist.org/. Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum l. English Communication: One course in English composition and one course in critical thinking/English composition. 2. Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning: One course in mathematics or mathematical statistics which has a pre\u00ad requisite of intermediate algebra. Courses on the application of statistics to particular disciplines are not acceptable. 3. Arts and Humanities: Three courses with at least one in arts and one in humanities. 4. Social and Behavioral Sciences: Three courses from at least two different disciplines, or an interdisciplinary sequence. 5. Physical and Biological Sciences: One physical science and one biological science course; one must include a laboratory. 6. Language Other Than English: Proficiency equivalent to two years of high school courses in the same language. UC IRVINE - 2006-200766 UCI 2006-07 fnformatioh for Admitted Students Transferability of Credit The University is committed to serve as fully as possible the edu\u00ad cational needs of students who transfer\u00b7 from other California colle\u00ad giate institutions. The principles covering transferability of unit credit and course credit are explained below and, unless otherwise indicated, are much the same whether transfer is from a two-year or a four-year institution. Duplicate Credit Prohibited. Students may not receive unit credit or earn grade points for college courses in which the content dupli\u00ad cates material of a previously completed course or examination for which the student has been granted college credit. See pages 46-47 for exceptions related to Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate credit. See pages 71-72 for exceptions related to the repeat of deficient grades. UNIT CREDIT FOR WORK TAKEN ELSEWHERE The University of California grants unit credit for courses com\u00ad pleted at other accredited colleges and universities when such courses are consistent with the functions of the University as set forth in the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. Equiv\u00ad alent advanced standing credit from institutions on the semester calendar may be determined at a ratio of one semester unit to one and one-half quarter units. (To graduate from UCI a minimum of 180 quarter units, equivalent to approximately 45 UCI quarter courses, are needed.) Community Colleges A student may earn a maximum of 105 quarter units (70 semester units) at a community college toward a University degree. No fur\u00ad ther unit credit may be transferred from a community college, although subject, major, or breadth credit for courses taken will still be granted. Students anticipating transfer to UCI are urged to consult with their community college counselors. The counselors, with the aid of that college's UC Transfer Course Agreement (UCTCA), can advise students about California community college courses and units which will transfer to the University. In addition, staff in the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools can advise students about the transferability of courses. UCTCAs for all Cali\u00ad fornia community colleges are available on the World Wide Web at http://www.assist.org/. Four-Year Institutions Unit credit is granted for courses consistent with the University of California's functions and which have been completed in colleges or universities accredited by the appropriate agencies. While limi\u00ad tations of credit may be imposed in certain subject areas, these are consonant with the curricula for all students in the University of California. No defined maximum number of units which can be earned toward the degree is set for students transferring from four\u00ad year institutions. However, see the Residence Requirement in the UCI Requirements section. University of California Extension Extension courses prefixed by XB, XD, XI, XR, XSB, and XSD are granted unit credit on the same basis as courses taken in resi\u00ad dence at any accredited collegiate in_\u00a7titution. Students intending to transfer Extension course credit for a degree at another college or university should verify acceptance of the course with that institution. Resident students of the University of California must obtain the consent of the dean of their school or college prior to enrolling for credit in an Extension course. Exten\u00ad sion courses are not accepted as part of the residence requirements of the University. Grades earned in University Extension are not used in calculating the University grade point average. Decisions regarding the acceptability of extension courses taken in institutions other than the University of California rest with the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Decisions regarding the applicability of such courses toward specific degrees and majors rest with the student's academic dean. COURSE CREDIT FOR WORK TAKEN ELSEWHERE The policies above refer only to the unit transferability of courses and are uniformly implemented on all UC campuses. Thus, courses which are determined by the University of California to be trans\u00ad ferable are assured only of being granted elective course credit. The application of transfer work to specific course and major requirements is determined by the student's academic dean. The Irvine campus makes every effort to eliminate all barriers to orderly progress from California community colleges into UCI's programs. To this end, courses from many California community colleges have been reviewed by UCI faculty and approved as acceptable toward meeting lower-division major or breadth require\u00ad ments. Although course equivalencies for the breadth requirement may be liberally interpreted for purposes of transfer, courses to be applied toward school and departmental major requirements must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in unit value and in content. All California community colleges have entered into articulation agreements with UCI so that the specific application of their courses to UCI's breadth, school, and/or departmental major requirements may be readily communicated to prospective transfer students. By careful selection of courses, it is possible for students to satisfy some or all of the lower-division requirements of their intended program or school prior to transfer. It is recommended that transfer students complete as much of the lower-division breadth, school, and major requirements as possible prior to trans\u00ad ferring to UCI. Articulation agreements are available on the World Wide Web at http://www.assist.org/. Students are urged to consult community college counselors or the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools for informa\u00ad tion on planning a program for transfer. Prospective transfer stu\u00ad dents with specific questions about course work in their major should contact the respective school or department at UCI. ENROLLMENT AND OTHER PROCEDURES Except where noted, all information applies to both undergraduate and graduate students. Additional information concerning enroll\u00ad ment and academic policies applying only to graduate students is presented in the Office of Graduate Studies section later in this Catalogue. Schedule of Classes and Registration Information The Searchable Schedule of Classes, also known as the WebSOC, contains current class offerings including time, room, instructor, capacity, number enrolled and on the waitlist, Web links, status (open, waitlist, full), and more. Access the Schedule on the Regis\u00ad trar's Web site at http://www.reg.uci.edu. The Registrar's Web site also includes registration and related infor\u00ad mation such as quarterly calendars; final examination schedules, and the Academic Honesty policy. Because the Scheiule is posted quarterly, it and the Registrar's Web site are timely sources of infor\u00ad mation on new or changed policies, procedures, and fees that could not be included in the Catalogue because of the latter's annual pub\u00ad lication schedule. The WebSOC, Searchable Schedule of Classes is available just prior to the beginning of each quarter's registration period (four weeks before the end of each quarter). UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Enrollment and Payment of Fees\" To receive academic credit for regular courses and other supervised instruction or research, a student must be officially enrolleq prior to undertaking such activities. Registration does not become offi\u00ad cial until all required fees have been paid, and the student enrolls in classes with the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollments are correct. A quarterly calendar of dates for enrollment and payment of fees is 0 available at http://www.reg.uci.edu. The general procedures for enrollment are: 1. Consult the appropriate academic advisor to develop an approved program of study. Secure necessary authorizations for courses that require special approval. New undergraduate students entering in the fall should seriously consider attending one of the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP) sessions during the summer for academic advising and enrollment assistance. 2. Pay careful attention to deadlines. Enroll in classes during the published registration period. 3. Pay required fees online or to the Cashier's Office on or before the published deadline. Other outstanding obligations must be satisfied at this time also. NOTE: Late fee payment and/or late enrollment in classes may re\u00ad quire the student to enroll in classes using the Add-Card procedure. WEB REGISTRATION WebReg, UCI's Web registration system, allO'-';S students to enroll in classes from anywhere in the wqrld. Students may add and drop classes, inquire about open sections, change their grading option or units for a variable-unit class, put themselves on an official waiting list, and list their confirmed class schedule. Immediate feedback on the availability of a class and a student's eligibility to enroll is pro\u00ad vided; schedule changes may be made during the registration period or the adjustment period. Complete information about WebReg is available on the Registrar's Web site at http://www.reg.uci.edu. PAYMENT OF FEES AND ENROLLMENT Registration fees are assessed quarterly and appear on ZOT Account Online (http://www.fs.uci.edu). Students who do not pay all required fees online or to the Cashier's Office during the pub\u00ad lished registration period are subject to a late service fee of $50. Students who do not enroll in classes during the published registra\u00ad tion period are subject to a late service fee. Students enrolled in zero (0) units at the close of business at the end of the second week of classes are assessed a $50 late enrollment fee. A signature of the student's dean is required for late enrollment after the second week of classes. The student is subject to both late service fees if fees are not paid online or to\" the Ca~hier's Office and the student does not enroll in classes by the registration deadlines, published in the Quarterly Calendar on the Registrar's Web site (http://www.reg.uci.edu). To avoid the expense and inconvenience of late enrollment, stu\u00ad dents are urged to enroll and pay fees well before the published registration deadlines. Students with' financial need should make advance arrangements with the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, or another source, to have funds available when fees are due. Late registration (payment of fees and/or enrollment in classes) is permitted only in exceptional circumstances with the authorization of the student's dean. A student who is allowed to apply late and, as a result, must pay fees and enroll late, is required to pay late Enrollment and Other Procedures 67 service fees. Late services charges may be waived only if the Uni\u00ad versity is responsible for the late transaction. CHANGE OF CLASS ENROLLMENT After officially enrolling with the Registrar, a student may add or drop classes, change sections of a course, change units in a vari\u00ad able unit course, or change the grading option by obtaining the approval of the instructor and by completing an Add, Drop, or Change Card, available from the student's academic counseling office or the Registrar's Office. In the first two weeks of classes, instructors may authorize the use of WebReg for adding, dropping, and changing the grade option. An undergraduate student may not enroll in more than 20 units .or fewer than 12 units of course work during a given quarter without the permission of the student's academic dean or, for undecided/ undeclared students, the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education. Changes to Pass/Not Pass grading must not cause the student to exceed the limitations to Pass/Not Pass enrollment. Graduate students may not enroll in more than 16 or fewer than eight units of graduate or upper-division credit without prior approval of the departmental graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Students may add classes through the sixth week of classes with the approval of the instructor in charge of the class. To change the grading option of a class during. the first two weeks of instruction, students must obtain the signature of the instructor in charge. The Change Card must then be submitted to the Regis\u00ad trar's Office no later than the end of the second week of instruc\u00ad tion. Changes in the grading option from the third through the tenth week require approval of the instructor and the student's aca\u00ad demic dean. Students may drop classes from the first through the sixth week of a quarter, inclusive, with the signature of the instructor in charge. After the sixth week of instruction, students may add or drop a class only with the permission of the instructor and the student's acade\u00ad mic dean. Permission to drop after the sixth week can be granted only if the student is not failing the course and is not subject to disqualification, and only if dropping the course would be to the educational benefit of the student, of the class as a whole, or both. UC IRVINE - 2006-200768 UCI 2006-07 Information for Admitted Students A W notation will be recorded for each course dropped after the end of the sixth week of instruction. The effective date of a \"drop\" is the date the approved Drop Card is received in the Registrar's Office. Students are responsible for their official enrollment and must be officially enrolled in each class they attend. They must officially drop classes they have ceased attending. The student cannot simply discontinue attendance in a class; a Drop Card must be filed before the last day of instruction for the quarter. The Registrar's Office cannot accept Add, Drop, or Change Cards after the last day of instruction of a particular quarter. NOTE: Instructors and deans may have earlier deadlines than those ' mentioned above. Change of Major Each school or program has its own standards for change of major, and some majors are impacted, that is, more students apply than can be accommodated. Once a student selects a major, or decides to change majors, the student should visit the academic counseling office for their prospective major to obtain current information about prerequisites, program planning, and policies and proce\u00ad dures. Information also is available on the Registrar's Web site under How to Change Majors. In addition, a form called the Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major must be completed. The form is available from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. All schools with exceptional requirements have major-change crite\u00ad ria approved by the Academic Senate and published on the Divi\u00ad sion of Undergraduate Education Web site at http://www.due.uci. edu/Change_of_Major.html. Students changing majors may meet the approved major-change criteria of the unit they wish to enter that are in place at the time of their change of major or those in effect up to one year before. Reduced-Fee Part-Time Study Program Part-time study for credit leading to an undergraduate or graduate degree is available in academic units in which there exists good educational reason, as determined by the academic unit, to allow part-time study. To take advantage of reduced fees for part-time status, quarterly course enrollment is limited to 10 units or less for undergraduate students and to eight units or less for graduate stu\u00ad dents. Students enrolled in excess units after the Friday of the third week of instruction are liable for full fees. The same admissions standards that apply to full-time students apply to part-time students. Under University policy, academic deans (the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education, for undecided/undeclared students; the Dean of Graduate Studies, for graduate students) may approve Petitions for Part-Time Status only for reasons of occupation, family responsibilities, or health. In addition to all other required fees, students approved for part\u00ad time' status pay one-half of the Educational Fee and, if applicable, one-half of the Nonresident Tuition Fee or Professional School Student Fee. Undergraduate petitions are available from academic counselors or the Registrar's Office; graduate students may obtain further information and petitions from the Office of Graduate Stud\u00ad ies. Since there are certain restrictions on receiving undergraduate credit for part-time course work, undergraduates interested in part\u00ad time study should read, in addition to the Undergraduate Admis\u00ad sions section, the sections on Expenses and Fees, and Financial Aid. Graduate students should refer to the Office of Graduate Stud\u00ad ies section. Lapse of Status A student's status may lapse for the following reasons: Failure to pay required student fees by the prescribed deadline; failure to respond to official notices; failure to settle financial obligations when due or to make satisfactory arrangements with the Cashier's Office; failure to complete the physical exami-nation; or failure to comply with admission conditions. Each student who becomes subject to lapse of status is given advance notice and ample time to deal with the situation. However, if the student fails to respond, action \u00b7will be taken without further notice. A \"hold\" will be placed on all of the student's records and the student will be entitled to no further services of the University except assistance toward clearing the hold. A student must satisfy the conditions which caused the lapse of status before the hold can be cleared. Retention of Student Records The Registrar's Office maintains a permanent record of academic work completed by each student. Support documents for the acade\u00ad mic record are kept for one year. Students are strongly advised to carefully check their academic record quarterly. (Student copies of the academic record are avail\u00ad able from the Registrar's Office shortly after the close of each quar\u00ad ter.) Discrepancies in the academic record should be reported to the Registrar iml)lediately. After one year, it is assumed that the stu\u00ad dent accepts the accuracy of their academic record, and supporting source documents are destroyed. Transcript of Records The official transcript of a student's academic record will be released only upon receipt of a signed request from the student authorizing the release. All outstanding debts to the University (with the exception of long-term financial aid loans not yet due and payable) must be paid in full before a transcript will be released. Requests for transcripts by other than the student whose transcript is being sought can be honored only (1) if the request is accompa\u00ad nied by a written authorization signed by the student whose tran\u00ad script is sought, and (2) upon approval of the Registrar. Verification of Student Status The Registrar's Office provides verifications of student status. Ver\u00ad ifications may be needed for reference checks, bank loans, applica\u00ad tions for good-student-driver insurance rates, and Social Security payments. There is a $6 fee for each verification, however verifica\u00ad tions for the purpose of student loan deferments are free of charge. For verification purposes, enrollment in 12 units or more in regular sessions is considered full-time status; enrollment in 6.0-11.9 units is considered half-time status; enrollment in 5.9 units or less is considered less than half-time status. Enrollment in eight units is considered full-time status for summer session. \u00b7 Cancellation/Withdrawal Undergraduate students who pay fees for a regular academic quar\u00ad ter and then decide to withdraw from the University must submit a Cancellation/Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office after obtaining the signatures of their academic dean (or the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education, for undecided/undeclared students). Medical students must submit the form to the Curricular Affairs Office in the School of Medicine. This form serves two purposes: (1) a refund of fees, if applicable (see Fee Refund sec\u00ad tion); and (2) automatic withdrawal from classes. The effective date of withdrawal is used in determining the per\u00ad centage of fees to be refunded. This date is normally the date that UC IRVINE - 2006-2007the student submits the form to the appropriate Dean for approval. Requests for an effective date of withdrawal prior to submittal to the appropriate Dean must also have approval of the Ombudsman. A W notation will be recorded for each course in which enrollment is withdrawn if the student's effective date of withdrawal is after the end of the sixth week of classes. (See W notation in the Grad\u00ad ing System section.) A graduate student in good academic standing who wishes to with\u00ad draw and intends to return within one year should submit both the Cancellation/Withdrawal form and an: application for a Leave of Absence. Further information appears in the Office of Graduate Studies section. New undergraduate students are encouraged to seek advice from their admissions or academic counselor to understand the conse\u00ad quences of withdrawal and their eligibility to return. If an undergraduate student plans to leave the University after com\u00ad pleting all academic work for the latest quarter of enrollment and has not paid fees for the next quarter, a formal notice of with\u00ad drawal is not necessary. Readmission: Undergraduate Students Students are strongly urged to consider the readmission policy in formuJating plans for leaving or returning to UCI. Every effort will be made to readmit UCI students who were in good academic standing at the time they ceased attending and who have filed read\u00ad mission applications by the deadline. Former UCI students who wish to be readmitted should contact the undergraduate counseling office of the school or program which offers their intended major. Readmission is subject to dean's approval and campus deadlines (August 1 for fall quarter, November 1 for winter quarter, and Feb\u00ad ruary 1 for spring quarter). To apply for readmission, a student must first pay a nonrefundable $60 Application Fee at the Cashier's Office, and then file the Application for Readmission with the Reg\u00ad istrar's Office. Remittance of this fee may be made by bank draft or money order made payable to Regents-UC. New undergraduate students who cancel registration prior to the first day of the quarter must reapply to UCI; they are not eligible to file for readmission as described above. If a student has been academically disqualified from the University or has left the University while on probation or subject to disquali\u00ad fication, the student must apply for readmission. The application, however, is subject to the approval o( the dean of the school which the student hopes to enter. Transcripts for work taken at other institutions must be submitted as part of the application. Readmission: Graduate Students A graduate student who withdraws and has not been granted a leave of absence approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies can resume graduate study only if readmitted. The online Application for Graduate Study, including the nonrefundable application fee, must be submitted by the published deadline for graduate admis\u00ad sion applications. Refer to the statement on readmission which appears in the Office of Graduate Studies section for additional information. Enrollment at Other Institutions Various programs exist that enable currently registered UCI stu\u00ad dents in good standing to take courses at other UC campuses, as well as at California State University and California Community College campuses. More information is available from the Regis\u00ad trar's Office and from the academic counseling offices. Enrollment and Other Procedures 69 California Residence Detailed information about California residence is available in the Catalogue's Expenses and Fees section. All inquiries with regard to the requirements for the establishment of California residence (including exceptions pertaining\u00b7to minors, aliens, and dependents of military personnel stationed in California) should be directed to the University of California, Irvine, Residence Deputy, Registrar's Office, 215 Administration Building, Irvine, CA 92697-4975, tele\u00ad phone (949) 824-6129. Commencement UCI Commencement ceremonies are held each June for all stu~ dents who graduate any quarter of that academic year. Commence\u00ad ment protocol information is mailed to all prospective graduates in the spring and also is available from academic counselors. Addi\u00ad tional information is available from the Commencement Office; telephone (949) 824-6378; World Wide Web: http://www. commencement.uci.edu/. Application for Graduation. In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student must submit an online Application for Graduation via the StudentAccess link at http://www.reg.uci.edu no later than the published deadline. Specific deadline dates for filing the application are established quarterly so that candidates' academic records can be reviewed to verify that all graduation requirements have been met. Students should contact their acade\u00ad mic counseling office for deadline and degree audit information. Diplomas. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available, which is three to four months after the quarter in which the student graduated. Please note that summer and fall quarter graduates awarded academic honors (summa cum laude, magna cum laude, or cum laude) at the end of the academic year are noti\u00ad fied by the Registrar's Office to return their previously issued diplomas. New diplomas reflecting the academic honor will be issued and will be available three or four months after the end of spring quarter. Students may then pick up their diplomas at the Registrar's Office or authorize the Registrar to send their diplomas by certified mail, or registered air mail to locations outside the United States. All outstanding debts due to the University, with the exception of long-term financial aid loans, must be paid in full before a student's diploma will be released. UC IRVINE - 2006-200770 UCI 2006-07 Information for Admitted Students ACADEMIC REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES Except where noted, all information applies to both undergraduate and graduate students. Additional information concerning acade\u00ad mic regulations applying only to graduate students is given in the Office of Graduate Studies section. Student Academic Records The Registrar's Office maintains a permanent record of academic work completed by each student. Support documents for the acade\u00ad mic record are kept for one year. Each student is responsible for carefully examining their enroll\u00ad ment and academic records and may do so throughout the acade\u00ad mic year. Students must promptly notify the Registrar's Office if they find a discrepancy in their records. Student academic records may not be changed after one year or, in some cases, in less than one year if Academic Senate regulations specify a shorter time limit. For example, the notation \"NR,\" which means that no grade has been reported, must be removed within one quarter of subsequent enrollment or it will automatically be converted to the grade \"F\" or \"NP\" (under Senate Regulation IR 345). After a student's degree has been certified by the student's dean, the academic record may not be altered except in those cases where a procedural or clerical error on the part of an instructor has occurred. GRADING SYSTEM A -Excellent (4.0 grade points per unit) B -Good (3.0 grade points per unit) C -Average (2.0 grade points per unit) D -Lowest passing grade (1.0 grade point per unit) F -Not passing (no grade points) I -Incomplete P -Pass (equal to grade Cor better) NP-Not Pass (equal to grade C-or below) S -Satisfactory (equal to grade B or better; graduate students only in courses designated by the Graduate Council) U -Unsatisfactory (graduate students only in courses so desig\u00ad nated by the Graduate Council) IP -In Progress (restricted to certain sequential courses, so desig\u00ad nated by the Subcommittee on Courses or Graduate Council, for which the final quarter grade of a multiquarter course is assigned to the previous quarter(s) of the sequence). NR-No Report (given when an instructor does not submit final grades for a class or individual grades for students whose names appear on the official class roster; NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subsequent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. The instructor may replace an NR with a grade within one quarter of subsequent enrollment or may authorize the student to drop the class, which would result in the NR b_ecoming a W). UR-Unauthorized Repeat. A UR notation is recorded for the grade when a student already has a passing grade for a nonrepeatable course and has taken it again. W ~Withdrew. A W notation is recorded on a student's permanent record for each course a student drops after the end of the sixth week of instruction in a quarter. Courses in which a W has been entered on a student's record will be disregarded in determining the student's grade point average and will not be considered as . courses attempted in assessing the student's satisfaction of the normal progress requirement. Plus and minus suffixes may be attached to the grades A, B, C, and D. GRADE POINTS AND GRADE POINT AVERAGE Grade points are assigned on a four point basis: A, 4 points per unit; B, 3 points per unit; C, 2 points per unit; D, 1 point per unit; F and I, zero points. Plus or minus suffixes modify the above by plus or minus 0.3 grade point per unit, with the exception of the A+ grade which is assigned 4 points per unit. Requirements for a bachelor's degree include the accumulation of baccalaureate credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units with an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). A course at UCI normally offers four quarter units of credit, and, in the fol\u00ad lowing text, the term \"course\" may be understood to carry four units. The grade point average is the sum of all accumulated grade points (grade points earned in a course taken for a letter grade times the unit value of the course) divided by the sum of all units attempted. P, NP, S, U, NR, IP, and I grades, as well as workload credit, are excluded in computing grade point average. Baccalaureate credit counts toward degree requirements and is used to compute .the grade point average. Workload credit is used to determine full-time status for financial aid, housing, student loans, and other purposes. For most courses at UCI, baccalaureate credit and workload credit are identical. Courses differing in this credit or \"workload credit only\" courses are identified in the course description. It should be noted that final grades as reported by professors are normally permanent and final. A professor may not change a final . grade except to correct a clerical or procedural error. Clerical or procedural errors should be corrected within one regular academic quarter after the grade is assigned. No grade may be revised by reexamination or, with the exception of I and IP grades, by com\u00ad pleting additional work. If a student is dissatisfied with a grade, the student should review their work with the instructor and receive an explanation of the grade assigned. A grade may be appealed on any reasonable grounds to the instructor, the chair of the department, and the dean of the school. If the matter is not resolved, the student may go for counsel to the Office of the University Ombudsman. Under circumstances explained in The Manual of the Irvine Divi\u00ad sion of the Academic Senate (Appendix \u00b7n: Student Academic Grievance Procedures Relating to Nondiscrimination), a grade may be. changed if the Academic Grievance Panel has determined that the grade was assigned on the basis of discrimination. INCOMPLETE GRADES An I or Incomplete grade is assigned to a student by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control, and when the student has been temporarily excused by the instructor from completing the quarter's work. For currently enrolled students, the maximum time limit for mak\u00ad ing up an I grade is three quarters of enrollment. After this time the I grade can no longer be replaced and will appear permanently on the record. The instructor is not obligated to allow the maxi\u00ad mum three-quarter period. The student should consult with the instructor to determine how the Incomplete may be made up. It is strongly recommended that the student and the instructor prepare a written agreement specifying how the Incomplete can be made up and the deadline for doing so. Once the work is completed within UC IRVINE - 2006-2007the time agreed upon by the instructor, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade form to the counseling office of the school in which the course was offered. The student should not reenroll in the course to make up the Incomplete. Students not currently enrolled at UCI have a maximum of one calendar year in which to replace an Incomplete grade. However, in exceptional individual cases involving the student's prolonged inability to pursue a course of study, extensions of up to two additional years may be granted by the instructor with the approval of the dean of the unit offering the course; students must petition for such an extension within one calendar year following the assignment of the Incomplete grade. Courses graded I carry no grade points and are not included in computation of the grade point average which appears on the stu\u00ad dent's permanent record. Any I grade will remain permanently on the record unless the work is completed and a grade assigned as described above. University of California regulations require a grade point average of 2.0 for all units attempted in order to receive a bachelor's degree. Only when a check for satisfaction of graduation require\u00ad ments is made are I's treated as F's. If the student's overall aver\u00ad age is at least a 2.0, including the Incomplete grades computed as F's, then the student may graduate. If the Incomplete grades com\u00ad puted as F's decrease the student's average below a 2.0, the.student may not graduate until enough I grades have been made up to bring the average up to a 2.0 and this must be done within the time limits specified above. PASS/NOT PASS The Pass/Not Pass option is available to encourage students to enroll in courses outside their major field. Courses graded Pass or Not Pass are not included in computation of the grade point aver\u00ad age whiCQ appears on a student's permanent record. However, if a student receives a Pass in a class, course and unit credit for the class is, received, except as provided below. If a Not Pass is received, the student receives no credit for the class. Some courses are designated by academic units as Pass/Not Pass Only. Students do not have the option of taking these courses for a letter grade. The use of Pass/Not Pass is governed by all of the following provisions: 1. A student in good standing may take up to an average of four units per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. 2. In addition, students may count a total of 12 units of courses des\u00ad ignated Pass/Not Pass Only toward their graduation requirements. 3. A student who earns a grade of C (2.0) or better will have a Pass/Not Pass grade recorded as Pass. If the student earns a grade of C-or below, the grade will be recorded as a Not Pass, and no unit credit will be received for the course. In both cases, the stu\u00ad dent's grade will not be computed into the grade point average. 4. Courses taken under the Pass/Not Pass option may count toward the unit requirement for the bachelor's degree and toward the breadth requirement. With the exception of courses designated Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course requirements of the student's school and major, unless authorized by the appropriate dean. No more than two courses applied to a minor may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program, may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree, and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. Academic Regulations and Procedures 71 5. Changes to or from the Pass/Not Pass option can be made during the enrollment period. No changes can be made after the first two weeks of classes without the approval of the dean of the student's school. No changes in the Pass/Not Pass option can be made after the last day of instruction of the quarter. 6. A student on academic probation may not enroll in a course with the Pass/Not Pass option unless the course is offered on that basis only. SATISFACTORY/UNSATISFACTORY GRADES (GRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading, unlike Pass/Not Pass, is not a student option. With the consent of the academic units involved, and upon approval of the Graduate Council, individual study and research or other individual graduate work undertaken by a gradu\u00ad ate student may be evaluated by means of the grades S or U. Also, with the approval of the Graduate Council, certain graduate courses are graded Stu Only. Additionally, the grade S or U may be assigned provisionally in each but the last quarter of a graduate course extending over more than one quarter. Upon completion of the last quarter, letter grades (A to F) replace such provisional grades. When a grade of S or U has been assigned on a provisional basis and the student does not complete all quarters of the course sequence, the instructor may assign a final letter grade or the grade of I to replace the S or U, or let the grade of S or U stand as a final grade. The grade S is defined as equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit will be allowed for work graded Unsatisfactory. GRADES IN PROGRESS IP is a transcript notation, restricted to sequential courses which extend over two or more quarters, indicating that the final grade for the individual quarters will not be assigned until the last quarter of the sequence is completed. The grade for the final quarter is then assigned for all of the previous quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. IP notations may be given only for courses designated by the Acade\u00ad mic Senate Subcommittee on Courses or Graduate Council for use of this notation. IP notations are not included in computations of the student's grade point average and do not contribute to the num\u00ad ber of quarter units completed. GRADES NOT REPORTED A No Report (NR) is assigned when the student's name was on the official class roster but the instructor did not submit a final grade. A student who receives an NR' must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. An NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subsequent enroll\u00ad ment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. NR transcript notations are not included in computations of the grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. REPETITION OF COURSES Repetition of courses not authorized by the Subcommittee on Courses to be taken more than once for credit is subject to the fol\u00ad lowing provisions. Undergraduates may repeat courses only when grades of C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP were received. (A C-earned before fall quarter, 1984, is not repeatable.) Unit credit for courses so repeated will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded. In computing the grade point average of an undergraduate with repeated courses in which a C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP (if repeated for a letter grade) was received, only the most recently received grades and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated. In case of further repetitions, UC IRVINE - 2006-200772 UCI 2006-07 Information for Admitted Students the grade point average shall be based on all additional grades assigned. Repetition of a course more than once requires approval in all instances of the School (or equivalent) in which the student is enrolled. All courses which were-originally taken for a letter grade must be repeated for a letter grade. Courses originally taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis may be repeated for a Pass/Not Pass or for a letter grade if the course is so offered. A graduate student may repeat only once a course in which a grade below B or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade shall be used in computing the student's grade point. average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades will be used. If a student repeats a course for which a passing grade has already been received and the course is not approved as repeatable for credit, the student will receive a UR and no credit will be given. Information regarding the repetition of foreign language courses is available in the School of Humanities section. Duplicate Credit Prohibited. Other than the exceptions related to the repeat of deficient grades as noted above, and the exceptions related to Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate credit (see pages 46-47), students may not receive unit credit or earn grade points for college courses in which the content dupli\u00ad cates material of a previously completed course or examination for which the student has been granted college credit. SATISFACTION OF THE WRITING REQUIREMENT Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. Continuing UCI students may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy lower-division or upper-division writing requirements. The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division writing requirement must be completed with a grade of C or better (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). 1. Students who fail to attain a letter grade of C or better in English WR 37 must repeat the course or enroll in the equivalent. It is recommended that these students enroll in WR 39A or WR 39AP followed by WR 39B-C to assure completion of this requirement. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in WR 39C must repeat the course. 2. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in one or both courses of the English WR 39B-C sequence must repeat the course or courses in question. 3. Students who fail to attain a grade of Cor better in at least two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course after satisfying the UC Entry Level Writing requirement by attaining a grade of Cor better in Humanities lAS/A, should substitute English WR 39C if they need one quarter of additional work to complete the requirement, or English WR 39B-C if they need two quarters to complete the requirement. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in Humanities IA S/ A, enroll in Humanities IB S/A and attain a grade of Cor better, but fail to attain a grade of C or better in the writing component of Humani\u00ad ties lC, should substitute English WR 39C to complete the requirement. 4. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in either Humanities IA S/A or Humanities 1B S/A, should substitute English WR 39A-B-C to complete the requirement. 5. Students who fail to attain a grade of C (or Pass) or better in Uni\u00ad versity Studies llA, liB, llC, 12A, 12B, or 12C should see their academic counselor. The course taken to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement must be completed with a grade of Cor better (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). See the UCI Requirements section for fur\u00ad ther information. Students who have not completed the lower-division writing requirement before the beginning of their seventh quarter at UCI will be subject to probation. Students transferring to UCI normally should have satisfied the lower-division writing requirement before entering UCI; if, however, they have not, they must complete it within their first three quarters of enrollment or they will be sub\u00ad ject to probation. Academic English/English as a Second Language students must complete the lower-division writing requirement before the beginning of the seventh quarter following the comple\u00ad tion of their AE/ESL courses or they will be subject to probation. Credit by Examination An enrolled student may obtain credit for course material previ\u00ad ously mastered by taking a special examination administered by a faculty member who normally teaches that course. Detailed proce\u00ad dures for obtaining credit by examination may be obtained from the counseling office of the school which offers the course. Approval of any petition for credit by examination must be obtained from the dean or designee of that school before the examination can be administered. After the dean has signed the petition, the student must have it validated by paying a $5 Credit by Examination Fee at the Cashier's Office. The instructor giving the examination retains the prerogative (1) to decide whether the course can be taken by examination, (2) to determine the form such an examination may take, and (3) to stipu\u00ad late whether the grade will be reported as Pass/Not Pass or as a let\u00ad ter grade (e.g., A, B, C, etc.). A student may take the examination for a particular course only one time. After receiving the grade, the student may accept it or reject it. If the student is not satisfied with the grade received on the examination, the student may choose not to receive credit 'or a grade. If the student does choose to accept the results of the exami\u00ad nation, grades and grade points (if applicable) will be entered on the record in the same manner as those for regular courses of instruction. Independent Study: Undergraduates Only A unique class option is available primarily to upper-division stu\u00ad dents at UCI. The independent-study option allows the student to plan with the instructor a course having a clear relationship to the student's academic program. The plan for the course will include a reading list, a group of assignments, examinations, papers, or simi\u00ad lar evidence of intellectual achievement on which academic credit will be based. A description of the course and of its requirements must be approved by the instructor responsible for it and by the department chair or dean. Independentcstudy credit for undergradu\u00ad ates is limited to five units per quarter. Final Examinations Final examinations, or their equivalent, are obligatory in all under\u00ad graduate courses except laboratory and studio courses, as individu\u00ad ally determined by the Subcommittee on Courses. Normally each such examination shall be conducted in writing and must be com\u00ad pleted by all participants by the time scheduled by the Registrar for the quarter in question. These examinations may not exceed three hours duration. Special arrangements may be made for disabled students. \u00b7 Examinations normally are not required in laboratory and studio courses. At its option, the department concerned may require a UC IRVINE - 2006-2007final examination subject to prior announcement in the WebSOC, Searchable Schedule of Classes for the term. Final grades from professors are due in the Registrar's Office within 72 hours after the final examination. Student Copies of Quarterly Grades After each quarter, a complimentary copy of the student's perma\u00ad nent record is available from the Registrar's Office. On the copy, the student wi!I find grades for all the quarters taken at UCI, a computation of grade point average at the University of California, and a list of the University requirements completed (UC Entry Level Writing, American History and Institutions). Declaration of Major All students are required to declare a major by the time they reach junior status (90 units excluding college work completed prior to high school graduation) or they will become subject to disqualifi\u00ad cation from further registration in the University. Undergraduate Scholarship Requirements Requirements for a bachelor's degree include the accumulation of credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units with an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). CLASS LEVEL Undergraduate students are classified as freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior students, based on the total number of units com\u00ad pleted, as follows: Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior 0 45.0 90.0 135 + COURSE LOAD LIMITS 44.9 89.9 134.9 An undergraduate may enroll in as few as 12 units or as many as 20 units. To enroll for more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units, students must obtain the authorization of their dean or, for unde\u00ad cided/undeclared students, the Dean of the Division of Undergrad\u00ad uate Education. Refer to the Reduced-Fee Part-Time Study Pro\u00ad gram section. ACADEMIC STANDING. To remain in good academic standing a student must maintain a grade point average of at least 2.0 and make progress toward the degree at a satisfactory rate. An undergraduate student normally is subject to academic proba\u00ad tion if at the end of any quarter the grade point average for that quarter, or the cumulative grade point average, is less than 2.0. A student whose grade point average falls below a 1.5 for any quarter, or who after two consecutive quarters on probation has not achieved a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or a satisfactory rate of progress, is subject to disqualification. NORMAL PROGRESS REQUIREMENT Regular undergraduate students will become subject to probation or to disqualification from further registration in the University if they fail to make normal progress toward the baccalaureate degree, if they fail to declare a major by the time they reach junior status (90 units excluding college work completed prior to high school graduation), or after declaring a major, if they fail to follow the program of study required by the academic unit of their major. Stu\u00ad dents who have selected undeclared status within a school may be subject to probation or to disqualification if they fail to follow a Academic Regulations and Procedures 73 program of study leading to completion of lower-division school requirements. A. Normal progress for all regular undergraduate students is defined in the following table, in terms of quarter units com\u00ad pleted at the end of quarters enrolled. Normal Subject to Subject to Quarter Progress Probation Disqualification 1 12-15. 8-11 7 2 26-30 18-25 17 11 164-165 159-163 158 12 180 NOTE: This table is effective fall 2005. Students who began college prior to fall 2005 should consult their academic counselor. B. Status Determination: 1. Undeclared students who have completed the number of units specified in the given quarter of their enrollment, as shown in the table above, and are following a course of study pre\u00ad scribed by their school are making \"Normal Progress.\" 2. Students who have declared a major must follow the program of study required for their major, as well as complete the units specified in the given quarter of their enrollment, as shown in the table above, in order to make \"Normal Progress.\" Students must declare a major by the time they reach junior status (90 units excluding college work completed prior to high school graduation). 3. Students who fail to make Normal Progress as defined in (1) or (2) above are subject to being placed on probation by the fac\u00ad ulty of their academic unit or its designated agent, or for first\u00ad year undecided/undeclared students, by the Faculty Board for Undecided/Undeclared Students or its designated agent. C. Students who have completed two consecutive quarters on acad\u00ad emic probation without having achieved at the end of that period at least the normal rate of progress specified under (A) and (B) above are subject to disqualification. D. For purposes of calculating \"Normal Progress,\" \"Subject to Pro\u00ad bation,\" and \"Subject to Disqualification,\" students admitted to the University with advanced standing will be classified with respect to quarter of enrollment at entrance in accordance with the following table: Quarter at Entrance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Advanced Standing Quarter Units at earned under the following two circumstances are not to be counted toward determination of the quarter at entrance under (D) above: (1) Advanced Placement Examination; (2) concurrent enrollment in college courses while in high school. F. The quarter of enrollment at entrance of students (including bac\u00ad calaureate degree candidates who already hold a baccalaureate UC IRVINE - 2006-200774 UCI 2006-07 Information for Admitted Students degree) seeking admission to the University with 150 or more advanced standing units will be determined by the faculty offer\u00ad ing the curriculum in which such students seek to enroll. This determination will be made consistent with the program required for such students to obtain the desired degree and with Univer\u00ad sity residence requirements. G. For purposes of this regulation students will be understood to have declared a major when they have been formally accepted by the faculty of a degree-granting program or its designated agent to pursue a defined course of study leading to a baccalau\u00ad reate degree. H. All undergraduate students are expected to graduate when they have completed the baccalaureate requirements of their declared major or majors. The Normal Progress requirement described above is not to be confused with the Normal Academic Progress requirement for Financial Aid. The former has to do with academic standing, the latter with receipt of financial aid. Probation is not a necessary step before disqualification. If a stu\u00ad dent becomes subject to disqualification, the complete record of grades and other accomplishments will be carefully reviewed by the responsible faculty authorities of the student's school or, for undecided/undeclared students, by a faculty authority designated by the Faculty Board for Undecided/Undeclared Students. If the record indicates little probability that the student will be able to meet the academic standards of the University of California, the student will be disqualified from further enrollment. Faculties of undergraduate-degree-granting units and the Faculty Board for Undecided/Undeclared Students are obliged by Academic Senate regulations to maintain a procedure under which a student may contest disqualification actions. In order to transfer from one campus to another in the University of California or from one UCI school to another, a student who has been disqualified or who is on academic probation must obtain the approval of the appropriate faculty, or its designated agent, into whose jurisdiction the student seeks to transfer. HONORS Information about honors opportunities at UCI is found in the Division of Undergraduate Education section and the academic unit sections. Quarterly Undergraduate Honors Quarterly undergraduate honors are awarded in each school to stu\u00ad dents who achieve a quarterly grade point average of 3.5 or better in a minimum of 12 graded units. Honors at Graduation Of the graduating seniors, no more than 12 percent will receive academic honors: approximately I percent summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. The criteria used by each school in selecting candidates for these honors are included in each school's section of the Catalogue. A general crite\u00ad rion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in resi\u00ad dence at a University of California campus by the end of the winter quarter of the academic year in which they graduate. Additional information is available in the Division of Undergraduate Educa\u00ad tion section of this Catalogue. Graduate Scholarship Requirements For a graduate student, only the grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship. Information concerning graduate student course load requirements and satisfactory academic progress is given in the Office of Graduate Studies section. Enrollment in UC Irvine Extension If a UCI student wishes to enroll in a UC Irvine Extension course concurrently with enrollment in regular courses, the entire program of study must be approved in advance by the dean of the student's school (the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education, for undecided/undeclared students; the Dean of Graduate Studies, for graduate students). Fee information is available from the UC Irvine Extension Registration Office. Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Undergraduate Students \u00b7 UCI undergraduate students who plan to enroll in courses at another institution or University Extension in either a summer or regular session and to use such courses to satisfy any UCI require\u00ad ments should first consult with and secure prior approval from the academic dean or chair of their major who will determine if the credits are applicable to major and breadth requirements. UCI undergraduate students must submit an official transcript of all course work earned at another institution or college to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. If such courses are deter\u00ad mined by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools to be transferable, do not duplicate other credit granted, and do not exceed limitations of credit, then the units earned may be applied toward the total required for graduation. Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Graduate Students In accordance with UC Academic Senate policy, graduate students may be granted unit credit (not grade credit) toward a master's degree for a limited number of acceptable graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through University Extension before enrollment in graduate study at UCI. To receive such credit, the student must submit a formal petition, including an original transcript, after enrollment in graduate study. Approval of the stu\u00ad dent's graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies is UC IRVINE - 2006-2007required. The petition may be downloaded from http://www.rgs.uci. edu/grad/students/forms.htm. While enrolled at UCI or on a leave of absence, a graduate student may receive unit credit for graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through UCI Extension only with the prior approval of the student's graduate advisor and the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies.

Students with varying disabilities, including those with mobility, visual, hearing, and learning disabilities, and chronic health problems, may be eli\u00ad gible for reasonable disability accommodations through this pro\u00ad gram. Staff assist students from the point of their admission to UCI through graduation. Specialized services may include testing accommodations, priority registration, document conversion, adap\u00ad tive equipment, readers, notetakers, interpreters, captionists, liaisons with faculty and campus departments, disability parking, and information regarding disability legal rights in the university setting. A Center Computing Lab provides adaptive computer tech\u00ad nology and training. There is no cost to the student for the sup\u00ad port services or accommodations provided by the Disability Ser\u00ad vices Center. Students are responsible for fully acquainting themselves with the detailed procedures for use of accommoda\u00ad tions. These procedures are available on the Center's Web site at http://www.disability.uci.edu. Students with disabilities may qualify for reasonable accommoda\u00ad tions based on disability-related needs. Students must provide appropriate documentation about their disabilities to the Center. Documentation provided to the Center is confidential. It is the responsibility of the applicant or student to provide this documen\u00ad tation and, if necessary, to cover the cost for such documentation. This includes the cost for professional assessments for such dis\u00ad abilities as learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, and psy\u00ad chiatric disabilities. Contact the Center for more information about disability documentation.requirements. In some cases there is need for recent or very detailed documentation about the disability. UCI reserves the right to determine the most effective and timely accommodations after consultation with the student about the dis\u00ad ability and previous use of accommodations. The provision or use of a disability accommodation does not guarantee or ensure a cer\u00ad tain level of achievement for the student. Students with disabilities must meet the same academic standards as all other students. Some academic accommodations may require approval of the chair or dean of the student's academic unit. Students with disabilities who need accommodations (in particular, reading assistance, textbook conversion including e-text and Braille, American Sign Language interpreting services, real-time cap.tioning services, and adaptive computing technology in campus laboratories) that must be planned or arranged in advance of the start of classes should contact the Disability Services Center as quickly as possible after admission to UCI. Failure to do so may delay or in some cases preclude the Center's ability to provide cer\u00ad tain accommodations. This advance notice also allows the Center to document needs, discuss service procedures and student respon\u00ad sibilities, and determine the appropriate accommodations. \u00b7The Disability Services Center is located next to the Humanities Trailer Complex; telephone (949) 824-7494 Web: http://www. disability.uci.edu/, The International Center promotes and facilitates international education and exchange by providing services and information to the Uci international population, affiliated offices, and the general campus community.

California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) The California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) was established in December 2000 by the State of California as a partnership between academia and the busi\u00ad ness community. Calit2-a joint venture between UCI and UCSD, with dedicated research facilities on both campuses--conducts \u00b7 interdisciplinary, collaborative research that generates novel mate\u00ad rials, devices, and information systems, with applications in many fields. The Institute's research in networked systems, the environ\u00ad ment, transportation, bioinformatics,- policy, education, digital arts, security, and other fields will keep California's industry at the cut\u00ad ting edge of technology, accelerating growth in existing companies and spurring high-technology start-ups that will boost the State's economy. UCI and UCSD faculty from many academic disciplines collaborate with researchers from more than 130 leading California high-tech\u00ad nology corporations. A major objective of the Institute is to educate and prepare students-in the classroom and the laboratory-for successful careers in industry, government, and academia. University of California Humanities Research Institute The University of California Humanities Research Institute (UCHRI), located at UCI, is a multicampus research unit of the UC Office of the President. Founded in 1987, UCHRI's distinctive mission is to foster intellectual community, research, and public programs across campus boundaries; mobilize the strength of the University of California humanities faculty as a whole; and pro\u00ad mote innovative collaborative and interdisciplinary research among humanities scholars and researchers in disciplines across the social sciences, sciences, technology, and medicine. Residential research groups, historically at the heart of UCHRI's activities, bring together both UC and non-UC scholars, postdoc\u00ad toral fellows, and advanced UC graduate students to work in col\u00ad laboration on interdisciplinary topics of special significance. The groups are expected to communicate their findings following resi\u00ad dency to a broader scholarly community or public. UCHRI's facili\u00ad ties for participating scholars include private offices with e-mail and Internet access, multimedia meeting rooms, and a reference library. Furnished apartments are provided by the Institute for use by fellows on an as-needed basis during their residencies. UCHRI also sponsors a wide range of conferences and seminars, as well as workshops and other research projects at all of the UC campuses. Two new programs have just been launched: short-term residencies for groups with pre-existing collaborative projects nearing comple\u00ad tion; and partnership projects between UC humanities initiatives and community organizations. The UCHRI Advisory Committee, comprising a faculty representative from each UC campus, makes decisions on program proposals and fellowship applications. UCHRI also administers the Kevin Starr Postdoctoral Fellowship in California Studies; the Andrew Vincent White and Florence Wales White Graduate Student Scholarship supporting dissertation research in the humanities or theoretical social sciences and medi\u00ad cine; and the annual summer Seminar in Experimental Critical Theory. The Institute is engaged in an extensive digital humanities initia\u00ad tive in collaboration with researchers both within and beyond the University of California. Scholars interested in UCHRI programs now apply exclusively online via the Institute's FASTAPPS system, which is being adapted for use by other UC units. Virtual collabo\u00ad rative research environments are being implemented as an adjunct to the residential groups. The HASS Grid, developed by UCHRI with the Center for Information Technology Research in the Inter\u00ad est of Society at UC Berkeley and the San Diego Supercomputing Center at UC San Diego, is a major cyberinfrastructure initiative to strengthen research support for the humanities, arts, and social sci\u00ad ences. UCHRI has also led the development of the Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC), a consortium of top-level humanities and science institutions in the U.S. and abroad dedicated to new and productive partnerships across disciplines in order to create tools and databases that will allow for the production of new kinds of knowledge.

Its goals are to create a comprehensive digi\u00ad tal library of Greek literature from antiquity to the present era; to conduct literary research using collected texts; and to apply tech\u00ad nological innovation in these endeavors. The TLG\u00ae corpus cur\u00ad rently contains more than 90 million words of Greek text and essentially all extant texts from Homer to the fall of Byzantium in A.D. 1453. Work is underway to include later periods of Greek literature. TLG\u00ae research activities combine the traditional concerns and methodologies of philological and literary study with the most advanced features of computer technology. Included among current research foci are the identification of ancient Greek literary and documentary .materials from various literary-historical periods; the conversion of these materials into digital form using modem meth\u00ad ods of text encoding; the enhancement of automated text-correction routines; and the formulation of criteria for the lexical analysis and categorization of the texts in the corpus. The project also has estab\u00ad lished procedures to facilitate international access to its textual, bibliographical, and lexical resources either online (http://www.tlg. uci.edu/) or through compact disk. TLG\u00ae's library holdings enhance those of the UCI Langson Library, and TLG\u00ae-related conferences and scholarly visits afford faculty and students contact with eminent scholars in related fields. The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae\u00ae has made UCI a major source of Classics research activity. Organized Research Units Organized Research Units (ORUs) normally consist of an inter\u00ad departmental group of faculty, students, and other researchers engaged in a continuing program of multidisciplinary or interdisci\u00ad plinary research, supported by both University and extramural funding. The work of some ORUs is directed toward the solution of complex contemporary problems, while others conduct basic research essential to the understanding of natural or social phe\u00ad nomena or of humanistic ideas and expressions. The following ORUs have been established on the Irvine campus. CANCER RESEARCH INSTITUTE The Cancer Research Institute provides leadership and support for researchers working toward understanding and controlling cancer. The Institute serves as a means of focusing, coordinating, and directing efforts of scholars in basic and clinical sciences from sev\u00ad eral departments in the Schools of Biological Sciences and Medi\u00ad cine. It provides a central source of information concerning cancer\u00ad related research, as well as a forum in which basic researchers and clinicians can assess advances that may be of immediate value in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and in the detection of chemicals or conditions that cause cancer. Ongoing and projected research activities involve the regulation of cell function, viral car\u00ad cinogenesis, immunology, and basic molecular processes relevant to cancer. The Cancer Research Institute administers Sprague Hall, a research facility in the Biomedical Research Complex dedicated to cancer and genetics. The Cancer Research Institute serves as the basic science arm of UCI's Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive can\u00ad cer center.

CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF DEMOCRACY The Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD) sponsors research and education to enhance our scientific understanding of both the democratic process in the United States as well as in other estab\u00ad lished democracies, and expanding democracy around the world. The Center emphasizes five research programs: (1) Democracy21 focuses on the democratic process in established democracies including the United States as we enter the new century. This pro\u00ad gram examines ways to increase the citizens' ability to express their preferences and have these preferences represented within the democratic process; (2) Democratic Transitions/Consolidation sup\u00ad ports research on the development of sustainable democracies in Eastern Europe, East Asia, and other new democracies; (3) Social Movements and Collective Action focuses on new forms of citizen participation and the use of collective action to expand the bound\u00ad aries of democratic action; (4) Race, Ethnicity, and Democracy focuses on the representation and participation of minorities, and the institutional structures that may encourage democratic equality; and (5) Economics of Governance examines the intersection of economic and political worlds; how economic principles inform or \u00b7should inform policy making and how economic factors enter into political decision making. UCI's expertise in this area was recognized by the National Sci\u00ad ence Foundation, which selected UCI as a national center for the training of graduate students on democracy. The educational activi\u00ad ties continue through the CSD's Democracy Fellows program. CSD hosts an active lecture program, organizes international research conferences, sponsors faculty research, publishes a . research paper series, and facilitates research and teaching on democratic themes. The Center has a multidisciplinary faculty from four UC campuses and is one of the leading university-based programs in America devoted explicitly to the study of democracy. Further information is available at the Center's Web site at http://www.democ.uci.edu/. CENTER FOR VIRUS RESEARCH The primary purpose of the Center for Virus Research is to signifi\u00ad c~ntly stimulate the interaction of UCI virologists with many other UCI basic and clinical researchers. Research on viruses has often provided a biological and technolog\u00ad ical foundation from which much has been discovered concerning the basic molecular processes of organisms. Indeed, this technol\u00ad ogy has had enormous impact on other areas. As such, the very foundations of molecular biology owe much to virus research. Virology continues to teach us much about normal and disease processes (including cancer) of living systems not only at the mol\u00ad ecular and cellular level, but at the level of whole organisms and their p9pulations as well. Viruses have long provided some of the most useful experimental models for disease, cancer, immunity, and genetic systems of gene control. In addition, viral-based tech\u00ad nology is being vigorously pursued and developed in the context of gene therapy and .is teaching us much about the control of cellular processes. With the growing worldwide threat of emerging viral diseases, interest in virus research at all levels has intensified and taken on a new global perspective; thus, there is a need at the international level to become more knowledgeable about viruses and disease. As a consequence, previously separate disciplines such as molecular biology, pathogenesis, evolutionary biology, neurology, and radio\u00ad logical sciences can now be readily linked by virus research. Such research pathways provide a highly interdisciplinary character to the Center for Virus Research at UCI. CRITICAL THEORY INSTITUTE The Critical Theory Institute (CTI) provides a locus for the con\u00ad duct and support of collaborative, interdisciplinary research that focuses on the theoretical underpinnings of such fields as history, literature, philosophy, art, anthropology, politics, and cultural stud\u00ad ies. CTI's principal function is to create a forum for debate among competing movements in contemporary critical theory. CTI's work encompasses not only the application of theory to data but also a self-reflexive investigation of theoretical presuppositions in order to produce alternative theoretical models, methodologies, and research strategies. CTI investigates problems according to three-to four-year research projects on announced topics, such as \"The Forces of Globaliza\u00ad tion\" (1995-99), Security\" (2003-06). Research projects involve collaborations between CTI members and contemporary theorists from around the world. Contributors to each project pre\u00ad sent lectures in CTI's Irvine Lectures in Critical Theory series. Research programs are concluded with the publication of essay collections in CTI's project series with Columbia University Press. See for example, \"Culture\" and the Problem of the Disciplines, edited by John Rowe. CTI additionally hosts the annual Rene Wellek Library Lectures, inaugurated in 1981. Every year, typically in the spring quarter, a distinguished scholar delivers three public lectures on a topic rele\u00ad vant to the field of critical theory. Recent lecturers have included Gayatri Spivak, Judith Butler, Homi Bhabha, Paul Gilroy, Angela Davis, Achille Mbembe, and David Harvey. The Wellek Lectures UC IRVINE - 2006-2007also are published with Columbia University Press in CTI's ongo\u00ad ing series. Other activities sponsored by CTI include workshops, conferences, reading and discussion groups, one-time lectures by international scholars, and co-sponsorships of a number of other theory-related events. In recent years, CTI has established broad connections to distin\u00ad guished institutions and scholars around the world and has been planning collaborative international projects on a regular basis. The inaugural event, a conference entitled \"The States of Theory: China and the West,\" took place in Beijing in the summer of 2000, and was co-organized by CTI and Beijing Language and Culture University. In April of 2002, CTI hosted another major conference, \"Derrida/Deleuze: Psychoanalysis, Territoriality, Politics.\" The two-day event on connections between Derrida and Deleuze featured keynote lectures by Catherine Malabou and Der\u00ad rida, and 1996). In association with the Postcolonial Institute, CTI participated in another interna\u00ad tional conference in September 2003 in Melbourne, Australia. Further information on CTI, including a ~alendar of events, is available at http://www.humanities.uci.edu/critical. DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY CENTER The Developmental Biology Center (DBC) is an Organized Research Unit supporting multi-investigator research and training projects in developmental biology. DBC scientists are investigating how cells cooperate during development to control the growth and development of the body. This involves study of the processes of cell division, migration, and differentiation at the molecular, genetic, and cellular levels using a variety of experimental organ\u00ad isms, as well as human material and, more recently, stem cells. In support of these research programs, DBC manages shared facilities for confocal microscopy, computer-based image processing and analysis, cell sorting and analysis, and surface plasmon resonance measurements of binding kinetics. These facilities are part of the Optical Biology Shared Resource of the Chao Family Comprehen\u00ad sive Cancer Center. DBC also administers training grants to sup\u00ad port both graduate students and postdoctoral investigators, and Pro\u00ad gram Project grants supporting research in multiple laboratories. The unit sponsors seminars; organizes local, national, and interna\u00ad tional conferences; and hosts visiting scientists for collaborative research. The results of the work will contribute to understanding normal development and growth control as well as abnormalities that lead to birth defects, cancer, and nervous-system malfunction in the human body. New research programs are helping to identify chemicals in the environment that pose hazards for human develop\u00ad ment; to help to train scientists in the manipulations of stem cells and in order to better develop methods to stimulate the regrowth of tissues and organs; and to produce tissues for reconstructive surgery. Additional information is available on the World Wide Web at http://mamba.bio.uci.edu/-pjbryant/ dbc/index.htm. GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY RESEARCH INSTITUTE The Genetic Epidemiology Research Institute (GERI) was estab\u00ad lished in 2004 and brings together scientists from epidemiology, developmental and cell biology, molecular biology and biochem\u00ad istry, evolutionary biology, genetics, immunology, statistics, bioin\u00ad formatics, and environmental and behavioral sciences to answer complex questions that can best be explored though an interdisci\u00ad plinary approach. GERI will (1) combine epidemiologic approaches with basic science methods to test hypotheses related to genetic bases of the etiology and progression of disease; (2) facilitate research to apply newly discovered molecular biological processes . and genetic characteristics in health and disease in well-character\u00ad ized human populations; (3) provide epidemiological information that will influence the understanding of the basic processes leading to disease, such as environmental and lifestyle factors, and to test Organized Research Units 87 their effect as modifiers of genetic predisposition, thus providing the foundation for disease prevention; and (4) use advances in information sciences and communication technology to allow for efficient data mining and pattern recognition for genetic epidemio\u00ad logical data. INSTITUTE FOR BRAIN AGING AND DEMENTIA The goal of the Institute is to mobilize and unify University resources to discover meaningful ways to prevent decline in brain function with aging prior to its inception and to reverse loss of function once it has occurred. The elusive, yet attainable goal of \"successful aging,\" maintaining functionality in one's later years, is one of the great challenges facing the nation. While many individu\u00ad als continue to maintain and even improve their intellectual and cognitive skills, others suffer a serious and seemingly irreversible loss of cognitive function and develop dementias, most commonly Alzheimer's disease. The Institute is a fully integrated basic sci\u00ad ence/clinical research program that operates a Dementia Assess\u00ad ment and Treatment Clinic; a Brain Imaging Acquisition/Analysis Unit; a Tissue Repository for cellular and molecular analysis of the aged and Alzheimer's brain; and a comprehensive database of clin\u00ad ical and research data. Research is multidisciplinary, employing the latest techniques in computer science, artificial intelligence, molec\u00ad ular biology, and neuroscience. The Institute also sponsors a spe\u00ad cialized educational track in brain aging and dementia for advanced students who wish to develop a career opportunity in an exciting and expanding field. The Institute is the site of a National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and a State of California Department of Health Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Faculty from the Departments of Neurobiology and Behavior, Neu\u00ad rology, Radiology, Anatomy and Neurobiology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Cogni\u00ad tive Sciences, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science; the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences; and the School of Social Ecology comprise the Institute's core group of investigators. INSTITUTE FOR GENOMICS AND BIOINFORMATICS The Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics (IGB) provides an organizational structure for interdisciplinary in genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, ogy--emerging scientific biol\u00ad ogy, medicine, and society. IGB computational and life scientists are working together to pioneer fundamental processes for reverse engineering gene and protein networks to understand complex bio\u00ad logical systems. Through these interdisciplinary collaborations, IGB scientists are creating new theoretiCal, algorithmic, and software UC IRVINE - 2006-200788 UCI 2006-07 Office of Research advances in storing, retrieving, networking, processing, modeling, analyzing, navigating, and visualizing biological information. In turn, their computational and computer science accomplishments are providing methods, predictions, and new hypotheses that are driving biological research in previously unanticipated ways. This scientific cross-fertilization is enriching both fields and will con\u00ad tinue to do so in the coming decades. More complete descriptions of the Institute's research and training programs are available on the World Wide Web at http://www.igb.uci.edu/. INSTITUTE OF GEOPHYSICS AND PLANETARY PHYSICS The Irvine branch of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP) was established in 2001. IGPP is a University of California Multicampus Research Unit (MRU) established in 1946, with existing branches at UCLA, UCSD, UCR, UCSC, and the Los Alamos and Livermore National Laboratories. The Institute's mis\u00ad sion is to promote and coordinate basic research on the understand\u00ad ing of the origin, structure, and evolution of the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe, and on the prediction of future changes, as they affect human life. The UCI branch's research goals comple\u00ad ment the MRU in that the understanding of the Earth as a coupled system of atmosphere, land, and ocean is required to plausibly pre\u00ad dict future changes in the Earth System. In order to assess the role of human activities on present and future changes in the global environment, as well as the consequent effects on human life, the UCI branch intends to forge links to other UC campuses as well as the national laboratories. The core of the UCI branch is the Center for Global Environmental Change Research (CGECR), which was established in 1999. IGPP promotes research at UCI by (1) supporting major research initiatives and facilities jointly with the School of Physical Sci\u00ad ences and the Department of Earth System Science; (2) by support\u00ad ing research by graduate students; and (3) by supporting vi~iting scientists, seminars, and workshops that promote collaborative research. Facilities that receive IGPP support include: the W. M. Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility, the Stable Isotope in Atmospheric Trace Gas Facility, the Earth System Modeling Facility, and the Earth System Science (ESS) Analytical Mass Spectronomy Facility. INSTITUTE FOR MATHEMATICAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES The Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences fosters research in the application of mathematical models and methods to describe . and to better understand human behavior, both individual and social.

Corporate and institutional sponsorships support ISR's research, activities, and professional meetings. Additional information is available at http://www.isr.uci.edu/. INSTITUTE FOR SURFACE AND INTERFACE SCIENCE The detailed understanding, control, and application of phenomena that occur at surfaces and interfaces requires expertise that cuts across the traditional boundaries of science and engineering. The increased activity in the nanosciences provides an excellent exam\u00ad ple. As structure sizes are reduced into the nanometer regime, the properties of surfaces and interfaces become dramatically more important as the surface-to-volume ratio increases. In this burgeon\u00ad ing new field, new understanding of surface chemistry becomes ever more important to the controlled synthesis of structures (e.g., wires, tubes, particles), new understanding of physics of surfaces and interfaces is required to understand and control the properties, and new engineering approaches are required to convert such struc\u00ad tures into a broad range of new devices. The Institute for Surface and Interface Science (ISIS) at UCI exists to stimulate and foster scientific interactions between member faculty who share a com\u00ad mon interest in molecular and atomistic-scale understanding and control of phenomena that occur on or at the interfaces between one or more phases of matter. A fundamental understanding of sur\u00ad faces and interfaces provides a foundation for control of a myriad of technologically important phenomena including: lubrication, . catalysis, corrosion, chemical sensing, semiconductor-based elec\u00ad tronics, power generation in batteries, fuel cells, and solar cells. ISIS faculty have a diversity of training, experience, and research focuses related to surfaces and interfaces; interactions between members can be highly synergistic, and these interactions make possible a \"vertically integrated\" treatment of complex problems encompassing theory, fundamental experiments, engineering, and application. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), a University of Cali\u00ad fornia multi-campus organized research unit with branches at Irvine, Davis, and Berkeley, was established by act of the State Legislature in 1947 to foster interdisciplinary research on contem\u00ad porary transportation issues. ITS research at UCI involves faculty and students from The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, the School of Social Sciences, the School of Social Ecology, The Paul Merage School of Business, and the Donald Bren School of Infor\u00ad mation and Computer Sciences. ITS has a long and rich history of providing both direct and indi\u00ad rect support to the UCI transportation graduate programs. It pro\u00ad vides office and research space to virtually all of the students enrolled in UCI's four graduate transportation programs-the inter\u00ad disciplinary Program in Transportation Science; the graduate con\u00ad centration in Transportation Economics; the Transportation Plan\u00ad ning option in the Department of Planning, Policy, and Design; and the Transportation Systems Engineering graduate focus in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. ITS provides extensive computing resources to all of these students, together with state-of-the art simulation and laboratory facilities. ITS sub\u00ad scribes to the major transportation research journals and offers a variety of computer-based information retrieval services. Research at ITS covers a broad spectrum of transportation issues. Much of the research conducted by the Institute is organized around centers. The Institute is part of the University of Califor\u00ad nia Transportation Center (UCTC), a federally designated center for transportation research that focuses on research in transporta\u00ad tions systems and policy. The ITS Center for Activity Systems Analysis (CASA) supports research directed toward the develop\u00ad ment of activity-based approaches to travel behavior analysis. For more than 25 years, CASA research associates have been on the leading edge of research in travel demand. analysis, establishing an international reputation in the study of complex travel behavior, activity-based approaches, agent-based models, microsimulation approaches, data collection technologies, and empirical modeling. The ITS Center for Advanced Transportation Management Sys\u00ad tems Research, which is part of the Universitywide PATH (Part\u00ad ners for Advanced Transit and Highways) program, supports research directed toward the development of intelligent transporta\u00ad tion systems. The ITS Advanced Transportation Management Sys\u00ad tems (ATMS) Laboratories provide facilities for the teaching, research, and development of intelligent transportation systems. This major effort is complemented by the ITS Center for Traffic Simulation Studies (CTSS), which features prototype systems for modeling and evaluating intelligent transportation systems and telematics. The Center for Logistical Innovations in Freight Sys\u00ad tems (CLIFS) focuses on the development of optimization tech\u00ad niques for dynamic and stochastic freight and fleet management and investigation of the impacts of information technology on logistics operations. The Center for Urban Infrastructure (CUI) organizes and conducts research into the role of transportation in achieving and promoting sustainable community development. The Institute also plays a major role in the intelligent transportation and telematics research component of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, one of the Institutes for Science and Innovation created by the Governor of California. In addition to projects connected to these centers, ITS researchers are involved in many individual projects across several disciplines. ITS also hosts visiting scholars from the U.S. and abroad to facili\u00ad tate cooperative research and information exchange, and sponsors conferences and colloquia to disseminate research results. Irvine Research Units 89 Irvine Research Units Irvine Research Units (IRU) provide an organizational structure for the conduct of research that is difficult or infeasible to be carried out within the normal school or departmental structure. IRUs nor\u00ad mally are established for a period of five years, and may provide the basis for establishment of extramurally supported research cen\u00ad ters or Organized Research Units. CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH The Center for Health Policy Research (CHPR) is an interdiscipli\u00ad nary faculty re.search organization dedicated to improving the qual\u00ad ity of care and reducing the disparities in health care. Through research, its faculty and associates translate scientific findings into practice by uniting clinical sciences with the social and behavioral science fields of economics, psychology, anthropology, sociology, and business. This unique platform provides the basis for CHPR's research results to directly effect health policy and the health of the local community and the public. CHPR is experiencing dramatic growth in personnel, grant support, and achievements, and is committed to building the Center into a nationally recognized focal point for health care research. CHPR has four principal functions: (1) to produce high-level health policy research in the areas of quality of chronic disease care (i.e., diabetes, cancer, nursing home care) and reduce health disparities and improve quality of care for ethnic minorities; (2) to disseminate research findings to UCI's faculty and students through seminar series, meetings, and publications; (3) to serve as the research center for UCI graduate and undergraduate students who have health inter\u00ad ests; and (4) to support improvements in patient health and safety and organizational improvements in the UCI health care system. CHPR's achievement of these goals begins with its faculty-an interdisciplinary group of national leaders representing health ser\u00ad vices research, health economics, clinical epidemiology, psycho\u00ad metrics, and behavioral sciences in medicine. The current research led by CHPR's members and its campuswide collaborators enhance UCI as one of the best research universities in the country. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007OFFICE OF GRADUATE STUDIES William H. Parker, Dean of Graduate Studies With the exception of programs conducted by the School of Medi\u00ad cine for the training of physicians, the Dean of Graduate Studies administers graduate education in accordance with academic poli\u00ad cies established by the University of California, the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, and the UCI Graduate Council, a standing committee of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. Graduate education includes those students engaged in the pursuit of a mas\u00ad ter's degree, a doctoral degree, or a teaching credential, as well as individuals engaged in postdoctoral training at UCI. There is no separate graduate faculty at UCI; all graduate work is supervised by academic units and faculties which have concurrent responsibil\u00ad ity for undergraduate education. Information about graduate education at UCI is published here in the UCI General Catalogue, on the Office of Graduate Studies Web site, and in individual graduate program publications. The staff of the Office of Graduate Studies and departmental academic advisors are prepared to answer questions about admission, academic poli\u00ad cies and procedures, graduate programs and degrees, financial assis\u00ad tance, student services, and other matters of concern to applicants or graduate students. The Office of Graduate Studies is located in 120 Administration Building; telephone (949) 824-4611; World Wide Web: http://www.rgs.uci.edu/grad. The University of California believes that a diverse student and faculty population is integral to the advancement of academic excellence. It is critical to promoting the lively intellectual exchange and the variety of ideas and perspectives that are essen\u00ad tial to advanced scholarly research and debate. The University is committed to expand student outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts. Through the Office of Graduate Studies' diversity pro\u00ad grams, steps are taken to increase the participation of diverse groups of Americans who have been educationally or socioeco\u00ad nomically disadvantaged. It is the goal of UCI's Office of Graduate Studies to award fellow\u00ad ships to many admitted students based upon merit or financial need. In addition, diversity fellowships for new and continuing graduate students are based on demonstrated scholastic achievement, full-time status, U.S. citizenship, and socioeconomic and educa\u00ad tional limitations. Each academic department identifies those stu\u00ad dents whose scholarship, background, and life experiences can best enhance the level of diversity within a department or discipline. Admission to Graduate Standing Applicants for admission to graduate study at UCI must apply for acceptance into a specific graduate program to work toward a spe\u00ad cific advanced degree. A general requirement for admission is that the applicant hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Letters, Philoso\u00ad phy, or Science (or an acceptable equivalent) from an accredited academic institution with degree standards equivalent to those of the University of California. A minimum undergraduate grade point average of at least B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is required. Each applicant's file is comprehensively evaluated by the faculty admissions committee of the applicant's specific graduate program on the basis of such factors as academic subject preparation, schol\u00ad arship, letters of recommendation, test scores, and examples of pre\u00ad vious work. One critical evaluative question is whether the appli\u00ad cant's academic objectives can reasonably be satisfied by a particular graduate program on this campus. Please note that the University of California does not have the capacity to accommo\u00ad date/admit all applicants who meet the minimum admission requirements. Application Procedures HOWTOAPPLY Prospective students should apply online using the Application for Graduate Study available at http://www.rgs.uci.edu/grad/. Detailed instructions are included in the electronic application. For additional information, send e-mail to ogs@uci.edu or call (949) 824-4611. The mandatory application fee is $60 ($80 for international students) and is not refundable under any circumstances. (Please note, how\u00ad ever, that the application fee for M.B.A. programs offered by The Paul Merage School of Business is $110.) Payment instructions are provided in the electronic application as well as on the Office of Graduate Studies Web site. Financial-need-based application fee waivers may be available for a few domestic (U.S. Citizen or U.S. Permanent Resident) applicants. WHEN TO APPLY For all graduate programs, applications should be completed and submitted by January 15 to receive full consideration for any fin31)_\u00ad cial support. Some academic units may accept applications for winter or spring quarter admission for which deadlines are October 15 and January 15, respectively. In order to process applications in time for the applicant to receive full consideration, letters of rec\u00ad ommendation, official trans.cripts, and official test scores must be received before the published deadlines. Some schools and depart\u00ad ments have earlier or later deadlines for filing the application. Applicants should consult their prospective department or school for more detailed information. Contact information for the schools and departments may be obtained by visiting the online directory at http://www.rgs.uci.edu/grad/contact/prgm_dir.htm. ,Required Supporting Documents LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION Applicants should arrange to have three letters of recommendation forwarded directly to their prospective academic department or program. Recommendation forms are available for downloading at http://www.rgs.uci.edu/grad/. Only one set of three recommenda\u00ad tion letters needs to be submitted in support of an application for admission and fellowship or assistantship consideration. It is important that letters of recommendation be completed primarily by professors or instructors in disciplines related to the proposed course of study who are in a position to analyze an applicant's abilities and academic promise. GRADUATE RECORD EXAMINATION (GRE) SCORES All applicants are required to take the Graduate-Record Examina\u00ad tion (GRE) General Test, with the following exceptions: (1) The Paul Merage School of Business requires that M.B.A. applicants take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), and (2) the only M.F.A. program that requires the GRE General Test for admissions consideration is the M.F.A. program in Arts Computa\u00ad tion Engineering. Several programs also require, or strongly rec\u00ad ommend, that an applicant report the score of a GRE Subject Test. There is no minimum GRE score. Applicants should register for either the October or December test dates to ensure the timely UC IRVINE - 2006-2007receipt of their score results for admission consideration: A com\u00ad puterized version of the GRE is now offered year-round. The stan\u00ad dard written GRE is administered in 96 countries. In addition, sev\u00ad eral administrative service tests are given each year in major U.S. cities (dates vary). Applications for the GRE, as well as informa\u00ad tion about computerized GRE test center locations, is available from the Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541-6000, or online at http://www.gre.org/. DOMESTIC ACADEMIC RECORDS Domestic applicants should request that official transcripts be forwarded directly to their prospective academic department or program. Two complete sets of official records covering all post\u00ad secondary academic work attempted, regardless of length of atten\u00ad dance, are required. Two official Sets of transcripts must also be sub\u00ad mitted by applicants who attended or graduated from any University of California campus, including UC Irvine. Applicants with academic work in progress must expect to complete their undergraduate degree programs before the intended date of enroll\u00ad ment at UCI and must submit evidence of degree conferral before officially enrolling. FOREIGN ACADEMIC RECORDS Official records from overseas institutions should be sent directly to the prospective academic department or program at UCI. Records of academic study from foreign institutions must be offi\u00ad cial, bearing the original signature of the registrar and the seal of the issuing institution. Applicants should not send the original of an academic record which cannot be replaced; they should obtain instead properly certified copies. Unless academic records and diplomas are issued in English by the institution, the official records in their original language must be submitted with an autho\u00ad rized, complete, and exact English translation. Foreign \u00b7academic records must be in duplicate and include all subjects or courses taken on a yearly basis, together with the units of credit or time allotted to each subject each term or year and the marks or ratings in each subject or examination passed. In all cases the institutional grading scale or other standard of evaluation, including maximal passing and failing marks and definition of grades between them, should appear on official records or as an official attachment. Offi\u00ad cial evidence of degree conferral must also be supplied, together with evidence of rank in class if available. DEMONSTRATION OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY FOR ADMISSION Applicants whose primary language is not English are required to demonstrate proficiency in English for admission consideration. However, this requirement will be waived automatically for appli\u00ad cants who have received an advanced degree (i.e., a master's or doctoral degree) from an accredited U.S. college or university. Pro\u00ad ficiency in English may be demonstrated by passing one of two standardized, internationally administered tests: TOEFL (the Test of English as a Foreign Language), or IELTS (International English Language Testing System). The applicant should take one of these tests at the earliest available date to ensur~ that the scores are reported in time to meet application deadlines. Applicants will not be admitted provisionally if they lack an acceptable proficiency score or have not yet taken an acceptable proficiency examination. The TOEFL is administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) (see http://www.ets.org). The minimum scores required for admissions consideration are 550 for the paper-based test, and 213 for the computer-based test. Please note that the minimum score requirements for admission to programs within The Paul Merage School of Business are 600 for the paper-based test, and 250 for the computer-based test. Required Supporting Documents 91 ETS recently began rolling out the TOEFL iBT (Internet-based Test) as the next generation of the TOEFL examination. The test was introduced in September 2005 in the U.S. and will be phased in for other countries through 2006. For the TOEFL iBT, the mini\u00ad mum required overall score for admission is 80. TOEFL and TOEFL iBT scores that are two years old or older are not acceptable. Results of institutional (non-ETS) administrations of the TOEFL or TOEFL iBT are not acceptable. English language proficiency may also be demonstrated by passing the Academic Modules of the International English Language Test\u00ad ing System (IELTS) examination (http://www.ielts.org). The mini\u00ad mum requirements for admissions consideration are an overall score of 7, with a score of no less than 6 on any individual module. IELTS test scores that are two years old or older are not acceptable. Additional information about English language proficiency for the purpose of graduate admission to UCI is available at http://www.rgs.uci.edu/grad/prospective/toefl.htm. DEMONSTRATION OF ORAL ENGLISH PROFICIENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL TEACHING ASSISTANT/ASSOCIATE EMPLOYMENT Many UCI degree programs require students to serve as a Teaching Assistant for training purposes and as a graduation requirement. UCI encourages (and some individual graduate programs require) prospective students to take and pass one of the accepted oral Eng\u00ad lish proficiency examinations prior to application/admission. Inter\u00ad national and U.S. Permanent Resident graduate students who are not citizens of countries where English is either the primary or dominant language as approved by the UCI Graduate Council, who wish to be considered for appointment as a Teaching Assistant/ Associate, must pass one of the following English proficiency examinations: Test of Spoken English (TSE), Test of English as a For~ign Language Internet-based Test (TOEFL iBT), International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or UCI campus Speak\u00ad ing Proficiency English Assessment Kit (SPEAK) test. Both TSE and TOEFL iBT are administered by the Educational Testing Ser\u00ad vice (ETS). IELTS, on the other hand, is administered through the partnership of the British Council, IDP: IELTS Australia and the University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations. Once a student is UC IRVINE - 2006-200792 UCI 2006-07 Office of Graduate Studies admitted to UCI, the SPEAK test, which is administered by the UCI Humanities Instructional Resource Center (HIRC), is an option to satisfy this requirement. Achieving a minimum score of 50 on the TSE, a score of 26 on the speaking portion of the TOEFL iBT, a score of 8 on the speaking module of the IELTS, or a score of 50 on the SPEAK test satisfies the oral proficiency requirement and may establish eligibility for a Teaching Assis\u00ad tant/ Associate appointment. Graduate students are responsible for ensuring that the UCI Office of Graduate Studies is notified directly of their scores by the testing centers. There is no exception to this requirement. A full discussion of English proficiency options and links to the agency sites offering these examinations are available at http://www.rgs.uci.edu/grad/students/esl_tests.htm. Students who are citizens of the United States (regardless of coun\u00ad try of origin) and citizens of countries where English is either the primary or dominant language as approved by the UCI Graduate Council are exempt from the requirement of taking and passing the English language proficiency examinations. Non-U.S. citizens who are U.S. Permanent Residents or hold other non-citizen status and are residing in the United States, who have completed their under\u00ad graduate education in the United States, or have attended American schools abroad are still required to pass one of the English lan\u00ad guage proficiency examinations noted above. International and U.S. Permanent Resident graduate students whose native language is not English, who have completed all years of their high school education in the United States, are eligible to request an exemption by submitting a request and official high school transcripts to the Graduate Student Employment Analyst in the Office of Graduate Studies. No student is permitted to begin an appointment as a Teaching Assistant/Associate until the exemption has been approved in writing. SPECIAL NOTE TO FOREIGN APPLICANTS If admitted, foreign applicants will be required to certify that they possess sufficient funds to cover all fees, transportation, and living expenses for the first year of their studies at UCI. A Confidential International Applicant Questionnaire for the purpose of verifying the amount and source of funds available for graduate study will be forwarded to foreign applicants upon admission to graduate study. The required financial verification must be provided before a visa can be issued. Admission and Registration A formal notice of the admission decision is sent to each applicant as soon as possible after the application and complete records are received, and after the department has made a recommendation. The official notification will be mailed well in advance of the beginning of the quarter for which application has been made. Admission to graduate standing does not constitute registration for classes. A student is not officially registered for classes until the entire registration procedure is completed each quarter, including payment of registration and other University fees and enrollment in courses. Information on registration dates and procedures will be mailed to new applicants prior to the registration cycle. Extensive information for newly admitted students is available online at http://www.rgs. uci.edu/grad/newadmits/index.htm. If an applicant wishes to defer admission to a later academic quar\u00ad ter (up to a maximum of three quarters after the original quarter of admission), the Office of Graduate Studies must be notified of the request in writing. After formal admission has been offered, the request for deferral must also be approved by the academic pro\u00ad gram to which the applicant was admitted. Academic Advising In each academic unit with an advanced degree program, there is at least one formally appointed faculty graduate advisor or director of graduate studies. The graduate advisor is a regular faculty member responsible for supervising graduate study in that unit, for monitor\u00ad ing the academic progress of graduate students, and for seeing that each graduate student is assigned a faculty advisor. The graduate advisor plays a key role in the academic lives of graduate students, advising students and other faculty members about program requirements and the academic policies pertaining to graduate stu\u00ad dents, approving study lists, and evaluating academic petitions. In many academic units the graduate advisor is instrumental in the nomination of students for fellowship support, the selection of stu\u00ad dents for assistantship and fellowship appointments, and in the supervision of graduate student teachers. In most schools there also is an associate dean for graduate studies who coordinates many of the functions which affect graduate students within that school. Both graduate advisors and deans are important links between the student and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Most graduate students also will have an individual faculty advisor or advising committee after the first year of graduate study. When a student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., the doctoral com\u00ad mittee becomes the primary source of academic guidance; how\u00ad ever, student academic petitions still must be approved by the fac\u00ad ulty graduate advisor. Academic Policies The academic policies described here apply to students enrolled in study leading to graduate degrees and California education creden\u00ad tials. Other regulations and procedures are covered in the Acade\u00ad mic Regulations and Enrollment and Other Procedures sections, and in the description of each gradua~e program. SCHOLASTIC REQUIREMENTS A graduate student is expected to make satisfactory progress toward an approved academic objective, as defined by the faculty of the program in accordance with policies of the Graduate Coun\u00ad cil, and to maintain a satisfactory grade point average for all work undertaken while enrolled in graduate study. Satisfactory progress is determined on the basis of both the recent academic record and overall performance. A graduate student normally is expected to complete satisfactorily at least eight units of academic credit applicable to the graduate program in each regular academic ses\u00ad sion (unl.ess on an approved leave of absence), and satisfy all requirements of the academic program according to an approved schedule. For a graduate student, only the grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship and may be applied toward advanced degree requirements. However, a UCI course in which a grade of B-is earned may be accepted, via a formal peti\u00ad tion process, in partial satisfaction of the degree requirements if the student has a grade point average of at least 3.0 in all courses applicable to the degree. Graduate students may not apply courses graded Pass/Not Pass toward any degree or satisfactory progress requirements. A grade point average below the B level (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is not satisfactory, and a student whose grade point aver\u00ad age is below that level is subject to academic disqualification. A student's academic progress ordinarily is evaluated on the basis of the academic record. A few weeks after the end of a quarter, an updated copy of each enrolled student's permanent academic record is available from the Registrar. This record lists all UCI courses for which a graduate student was enrolled (including courses taken through the Intercampus Exchange Program), the grades assigned, and the cumulative grade point average. This record also includes formal candidacy for an advanced degree, degrees conferred, certain examinations passed, unit credit UC IRVINE - 2006-2007accepted from other institutions, and other important academic information. A graduate student who has not demonstrated satisfactory acade\u00ad mic progress is not eligible for any academic appointment such as Reader, Tutor, Graduate Student Researcher, Teaching Associate, or Teaching Assistant, and may not hold a fellowship or other award which is based upon academic merit. SATISFACTION OF DEGREE REQUIREMENTS To graduate, students must satisfy the degree requirements outlined in the Catalogue that is in effect at the time they are admitted to a graduate program. If the degree requirements are subsequently revised, the academic unit may, where appropriate, give students the option to meet the n.ew requirements instead. A student who withdraws from a program, or loses student status for other reasons for one or more quarters, will be bound by the degree requirements in effect at the time of readmission unless otherwise stipulated and agreed to in writing by the academic unit and approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies. A student who defers admission or who changes to another program will be held to the requirements in effect at the time of first registration. GRADING With the consent of the academic units involved, and.upon approval by the Graduate Council, individual study and research courses at the graduate level may be graded Satisfactory or Unsat\u00ad isfactory (SID). Also, with the approval of the Graduate Council certain graduate courses are graded S/U only. A grade of S is assumed equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No course credit is given to a student for a course in which a grade of U is received. Graduate students may take one undergraduate course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program and are not applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree. The grade of Incomplete (I) may be assigned by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control. Ordinarily, incom\u00ad plete grades do not affect a graduate student's grade point average, but they are an important factor in evaluating academic progress. Further, when computing GPA to determine whether the student meets the minimum GPA requirement for graduation (3.0), I grades are counted as F (i.e., zero grade points). The maximum amount of time that an instructor may allow for making up incomplete work is three quarters of enrollment but stricter~limits may be applied. When work is completed within the time allowed, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change-of-grade notice to the Registrar, through the dean of the school in which the course was offered. If not made up within the time allowed, an I grade is recorded permanently. (Students who have not been continuously enrolled should contact their graduate advisor for information about completion of incomplete grades.) IP (In Progress) is a transcript notation restricted to sequential courses extending over two or more quarters for which use of the IP notation has been approved. When the last quarter of the sequence is completed, the grade for the final quarter is assigned for all quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. A student who received an NR (No Report) transcript notation must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. If no action is taken by the end of the first quarter following the quarter in which the NR was assigned, or by the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first, the NR becomes an F, U, or NP and will remain permanently on the student's record. Academic Policies 93 A graduate student may repeat once a course in which a grade below B (3.0) or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade is used in computing the student's grade point aver\u00ad age for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades are used. Additional information about grading may be found in the Acade\u00ad mic Regulations section. LANGUAGE POLICY FOR EXAMINATIONS AND THESES/DISSERTATIONS English is to be the language of instruction and examination for graduate courses at UCI, unless the subject matter includes foreign language content. Similarly, examinations that satisfy specific degree requirements, such as qualifying/candidacy examinations and thesis/dissertation defenses will be conducted in English, except for the portions of the examination where the subject matter makes a different language specifically appropriate. (Examples include foreign language literature, linguistics, and others.) Students must seek permission to write their thesis/dissertation in a language other than English. To do so, immediately after advance\u00ad ment to candidacy, the candidate must submit to the Dean of Grad\u00ad uate Studies a letter approved by the thesis/dissertation chair, com\u00ad mittee, and department chair. All members of the candidate's thesis/dissertation committee must have a reading knowledge of the language presented in the thesis/dissertation. There must be legitimate reasons for substituting English with a foreign language such as subject matter, special primary audience, publication arrangements, academic position in a foreign country, historical or literary value, or principallanguage(s) used in the documents to be analyzed and interpreted. Inability to write in English is not a valid reason. If the thesis or dissertation is approved to be written in a foreign language, the candidate must submit two abstracts. One must be in English. The other must be written in the language of the thesis or dissertation. Moreover, the thesis/dissertation defense will be conducted in English, except as determined by sub\u00ad ject matter. See the UC/ Thesis and Dissertation Manual for infor\u00ad mation about the preparation of manuscripts (http://www.lib.uci.edu/ libraries/collections/speciaUthesis/tdmanual.html). UC IRVINE - 2006-200794 UCI 2006-07 Office of Graduate Studies ACADEMIC DISQUALIFICATION After consultation with the student's academic unit, the Dean of Graduate Studies may disqualify a student who has a grade point average in graduate and upper-division courses below 3.0 for two or more successive quarters; or fails to pass (or does not take) a required examination or course within the time specified for that graduate program; or does not maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an approved program of study. Unsatisfactory academic progress may be determined on the basis of explicit requirements, but the professional judgment of the fac\u00ad ulty upon review of all graduate work undertaken by the student is paramount. Ordinarily, a student whose work does not meet acade\u00ad mic standards will be given written notice and a reasonable period of time in which to make up all deficiencies. Prior to taking final action to disqualify, the Dean of Graduate Studies ordinarily will notify a student who is subject to academic disqualification and will provide reasonable opportunity for the student to correct erroneous or outdated academic records, to sub\u00ad mit other information or comments in writing, or to request a sec\u00ad ond review of his or her academic performance. Upon written notice of academic disqualification by the Dean of Graduate Studies, disqualification will be noted on the formal aca\u00ad demic record of that student. Following the formal notice of dis\u00ad qualification, the student may appeal to the Dean of Graduate Studies only on the basis of procedural error. ACADEMIC RESIDENCE A graduate student is considered to be in residence during an acad\u00ad emic quarter if at least four units of academic credit are earned in regular upper-division or graduate courses. Credit for one academic quarter of residence may also be earned by completing at least two units of credit in approved courses in each of two six-week sum\u00ad mer sessions, or four units of credit in an eight-or ten-week sum\u00ad mer session. In the case of Ph.D. students, these must be consecu\u00ad tive sessions. ENROLLMENT POLICY Full-time academic enrollment is expected of graduate students at the University of California. Study for the Ph.D. requires a full\u00ad time commitment from the doctoral student. Full-time study is defined as enrollment in at least 12 units of upper-division or grad\u00ad uate academic credit per quarter, including credit for supervised research or teaching. Graduate students may enroll in lower-divi\u00ad sion courses with the approval of their academic advisors, but such courses are not considered to be part of any graduate program. Graduate students ordinarily may not receive credit for more than 12 units per quarter in graduate courses, or 16 units in upper-divi\u00ad sion courses, or a proportionate number in combination. Course loads in excess of 16 units must be approved in advance by the stu\u00ad dent's Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Although in most instances completion of an advanced degree at UCI requires full-time study, the University recognizes the legiti\u00ad mate need for part-time study opportunities and is committed to providing those opportunities wherever possible. Graduate degree programs may be opened to part-time students wherever good edu\u00ad cational reasons exist for so doing. In general, part-time status is available in master's and credential programs where part-time study has been judged academically feasible by faculty and approved by the Graduate Council. However, on the recommenda\u00ad tion of the academic unit, students admitted to a Ph.D. program may be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies for part-time status on an ad hoc basis. Under this policy, part-time enrollment at the graduate level is defined as enrollment for eight units or less. Within the guidelines and limitations noted on the application form available on the Office of Graduate Studies Web site, graduate stu\u00ad dents may petition for part-time status for a maximum of three consecutive quarters and, if the petition is approved, shall pay the full University Registration Fee and student activities fees, one-half the Educational Fee, and if applicable, one-half the Nonresident Tuition Fee and one-half the Professional School Student Fee. CONTINUOUS REGISTRATION A graduate student is expected to register for each regular acade\u00ad mic session (fall, winter, and spring quarters) until all requirements for an advanced degree or credential have been completed, includ\u00ad ing final examinations and the submission of an approved thesis or dissertation. Registration is not official or complete until all required fees have been paid and the student has enrolled in classes. Stu\u00ad dents are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollment is correct. A student engaged in study or research outside the State of Califor\u00ad nia for an entire quarter ordinarily will be required to register in absentia. Unless an official leave of absence has been granted, or a petition to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration has been approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies, a student who does not register by the final deadline for any regular quarter will lose grad\u00ad uate standing (i.e., the individual's status as a graduate student will lapse), and candidacy for any advanced degree will lapse. Prior to resuming graduate study in the University, a former student must successfully apply for readmission. If readmitted, the student must satisfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmis\u00ad sion and may be required to satisfy certain requirements a second time, including those for formal advancement to candidacy. A readmitted student must register and then be advanced to candi\u00ad dacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree. A degree cannot be conferred earlier than the second quarter follow\u00ad ing readmission. A graduate student who decides to leave the University after enrolling and paying fees for a quarter must file an official Notice of Withdrawal or Cancellation with the Dean of Graduate Studies. A graduate student in good academic standing who withdraws from graduate study and intends to return within one year may sub\u00ad mit an application for a leave of absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for read\u00ad mission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. LEAVE OF ABSENCE A graduate student who withdraws from the University with the intention of returning within one year and wishes to avoid a lapse of student status should request a leave of absence. A leave of absence of up to one year's duration may be granted by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon the recommendation of the student's aca\u00ad demic unit, subject to the following guidelines: 1. The student must have completed satisfactorily at least one quar\u00ad ter in residence and be in good academic standing. The leave must be consistent with the student's academic objectives. 2. Leave ordinarily is approved in cases of serious illness or other temporary disability, or temporary interruption of the student's academic program for other appropriate reasons. 3. A student on leave is not eligible for assistance from a University fellowship, research grant, or financial aid program, and may not hold an academic appointment or be employed by the University in any capacity. During a period of leave, a student may not take comprehensive or qualifying examinations or earn academic credit (except by a transfer of credit from another institution approved in advance by the Dean of Graduate Studies). University resources and facilities, including housing, are ordinarily unavail\u00ad able to students on leave. UC IRVINE - 2006-20074. A student failing to register for the next regular academic session following the expiration of leave will lose graduate standing and will be subject to the following readmission policy. READMISSION A student who previously withdrew from the University, or whose student status has lapsed, may request readmission to graduate study by submitting online a new Application for Graduate Study with the nonrefundable $60 fee ($80 for international students). The Dean of Graduate.Studies may grant readmission when recom\u00ad mended by the academic unit. If readmitted, a student's previous \u00b7 academic work will be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree only with the approval of the graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. A readmitted student must sat\u00ad isfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmission and may be required to satisfy certain requirements a second time, including those for formal advancement to candidacy. A readmitted student must register and then be advanced or reinstated to candi\u00ad dacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree, which will be conferred no earlier than the second quarter follow\u00ad ing readmission. INTERCAMPUS EXCHANGE PROGRAM A graduate stuqent in good standing who wishes to take advantage of educational opportunities available only at another campus of the University of California may do so through the Intercampus Exchange Program. Ordinarily, an exchange student will have demonstrated a high level of scholarship during at least one quarter of graduate study at the home campus and will have well-defined academic objectives. Approval of the faculty advisor, the host department(s), and the respective Deans of Graduate Studies is required. Direct arrangements between faculty members on the two campuses are encouraged so as to ensure that courses, seminars, or facilities will be available to meet the participating student's needs. Students may take courses on more than one campus of the Univer\u00ad sity in the same academic session. The exchange student enrolls and pays fees on the home campus and then enrolls at the host campus, following the procedures of that Registrar's Office. A report of academic work completed will be transferred to the student's academic record on the home cam\u00ad pus after the term has ended. Although eligible for all normal stu\u00ad dent services, the exchange student is a visitor and is not formally admitted to graduate study at the host campus. Application forms for the Intercampus Exchange Program may be downloaded from the Office of Graduate Studies Web site at http://www.rgs.uci.edu/ grad/students/forms.htm and should be filed with the Office at least four weeks before the beginning of the quarter in order to avoid penalties. TRANSFERS OF CREDIT At least one-half of the course requirement for a master's degree must be completed while in residence as a graduate student at UCI. Credit for up to one-fifth of the minimum number of units required for a master's degree may be allowed for graduate-level work com\u00ad pleted at another institution or through University Extension prior to first graduate enrollment at UCI. Such courses do not count toward the required number of units in 200-series courses. Up to one-half the units required may be accepted from another graduate division of the University of California. After enrollment, the stu\u00ad dent must initiate a formal petition for such credit and submit an original transcript. The acceptance of unit credit earned in another program must be recommended by the academic unit to which the student has been admitted and be approved by the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Stl.ldies. No units of transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B (3.0) or equivalent was assigned. Under no circumstances will grade credit be transferred. Graduate Degrees 95 A student currently enrolled in a master's degree program or on a leave of absence may receive unit credit (not grade credit) for graduate-level work completed at another institution or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the depart\u00ad mental graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. No transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B or equivalent is received. A student who begins graduate study at UCI in the fall quarter will receive appropriate credit for courses taken in preceding UCI sum\u00ad mer sessions, provided that the formal date of admission precedes summer session enrollment. Continuing graduate students will receive credit for courses taken in intervening UCI summer sessions. Graduate Degrees MASTER'S DEGREES The master's degree is conferred at the end of the academic quarter in \u00b7which all requirements have been satisfied, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council. The student must be advanced to candidacy for the degree prior to the beginning of the final quarter of enrollment. Therefore, an application for advancement to candi\u00ad dacy, initiated by the student and approved by the academic unit, should be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies at least 30 days before the opening of the quarter in which the degree is expected. The Master of Arts (M.A.) or Master of Science (M.S.) degree nor\u00ad mally is attained by one of two routes: Plan I, the thesis option; or Plan II, the comprehensive examination option. Both require a minimum of one year in residence, satisfactory completion of pre\u00ad scribed course work, and an appropriate demonstration of achieve\u00ad ment. Plan I includes a minimum of seven courses (28 units), 20 units or more of which must be at the graduate level; a thesis; and a general examination. Plan II requires at least nine courses (36 units), including 24 units or more at the graduate level, and a com\u00ad prehensive examination covering a broad range of subject matter in the discipline. Only approved 200-series courses completed while in residence at the University satisfy the minimum graduate course requirement. Some programs will have course requirements exceeding the minimums cited above and may have additional or alternative degree requirements. Please refer to the description of the specific program for more information. Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degrees are awarded by the Claire Trevor School of the Arts (M.F.A. in Dance, Drama, Fine Arts, Music, or Studio Art) and by the Program in Creative Writing (M.F.A. in English) upon successful completion of the equivalent of two years or more of full-time study with an emphasis upon cre\u00ad ative expression and professional development. Special thesis or comprehensive examination requirements are established for these programs. Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) degrees are awarded upon successful completion of programs designed for the professional development of elementary and secondary school teachers. A mini\u00ad mum of one year in residence is required, usually including sum\u00ad mer session course work. A thesis project or other comparable evi\u00ad dence of professional attainment is part of each M.A.T. program. Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) degrees are awarded by The Paul Merage School of Business upon successful comple\u00ad tion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study in the devel\u00ad opment of professional managerial skills. Master of Advanced Study (M.A.S.) degrees are awarded by the School of Social Ecology in Criminology, Law and Society upon successful completion of 52 units of course work in the broad areas of criminal justice, including corrections, probation, criminal pros\u00ad ecution, defense, and civil law. The program is fully online with UC IRVINE - 2006-200796 UCI 2006-07 Office of Graduate Studies the exception of a required one-week in-residence course during the first fall quarter. Master of Urban and Regional Planning (M.U.R.P.) degrees are awarded by the School of Social Ecology upon successful comple\u00ad tion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study in contempo\u00ad rary methods of planning and policy analysis. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is awarded on the basis of evidence that the recipient possesses knowledge of a broad field of learning and expert Il?-astery of a particular area of concentration within it. The research dissertation is expected to demonstrate criti\u00ad cal judgment, intellectual synthesis, creativity, and skill in written communication. Students are required to advance to candidacy for the doctorate, and to complete all requirements for the doctoral degree, within the normal time specified by the individual graduate program. Students who fail to complete the degree within the normal time limit for their program shall be deemed as not making satisfactory academic progress, and will not be qualified to continue to receive non\u00ad instructional University resources (e.g., financial aid, teaching assistantships, student housing). Normal time-to-degree parameters for each doctoral program are indicated in the academic unit sec\u00ad tions of this Catalogue. The candidate for the Ph.D. is expected to be in full-time residence for at least six regular academic quarters. Four to six years of full-. time academic work beyond the bachelor's degree typically is required to complete the degree. At the end of the first year or so of full-time study, many programs administer a preliminary exami! nation on the student's mastery of fundamental knowledge in the discipline. Upon successfully demonstrating a high level of schol\u00ad arship on this examination and after further study, the student will continue to a series of qualifying examinations which lead to for\u00ad mal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. Graduate students ordinarily attain candidacy status for the Ph.D. degree when all preparatory work has been completed, when quali\u00ad fying examinations have been passed, and when they are ready for the dissertation phase. Students are recommended for advancement to candidacy by unanimous vote of the candidacy committee appointed by the academic unit on behalf of the Graduate Council. The Report of the Ph.D. Candidacy Committee (Form I) must be signed by the committee at the time the candidacy examination is concluded and submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies. Follow\u00ad ing a unanimous favorable vote of the committee, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon payment of the $65 Candidacy Fee. Candidacy for the Ph.D. will lapse automatically if the student loses graduate standing by academic disqualification or failure to comply with the University policy on continuous registration. A readmitted student who was a candidate for the Ph.D. must again advance to candidacy and thereafter enroll as a candidate for at least one academic quarter before the Ph.D. may be conferred. Following advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D., a doctoral committee appointed by the academic unit chair (on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council) supervises the student's program, approves the dissertation, and conducts the final oral examination if required. The chair of the doctoral committee is the member of the faculty responsible for providing primary guid\u00ad ance of the student's dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will be given just prior to completion of the dissertation and while the student is in residence during a regular academic session, and will be open to all members of the academic community. All stu\u00ad dent committees must conform to policy approved by the Graduate Council in effect at the time of examination. Ph.D. degrees are conferred, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council, as of the last day of the regular academic quarter in which all require\u00ad ments have been satisfied. DOCTOR OF EDUCATION DEGREE The Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) degree is awarded by UCI in con\u00ad junction with several California State University campuses. Refer to the Department of Education section of this Catalogue for more information, including normal time to advancement and normal time to degree for this program. THESES AND DISSERTATIONS Candidates for the Ph.D., Ed.D., and certain master's degrees must conduct an extensive research project and submit a dissertation or thesis in order to fulfill degree requirements. Research expenses are not supported by the University, and the cost of preparing the dissertation or thesis ordinarily ranges from $200 to $1,000, but may be considerably more. After approval by the doctoral or thesis committee appointed for each candidate by the academic unit, on behalf of the Graduate Council, two copies of the dissertation or thesis must be filed for placement in the UCI Library and automatically become available for public access. The final copy must meet the University's requirements for style, format, and appearance before the degree can be conferred. A thesis and dissertation manuscript preparation manual is available online at http://www.lib.uci.edu/libraries/ collections/speciallthesis/tdmanual.html. All doctoral students are required to submit an Exit Survey and a Survey of Earned Doctor\u00ad ates prior to the awarding of their degree. Dissertations and theses must be filed by the deadline published on the Office of Graduate Studies Web site (http://www.rgs.uci.edu/ grad/students/forms/filing_deadlines.pdf) in order for them to be reviewed and accepted in time for the degree to be conferred in that quarter. Those students who complete requirements and submit theses/dis\u00ad sertations after the end of the tenth week of classes and prior to the start of the subsequent quarter will earn a degree for the following quarter, but will not be required to pay fees for that quarter. Please note that in order to avoid payment of fees, manuscripts, all forms, and degree paperwork must be submitted prior to the first day of the quarter in which the degree is to be earned. THE FILING FEE Under certain circumstances, a student who has advanced to candi\u00ad dacy for a graduate degree may be eligible to pay a Filing Fee equal to half of the Registration Fee in lieu of registration, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies. International stu\u00ad dents who wish to go on Filing Fee status must, in addition, secure approval to do so from UCI's International Center. In general, all requirements for a degree must have been satisfied prior to the start of the quarter, except for the submission of the final version of the dissertation or thesis, or the completion of a final oral or compre\u00ad hensive examination. A student on Filing Fee status may not make use of any University resource, hold any academic appointment, or receive any student service for which official registration and pay\u00ad ment of regular fees is a requirement. A Filing Fee will not be accepted immediately following readmission nor immediately fol\u00ad lowing a leave of absence except under exceptional circumstances. The date for payment of the Filing Fee is the same as that for the payment of other student fees. If all degree requirements are not completed during the quarter in which the Filing Fee is paid, the stu\u00ad dent must subsequently register and pay all applicable fees. Students may only utilize the filing fee option for one academic quarter. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007NONRESIDENT TUITION Nonresident doctoral students who have advanced to candidacy are eligible for a 100 percent reduction in the annual nonresident tuition fee for a maximum of three consecutive calendar years including time on leave of absence. Reduced nonresident tuition begins with the first academic term following advancement to can\u00ad didacy. Any nonresident student who continues to be enrolled, or who re-enrolls following the three-year maximum allowance, will be charged the full nonresident tuition rate that is in effect at that time of enrollment. CONFERRAL OF GRADUATE DEGREES Prior to the beginning of the quarter in which an advanced degree is to be conferred, the student must have advanced to candidacy for that degree and should haye received formal notice confirming candidacy from the Dean of Graduate Studies. The student should consult the departmental faculty graduate advisor to determine which degree requirements, if any, have not yet been satisfied. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available, which is approximately six months after the quarter in which the. degrees are awarded. Financial Assistance for Graduate Students Several types of financial assistance are available to graduate stu\u00ad dents at UCI. These include fellowships, teaching and research assistantships, tuition fellowships for nonresident students, grants\u00ad in-aid, and student loans. All domestic graduate students are encouraged to submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year to access state and federal grants and loans. It is available online at http://www.fafsa.ed.gov or in the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships after January 1, with a submission deadline of March 2 each year. The Financial Aid section in this Catalogue and the Financial Aid Handbook (http://www.ofas.uci.edu/) contain infor\u00ad mation about assistance based upon financial need that is adminis\u00ad tered by the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. Applicants interested in assistantships or fellowships should so indicate on their application when applying for admission. Appli\u00ad cations for graduate admissions should be completed by January 15 to receive full consideration for fellowship and assistantship awards. Continuing students interested in an assistantship or fel\u00ad lowship should contact the graduate advisor for their academic pro\u00ad gram. The awarding of fellowships to incoming students for the following academic year begins in the winter quarter. UCI subscribes to the agreement of the Council of Graduate Schools of the United States, under which successful applicants for awards of financial support are given until April 15 to accept or decline such awards. An award accepted from one of the member universi\u00ad ties may be resigned at any time through April 15. However, an acceptance given or left in force after that date commits the student to not accepting another appointment without first obtaining formal release for that purpose from the awarding institution. Regents', UCI Chancellor's Fellowships, and other merit-based fellowships are awarded by some schools to a number of promising students entering graduate study at UCI leading to the Doctor of Philosophy or Master of Fine Arts degree. Awards may include a stipend, all required student fees, and, if applicable, Nonresident Tuition. Other fellowships are offered, including tuition awards for outstanding applicants who are not residents of California. In many cases, fellowship stipends may be supplemented by partial assist\u00ad antship appointments. Fellowship awards are typically made by the student's academic unit. Financial Assistance for Graduate Students 97 Entering or continuing graduate students may be awarded research or teaching assistantships for all or part of the academic year. The types of assistantships, number available, and required duties vary according to the activities of the academic unit. A graduate assis\u00ad tant who is not a California resident also may receive a tuition fellowship. While enrolled as a graduate student at UCI, students are limited in their employment with the University to no more than 50 percent time. Fellowship support as well as research or teaching assistantships all require students to maintain satisfactory academic progress. Through the Office of Graduate Studies' diversity programs, a number of diversity fellowships are awarded to entering and con\u00ad tinuing domestic graduate students who may have been disadvan\u00ad taged in higher education. Departments nominate candidates on the basis of their merit and contribution to the diversity of the depart\u00ad ment or discipline, as well as demonstrated scholastic achievement, full-time status, and U.S. citizenship. Individuals from diverse cul\u00ad tural, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds are especially encouraged to apply to UCI's graduate programs. In conformance with State law, applicants may not be given preferential treatment on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or national origin.

Graduate Program The primary endeavor of the Claire Trevor School of the Arts is the creative act. Research activities are pursued both as an end in themselves and as a source that can inform both performance and the studio experience. The intellectual activity of theoretical, liter\u00ad ary, and historical courses complements the practical work in stu\u00ad dio workshops and performance. The aim of the M.F.A. programs in Dance, Drama, Music, and Studio Art is, thus, to produce artists literate in both traditional and digital media who are disciplined, responsive to intellectual stimuli, and capable of integrating exist\u00ad ing knowledge into creative projects. The M.F.A. concentration in Arts Computation Engineering provides broad-based, interdiscipli\u00ad nary training at the intersection of digital technology and cultural and artistic practice. The UCI-UCSD joint doctoral program in Drama and Theatre provides opportunity for significant crossover research. and teaching between the two campuses irt a wide range of areas in drama and the theatre. It is the strong belief of the UCI Claire Trevor School of the Arts that intellectual integrity and cre\u00ad ative excellence cannot exist without each other. ADMISSION TO THE PROGRAM Applications are accepted for fall quarter admission only, and ordi\u00ad narily must be completed by January 15 for the Ph.D. in Drama and Theatre and the M.F.A. in Studio Art, February 1 for the M.F.A. in Music, and March 1 for all other M.F.A. programs, as the number of graduate students that can be admitted to the Claire Trevor School of the Arts is limited. Applicants are advised to arrange for auditions, interviews, and the submission of portfolios, compositions, and dossiers by the appropriate deadlines. Students applying for scholarships and fellowships should do so by January 15, and are also encouraged to apply for financial assistance through the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. The Claire Trevor School of the Arts has a modest number of teaching assist\u00ad antships available in all areas, and all candidates are automatically reviewed for teaching assistantship positions; the School informs successful candidates by June 1 for the following academic year. Upon admission to the program the student is assigned an advisor. Students should discuss with their advisor the scope of undergradu\u00ad ate preparation to determine any areas which may need strengthen\u00ad ing if full benefit from graduate study is to be derived. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 1 00 UCI2006-07 Claire Trevor School of the Arts Minor in Digital Arts The minor in Digital Arts is geared toward students with computer skills who want a grounding in the arts. This program allows stu\u00ad dents to acquire a working knowledge of digital media and related technological skills within an arts context. Through readings, dis\u00ad cussion, and hands-on experience, students learn basic aesthetic components of digital media practices, relating computer-based arts to traditional art forms. Courses provide a broad survey of the\u00ad ory and praxis, touching on such areas as computational media, interface design, computer music, networked art, telematic perfor\u00ad mance, intelligent agents, virtual realities, artificial life, ubiquitous computing, and interdisciplinary approaches. Lectures and readings address the overlap of artistic and scientific practices, critical issues related to dependence on new and emerging technologies, and the long-term social, cultural, and political consequences of technological change for the arts. Prospective students in the minor must have the ability to use e-mail, surf the net, and use word processing software, and it is highly recommended that students have their own computer. Addi\u00ad tional information is available at http://www.arts.uci.edu. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR The minor in Digital Arts consists of a minimum of eight courses which fall into three categories: I.

Poster, Ph.D. New York University, Professor of History and of Film and Media Studies (theory and history of the media, theory of technology and culture, and Internet studies) As digital technologies infiltrate increasingly diverse aspects of cultural practice, and human culture at large is influenced by the presence of digital technologies, there is a profound need for a new type of professional in the entertainment industry, in education, and in the arts, who can help construct, manage, and monitor these changes. Such a professional must be technically skilled, artisti\u00ad cally skilled, and theoretically skilled, all at an equally high and rigorous level. The goal of the M.F.A. in Fine Arts with a concen\u00ad tration in Arts Computation Engineering is to provide students with a broad-based and interdisciplinary training at the intersection of digital technology and cultural and artistic practices. The ACE program is coordinated across the Donald Bren School of Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Sciences, The Henry Samueli School of Engi\u00ad neering, and the Claire Trevor School of the Arts, and places equal emphasis on technical, artistic; and critical proficiency. Strongly practical in composition, it provides students with the opportunity to explore in detail topics such as telematic performance, immer\u00ad sive and augmented environments, embodied interaction, and the cultural impact of new technologies. Graduation is by publicly presented thesis project and written the\u00ad sis, in addition to completion of course work. The ACE concentrations in all three fields consist of a two-year curriculum. The following courses are required: ACE Core: five ACE interdisciplinary theory seminars (Arts 270), four ACE studio/labs (Arts 271-277), two ACE project internships (Arts 279), and one quarter of ACE thesis research (Arts 278). (NOTE: A total of 48 units of Core courses must be completed. Any of the ACE core category courses may be reduced by one and replaced with a different ACE core course or an elective, in consul\u00ad tation with the student's advisor.) Arts Computation Engineering 101 Electives: four courses in school-based specialization electives chosen by students in consultation with faculty advisors, consistent with the technical, aesthetic, and theoretical themes of their thesis project; and two breadth electives that may be chosen by students in consultation with an advisor, and/or may be assigned by the ACE program committee in consultation with the student. These courses will compensate for lacunae in the student's background and may include upper-division undergraduate courses when appropriate and approved in advance by the candidate's advisor.

The program focuses on the dance tech\u00ad niques of ballet, modern, jazz, tap, world dance, and dance and technology. Theoretical studies include history; philosophy, aes\u00ad thetics, and aesthetics of digital media. Cre\u00ad ative opportunities bridge the studio and theoretical work through performance and choreography for multiple contexts; creative applications of animation, motion capture, audio and video tech\u00ad nologies; lecture demonstration; and critical, historical, ethno\u00ad graphical, and scientific writing. The objective of studio work is to develop kinesthetic resources, precision, flexibility, creativity, and freedom in a coordinated and intelligently responsive dancer. The techniques of classical ballet, modern dance, and jazz constitute crafts and styles for the dancer that serve not only as a basis for the training of the body, but also as a basic language of movement for the choreographer. The theoretical, historical, and scientific courses are designed both to broaden the perspective of those students whose first interest is performance or choreography, and to provide a foundation for those students who plan to pursue careers in the academic, scien\u00ad tific, technological, or administrative fields of dance. The dance archives in the UCI Library Special Collections offer a rich source of research materials which enhance the Dance program'. Among other special holdings, the archives include the extensive Ruth Clark Lert collection of dance books, journals, photographs, original costume sketches, and memorabilia of dance in Europe and the United States from pre-World War I to the present. CAREERS FOR THE DANCE MAJOR Careers in dance require excellent training and extraordinary disci\u00ad pline, tenacity, and dedication. Graduates of the Department have an excellent record of placement in the many fields of dance. Some have become professional dancers in ballet companies (including the Metropolitan Opera Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, Nashville Ballet, and Ballet Pacifica); in modern dance companies (including Hubbard Street Dance Company, MOMIX, and Martha Graham Dance Ensemble); in touring companies (including The Lion King, Fame: The Musical, Carousel, and Cirque du Solei!); and in films, televi\u00ad sion, and theatre. In addition to training for professional dance performance and choreography, the major in dance serves as a basis for graduate study or job opportunities in fields such as dance history, dance sci\u00ad ence, dance pedagogy, dance reconstruction, dance criticism, dance video, and technology. Related fields, such as arts administration, law in relation to the arts, arts therapies, design and production, and music also offer positions for graduates. Students who are interested in a career in physical therapy or dance science will find a major in Dance, with related course work in chemistry, physics, biology, and mathematics, to be excellent preparation for further study. THE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) is designed for those who wish to obtain a broad undergraduate background as preparation for careers or graduate work and related fields. It offers students a dance edu\u00ad cation that stresses performance and choreography, and, at the same time, intellectual depth and scope. In addition to the core, 12 units of elective Dance courses are required. The remaining elective units required for graduation may be chosen from Dance or other disciplines in relation to a student's individual interest. While the program of study in Dance stresses technical proficiency and acad\u00ad emic understanding in dance, the B.A. degree program also enables students to pursue elective subjects in their special areas of interest in other academic disciplines. The Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree program with special\u00ad izations in Performance and Choreography, is designed for students who wish to prepare intensively for careers in those areas. The courses required in addition to the core are primarily in Dance. The B.F.A. program allows for a few free electives in other areas. Admission to the B.F.A. program with a specialization in Choreog\u00ad raphy is by faculty approval only .. The B.F.A. program with a specialization in Performance does not require additional faculty approval beyond the required audition for admission to the Dance major; students should declare their inten\u00ad tion to pursue this specialization during spring quarter of their sophomore year. Proficiency Levels In addition to meeting the general requirements for admission to UCI, applicants must demonstrate technical/creative promise. The Department holds annual entrance auditions for potential freshmen and transfer students during winter quarter prior to the fall quarter when entrance is anticipated. First-year students wishing to major in Dance must be at technique level II in at least one of the three major genres (ballet, modern, jazz). UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Placement auditions for admitted students are held during Welcome Week to determine levels of technical ability for placement in courses. It is suggested that transfer students wishing to pursue a B.A. degree in Dance complete, in addition to their breadth require\u00ad ments, one course in choreography, two courses in dance tech\u00ad nique, and one course in music for dancers prior to transfer to UCI. Previously admitted majors who wish to obtain a B.F.A. degree should contact the School of the Arts Student Affairs Office to obtain information about change of major requirements, procedures, and policies. Transfer students wishing to pursue the B.F.A. degree must declare their intention in writing at the time of their entrance audition and demonstrate technique and/or choreography levels appropriate to their year. It is suggested that transfer students complete, in addition to their breadth requirements, one course in choreography, two courses in dance technique, one course in music for dancers, and one course in dance performance prior to transfer to UCI. Students deficient in level of performance or academic preparation should be prepared to extend their studies beyond the normal four\u00ad year program in order to meet the requirements for graduation.

California State University, Long Beach, Lecturer in Drama (costume design) The Bachelor of Arts program in Drama combines broad liberal study and comprehensive training in several subdisciplines of drama. Each Drama major studies and practices in each of several mutually related areas of the theatre: performance, literature, his\u00ad tory, criticism, design and stage management, and production. The curriculum is structured to relate studio practices, technical resources, and production techniques to the development of dra\u00ad matic literature and current critical theory. The program is designed for students who, while not necessarily planning to make the theatre their vocation, have a serious interest in the literature, theory, and practice of drama, as well as for stu\u00ad dents preparing to work professionally in the theatre, often after more specialized training at the graduate level. The Department of Drama is a member of the University/Resident Theatre Association (U/RTA). CAREERS FOR THE DRAMA MAJOR A degree in Drama may or may not lead to professional employ\u00ad ment in theatre or film. Graduates in Drama at UCI have performed in Broadway plays, regional and summer theatres, and in films and television. They serve as artistic directors, designers, art directors, business man\u00ad agers, and performers at more than 100 theatre companies, and as faculty at more than 75 institutions of higher learning. Not all Drama students become professional theatre artists. Many embark upon careers in law, business, arts management, advertis\u00ad ing, and teaching; others pursue further study at UCI or elsewhere. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: None.

UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 1 08 UCI 2006-07 Claire Trevor School of the Arts Honors in Design Program The Honors in Design Program provides the opportunity for Drama majors to concentrate on the study and practice of scenery, cos\u00ad tume, or lighting design. Honors in Design students study basic and advanced design techniques, participate in classes with gradu\u00ad ate design students, serve as an assistant designer to a graduate stu\u00ad dent or faculty designer, and possibly design a production at UCI. Eligibility requirements are: (1) at least one year in good standing at UCI as a Drama major; (2) completion of Drama 50 A, B, C or equivalent courses; (3) completion of at least two upper-division studio courses in design, one of which may be in production tech\u00ad niques, selected from Drama 150-162, 167-169; (4) possess and maintain an overall GPA of at least 3.2, with a GPA of 3.4 or higher in all design and production technique courses; (5) completion of four out of eight units of Drama 101 (Theatre Production); and (6) completion of the eligibility form. Admission to the Honors in Design Program is competitive. Stu\u00ad dents may be admitted as early as the winter quarter of their sopho\u00ad more year but no later than the spring quarter of their junior year. Upon completion of eligibility requirements, the student will schedule an informal portfolio review with a member of the design faculty appropriate to the student's specialty area(s). The selected faculty mentor may recommend that: (1) the student is ready to proceed with a formal portfolio review and presentation to the Design faculty via the Head of Design; (2) the student rework the content and/or presentation of the material for reconsideration by the faculty mentor; (3) the student is not ready or able to pro\u00ad ceed with Honors in Design. Only truly exceptional students (no more than 10 to 20 percent of those eligible) will be admitted to Honors in Design as determined by the Design faculty via the Head of Design. Honors in Design students receive: (1) the \"Honors in Design\" notation on their official transcript; (2) nomination and recommen\u00ad dation for national University/Resident Theatre Association (U/RTA) interviews; (3) an assistant designer assignment with a graduate student or faculty designer; and ( 4) special consideration to design a budgeted and technically supported production. Honors candidates meet with their faculty mentor at the beginning of every quarter to evaluate their progress and with the Head of Design to check that all grade and course requirements are being satisfied. Honors in Directing Program The Honors in Directing Program provides the opportunity for Drama majors to concentrate on the study and practice of stage direction. Honors in Directing students study basic and advanced directing techniques, participate in the Directing Laboratory with graduate Directing students, take a course in directorial themes and/or the history of directing, and direct two full plays in the Drama Workshop series. Honors students also have the opportunity to receive credit as the assistant director of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Department show; as a production internship with a professional theatre company; or for production/direction responsibility with the Playwright's Workshop. \u00b7 Admission to the Honors in Directing Program is competitive. Candidates must first complete Drama 170 (Directing) with a grade of B or higher, which qualifies them to enroll in Drama 185 (Advanced Directing). Candidates must apply, as a director, for Drama 198 (Drama Workshop) by submitting a proposal to direct a play in the Drama Workshop series. If the proposal is accepted, the candidate must declare to the Head of Directing that the production is to be counted as an audition for admission to the Honors in Directing Program. A committee of three Drama faculty members, including the Head of Directing, will then see and evaluate the production for clarity of interpretation, unity of style, strength of acting, and ensemble performance, and will examine the candi\u00ad date's self-evaluation and the evaluations of the director by mem\u00ad bers of the cast. The Head of Directing will inform the candidate of the committee's decision as to whether or not the candidate is admitted to the Honors Program. Undergraduate Drama majors can be admitted into the program as early as the winter quarter of their freshman year but no later than the spring quarter of their junior year. Students may be admitted to the program retroactively if all the requirements for Directing Honors have been met by their final year, but only if a faculty committee of three has seen their workshops and agrees to admit the candidate. To achieve the Honors in Directing distinction, students must fulfill all the courses required of the regular Drama major, with an overall GPA of 3.2 or higher. In addition, students must complete the fol\u00ad lowing courses with a GPA of 3.4 or higher: I. Drama 170 (Directing). This course is taught each year in the \u00b7 fall quarter only. 2. Two courses in Drama 185 (Advanced Directing). Drama 185 is offered annually in winter quarter and sometimes in spring quar\u00ad ter. In this course, undergraduate Directing students present work in the Directing Laboratory along with graduate Directing students. 3. Two Drama Workshops, one of which must be taken as Drama 198 (Drama Workshop) with the candidate serving as director. The candidate must stage a second Drama Workshop as Drama 199 (Projects in Theater), for which a letter grade is earned. 4. Four additional units to be satisfied by any of the following: Drama 199 (as a summer internship, approved by the Head of Directing, with the candidate serving a professional theatre com\u00ad pany as director, assistant director, or production assistant); Drama 199 (as a production/directing project for Playwright's Workshop)'; Drama 100 (as assistant director to a faculty direc\u00ad tor); or Drama 199 (as assistant director to a graduate director's thesis production). Honors candidates meet with the Head of Directing at the begin\u00ad ning of every quarter to evaluate their progress and to check that all grade and course requirements are being satisfied. Successful graduating seniors will receive the \"Honors in Directing\" notation on their official transcript and will receive a nomination and rec\u00ad ommendation for national University/Resident Theatre Association (U/RTA) interviews. NOTE: All of the above courses are open to all students even though they may not qualify for the Honors Program. Honors in Dramatic Literature, History, and Theory Program The Honors in Dramatic Literature, History, and Theory Program is designed to challenge superior students beyond the scholarly requirements of the Drama major. It provides them with the oppor\u00ad tunity to advance their knowledge of dramatic literature, history, and theory and to further develop their writing, analytical, and research skills. An additional purpose of the program is to better prepare students for graduate study in not only dramatic literature, history, and theory, but in all fields in the humanities and social sciences, as well as in law. Eligibility requirements are: (1) completion of Drama 40A, B, C and two courses of Drama 103 (for upper-division writing credit), or equivalents to these courses from other institutions; (2) possess and maintain an overall GPA of at least 3.2, with a GPA of 3.4 or higher in all dramatic literature, history, and theory courses; and (3) completion of the eligibility form. Admission to the Honors in Dramatic Literature, History, and The\u00ad ory Program is competitive. Students must apply to the program UC IRVINE - 2006-2007prior to the spring quarter of their junior year. Upon completion of eligibility requirements, applicants must submit at least two critical essays, most likely written previously for courses, totaling no more than 30 pages. These essays will be used by the Honors Committee (comprised of the Head of Dramatic Literature, History, and The\u00ad ory and two additional members of the Drama faculty) to deter\u00ad mine admission. Only truly exceptional students (no more than 10 to 20 percent of those eligible) will be admitted. Beyond fulfilling the regular requirements of the Drama major, honors students must take three additional upper-division courses in dramatic literature, history, and/or theory, one of which must be focused on theory. Upper-division courses in other departments may be used to fulfill these requirements, as long as the Honors Committee approves them. Honors students must also write an honors thesis, a 30-40 page research paper written under the supervision of a faculty member on a topic chosen by the student. In consultation with the student, the adviser for this project is selected before the end of the fall quarter of the student's senior year. Students develop their projects until the spring quarter when they enter the writing phase. It is only during the spring quarter that students achieve full course credit for their work on the thesis, in the form of an independent study course with their advisor. This independent study is the final course of the program. Successful graduating seniors will receive the \"Honors in Dramatic Literature, History, and Theory\" notation on their official transcript. Honors in Music Theatre Program The Honors in Music Theatre Program provides special recognition to the music theatre student who has not only taken full advantage of all music theatre course offerings, but has done so with superior achievement and professional aptitude. Students are selected for this distinction by the music theatre faculty based on their admis\u00ad sion into Drama 17 4 (Music Theatre Workshop IV), grade point average.(see below), and exceptional talent. Drama 174 is offered every fall, winter, and spring quarters by audition. Students in the Honors in Music Theatre Program must fulfill all the courses required of the regular Drama major with the following qualifications and additions: 1. The two upper-division courses in Dramatic Literature must be satisfied with Drama 148A, B (History of American Musical Theatre). 2.

DOCTORAL DEGREE PROGRAM Degree Offered Ph.D. in Drama and Theatre. This is a joint program offered by the UCI Department of Drama and the UCSD Department of Theatre and Dance. Preparation Students with a B.A. (minimum GPA of 3.5), M.A., or M.F.A. degree in Drama and Theatre are eligible for admission to the doc\u00ad toral program. Students with training in literature (or another area in the humanities) will also be considered, provided they can demonstrate a background in drama or theatre. Experience in one of the creative activities of theatre (acting, directing, playwriting, design, dramaturgy) enhances a student's chances of admission. All applicants are required to take the Graduate Record Examina\u00ad tion and to submit samples of their critical writing. While not required for admission, a working knowledge of a sec\u00ad ond language is highly desirable (see Language Requirement). Course of Study Students are required to take a minimum of 144 units, which is equivalent to four years of full-time study (full-time-students must enroll for a minimum of 12 units each quarter). Forty of these units are taken in required seminars; the balance is made up of elective seminars, independent study and research projects (including preparing the three qualifying papers), and \u00b7dissertation research. Students must take\u00b7 a minimum of one seminar per year in the UCSD Department of Theatre and Dance. The program of study makes it possible for students to take a significant number of elec\u00ad tive courses and independent studies both with faculty in Drama and Theatre and in other departments. Required Courses Students must take a minimum of 12 units (three seminars) each of Drama 290 (Dramatic Literature and Theatre History Prior to 1900) and 291 (Dramatic Literature and Theatre History, 1900 to Present), and 16 units (four seminars) of 292 (Cultural and Critical Theory). All graduate courses may be repeated when the topic varies. Descriptions of the topics to be treated in a given academic year are published by the Department in the fall. Enrollment in each course.requires the consent of the instructor. The courses are lim\u00ad ited to registered doctoral students. These 10 required seminars must be completed by all students, including those who have an M.A. or an M.F.A. degree, before the end of the third year. In addition, students must pass comprehen\u00ad sive examinations at the end of their first and second years. Drama 293 (Directed Studies) and 294 (Dissertation Research) are also required. Comprehensive Examinations In the first year, students prepare for the Written Comprehensive Examination, which is based on a reading list of approximately 150 titles ranging from the Ancient Greeks to the present. Students take this examination at the beginning of the fall quarter of their second year. (Comprehensive examinations are scheduled at the beginning of fall quarter in order to allow students the summer to prepare.) Students who fail-the Written Comprehensive may retake it no later than the first week of winter quarter of their second year. Students who fail the Written Comprehensive for a second time are dismissed from the program. In their second year, students prepare for the Oral Comprehensive Examination. The reading list for this examination is designed to permit students to acquire a knowledge of their dissertation subject area, broadly conceived. The reading list is compiled by the student UC IRVINE - 2006-2007and the dissertation advisor, in consultation with other members of the faculty, as appropriate; the reading list must be established by the end of winter quarter of the second year. Students take the Oral Comprehensive at the beginning of the fall quarter of their third year. Students also submit a dissertation prospectus (approximately five pages) when they take this examination. Students who fail the Oral Comprehensive may retake it no later than the first week of winter quarter of their third year. Students who fail the Oral Com\u00ad prehensive for a second time are dismissed from the program. Advancement to Candidacy: Three Qualifying Papers Students normally select a dissertation advisor during their second year and must do so before the end of spring quarter of that year. In consultation with the dissertation advisor and other faculty members, students develop topics for three qualifying papers, which are written during their third year. The three qualifying papers-one long (approximately 50 pages) and two short (approx\u00ad imately 30 pages each)-must be completed by the end of the third year; these completed papers provide the basis for the Oral Quali\u00ad fying Examination. Students write the long paper under the direc\u00ad tion of their dissertation advisor; it is understood that the long paper is preparatory to the dissertation. The short papers deal with other related topics, subject to the approval of the student's advi\u00ad sors; the two short papers are understood as engaging in exploring the larger contexts of the dissertation. Students normally pass the Qualifying Examination and advance to candidacy at the end of their third year; students must advance to candidacy no later than the end of fall quarter of their fourth year. Once advanced to candi\u00ad dacy, students write their dissertation which, upon completion, is defended in a final oral examination. Students may select a dissertation advisor from either the UCI Department of Drama or the UCSD Department of Theatre and Dance. All UCI doctoral dissertation committees must include at least one faculty member from UCSD. Language Requirement Students are required to complete an advanced research project using primary and secondary material in a second language (mate\u00ad rials may include live and/or recorded performance; interviews with artists, critics, and scholars; and other non-documentary sources, as well as more conventional textual sources). This requirement may be satisfied by writing a seminar paper or a quali\u00ad fying paper (see Advancement to Candidacy above) that makes extensive use of materials in a second language. The second-lan\u00ad guage requirement must be satisfied before the end of the third year. This requirement will not be waived for students who are hi\u00ad or multilingual; all students are required to do research-level work in more than one language. It is assumed that students will have acquired a second language before entering the doctoral program, although second-language proficiency is not a requirement for admission. While students may study one or more second languages while at UCI orUCSD, lan\u00ad guage courses may not be counted toward doctoral program requirements. Teaching Students are required to teach a minimum of four quarters. No more than eight units of apprentice teaching may be counted toward the required 144 units. Departmental Ph.D. Time-Limit Policies Students must advance to candidacy by the end of the fall quarter of their fourth year. Departmental normative time for completion of the degree is five years; total registered time in the Ph.D. program at UCI or UCSD cannot exceed seven years. Drama 111 Financial Support Ph.D. students entering the program with a B.A. may be supported (either by teaching assignments or fellowships) for five years. Stu\u00ad dents who have an M.A. and have been given transfer credit may be supported for four years. Such support depends upon the funds available, the number of students eligible, and the student's rate of progress. Courses in Drama LOWER-DIVISION 10 Introduction to Production Theory (4) F, W, S.

PROGRAMS OF STUDY The Department of Music offers two undergraduate degrees (the Bachelor of Arts in Music and the Bachelor of Music) and the Master of Fine Arts degree in Music. The Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.) degree program is performance\u00ad oriented. It offers students the opportunity to specialize in one of the following: bassoon, clarinet, composition, contrabass, flute, French hom, harp, jazz instrumental, lute and voice. (The specialization appears on the student's UCI transcript.) In addition, B.Mus. students may qualify for the Spe\u00ad cial String Performance option, an intensified curriculum for pro\u00ad fessional-level students. All B.Mus. students receive weekly private instruction, for a maximum of 12 quarters for entering freshmen or six quarters for transfers and composition students, and present a solo recital during their senior year. B.Mus. students participate in performance classes each quarter. Normal residency for the Bache\u00ad lor of Music degree is four years, and two years for transfer stu\u00ad dents. Vocal performance students focus on diction, movement, stage presentation, repertory, criticism, and style. Guitar and lute students focus on ensemble work, repertory with other instruments and voice, criticism, and pedagogy. Piano students give weekly solo performances before other students, and also focus\u00b7on criti\u00ad cism, style, and interpretation. String, wind, brass, percussion, and also piano students focus on quartet work, \u00b7small ensembles, and solo sonatas privately coached and presented in afternoon recitals. The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree program enables students to pursue elective subjects in music (such as analysis, history, or jazz), in the arts, or in other academic disciplines. Students receive two years of instrumental or vocal instruction and participate at the same time in two years of ensemble or repertory classes. Students also complete a senior project in an area of interest: a historical project, a composition, or a lecture/performance. Music scholarships are offered to promising undergraduate per\u00ad formers. Scholarship awards are generally based on the preadmis\u00ad sion auditions held in February. The University's Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to study abroad during their junior year. Music majors may enroll in conservatories and universities in several countries; UC IRVINE - 2006-2007highly qualified performers may be eligible to attend the Conserva\u00ad torio G. B. Martini in Bologna, Italy. See the Educational Abroad Program section for additional information. In each baccalaureate degree program, students receive private lessons on their instruments or in voice, and perform in orchestral or choral concerts, in chamber ensembles, and in solo recitals. A five-year program coordinated with the UCI Department of Edu\u00ad cation is available for students interested in obtaining a California Teaching Credential. The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degree program in Music emphasizes Choral Conducting, Collaborative Piano, Composition and Technology, Guitar/Lute Performance, Instrumental Perfor\u00ad mance, Jazz Studies, Piano Performance, and Vocal Arts. PERFORMANCE OPPORTUNITIES ChoraiNocal Choral ensembles at UCI offer all students, regardless of major, the opportunity to sing. Regular ensembles include the California Chamber Singers, Concert Choir, Madrigal Singers, Men's Chorus, Women's Chorus, and Women's Chamber Choir. Performances range from international concert tours, to Southern California con\u00ad cert venues, to campus concerts. The Department produces the annual Madrigal Dinner celebrating the court of Henry VIII. Annual invitational choral festivals are an integral -part of the pro\u00ad gram. Opera and oratorio performances feature student soloists. Instrumental The UCI Symphony Orchestra offers participants an opportunity to explore the great masterworks of the standard orchestra repertory. The most proficient students have an opportunity to perform a con\u00ad certo with the orchestra by winning the annual concerto competi\u00ad tion. The symphony performs six times a year including collabora\u00ad tions with the UCI Opera Theatre and the Departments of Dance and Drama. Productions have included Bizet's Carmen and Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel. A cornerstone of instrumental study at UCI is the chamber music program. Small ensembles, coached by the faculty, have frequent opportunities to perform. Additional student performance opportunities are available in larger ensembles: the Wind Ensemble performs music written for varying combinations of wind and percussion instruments; the Jazz Orchestra performs a variety of jazz big band charts; and the Ath\u00ad letics Bands (Pep Bands, Drumline, Marching Band, and others) play for athletic events and other school, community, and private functions. Composition Students have the opportunity to compose works for performances by undergraduates and graduates, chamber groups, and a student modern music chamber ensemble. Selected student works may be read by the large performing ensembles. CAREERS IN MUSIC A degree in Music offers many career opportunities. Music is a highly competitive profession and a degree may or may not lead to professional employment with an orchestra or as a concert artist. Many graduates do, however, become successful freelance mem\u00ad bers of symphony orchestras, composers, and performers. Many others go on to pursue graduate degrees in performance, music his\u00ad tory, conducting, arts management, music librarianship, composi\u00ad tion, or secondary or postsecondary education. Some graduates have made careers in music publishing and in the recording industry. Music 115 RECOMMENDED PROFICIENCY LEVELS All applicants for admission are required to pass an audition in their principal performing medium and will receive infor\u00ad mation concerning the mandatory audition approximately 60 days following the close of the application period.

Various approaches to developing text and word are considered, and students are encour\u00ad aged to approach developing the thesis textual component follow\u00ad ing a path best suited to their postgraduate interests (e.g., critical writing, spoken word/performance, critical memoir, digital narra\u00ad tive structures). The overall emphasis in the program, however, is on studio produc\u00ad tion. Throughout their three years, students must take a series of critique seminars. Work-in-progress, produced for the given quar\u00ad ter's critique class, is intensively discussed within a group context. Students must also, throughout their graduate careers, work each quarter on an independent basis with faculty of their choice and are encouraged to work with a range of faculty members. During the second year, students must select a thesis committee with whom they will work closely on the development ofboth thesis studio production and research interests. However, even after selecting their committee, students are still encouraged to work with a range of faculty on an independent basis in order to continue to respond to and reflect on a diversity of ideas and differing approaches to both studio production and art distribution systems. Throughout the first two years, students must also undergo a series of progress checks including open studio reviews and a second-year exhibition. Students are evaluated by faculty committees during their first and second years. Satisfactory opinion by these committees coupled with both satisfactory independent study evaluations and grades of at least a B or above will allow the student to progress to candi\u00ad dacy for the degree. During the third year, candidates must mount a thesis exhibition. In tandem with the final thesis exhibition, stu\u00ad dents are required to do a public presentation on their work as part of their final defense before their thesis committee. During the first two years, students are required to take courses from a structured curriculum totaling 12 units each quarter. Beyond that, students can select additional course work from any sector of the Department or University including approved upper-division undergraduate courses. The third year is structured so that students can individualize their course of study through a wide selection of classes. For example, students wishing to focus primarily on studio production can do so through a combination of independent studies and critique classes, or students could design their third year to focus both on studio production and acquiring additional course work in a given research area or graduate emphasis. M.F.A. candidates are each provided with an individual studio space. Facilities include photography laboratories (analog and digi\u00ad tal), video production studios, data laboratories, and sculpture lab\u00ad oratories for work in wood and metal. There are also facilities to support work in digital media, painting, performance, drawing, and ceramics. Students also have regular opportunities to exhibit in two galleries. Various programs of visiting artists and lecturers are an integral part of the student experience. There is a public lecture series for which. solicited graduate student input is considered an important component. Visiting artists, curators, critics, and gallerists are invited to give lectures and conduct studio visits with graduate stu\u00ad dents. The Studio Art 220 seminar (required both first and second year) incorporates visiting lecturers into a colloquium setting where students are asked to lead in-depth discussions with a given visitor. In addition to artists and curators, Studio Art 220 visiting lecturers include faculty from the UCI campus as well as other UC campuses whose work and research may be of interest to graduate students. Some Studio Art faculty, in addition to their departmental appointment, are affiliated with other UCI and UC programs, e.g., Asian American Studies, African American Studies, Women's Studies, Engineering, Information and Computer Science, Critical Studies, Art History, the Cal-(IT)2 Gaming Studies Initiative, and the UC Institute for Research in the Arts (UCIRA). Admission\u00b7. Applicants for admission to the M.F.A. program must meet the general requirements for admission to graduate study, hold a B.A. or B.F.A. in Art, have completed one year of twentieth-century art history (students who have not completed this will be required to do so as part of their graduate studies), and submit by January 15 a portfolio of their most recent creative work of a maximum of 20 slides, on a #80 Kodak carousel tray, or video tape (VHS; no more than five minutes, cued up).

Otis Art Institute, Professor of Studio Art (video, multimedia, film theory) The major in Arts and Humanities provides students with a broad exposure to a range of disciplinary and methodological opportuni\u00ad ties in the Arts and Humanities. It insists on the productive inter\u00ad section of these two fields as the focus of each student's program. Students improve their critical and historical sophistication while learning about the process of performance and creative work, a combination that equips them to participate more effectively in a society that increasingly joins critique and creation just as closely as it fuses image and information. Arts and Humanities students investigate the symbolic dimension of human behavior and identity, an interest shared by many critics and artists alike. Often, this interest is expressed in the context of UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 130 UCI 2006-07 Claire Trevor School of the Arts interdisciplinary programs designed to facilitate contact among faculty and students from a wide range of different academic disci\u00ad plines. This major's focus on the connection between practice and analysis distinguishes it from the broader and more diverse scope of more general interdisciplinary programs. The scholarly work of many UCI faculty in the Arts and Humanities lies at an intersection between the two academic units, and the major translates this intel\u00ad lectual and creative activity into a coherent curriculum and projects current forms of scholarship and artistic practice into the classroom. CAREERS FOR THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES MAJOR Graduates of this program will be very attractive to teacher-train\u00ad ing programs. There is also a steadily growing market in private industry for students whose training combines skills sharpened by both the Arts and Humanities. Business demands graduates with strong writing and analytic skills, talents stressed in the Humani\u00ad ties. They also desire people with creativity and visual skills who have experience putting their original ideas into practice, some\u00ad thing emphasized in the Arts. Graduates will have special skills that will enable them to work in professional fields directly allied with the Arts, including museum work, art foundations, art critic cism, journalism, theatre, and the entertainment industry. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. Application Process for the Arts and Humanities Major New students are not admitted directly to the Arts and Humanities major. Continuing students apply to change their major to Arts and Humanities no earlier than the fall quarter of their sophomore year. Complete information about changing majors to Arts and Humani\u00ad ties is available at http://www.due.uci.edu/Change_of_Major.html. Students must submit a transcript and meet the change-of-major criteria for each of the two departments they propose' to combine. In addition, a program of study, approved by the designated faculty member in the Claire Trevor School of the Arts and in the School of Humanities, is required for admission to the Arts and Humani\u00ad ties major. Students are strongly encouraged to consult with the Arts Student Affairs Office early in their decision to apply to Arts and Humanities.

We are solving prob\u00ad lems today whose solutions were unimaginable even a few years ago, and implications for our society, our health, and our environ\u00ad ment are profound. The School of Biological Sciences is dedicated to providing students with a unique course of study that fosters a deep appreciation for the exciting facts and concepts in the field, an education that allows graduates to excel in their chosen careers. To that end, the School has recently redesigned the curriculum to remain on the cutting edge of biological education. All first-year students are enrolled in a Biology Freshman Seminar of their choice with one of 100 faculty members. Each seminar is different, designed by each member of the faculty to share their excitement about a particular aspect of biology with new students. Students also are introduced to basic concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology, as well as cellular and molecular biology, in that first year. The core set of courses in biology continues into the second year, featuring genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology, followed in the third and fourth year by a choice of advanced courses in biology. Since biology is a laboratory discipline, students complete a series of laboratory courses in which they learn both the tech\u00ad niques and approaches needed to solve problems in biology. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Finally, the faculty expect that most students will engage in cut\u00ad ting-edge research in one of more than 250 laboratories and med\u00ad ical clinics in the School of Biological Sciences and the UCI School of Medicine. It is in these situations that faculty train stu\u00ad dents to think in a sophisticated way about real-world problems. There is also no feding of excitement greater than finding out something about the world that no one has ever known before, a feeling afforded in biology only by participation in research. The Excellence in Research Program allows students to present their work and be recognized for their performance with a series of awards and publication of their reports in the School's Journal of Undergraduate Research. The combination of small seminars that transmit the faculty's enthusiasm for biology, the set of core classes that instructs students in the concepts of biology, the advanced classes that allow a deep understanding of specialized aspects of biology, the laboratory courses that convey the practical aspects of problem-solving in biology, and the research experi\u00ad ences that engage students in the real excitement in revealing new information about biology, come together to provide an extraordi\u00ad nary experience for students. The Honors Program in the School of Biological Sciences further enhances the educational experience for the best students. Biology students have the option of specializing in areas of biology that best fit their interests, completing courses for degree programs in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, Microbiol\u00ad ogy and Immunology, Neurobiology, Pharmaceutical Sciences, or Plant Biology. Those students who wish to receive a broader education in the area can opt to complete a major in Biological Sciences. Completion of any of these majors forms an excellent basis for application to either graduate or professional studies such as medical school, and graduates of the School of Biological Sciences are routinely accepted to the most prestigious programs in the country. The quality of the faculty in the School of Biological Sciences has remained high while increasing steadily in number over the past few years, giving students a remarkable range of expertise in biol\u00ad ogy and with it, a large number of different advanced courses and research opportunities. In addition, their efforts have brought sev\u00ad eral high-impact research units to the campus, such as the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, the Center for Virus Research, the Beckman Laser Institute, the Cancer Research Insti\u00ad tute, the Developmental Biology Center, the Center for Immunology, the Institute for Brain Aging and Dementia, the Macromolecular Structure Research Unit, the Center for Molecular and Mitochondr\u00ad ial Medicine and Genetics, the Institute for Genomics and Bioin\u00ad formatics, and the Reeve-Irvine Research Center, all of which are accessible to undergraduates. The School of Biological Sciences also has close research and teaching collaborations with faculty in the Schools of Medicine, Physical Sciences, Social Ecology, and Social Sciences; the Donald Bren School of Information and Com\u00ad puter Sciences; and The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. In addition to the regular University requirements for admission, students interested in the biological sciences should include in their high school curriculum, in addition to a course in biology, four years of mathematics, as well as courses in chemistry and physics, which are now an integral part of most contemporary biological work. The School's professional counseling staff is always available for consultation to students regarding the many decisions in their acad\u00ad emic program. They also are trained to provide guidance in the application process to both professional and graduate schools, a real advantage to the high proportion of students in the School of Biological Sciences who go on to pursu~ advanced degrees. Biological Sciences 135 Opportunities are available at the graduate level to specialize in Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry, Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Experimental Pathology, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Molecular Biol\u00ad ogy and Biochemistry, Neurobiology and Behavior, Physiology and Biophysics, and Protein Engineering Science.

UC IRVINE - 2006-2007REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE All School of Biological Sciences students must complete the fol\u00ad lowing requirements. University Requirements: See pages 59--64. School Requirements Biological Sciences 2B, 194S; Biological Sciences Core 93, 94, 97, 98, 99, lA-B-C, one course selected from Biological Sci\u00ad ences 7 or Mathematics 2D or 7D, 7LD or 7E. Prerequisites for all Biological Sciences Core courses are rigor\u00ad ously enforced. Students must have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average in the Biological Sciences Core Curriculum, four upper\u00ad division elective courses, and three upper-division laboratories. School Residence Requirement: After matriculation, all courses required for the major must be successfully completed at UCI. The School of Biological Sciences strictly enforces the UCI residence requirement. At least 36 of the final 45 units completed by a stu\u00ad dent for the bachelor's degree must be earned in residence at the UCI campus. (The School considers courses taken in the Education Abroad Program to be in-residence courses.) Undergraduate Major in Biological Sciences The Biological Sciences major presents a unified, in-depth study of modem biology. The Biological Sciences Core is a five-quarter series of courses ranging from ecology and evolutionary biology, to genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology. Important labora\u00ad tory techniques and methodology are presented in upper-division laboratories. Advanced elective courses provide an opportunity to continue to diversify students' exposure to the biological sciences or to gain a much more in-depth study of a particular area of the biological sciences. NOTE: Biological Sciences majors who successfully complete their second year of study may elect to apply for a change of major to one for the following: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Developmental and Cell Biology, Genetics, Microbiology and Immunology, Neurobiology, Pharmaceutical Sciences, or Plant Biology. Students may apply directly to the Ecology and Evolu\u00ad tionary Biology major when they apply for admission to UCI. Contact the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for more information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.S. DEGREE IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES University Requirements: See pages 59--64. School Requirements: See above. Major Requirements A. Required Major Courses: Three courses selected from Biologi\u00ad Laboratories: Three satisfied with El79L, El60L, or completion of Excellence in Research in the Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences. C. Upper-Division Biology Electives: Four upper-division, selected be isfy more than one requirement. Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C or Physics 147A-B can be used to partially satisfy Biological Sciences 137 the elective requirement. Additionally, Psychology/Biological Sciences double majors may also use Psychology 1 i2A-B-C to partially satisfy the elective requirement. NOTE: Double majors within the School of Biological Sciences, including the Applied Ecology major, are not permitted. Requirements for the Minor in Biological Sciences Nine courses are required, no more than two of which may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis: A. Three courses selected from Biological Sciences 93, 94, 97, 98, and 99. (Prerequisites are strictly enforced. Exceptions may be made for some majors that accept the above courses for degree requirements. Consult with the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office or the academic counseling office of the major.) B. Six three-or four-unit courses selected from Biological Sciences lOOL, and courses must be upper-divi\u00ad sion. Prerequisites are strictly enforced. (Courses used to satisfy group A may not also be used to satisfy group B.) Residence requirement for the minor: A minimum of six <:ourses required for the minor must be completed at UCI. Approved courses taken in the Education Abroad Program are considered to be in-residence courses. NOTE: Students in any of the majors within the School of Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences or in the Applied Ecology major may not minor in Biological Sciences. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Since biological sciences courses are built upon a base of the phys\u00ad ical sciences, it is very important for students to take their required physical sciences early, particularly general and organic chemistry. Students who have not completed high school chemistry are well advised to complete a preparatory chemistry course before entering UCI. The academic program shown is only a suggested program. Students should consult the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for individual academic planning. Freshmen will normally take Humanities lA or lower-division writ\u00ad ing courses, Chemistry lA, Biological Sciences 93, and a freshman seminar (Biological Sciences 2A) during the fall quarter. Students will then continue with Biological Sciences 94, 2B, complete their general chemistry requirement, and continue with Humanities or lower-division writing during the remaining winter and spring quarters. Sophomores begin organic chemistry (Chemistry 51A or 52A), continue the Biological Sciences Core with 97, 98, 99, and lOOL; students enrolling in 1 OOL must have completed or be concurrently enrolled in Biological Sciences 97 and 194S. Sophomores often begin taking courses in other disciplines to meet the UCI breadth requirement and fulfill their mathematics requirement if they have not done so as freshmen. During their junior year, most majors continue with the Biological Sciences electives and take physics. Students who intend to double major in Chemistry will be required to take Physics 7 A-B and 7D or 7E in place of Physics 3A-B-C. Juniors may complete their breadth requirements and usually start their research and their upper-division biology laboratory courses. Finally, during their senior year, students continue their research and complete their remaining major requirements. Students in the Biological Sciences major are required to make progress toward their degree, and their progress will be monitored. If normal academic progress toward the degree in Biological Sci\u00ad ences is not being met, students will be subject to probation.

Undergraduate Major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Few areas of Biological Sciences remain that are not impacted by studies at the chemical and molecular level. The major in Bio\u00ad chemistry and Molecular Biology is designed to provide a compre\u00ad hensive background in this modem, conceptual understanding of biology. Students who wish to begin in-depth study of the molecu\u00ad lar basis in any of a variety of fields, including development, gene expression, immunology, pathogenesis, disease, virology, and evo\u00ad lution, can do so through this major. This program will be espe\u00ad cially attractive to those students who intend to pursue an advanced degree in biological or medical sciences. The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology major is based upon required courses in Advanced Biochemistry and Advanced Molec\u00ad ular Biology (Biological Sciences M114 and M116). These courses, together with a wide variety of elective course offerings, provide majors the choice to either explore the breadth of the field or follow a more in-depth study of any of its subdisciplines. For students interested in the interface between biology and chemistry, this program articulates well with a second major in Chemistry. The program of study emphasizes laboratory experience and its integration with basic theory. This is accomplished in three ways: first, through coordination between the advanced courses in Bio\u00ad chemistry (Mll4) and Molecular Biology (M116), and laboratory courses in Biochemistry (Mll4L) and Molecular Biology (Mll6L) which provide students with the basic laboratory skills and an appreciation for the experimental foundations of the field; second, through advanced laboratories in Immunology (Ml21L) and Virol\u00ad ogy (Ml24L) which provide students with the opportunity to develop cutting edge research skills; and third, by emphasizing independent research sponsored by a participating faculty member. The program encourages the research interests of students in sub\u00ad disciplines other than immunology or virology by offering the opportunity to substitute one year of independent research for the advanced laboratory. The major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology is designed to provide students with the appropriate tools and training to success\u00ad fully pursue graduate degrees that emphasize basic scientific research, including Ph.D. and M.S. training as well as combined M.D./Ph.D. programs. In addition, and particularly with the explo\u00ad sive growth in biotechnology and its significant influence in every\u00ad day life, graduates could use their backgrounds very effectively to pursue careers in business, education, law, and public affairs.

UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Application Process to Declare the Major: The major in Bio\u00ad chemistry and Molecular Biology is open to junior-and senior\u00ad level students only. Applications to declare the major can be made at any time, but typically in the spring of the sophomore year. Review of applications submitted at that time and selection to the major by the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Faculty Board is completed during the summer. Information can also be found at http://www.due.uci.edu/Change_of_Major.html. Double majors within the School of Biological Sciences, including the Applied Ecology major, are not permitted. Undergraduate Major in Developmental and Cell Biology The Developmental and Cell Biology major is intended to provide students with intensive training in cutting edge approaches to understanding the structure and function of cells and how they interact to produce a complex organism, starting with a fertilized egg. The focus of the B.S. in Developmental and Cell Biology is to provide students with intensive training aimed at preparing them for graduate programs in modem Developmental and Cell Biology or other biomedical sciences. In-depth training in the molecular basis of cell and developmental biology will be coupled with inte\u00ad grating knowledge obtained from the recent explosive advances in genomic technology to provide a strong working understanding of how to approach problems in basic research. The major has distinctive features. The first is a reduction in the number of required courses, allowing students the opportunity to focus more deeply on training in Developmental and Cell Biology. The second is the implementation of a new course in Genomic and Proteomic analysis that is closely tied to problems in genetics, developmental, and cell biology. Understanding the connections among these disciplines and how to apply the appropriate tools for defining and answering fundamental questions in biomedical research is a critical tool for success in research. Another distinc\u00ad tive feature of the major is the opportunity to replace two upper\u00ad division laboratory courses with mentored Biological Sciences 199 individual research in faculty laboratories. This offers students the opportunity to apply the tools they have acquired during formal course work to current problems at the frontiers of research. Lastly, students majoring in Developmental and Cell Biology have faculty advisors with whom they meet at least quarterly. The faculty advi\u00ad sors help students plan their curriculum, select appropriate 199 projects and sponsoring labs, and as a group grant petitions and certify the degree. The combination of new upper-division courses, more flexibility in the curriculum, the option for mentored research, and close interaction with faculty advisors will help the Developmental and Cell Biology majors to develop an appreciation of the nature of research and establish a strong foundation for future success in graduate or professional schools.

Undergraduate Major in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology It has famously .been said that nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. This major is designed to allow students to make sense of biology. It is a broad major, including components of evolutionary biology, ecology, and physiology. Fac\u00ad ulty interests are also broad and include the evolution of aging, conservation biology, biogeography, plant and animal population and community ecology, the evolution of infectious disease, evolu\u00ad tionary physiology, behavioral ecology, host-disease interactions, evolutionary genetics, marine ecology, genetics of invasive species, and plant population biology. Following graduation students will be especially well prepared to enter graduate programs in either ecology or evolution for advanced study. The major also provides UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 140 UCI 2006-07 School of Biological Sciences the foundation to pursue careers in governmental and non-govern\u00ad mental environmental organizations, as well as professional schools. The Department considers undergraduate experience in research an integral component of a scientific education, and majors are encouraged to participate in Biological Sciences 199 in which they will be mentored by an indivi.dual faculty member within the Department.

Undergraduate Majo\u00b7r in Genetics Genetics pervades every aspect of modem society, from newspaper articles to talk shows, from discussions on health care to discus\u00ad sions on cloning. With the sequencing of the human genome, it is more important than ever for biology students to have a broad background in the study of heredity and evolution. The Genetics major is designed to benefit motivated undergraduates who have a particular interest in learning about developmental genetics, evolu\u00ad tionary genetics, and molecular genetics and to allow them to explore how our knowledge of genetic mechanisms contributes to our understanding of human development and disease. The Genet\u00ad ics major will accommodate students interested in the study of inheritance either as a basic discipline or in terms of its applied aspects in biotechnology, medicine, and agriculture, but will be especially attractive to those students desiring focused study and preparation for graduate training. Genetics majors begin their study in the junior year with two Genetics courses (Biological Sciences Ml37 and D137) and a Genomics and Proteomics course (D145). This series of courses is designed to give students an understanding of genetic mechanisms and teach them how to define and answer fundamental questions in biomedical research. Additionally, students choose at least two electives that deal with topics such as the molecular biology of cancer, human genetic diseases, developmental genetics, and the genetics of aging. Finally, Genetics majors are encouraged to explore laboratory research by enrolling in Biological Sciences 199. Laboratory research not only expands a student's technical skills, but is also designed to allow faculty members to mentor Genetics majors. All students majoring in Genetics have a faculty advisor with whom they meet at least quarterly. The faculty advi\u00ad sor helps students plan their curriculum and select appropriate Bio\u00ad logical Sciences 199 research projects. Genetics majors also have an opportunity to meet with other Genetics majors on a regular basis and participate in research talks. The Genetics major provides graduates with advanced training in the skills necessary to pursue graduate degrees in biomedical research. These include Ph.D. graduate programs, teacher-training programs, medical school, and veterinary school. Genetics gradu\u00ad ates may also use their backgrounds effectively in planning careers in law, business, education, and public affairs. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.S.

Undergraduate Major in Microbiology and Immunology Microbiology and immunology are well-established disciplines within the life sciences. Microbiology addresses the biology of bacteria, viruses, and unicellular eukaryotes such as fungi and pro\u00ad tozoa. Studies of microorganisms reveal basic information about processes in evolution, genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, structural biology, and ecology. Many bacteria, viruses, and protozoa cause disease in plants and animals, and major areas of medicine and public health that address infectious diseases focus on these microorganisms. In contrast, immunology encompasses efforts to understand how multicellular organisms have evolved to survive a variety of challenges to homeostasis, including tumor surveillance and infection by pathogens. Basic questions of how immunity functions are entwined with a funda\u00ad mental understanding of the consequences of microbial infection. The major has been designed to span the interconnected disciplines of microbiology and immunology, and because the scope of disci\u00ad plines is considerable, students have the opportunity to specialize within the major in one of three areas: microbiology, immunology, or virology. The curricula overlap considerably, but there are unique courses for each specialty. Students opting for the microbi\u00ad ology specialization can select from courses focused on prokary\u00ad otes (bacteria) or eukaryotes (parasites). The major is designed primarily for students who are serious about pursuing careers in microbiology and immunology and is intended to provide its graduates with the appropriate tools and training to successfully pursue professional and graduate degrees emphasizing these disciplines. These include Ph.D., M.D., and combined M.D./Ph.D. programs. Biological Sciences 141 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.S. DEGREE IN MICROBIOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY University Requirements: See pages 59-64.

Undergraduate Major in Neurobiology The Neurobiology major is designed to teach students how neuro\u00ad biologists apply cellular, molecular, systems, and behavioral analy\u00ad ses in understanding how the nervous system works. The hallmark of the major is a year-long, in-depth exploration of the intellectual tools used to create, advance, and disseminate knowledge about the nervous system. Through neurobiology satellite courses, students acquire advanced factual knowledge about neurobiology. In addi\u00ad tion, Neurobiology majors may choose to participate in research through Biological Sciences 199, where they will learn technical skills and receive mentoring from faculty members. Students completing the Neurobiology major will be well qualified for admission to graduate or professional schools in preparation for careers in biological research, medicine, dentistry, veterinary medi\u00ad cine, nursing, and other related fields. Even without additional edu\u00ad cation, they will be competitive for positions in the pharmaceutical industry, the health care delivery industry, or in medically or bio\u00ad logically related technologies. The major also provides valuable preparation for students interested in entering other disciplines that increasingly interface with biology and biotechnology, such as law, business administration, and government policy. Additionally, the major provides excellent preparation for students who wish to become high school science teachers. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.S.

Biological Sciences 143 Undergraduate Major in Plant Biology Recent developments in plant biology and biotechnology place plants in the center of biological research. A dramatic increase in the understanding of cellular and developmental processes in plants enables plant biologists to control and manipulate plants develop\u00ad mentally as well as genetically. The availability of unique regener\u00ad ation and gene delivery systems puts plant genetic engineering to the forefront of biotechnology. Food derived from genetically engi\u00ad neered plants is a daily experience for the American public and a continuous topic of ethical, environmental, sociological, and politi\u00ad cal discussions. The Plant Biology program builds on core knowledge in plant structure taught in courses required for all majors offered by the School of Biological Sciences. After completing their second year, students may be admitted to the Plant Biology major and take courses primarily focusing on cellular, developmental, and molecu\u00ad lar aspects of plant biology in lecture and laboratory classes. Although not affiliated with agricultural sciences, a limited expo\u00ad sure to applied aspects, such as plant breeding and hands-on horti\u00ad culture is offered through the program. The Plant Biology major is fully compatible with the major in Biological Sciences and with medical school admission requirements. The Plant Biology major is intended to provide graduates with the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue graduate degrees in biological research, including Ph.D. and M.S. training. In addition, graduates should be excellent candidates for pharmacy schools.

Formerly Biological Sciences 199A. GRADUATE STUDY IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES The School of Biological Sciences offers graduate study in a wide variety of fields ranging across the spectrum of the biological sci\u00ad ences. The four Departments of the School of Biological Sciences (Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biol\u00ad ogy, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Neurobiology and Behavior) and five basic science Departments of the School of \u00b7 Medicine (Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Physiology and Biophysics), representing respective concentrations of study under the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sci\u00ad ences, cooperate in the conduct of graduate education administered by the School of Biological Sciences. Although students are admit\u00ad ted to the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree program, the Mas\u00ad ter of Science (M.S.) degree may be earned in pursuit of the Ph.D. Additionally, a master's program in Biotechnology (M.S. degree in Biological Sciences) and a master's program in Ecology and Evo\u00ad lutionary Biology (M.S. degree in Biological Sciences) are offered. Each department has a graduate advisor whom students may con\u00ad sult in regard to the technical details of the individual programs. Applications for admission to graduate study are evaluated by the department or program to which the student has applied on the basis of letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, grades, research experience, and other relevant qualifica\u00ad tions of the applicant. Candidates for graduate admission are urged to consult the particular department or program whose faculty and expertise best fit their interests and background. MASTER OF SCIENCE AND DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES While both the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy pro\u00ad grams are offered, emphasis at the graduate level is on the Ph.D. programs, with the exception of the master's programs in Biotech\u00ad nology and in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Most training takes place within one of the departments, although full facilities and curricular offerings are available to all graduate students in all departments of the Biological Sciences. Interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Students are expected to maintain a B average at all times. The normal time to degree for the master's degree is two years, and five years for the doctoral degree. A master's degree, \u00b7however, is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree. During the first part of the initial year of graduate work, the stu\u00ad dent plans an academic program in consultation with the graduate advisor or a small committee. Faculty advisors are changed if the UC IRVINE - 2006-2007specific interests of the student change. In addition, it is possible for students to transfer to another program in the School, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies, provided they are accepted into that program. Students are encouraged to consult with other faculty members with regard to their research and acad\u00ad emic interests. During their graduate training all students will serve some time as teacher apprentices under the direction of advanced teaching assis\u00ad tants and faculty. Advanced graduate students may work closely with faculty in the planning and execution of the teaching program. The amount and exact nature of the teaching experience varies with the department. Master of Science Depending upon the program, there are two plans by which a Mas\u00ad ter of Science degree may be obtained. Plan 1: Thesis Plan. The student completes seven upper-division and graduate courses including a minimum of five nonresearch courses. The student then presents a thesis based upon research done while in the School. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan. The student com\u00ad pletes a minimum of nine upper-division and graduate courses. At least six must be graduate courses (numbered 200-299) in the stu\u00ad dent's field of specialization. This program is terminated with a comprehensive final examination. Doctor of Philosophy Comprehensive Examination-First Year. The student attains this level by completing oral or written examinations at the discretion of the department. The examination is generally taken at the end of the first year of graduate study. Advancement to Candidacy. The advancement to candidacy exam\u00ad ination is generally taken in the third year of graduate study. It eval\u00ad uates whether the student has identified a tractable dissertation research problem. A committee for the purpose of administering this examination is appointed by the School, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council. Once this examination is completed, the student is advanced to candidacy for the degree and is considered to have formally begun dissertation research. The student submits a dissertation on this research and defends it at an oral examination during the final year of graduate study. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years, and the maximum time permitted is seven years. Graduate student status or consent of instructor is a prerequisite for all 200-299 courses. Master of Science with a Concentration in Biotechnology Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry 3205 http://www.bio.uci.edu/ Thomas E. Lane, Director The field of biotechnology has developed explosively since the dis\u00ad covery of gene cloning and sequencing methods in the mid-1970s. The field is now embodied by many successful companies and an intense demand has developed for well-trained people with up-to\u00ad date research techniques in the manipulation of nucleic acids, pro\u00ad teins, immunological reag~nts, and pathogenic organisms. The pro\u00ad gram in Biotechnology (M.S. degree in Biological Sciences) provides extensive training from both teaching laboratories and actual research settings (individual faculty laboratories). Focus is placed on techniques relevant to industry and seminar exposure to the nature of industry. The program is designed to train students to enter the field of biotechnology as skilled laboratory practitioners. Biological Sciences Graduate Programs 155 Emphasis is placed on learning state-of-the-art technology in pro\u00ad tein isolation and characterization, animal and microbial cell cul\u00ad ture, and ~:ecombimint DNA methodology. Students are trained in experimental rationales for solving actual research problems and are encouraged to take summer internships in industry during the course of their studies. The Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry evaluates applicants to the program on the basis of grades, letters of recom\u00ad mendation, GRE scores, and other relevant qualifications. Appli\u00ad cants should have successfully completed a B.S. degree or equiva\u00ad lent. Courses should include general chemistry with laboratory, calculus, physics, organic chemistry, genetics, biochemistry, mole\u00ad cular biology, microbiology, immunology, and virology, as well as laboratory courses in biochemistry, molecular biology, microbiol\u00ad ogy, and either animal virology or immunology. The program emphasizes training in laboratory and research envi\u00ad ronments. First-year students are required to enroll in a series of laboratory courses (Molecular Biology and Biochemistry 221L, 224L, 250L, and 251L) that are designed to teach them techniques in recombinant DNA methodology, protein isolation and character\u00ad ization, animal and microbial cell culture, immunology, and virol\u00ad ogy. In addition, students are trained rigorously in data recording and presentation as the laboratory notebooks are reviewed and graded by laboratory course instructors. Students are taught formal course work in nucleic acids, proteins, genetic engineering, and molecular/cellular biology. Emphasis during the second year is devoted exclusively to research projects in faculty laboratories, with the exception of one required elective course each quarter (e.g., Developmental and Cell Biology 210, 231B, Molecular Biol\u00ad ogy and Biochemistry 206, 207). The program is terminated at the end of the second year. While the Biotechnology program is designed to produce skilled laboratory practitioners for industrial positions, some students may wish to continue in a Ph.D. degree program. The Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry is a member of the interdisci\u00ad plinary graduate program in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Bio\u00ad chemistry, a program which offers the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences. Biotechnology program students who wish to enter the interdisciplinary graduate program upon completion of the M.S. degree should apply for admission during their second year. INTERDISCIPLINARY GRADUATE PROGRAMS The School is structured in a manner that encourages an interdisci\u00ad plinary approach to scientific problems. Interaction and cooperative efforts across traditional institutional boundaries are especially evi\u00ad dent in the School's participation in various organized research units (described in the previous Office of Research section) and in the interdepartmentallinterschool graduate programs described below. Graduate Program in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Biochemistry 4141 Natural Sciences II; (949) 824-8145 E-mail: gp-mbgb@uci.edu World Wide Web: http://www.bio.uci.edu/academic/grad/mbgb.html Peter J. Bryant, Director The combined graduate program in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Biochemistry (MBGB) provides the first year of instruction for graduate students entering Ph.D. programs in seven departments of the School of Biological Sciences and the School of Medicine. It provides a year-long Basic Training course as well as four didactic courses in the key areas of Protein Structure and Function, Structure and Biosynthesis of Nucleic Acids, Cell Biology or Neurobiology, and Genetics. During the first year the students also undertake UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 156 UCI 2006-07 School of Biological Sciences introductory research in at least two laboratories. The year culmi\u00ad nates in a comprehensive preliminary examination and evaluation. At the beginning of the second year the student selects a research advisor from over 100 faculty from the participating departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry, Develop\u00ad mental and Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Physiology and Biophysics. Each faculty member's area of research is described at the beginning of the departmental sections on the following pages. Regular teaching of undergradu\u00ad ates is part of graduate student training, at least in the first and sec\u00ad ond years of study. During the second year and beyond, students participate in the journal club and seminar series of the department in which they have elected to carry out their dissertation work, as specified by the departmental requirements. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years, and the maximum time per\u00ad mitted is seven years. Further information is available in the Cata\u00ad logue sections of the participating departments and through the MBGB program office. Applicants should have significant laboratory experience and be well prepared in calculus, physics, organic chemistry, and bio\u00ad chemistry. Graduate Program in Mathematical and Computational Biology Frederic Y.M. Wan, Director The graduate program in Mathematical and Computational Biology (MCB) is a one-year program designed to function in concert with existing departmental programs. Students who successfully com\u00ad plete the MCB program select a thesis advisor from among the par\u00ad ticipating faculty and then automatically join a departmental pro\u00ad gram for the remainder of their Ph.D. training. In this way, the MCB serves not as a degree-granting program, but as a \"gateway\" toward a Ph.D. degree in an existing degree program. The MCB program provides students with an opportunity for a broad introductory training in mathematical and computational biology, individualized faculty counseling on curricular needs, and exposure to a large and diverse group of faculty and research pro\u00ad jects in participating departments of the program. Member depart\u00ad ments include Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Sci\u00ad ence, Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Mathematics, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, and Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. The MCB curriculum is designed to teach students at the beginning of their graduate studies the necessary mathematical, computa\u00ad tional, and biological knowledge for successful research at the interface between these disciplines. The needs of students with a variety of backgrounds can be met provided that they have had mathematical training comparable to a standard one-year univer\u00ad sity-level calculus course and a lower-division university course in elementary differential equations and linear algebra. Exceptional students not meeting these prerequisites may be admitted to the program on the condition that they fulfill these requirements during the first fall quarter of their graduate study or the summer preced\u00ad ing, and pass with a grade of B or better. All first-year students normally take six four-unit MCB core courses, three quarters in mathematical and computational methods for biology and three in biological sciences. Research laboratory rotations constitute an important component of the first-year train\u00ad ing program, providing students with intensive introductions to experimental design and quantitative data analysis as well as famil\u00ad iarizing them with available research opportunities. Students are expected to conduct three rotations in different labs prior to choos\u00ad ing a thesis advisor. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the MCB Program and the diversity of the enrolled students, MCB students are expected to become familiar with both \"wet\" experi\u00ad mental biology labs as well as with mathematical/computational laboratories. At the end of the first year, each student will choose a primary thesis advisor from among the participating faculty, and will enroll in a departmental Ph.D. program with which the thesis advisor is affiliated. To ensure interdisciplinarity of the thesis project, stu\u00ad dents who complete the MCB program choose a secondary thesis advisor from a department complementary to the primary thesis advisor's department. Although completion of the Ph.D. will be subject to the degree requirements of the departmental Ph.D. pro\u00ad gram in which the student enrolls, participating departments have agreed to accept both the course work and research conducted dur\u00ad ing the MCB gateway year in partial fulfillment of such require\u00ad ments. The degree to which this is applicable varies. Students must consult with the department of choice for more specific information. Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program 4145 Natural Neuroscience Program (INP) is a first-year graduate program that brings together more than 70 faculty from the Schools of Biological Sciences, Medicine, and Social Sciences, including participation from the Departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Cognitive Sciences, Developmental and Cell Biol\u00ad ogy, Neurobiology and Behavior, and Pharmacology. INP faculty have broad research interests in behavioral neuroscience, brain aging, developmental neurobiology, genetics, learning neurobiology, ropharmacology, plasticity, and and perception. Neuro\u00ad science as a discipline requires scientists' to have a detailed understanding of at least one field, and a broad understanding of many other fields. INP provides breadth early on, followed by spe\u00ad cialization in years two through five of predoctoral training. INP organizes and coordinates a core curriculum that provides a foundation in Neuroscience; this forms the basis of future special\u00ad ized instruction in a participating departmental degree-granting program. This curriculum includes course work \\lnd laboratory rotations. Each trainee is assigned a Student Advisory Committee, consisting of three participating faculty members, to assist trainees in tailoring an appropriate course of study based on academic background, interests, and research foci. After successfully com\u00ad pleting the core curriculum, students select an advisor from the participating faculty and then are guaranteed automatic admission to the Ph.D.-granting program in their advisor's home department. In this way, INP serves not as a degree-granting program, but as a \"gateway\" to further graduate training. In particular, the program will provide trainees an opportunity: (1) to begin training in Neuroscience with a broad academic introduc\u00ad tion, (2) to receive individualized attention to curricular needs, (3) to conduct initial research projects with a large and diverse group of faculty in a wide variety of departments, and ( 4) to conduct dis\u00ad sertation research in any of a large and diverse group of laborato- ries in a wide variety of departments. ' In the first year of study, students must successfully complete one course from each of the molecular, systems, and cellular neuroscience categories. All trainees also participate every quarter in a two-unit course called Foundations of Neuroscience. This \u00b7 mandatory course meets in the fall, winter, and spring quarters and is intended to expose students to critical reading and analysis of UC IRVINE - 2006-2007the primary literature. Grades are assigned on a Satisfactory/Unsat\u00ad isfactory only scale. Students are encouraged to carry out three lab\u00ad oratory rotations of 10 weeks each. With permission from their Advisory Committee, students may carry out fewer rotations. Rota\u00ad tions are graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory only scale. Trainees are judged as having successfully completed the program provided that they have: (1) achieved at least a B+ (3.3) average in the core courses, (2) achieved a satisfactory grade in each quarter of Foundations of Neuroscience, (3) achieved satisfactory grades in all rotations, and (4) identified a participating faculty member who has agreed to serve as their thesis advisor. The ideal INP candidate will have had a substantial subset of the following courses: biology, chemistry, physics, calculus, neuro\u00ad science, psychology, biochemistry, and genetics. Preference will be given to applicants who have had laboratory research experience.

This has provided new approaches to the basic study of protein structure and function, as well as the opportunity to design and produce pro\u00ad teins with a broad spectrum of industrial and health-related appli\u00ad cations. The School of Biological Sciences, in conjunction with the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences and the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, offer an interdiscipli\u00ad nary graduate program. The program brings together faculty with research interests in: structure/function of enzymes, metallopro\u00ad teins, receptors, and growth factors; protein folding and protein modification with non-natural amino acids; NMR spectroscopy; and X-ray crystallography. The program offers the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, or Engineering with a concentration in Protein Engineering Science. Upon entrance to the program, stuqents choose a Protein Engineer\u00ad ing curriculum leading to one of the three degrees. First-year stu\u00ad dents take courses in molecular biology and protein chemistry, structure, and engineering, and complete three laboratory rotations of their choice. Additional elective courses, current literature semi\u00ad nars, and research presentations are used to broaden training in subsequent years. A qualifying examination is administered at the Developmental and Cell Biology 157 end of the first year for students in the Schools of Biological Sci\u00ad ences and Engineering. For students in Chemistry, a written exami\u00ad nation is administered early in the second year. Students are then expected to select a laboratory and begin work toward completion of a Ph.D. dissertation based upon their own original research. Stu\u00ad dents advance to candidacy for the Ph.D. by presenting their dis\u00ad sertation proposal to an examining committee which also guides and advises the students and monitors research progress throughout their graduate training. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years. DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND CELL BIOLOGY 5205A McGaugh Hall; (949) 824-1721 Arthur D.

The Master's degree is professional in nature and is intended to provide future managers with a firm foundation in the basic disciplines and in management tools and techniques; the Ph.D. in Management is for those who wish to pursue a career in scholarly research. The undergraduate minor is designed for those who wish to gain some insight into issues of modem management, as well as those who anticipate future graduate work in Management. Business 171 Educational Objectives The Paul Merage School of Business offers a-generalist M.B.A. degree and a learning experience that prepares graduates for a life\u00ad time of professional and personal growth with increasingly impor\u00ad tant enterprise-wide responsibilities. The rigorous curriculum, combined with extensive professional and interpersonal training and opportunities made available through the School's Career Ser\u00ad vices Office and Center for Leadership Development, allows stu\u00ad dents to gain theoretical perspectives that are in turn tested and affirmed with practical application. The result is an environment that fosters the development of professional and personal skills vital to contemporary executives or managers. Students are encourc aged to develop their ability to lead change by mastering commu\u00ad nication skills, to work productively and actively within a team-ori\u00ad ented environment, to gain a solid grasp of quantitative skills, and to appreciate and effectively employ those solutions that involve the integration and implementation of information and technology to offer creatively viable business options. The School has developed a strategic focus on Information Technol\u00ad ogy for Management (ITM), a theme that is incorporated in many areas of the curriculum. Although a solid grounding in basic busi\u00ad ness disciplines provides the foundation for effective management, graduates are encouraged to aim higher. They learn about change as it takes place within the context of a knowledge-based, technology\u00ad driven society where information and its effective use are vital to establishing a competitive edge. Students, whether they are inter\u00ad ested in finance, marketing, general management, strategic planning, accounting, operations, health care, human resources, international business, or other areas, will be thoroughly imbued and comfortable with the nature, importance, and handling of information in all of these and other fields. Further, they will understand the technology and the technological processes that enable the gathering, analysis, dissemination, and use of information to change the way business is done. The strategic focus of the School is to provide skills that will enable its graduates to be effective managers who are not only profi\u00ad cient in business procedures but have the leadership qualities and know-how to affect change by transforming conventional business practices or perhaps even inventing new business processes and man\u00ad agement techniques. The Paul Merage School of Business has created an information\u00ad rich environment that cuts across all business disciplines by pro\u00ad viding its students, faculty, and staff with technological tools that enable each member of the School to retrieve and analyze informa\u00ad tion that can be used to develop new processes or solve complex problems. Five ITM laboratories in the core disciplines are a criti\u00ad cal part of the learning experience, and students' familiarity and ease with Information Technology for Management serve as back\u00ad drop for many other courses. Additionally, has also achieved a national reputation for excel\u00ad lence in graduate management education in the health care industry through the Health Care Executive M.B.A. (HCEMBA) program. Industry managers and health care professionals learn about man\u00ad agerial challenges and issues in the health care industry where hun\u00ad dreds of health care providers, medical device and instrumentation companies, and biosciences firms are headquartered. A joint M.D./M.B.A. program also is available. General Admission Requirements Evaluation of the applicant's file for admission to the Master's and Ph.D. degree programs will consist of an integrated assessment of all materials (test scores, transcripts of previous academic work, statement of purpose, and letters of recommendation). The Univer\u00ad sity admission standard of a 3.0 or better undergraduate grade point average (on a 4.0 scale) is required. The minimum TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score acceptable for study UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 172 UCI 2006-07 The Paul Merage School of Business at the School is 600 for all M.B.A. programs. Substantive work experience is considered for applicants to M.B.A. programs. Requests for application material should be addressed to either the Full-Time M.B.A., M.B.A. Programs for Working Profession\u00ad als, or Ph.D. Program at the University of California, Irvine, The Paul Merage School of Business, Irvine, CA 92697-3125; World Wide Web: http:/ Doctor of Philosophy in Management The Paul Merage School of Business admits students for the Ph.D. in the fall quarter only. The deadline for application is January 4. The Ph.D. program requires a commitment to full-time study. In addition to the other requirements, Ph.D. applicants are encouraged to submit a previously prepared paper (research report, Master's thesis, essay, case study) which may be indicative generally of the applicant's interests and capabilities. The School offers the Ph.D. in Management to students with back\u00ad grounds in a variety of disciplines. While a master's degree is pre\u00ad ferred, students may be admitted to the doctoral program directly from the baccalaureate degree. There are many appropriate under\u00ad graduate majors, including (but not limited to) psychology, politi\u00ad cal science, business or public administration, mathematics, com\u00ad puter sciences, economics, sociology, and so forth. Students with academic strengths in disciplines not usually considered as precur\u00ad sors for management (e.g., natural sciences, humanities, and the arts) are encouraged to apply. The Ph.D. program is designed to prepare students for academic careers in a number of the fields of management, e.g., organization and strategy, operations and deci\u00ad sion technologies, management information systems, finance, accounting, and marketing. Requirements of the Ph.D. program include a broad knowledge of core management disciplines. In addition, the Ph.D. student must qualify as a skilled researcher and must complete a dissertation demonstrating these skills. There are no foreign language requirements in the Ph.D. program. The Ph.D. program is divided into two phases: qualification and dissertation. In the qualification phase the student prepares for dis\u00ad sertation research in an area of specialization. This phase is com\u00ad pleted when an oral qualifying examination is passed and the can\u00ad didacy committee recommends advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is three years. The dissertation phase involves a significant original research project which demonstrates the Ph.D. student's creativity and ability to launch and sustain a career of research. Students are expected to complete the Ph.D. in four years. The maximum time permitted is six years.

Master's Degree Programs The Paul Merage School of Business offers a variety of programs leading to the M.B.A. (Master of Business Administration) degree. These include a two-year, full-time M.B.A. program, and three part\u00ad time M.B.A. programs: a 21-month Executive M.B.A. program, a two-year Health Care Executive M.B.A. program, and a three-year Fully Employed M.B.A. program. A five-year joint M.D./M.B.A. program is offered in conjunction with the School of Medicine. M.B.A. PROGRAM The Paul Merage School of Business admits students to the two\u00ad year, full-time M.B.A. program in the fall quarter. Students from a\u00b7 variety of undergraduate disciplines, including liberal arts, social sciences, physical or biological sciences, computer science, and engineering, are encouraged to apply. The final deadline for com\u00ad pletion of all phases of the application procedure is May 6. In addi\u00ad tion to the general University rules governing admission to gradu\u00ad ate study, the School normally requires the following: I. Completion of the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). 2. Completion of a course in both introductory calculus and statis- tics with probability with a grade of B or better. The evaluation of an applicant's file for admission consists of an integrated assessment of all materials submitted including test scores, transcripts of previous academic work, statements on appli\u00ad cation forms, and letters of recommendation. Above and beyond these factors, substantive work experience is given serious consid- eration in the evaluation process. \u00b7 The Innovation Economy we live in dictates that change, technol\u00ad ogy, information, and adaptation are the major mechanisms in the growth of the modem enterprise. Companies that are able to con\u00ad sistently grow harness innovation to drive increased company per\u00ad formance. They launch new products and services in shorter time frames, create new products that can immediately threaten well\u00ad established brands, and have the ability to quickly assess and inte\u00ad grate emerging technologies in order to sustain profitability and growth. The M.B.A. program at The Paul Merage School of Business is distinctive for its focus on providing students-the capabilities and skills to succeed in the Innovation Economy. Students develop a sophisticated understanding of the new requirements for success in the School's new curriculum that emphasizes the three critical dri\u00ad vers of the Innovation Economy: Strategic Innovation, Information Technology, and Analytical Decision Making. This understanding is advanced through experiential learning course work in which teams of students work on challenging assignments for leading companies. Another distinctive feature of the program is the new capstone course on the future of business where students explore specific industries and companies and dis\u00ad cover what actions must be taken today to reap the benefit from long-term trends in technologies, geopolitics, demographics, and macroeconomics. The full-time M.B.A. program requires a minimum of 92 units with a minimum grade point average of 3.0 in the Core and overall. The curriculum consists of courses divided into two groups designed to achieve specific educational objectives. The courses are divided as follows: l3 required Common Core Courses (50 units) and 42 units of elective courses which students select to emphasize career goals and educational interests. A thesis is not required. Required Course Work. Common Core Courses, each of which is four units, are: Management of Complex Organizations, Statistics for Management, Management Science, Operations Management, Organizational Analysis for Management, Financial and Managerial Accounting for Management, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics for Management or Government and Public Policy, Information Technology for Management, Marketing Management, Managerial Finance, Business Strategy. International Requirement. Students must fulfill the requirement in one of the following ways: completion of a Paul Merage School of Business international elective in a functional area; participation in a Paul Merage School of Business international exchange pro\u00ad gram; or completion of an upper-division or graduate international UC IRVINE - 2006-2007course offered by another UC school, with the approval of The Paul Merage School of Business Associate Dean. Electives. In addition to the core courses, 42 more units of elective courses are required. The major emphasis in the elective courses is to develop additional depth in a discipline or interdisciplinary area or specialized competence in the use of a particular set of technical tools and methods. Students select their electives in light of their educational and career goals and interests. The 3-2 Program for Undergraduates In addition to the full-time master's program for students who have already received a bachelor's degree, outstanding UCI undergradu\u00ad ate students may apply to enter a cooperative 3-2 Program with the School and most other campus units. Acceptance into the 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram constitutes advanced admission to the graduate program. Such students complete their undergraduate major requirements by the end of their junior year. During their senior year, they take graduate courses in the School. These courses are used to satisfy their undergraduate unit requirements, and at the same time apply toward their graduate degree. Successful completion of the require\u00ad ments in the program normally leads to the bachelor's degree in the cooperating discipline after the fourth year, and the M.B.A. degree - after the fifth year. Students should consult with their academic counselor in their major school early in their academic careers for further information about completing undergraduate requirements in three years. Students contemplating entering such a program should contact The Paul Merage School of Business prior to, or early in, the start of their junior year for the purpose of program consultation. NOTE: With the exception of 3-2 students, no undergraduates will be enrolled in Paul Merage School of Business graduate-level courses. M.D./M.B.A. Degree Program The M.D.'lM.B.A. program requires five or six years for comple\u00ad tion. It is aimed at individuals who are exceptional in ability and motivation and who seek a career as physicians with major respon\u00ad sibility for administration and management in health care organiza\u00ad tions and institutions. Students in this program pursue a combined curriculum for an M.D. degree from the School of Medicine and an M.B.A. degree from The Paul Merage School of Business. Students must be currently enrolled in the M.D. program and in good academic standing in order to apply to the combined M.D./M.B.A. program. During their second or third year of med\u00ad ical school, interested students submit an application to The Paul Merage School of Business Admissions Committee, after review by the School of Medicine. Final acceptance to the program is granted by The Paul Merage School of Business, and M.B.A. course work begins following completion of the student's third year of medical school. Students should be aware that enrollment in the M.D. program does not guarantee acceptance into the M.B.A. program .. The MCAT, along with the completion of three years of medical school training in good standing and passage of USMLE Step I, currently serve as a waiver for the GMAT entrance examination usually required for application to the M.B.A. program. The total number of units required to graduate for each program separately are satisfied in the M.D./M.B.A. program. Contact the M.D./M.B.A. Advisor at (949) 824-5388 for more information. Special Opportunities In addition to the standard. admissions criteria, the Admissions Committee is particularly interested in how prospective candidates envision the current role and future potential of information tech\u00ad nology in business. Business 173 The Paul Merage School of Business offers ~ourse work in health care management within the M.B.A. program. The courses provide training not only in health care and related issues, but also expose students to professionals in the areas of management, finance, mar\u00ad keting, and strategic planning. In today's interconnected global business world, it has become increasingly important for management students. to learn to operate in an international environment. M.B.A. students in the full-time program can gain first-hand knowledge of the culture and manage\u00ad ment practices of other industrialized countries by participating in an academic exchange with universities located abroad. This expe\u00ad rience, combined with course work in international management, prepares students for the demands and complexities of the growing global economic environment. Currently, The Paul Merage School of Business has exchange relationships with the ESSEC Graduate School of Management, Cergy-Pontoise, France; Budapest, Hungary; Vienna University of Administration, Wirtschafts Universitat, Wien, Vienna, Austria; ITESM (The Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education), Monterrey, Mexico; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong; and National University of Singapore, Singapore. Opportunities for students to take part in ongoing research exist through the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations (CRITO), which was recently designated by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as one of six industry-Univer\u00ad sity Information Research Centers in the United States. CRITO is a consortium of corporations working together with faculty at UCI and elsewhere to better understand the evolving fabric of the infor\u00ad mation society and its implications for the design, use, and man\u00ad agement of information and technology in various user environ\u00ad ments. These environments range from the individual user's environment to work-groups, organizations, social communities, and society. The aim is to determine how organizations can more effectively use information and better design and manage new technology for improving organizational performance and society more generally. CRITO faculty associates are recognized internationally for their excellence in the study of information technology as It applies to complex organizations. This tradition of excellence has been estab\u00ad lished by faculty from The Paul Merage School of Business, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, and the School of Social Sciences. These associates have collaborated since 1974 on theoretical and empirical research projects studying a broad array of questions about the relationship between informa\u00ad tion technology and organizational structure, society, political behavior, productivity, and performance. Research conducted through CRITO focuses on the management, use, and impact of information technology in the emerging global, competitive mar\u00ad ketplace and the policy issues raised by such use. Qualified Paul Merage School of Business students are encouraged to participate in the various CRITO research activities and to avail themselves of this unique opportunity to interact with scholars from allied disci\u00ad plines and to study in-depth the effects of the information technol\u00ad ogy revolution. M.B.A. Career Center The M.B.A. Career Center, located within the School, was estab\u00ad lished to serve the unique placement needs of M.B.A. students and alumni. It has two main functions: (1) attracting a variety of organi\u00ad zations to interview and hire graduates and (2) counseling students in career opportunities and the techniques necessary to conduct effective job searches, not only for their first jobs but throughout their careers. The relatively small size of the M.B.A. program allows considerable interaction between the Career Center and students.

The Depart\u00ad ment offers credential programs for teaching or administration in the public schools of California, a minor in Educational Studies, an M.A.T. degree in Elementary and Secondary Education, an Ed.D. degree in Educational Administration and Leadership, and a Ph.D. degree and M.A. degree in Education. Faculty associated with the Department of Education include researchers and scholars of national and international reputation. Many faculty have taught or served as administrators in public schools, and all are committed to the continued improvement of education through conducting research and the development of more effective approaches to teaching. At the heart of the Department's mission is a commitment to understand and deliver the kinds of educational transformations needed in today's world. This underlying theme is implemented in five main areas of research: language, literacy, and culture; learn\u00ad ing, instruction, and assessment; teacher education and develop\u00ad ment; information and communication technologies in education; and educational policy and leadership and their social contexts. Research projects address a variety of areas, including information and communications technologies; cognition in science; race and urban education; educational policy and school reform; program evaluation; reading, language, and literacy; arts education; and intelligence theory. Graduate and postbaccalaureate teacher prepa\u00ad ration programs develop the same theme for new scholars and practitioners in the field of education. Teaching and Service Credential Programs The Department of Education offers teacher and school administra\u00ad tor professional preparation programs for California teaching and service credentials. The Department is authorized by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) to offer full-time programs for Cali\u00ad fornia's two basic teaching credentials-the Multiple Subject Cre\u00ad dential and the Single Subject Credential. There are two paths avail\u00ad able to obtain each of these teaching credentials: the Intern Teacher Credential Program and the Student Teacher Credential Program. Additionally, in cooperation with University Extension, the Depart\u00ad ment offers Administrative Services Credential programs. MULTIPLE SUBJECTTEACHING CREDENTIAL A Multiple Subject Teaching Credential authorizes teaching in multiple-subject environments, as well as designated classrooms with English Language Learners, as commonly practiced in Cali\u00ad fornia elementary schools. A Preliminary Multiple Subject Teaching Credential is awarded by the State upon completion of a baccalaureate degree and the State\u00ad approved UCI teacher education program which includes student or intern teaching and a performance assessment. Students must also complete a college-level course or pass an examination on the U.S. Constitution, pass the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST), and verify subject-matter competence. In addition, can\u00ad didates for a Multiple Subject Credential are required to pass the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA). This t~st may be taken during or immediately following completion of the teacher education program. \u00b7 To demonstrate subject matter competence, multiple subject candi\u00ad dates must pass the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET). Students are tested in the following areas: reading, lan\u00ad guage and literature, history, social science, science, mathematics, physical education, human development, and visual and performing arts. Multiple subject candidates must pass all subtests of the CSET prior to student teaching. Education 183 SINGLE SUBJECT TEACHING CREDENTIA~ A Single Subject Credential authorizes teaching in a single-subject environment, as well as in designated classrooms with English Language Learners, as is commonly practiced in California high schools and middle/intermediate schools. UCI offers Single Sub\u00ad ject Teaching Credentials in art, English, languages other than English, mathematics, music, sciences, and social science. A Preliminary Single Subject Teaching Credential is awarded by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) upon completion of a baccalaureate degree and the State-approved UCI teacher education program which includes student or intern teach\u00ad ing and a performance assessment. Students must also complete a college-level course or pass an examination on the U.S. Constitu\u00ad tion, pass the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST), and verify subject-matter competence. California requires all credential candidates to demonstrate sub\u00ad ject-matter competence. Single subject candidates achieve this by passing the appropriate CSET examination in their subject area or by completing a CCTC-approved subject-matter program in the teaching area. For specialized science candidates, completion of a postbaccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution in the requested credential area, or a closely related area deemed equivalent by the CCTC, may also satisfy the subject-matter requirement. UCI offers CCTC-approved subject-matter programs in English, History/Social Science, Latin, and Mathematics, which are available to undergraduate students majoring in English, His\u00ad tory or Social Science, Classics, and Mathematics, respectively. Single Subject students must pass all subtests of the CSET or complete an approved subject-matter program prior to student or intern teaching. NOTE: Due to changes in State requirements, the subject-matter programs in English, History/Social Science, and Latin are under revision in 2006-07.

Student teaching for Multiple Subject candidates (grades K-6) is defined as a full-day, four-day-per-week assignment during the first quarter of student teaching and a full-day, five-day-per-week assignment during the second quarter of student teaching. Assign\u00ad ments will include two levels within the K-6 range in elementary schools. Student teaching for Single Subject candidates (grades 7-12) is defined as a full-day, five-day-per-week assignment, for one full public school semester in an appropriate classroom setting in mid\u00ad dle or high schools. Clearances for student teaching are processed by the Department of Education and are contingent upon a Certificate of Clearance, a current tuberculin test clearance, academic preparation clearances including CBEST, and verification of' subject-matter competence. Advancement to student teaching is limited to those candidates who are adjudged to be professionally ready to assume such responsibilities. Such readiness shall be determined by, but not be limited to, the candidate's academic work, professional deport\u00ad ment, and potential for success in teaching. Failure to be advanced to student teaching will be considered good cause for removal and/or a leave of absence from the prqgram. A grade of B or better is required in all courses and in student teaching for successful completion of the program. If competence has been demonstrated by the conclusion of the student teaching program and all other CCTC and Departmental requirements are met, the student is eligible for a preliminary credential recommenda\u00ad tion by UCI. STUDENT TEACHER PROGRAM WITH BCLAD (SPANISH) EMPHASIS Students who are bilingual in Spanish (as ascertained through test- . ing) may be eligible for the Bilingual Crosscultural, Language, and Academic Development (BCLAD, emphasis in Spanish) credential. Students should consult an academic counselor in the Department of Education for more detailed information. SUPPLEMENTARY AND ADDITIONAL TEACHING AUTHORIZATIONS After acquiring a basic credential, it is possible to add further teaching authorizations. Students wishing to be authorized in more than one subject area may qualify in either of two ways: 1. Students may complete additional units in specific college-level course work to qualify for a supplementary authorization or a subject-matter authorization to teach in areas other than the major teaching area. Consult an academic counselor in the Department of Education for details. 2. Students may pass the appropriate examinations in any area of their choice and successfully complete specified additional course work. Subject to approval by CCTC, they will then qual\u00ad ify for the additional teaching authorization in that subject. PREPARATION FOR APPLYING TO THE CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS It is recommended that a candidate begin to prepare for admission at least a year in advance. Eligibility for admission is supported by passing the CBEST, providing evidence of possession of/applica\u00ad tion for a Certificate of Clearance, and successfully completing the appropriate subject area examinations or an approved subject-mat\u00ad ter preparation program. A considerable amount of time is needed to accomplish or acquire these necessary items. The Department of Education requires appropriate field experi\u00ad ences or other professional life experiences prior to the program to prepare for the teaching profession and strengthen an admissions file. Course credit for field experience is available through, for example, Education 100, 103, and 160/160L, as well as through other University programs. Field experience can also be earned by other appropriate activities, e.g., tutqring, assisting in public school classrooms. Admission to the Credential Programs Information is available from the Department of Education, 2000 Berkeley Place. Prospective students may apply online by accessing the Department's Web site at http://www.gse.uci.edu/Admissions..:. Index.php. Admission decisions are based on a broad range of fac\u00ad tors including, but not limited to, the following: CBEST. Evidence of having passed the California Basic Educa\u00ad tional Skills Test must accompany the application for admission. CSET. Passage of the California Subject Exams for Teachers is required to advance to student teaching or to be admitted to the M.A.T. or the intern program. Therefore students are urged to pass CSET exams well in advance. It is not recommended that a person take more than two subtests in one sitting, and it is not uncommon for people to have to retake one or two subtests; therefore it is essential to make a strategic plan that involves several test dates. CSET test information and study materials can be found at http://www.cset.nesinc.com. \u00b7 UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Absence of Criminal Conviction that Would Preclude the Issuance of a Credential. All students are required by law to obtain a Certificate of Clearance from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC). Applicants must provide evi\u00ad dence of filing for this certificate as part of their application for admission to the credential program. Written Recommendations. Three letters of recommendation are required for admission. These letters should address (1) your abil\u00ad ity to do graduate level work, (2) your capacity to work with or your experience with children, and (3) your ability to work as part of a team and your work habits. Academic Achievement. Completion of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution and a minimum grade point average of 3.0 will support consideration of admission to the credential programs. Undergraduates who enroll in courses leading to a cre\u00ad dential are not guaranteed admission to the program; admission through the regular graduate admissions process is required. ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES CREDENTIAL Administrative Services credentials are issued by the State in pupil personnel services, administrative services, health services, library services, and clinical-rehabilitative services. UCI offers programs leading to the Administrative Services Credential generally required for school administrators. There are two tiers of the Administrative Services Credential. In the first tier, a candidate obtains the Preliminary Administrative Services Credential by completing the approved program of 36 quarter units and a comprehensive examination. This credential also requires a valid basic credential, three years of full-time teach\u00ad ing or services experience, and passage of the CBEST. This cre\u00ad dential program is jointly offered by the Department of Education and University Extension. After an administrative position is obtained, the individual must begin the Professional Clear Administrative Services Credential (tier two) program. The UCI Professional Clear program requires two years of successful full-time school administrative experience in a position, the Preliminary Administrative Services Credential, and six (6) quarter units (Induction and Final Evaluation, Educa\u00ad tion 398A-B) which provide structured mentoring, self-assessment, and formative/summative evaluation of the candidate. Students interested in these credentials should make an appoint\u00ad ment with the director of the program in the Department of Education. Undergraduate Minor in Educational Studies The minor in Educational Studies allows students to explore a broad range of issues in the field of education, and provides a strong foundation for K-12 teaching. The program consists of a coordinated set of courses which includes an introductory level course and several advanced courses in the field of education. A number of the minor's elective courses are offered by other acade\u00ad mic units. Students who plan to apply for admission to a credential program in the UCI Department of Education (or at other institutions) may acquire a strong basic foundation for their .advanced work through taking.the minor's coordinated set of courses. Students who do not eventually choose education as a career path will have gained a valuable knowledge base applicable to many other occupations and to roles as citizens, parents, and volunteers. Education 185 Requirements The minor requires completion of a minimum of seven courses (at least five of which must be upper-division) totaling 28 units drawn from the four required areas of study shown below and from the approved electives. No more than two courses from the student's major area of study may be used for completion of the minor. Area 1. Educational systems, issues, and reforms: Origins, Pur\u00ad poses, and Central Issues in K-12 Education (Education 50). Area 2. Learning and the learning process: either Cognition and Learning in Educational Settings (Education 173) or Psychology of Learning, Abilities, and Intelligence (Education 176). Each of these courses also fulfills a prerequisite requirement for the Department's fifth-year teacher credential programs. Area 3. Educational contexts and influences: There are two requirements in Area 3: (1) a course that focuses on K-12 educa\u00ad tion/schooling and (2) fieldwork in K-12 schools. To satisfy the fieldwork requirement, students must be involved in at least 20 clock hours of verified observation and/or service in the schools. Courses which include fieldwork are: Educational Strategies for Tutoring and Teacher Aiding (Education 100), Advanced Tutoring (Education 103), Preparation for Teaching Fine Arts in K-12 Schools (Education 104D), Multimedia\u00b7 and the Arts in the Multi\u00ad cultural Classroom (Education 104E), Science Education Teacher Apprentice Field Experience (Education 114), Multicultural Educa\u00ad tion in K-12 Schools (Education 124), and Practicum in After\u00ad School Learning and Inquiry (Education 160, 160L). Department of Education courses that meet the course requirement in this area but do not include fieldwork are: Children, Schools, and Cinema (Education 125), Ethics and Education (Education 126), Changing the High School Experience (Education 150), Foundations of Education (Education 175), Advanced Composition for Teachers (Education 179). Courses from other academic units, such as History of Chicano Education (Social Science 173H), may also be appropriate in this area. Taking one of these courses in combination with 20 clock hours of verified observation and/or service in the schools under the auspices of campus outreach pro\u00ad grams or through independent observation or service in K-12 schools will fulfill both requirements in this area. These fieldwork choices require approval by the minor in Educational Studies fac\u00ad ulty advisor prior to beginning the fieldwork. Area 4. Subject-matter content and pedagogy: This area requires completion of one course focusing on an academic disci\u00ad pline of the student's choice which has direct applicability to K-12 instruction. Courses from Area 4 may also meet the fieldwork requirement if they include 20 hours of pre-K-12 fieldwork. A list of courses approved for Area 4 is available on the Department of Education Web site at http://www.gse.uci.edu. NOTE: In addition to the approved courses shown, a variety of other courses may be appropriate for Areas 3 and 4. Students must have these additional courses pre-approved by the Department of Education Faculty Advisor. Only two courses may be chosen from the student's major area of study. Electives. The remaining courses needed to complete the seven\u00ad course minor may be selected from any approved courses that are not used to meet an area requirement or from other courses deemed appropriate by the Faculty Advisor. Residence Requirement for the Minor: At least four upper-divi\u00ad sion courses must be successfully completed at UCL Statement of Intent: A Statement of Intent is required of all stu\u00ad dents wishing to enroll in this minor; forms are available in the Department office, 2000 Berkeley Place.

Specifi\u00ad cally, the academic mission of the School is to provide a stimulating academic environment for individuals interested in the application of science and the development of new technologies for the benefit of society, and to provide a supportive environment for each pro\u00ad gram to meet its unique objectives. The individual engineering and related programs have published program objectives that are consistent with the missions and goals of the University of California and UCI, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, and the Accreditation Board for Engineer\u00ad ing and Technology (ABET) General Criteria for Accrediting Pro\u00ad grams in Engineering in the United States. Engineering 195 The School offers undergraduate majors in Aerospace Engineering (AE), Biomedical Engineering (BME), Biomedical Engineering: Premedical (BMEP), Chemical Engineering (ChE), Civil Engineer\u00ad ing (CE), Computer Engineering (CpE), Computer Science and Engineering (CSE, a joint program with the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences), Electrical Engineering (EE), Engineering (a general program, GE), Environmental Engineering (EnE), Materials Science Engineering (MSE), and Mechanical Engineering (ME). The majors in Aerospace, Chemical, Civil, Com\u00ad puter, Electrical, Environmental, and Mechanical Engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. Aerospace Engineering considers the flight characteristics, perfor\u00ad mance, and design of aircraft and spacecraft. An upper-division series of courses in aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, and con\u00ad trol follows a common core with Mechanical Engineering. The skills acquired in those courses are integrated in the capstone aero\u00ad space design course. The intent of the program is to produce highly proficient engineers who can tackle the aerospace engineering challenges of the future. See page 242. Biomedical Engineering applies fundamental engineering princi\u00ad ples to solve complex problems that are fundamentally medical in nature, and focuses at improving the quality of health care by advancing technology and reducing costs. Examples include advanced biomedical imaging systems, the design of microscale diagnostic systems, drug delivery systems, and tissue engineering. Two bachelor's degree programs are offered-Biomedical Engi\u00ad neering and Biomedical Engineering: Premedical. The former con\u00ad tains more engineering content and less biology whereas the latter is geared toward preparing students for admission to medical school. See page 209. Chemical Engineering applies the knowledge of chemistry, mathematics, physics, biology, and humanities to solve societal problems in areas such as energy, health, the environment, food, textiles, shelter, semiconductors, and homeland security. Employ\u00ad ment opportunities exist in various industries such as chemical, petroleum, polymer, pharmaceutical, food, textile, fuel, consumer products, and semiconductor, as well as in local, state, and federal governments. See page 214. Civil Engineering addresses the challenges of large-scale engi\u00ad neering projects of importance to society as a whole, such as water distribution, transportation, and building design. Specializations are provided in General Civil Engineering, Environmental Hydrology and Water Resources, Structural Engineering, and Transportation Systems Engineering. See page 223. Computer Engineering addresses the design and analysis of digi\u00ad tal computers, including both software and hardware. Computer design includes topics such as computer architecture, VLSI circuits, data base, software engineering, design automation, system soft\u00ad ware, and data structures and algorithms. Courses include program\u00ad ming in,high-level languages such as Python, Java, C, C++; use of software packages for analysis and design; design of system soft\u00ad ware such as editors, compilers, debuggers, and operating systems; application of computers in solving engineering problems, and lab\u00ad oratories in both hardware and software experiences. See page 232. Computer Science and Engineering is designed to provide stu\u00ad dents with the fundamentals of computer science, both hardware and software, and the application of engineering concepts, tech\u00ad niques, and methods to both computer systems engineering imd software system design. The program gives students access to mul\u00ad tidisciplinary problems in engineering with a focus on total sys\u00ad tems engineering. Students learn the computer science principles . that are critical to development of software, hardware, and net\u00ad working of computer systems. From that background, engineering UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 196 UCI 2006-07 The Henry Samueli School of Engineering concepts and methods are added to give students exposure to cir\u00ad cuit design, network design, and digital signal processing. Ele\u00ad ments of engineering practice include systems view, manufacturing and economic issues, and multidisciplinary engineering applica\u00ad tions. The program is administered jointly by the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and by the Department of Com\u00ad puter Science in the Donald Bren School of Information and Com\u00ad puter Sciences. See page 362. Electrical Engineering is one of the major contributors to the modernization of our society. Many of the most basic and perva\u00ad sive products and services are either based on or related to the sci\u00ad entific and engineering principles taught at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Students can spe\u00ad cialize in three general areas of studies-Electro-optics and.Solid\u00ad State Devices, Power Electronics and Power Systems, and Systems and Signal Processing-all at the forefront of technological advancement. See page 233. The major in Engineering is a special program of study for upper\u00ad division students who wish to combine the study of engineering principles with other areas such as the physical and biological sci\u00ad ences, social and behavioral science, humanities, and arts. Students may construct their own specialization. See page 200. Environmental Engineering concerns the\u00b7development of strate\u00ad gies to control and minimize pollutant emissions, to treat waste, and to remediate polluted natural systems. Emphasis areas include air quality and combustion, water quality, and water resources engi\u00ad neering. See page 224. Materials Science Engineering is concerned with the generation and application of knowledge relating the composition, structure, and synthesis of materials to their properties and applications. Dur\u00ad ing the past two decades, Materials Science Engineering has become an indispensable component of modern engineering educa\u00ad tion, partly because of the crucial role materials play in national defense, the quality of life, and the economic security and competi\u00ad tiveness of the nation; and partly because the selection of materials has increasingly become an integral part of almost every modem engineering design. Emphasis in the Materials Science Engineering curriculum is placed on: the synthesis, characterization, and prop\u00ad erties of advanced functional materials; analysis, selection, and design related to the use of materials; the application of computers to materials problems; and the presence of an interdisciplinary theme that allows a qualified student to combine any engineering major with the Materials Science Engineering major. See page 215. Mechanical Engineering considers the design, control, and motive power of fluid, thermal, and mechanical systems ranging from microelectronics to spacecraft to the human body. Specializations allow students to focus their technical electives in the areas of Aero\u00ad space Engineering, Energy Systems and Environmental Engineer\u00ad ing, Flow Physics and Propulsion Systems, and Design of Mechan\u00ad ical Systems. See page 243. The School offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Biomedical Engineer\u00ad ing; Chemical and Biochemical Engineering; Civil Engineering; Electrical and Computer Engineering, with concentrations in Com\u00ad puter Graphics and Visualization, Computer Networks and Distrib\u00ad uted Computing, Computer Systems and Software, and Electrical Engineering; Engineering, with concentrations in Arts Computa\u00ad tion Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Protein Engineering Science; Materials Sci\u00ad ence and Engineering; and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineer\u00ad ing.

UNDERGRADUATE STUDY Student Affairs Office 101 Engineering and Computing Trailer; (949) 824-4334 John LaRue, Associate Dean PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Advising Academic advising is available from academic counselors and peer advisors in the School's Student Affairs Office, 101 Engineering and Computing Trailer, and from faculty advisors. Students must realize, however, that ultimately they alone are responsible for the planning of their own program and for satisfactory completion of the graduation requirements. Students are encouraged to consult with the academic counselors in the Engineering Student Affairs Office whenever they desire to change their program of study. All Engineering majors are required to meet with their faculty advisor at least once each year. Some engineering students will need more than four years to obtain their B.S. degree,-particularly if part-time employment or extracurricular activities make heavy demands on their time. Nor\u00ad mally, such students can stay on track, and are encouraged to do so, by enrolling in summer sessions at UCI or at other institutions when a petition has been approved in advance. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007High-achieving students may declare a second major. Early consul- tation with the School is advisable. , Required courses may be replaced by other courses if the student substantiates the merits of the program of study and obtains prior approval from faculty in the School. Students should be aware that most Engineering courses require the completion of prerequisites. The sample programs shown in each departmental description constitute preferred sequences which take into account all prerequisites. School policy does not permit the addition or deletion of Engineer\u00ad ing courses after the second week of the quarter. Undergraduate students who have high academic standing, who have completed the necessary prerequisites, and who have obtained permission from the School may qualify to take certain graduate\u00ad level courses. Students are required to complete UCI's lower-division writing requirement (see the Requirements for a BacheJor's Degree sec\u00ad tion) during the first two years. Thereafter, proficiency in writing and computing (using a higher-level language such as FORTRAN, Pyth_on, C, C++, Java, or with MATLAB) is expected in all Engi\u00ad neenng courses. Students in the School, in accordance with general campus policy, are permitted to take courses in certain areas on a Pass/Not Pass basis. With respect to programs in Engineering, such areas are courses which do not fulfill the major requirements and the breadth courses (except for courses taken in fulfillment of the UC Entry Level Writing requirement). Admissions The sequential nature of the Engineering program and the fact that many courses are offered only once a year make it beneficial for students to begin their studies in the fall quarter. Applicants wish\u00ad ing to be admitted for the fall quarter, 2007 must have submitted their completed application forms during the priority filing period (November 1-30, 2006). High school students wishing to enter the UCI Engineering pro\u00ad gram must have completed four years of mathematics through pre\u00ad calculus or math analysis and are advised to have completed one year each of physics and chemistry. That preparation, along with honors courses and advanced placemen~ courses, is fundamental to success in the Engineering program and is vital to receiving first consideration for admittance to an Engineering major during peri\u00ad ods of restricted enrollments. Students applying for admission for fall quarter should complete their examination requirements during May or June of their junior year or during their senior year, but no later than the December test date. (Typically, this means that stu\u00ad dents will take either the SAT Reasoning Test or the ACT Assess\u00ad ment plus Writing test in October or November, and will take two SAT Subject Tests in November or December.) Applicants must apply for admission to a specific Engineering major. If enrollment limitations make it necessary, unaccommodated Engineering applicants may be offered alternative majors at UCI. Transfer students may be admitted to The Henry Samueli School of Engineering either from another major at UCI or from another college or university. A student seeking admission to The Henry Samueli School of Engineering from colleges and schools other than UCI must satisfy University requirements for admission with advanced standing and should complete appropriate prerequisites for their major of choice. It is to the student's advantage to com\u00ad plete the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) or UCI breadth and lower-division requirements prior to transfer. Since requirements vary from major to major, those con\u00ad templating admission with advanced standing to the School should consult each Department's Catalogue section and the UCI Office Engineering 197 of Admissions and Relations with Schools, (949) 824-6703, for the specific requirements of each program.

Program or Ph.D. Program in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering Exceptionally promising UCI undergraduate Engineering students with a minimum cumulative 3.5 GPA may, during their junior or senior year, apply for accelerated admissions into the M.S. or Ph.D. programs within The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. Accelerated admission would allow a student to petition for exemption from UCI's Graduate Record Examination (GRE) requirement for graduate school admission. (The exemption applies only to current UCI students applying for admission to one of the M.S. programs in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering; other graduate schools may still require the GRE. Non-engineering stu\u00ad dents in related disciplines are encouraged to apply to the acceler\u00ad ated program. However, these particular applicants must have per\u00ad formed research with a faculty member in the School, as well as identified a research advisor for their graduate studies. Admissibil\u00ad ity of these students depends on the discretion of the faculty.) The student would request GRE exemption at the time of applying. Accelerated admission applicants would in all other ways be evalu\u00ad ated in the same manner as other applicants to the School's gradu\u00ad ate programs. Occasionally, a candidate for accelerated admission may be required by the faculty to submit GRE scores in support of the graduate application. Students offered accelerated admission, upon completion of the undergraduate degree program, may petition to credit toward the M.S. degree up to 18 units (with a grade of B or better) or gradu\u00ad ate-level course work completed in excess of requirements for the UCI bachelor's degree. A UCI undergraduate whose ultimate goal is a Ph.D. may apply for the accelerated M.S. program, however, a GRE score must be submitted. Education Abroad Program Upper-division and graduate Engineering students may participate in a number of programs which offer unique opportunities for edu\u00ad cation and training abroad.

The Graduate Record Examination General Test is required of all applicants. FINANCIAL SUPPORT Teaching assistantships and fellowships are available to qualified applicants (who should contact the Department to which they are applying for information). Research assistantships are available through individual faculty members. Although not required, it is beneficial for. applicants to contact the faculty member directly to establish the potential for research support. Early applications have a superior chance for financial support. PART-TIME STUDY Those students who are employed may pursue the M.S. degree on a part-time basis, carrying fewer units per quarter. Since University residency requirements necessitate the successful completion of a minimum number of units in graduate or upper-division work in each of at least three regular University quarters, part-time students should seek the advice of a counselor in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering Graduate Student Affairs Office and the approval of the Graduate Advisor in their program. M.S. programs must be completed in four calendar years from the date of admis\u00ad sion. Students taking courses in University Extension prior to enrollment in a graduate program should consult the following sec\u00ad tion on Transfer of Courses. TRANSFER AND SUBSTITUTION OF COURSES Upon petition, a limited number of upper-division undergraduate or graduate-level courses taken through University Extension, on another campus of the University, or in another accredited univer\u00ad sity may be credited toward the M.S. degree after admission. The applicability of transfer or substitution courses must be approved by the student's department and the Graduate Dean of the Univer\u00ad sity, in accordance with Academic Senate regulations. Also in accordance with UC Academic Senate policy, transfer credit for the M.S. degree cannot be used to reduce the minimum require\u00ad ment in strictly graduate (200 series) courses.

Such a professional must be technically skilled, artistically skilled, and theoretically skilled, all at an equally high and rigorous level. The goal of the M.S. in Engineering with a con\u00ad centration in Arts Computation Engineering is to provide students with a broad-based and interdisciplinary training at the intersection of digital technology and cultural and artistic practices. The ACE program is coordinated across the Donald Bren School of Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Sciences, The Henry Samueli School of Engi\u00ad neering, and the Claire Trevor School of the Arts, and places equal emphasis on technical, artistic, and critical proficiency. Strongly practical in composition, it provides students with the opportunity to explore in detail topics such as telematic performance, immer\u00ad sive and augmented environments, embodied interaction, and the cultural impact of new technologies. Graduation is by publicly presented thesis project and written the\u00ad sis, in addition to completion of course work. The ACE concentrations in all three fields consist of a two-year curriculum. The following courses are required: ACE Core: five ACE interdisciplinary theory seminars (Engineer\u00ad ing 270), four ACE studio/labs (Engineering 271-277), two ACE project internships (Engineering 279), and one quarter of ACE the\u00ad sis research (Engineering 279). (NOTE: A total of 48 units of Core courses must be completed. Any of the ACE core category courses may be reduced by one and replaced with a different ACE core course or an elective, in consul\u00ad tation with the student's advisor.) Electives: a minimum of four graduate electives in Engineering (12-16 units, depending on whether the courses carry credit of three or four units), which will support the student's area of spe\u00ad cialization and must be approved by the student's Engineering fac\u00ad ulty advisor. Two additional breadth electives: that may be chosen by the stu\u00ad dent in consultation with an advisor, and/or may be assigned by the ACE program committee in consultation with the student. These courses will compensate for lacunae in the student's background and may include upper-division undergraduate courses when appropriate and approved in advance by th~ candidate's advisor. Engineering 203 A program faculty member from Engineering will advise on elec\u00ad tive selection and may be on the thesis committee.

Sirignano: Combustion, pollutant formation, fire spread, noise suppression Environmental Engineering addresses the development of strategies to control anthropogenic emissions of pollutants to the atmosphere, waterways, and terrestrial environment; the remediation of polluted natural systems; the design of technologies to treat waste; fire safety; noise suppression; energy efficiency; and the evaluation of contaminant fate in urban environments. Environmental engineer\u00ad ing issues are now an important component in the development of many engineering technologies and consequently are an important aspect of an engineering education. The discipline itself is interdis\u00ad ciplinary and requires a curriculum that provides students with an understanding of fundamentals in air-and water-quality sciences, contaminant fate and transport, and design concepts for pollutant emission control and treatment. To avoid the development of envi\u00ad ronmental engineering solutions which only transform one form of pollution to another, modem engineering education programs must require exposure and familiarity with a greater number of subjects than ever before. Environmental engineers with an interdisciplinary background are particularly sought to address the complex infrastructure needs of today's society, where they must be able to communicate with teams of scientists and engineers from different disciplines. Envi\u00ad ronmental engineering graduates who meet this description can expect to remain in strong demand in the private and public employment sectors, and their range of career opportunities is highly diverse. Examples of career fields and activities include the development of new technologies to genetically engineer microor\u00ad ganisms for waste treatment, design of combustion and control processes that minimize pollutant emissions and maximize energy efficiency, resolution of complex pollutant transport processes in naturally heterogeneous systems, development of new physical\u00ad chemical treatment approaches, and characterization of pollutant transformation mechanisms in natural systems. Curricular and research subjects of interest in Environme,ntal Engi\u00ad neering include environmental air and water chemistry, environ\u00ad mental microbiology, combustion technologies, aerosol science, transport phenomena, reactor theory, unit operations and systems design, mathematical modeling, energy systems, soil physics, fluid mechanics, hydrology, and meteorology. Interdisciplinary research endeavors commonly bridge many of these different subjects and a current focus is maintained on new and emerging technologies. . Curriculum objectives have also been set to maintain a balance between the depth and breadth of program scope for each student. Students may pursue either the M.S. or Ph.D. degree in Engineering. Required Background The interdisciplinary nature of the program allows students with a variety of backgrounds to undertake studies in this field. Students with a background in engineering-particularly chemical, civil, -environmental, and mechanical engineering-as well as scientists from biology, chemistry, environmental science, and physics, are encouraged to participate. Students admitted to the program are expected to have had rigor\u00ad ous undergraduate exposure to a number of relevant subject areas including air quality, environmental chemistry, fluid mechanics, microbial processes, and reactor theory and design. The degree to which each student meets the program's background requirement is determined by participating faculty at the time of admission. Stu\u00ad dents with an insufficient background who are offered admission will be required to take a set of appropriate prerequisite courses. Prerequisite work typically involves at least two and frequently as many as five or six upper-division, undergraduate courses each of which must be completed with a final grade of B or better. Occa\u00ad sionally, lower-division work in chemistry, mathematics, or physics is required. The student's specific prerequisite course work require\u00ad ment, if any, is stated the letter of admission. The background requirement establishes a common foundation for graduate study in the program. Not all students are required to take prerequisite course work; those who are may do so following matriculation in the graduate program. In addition, M.S. students may use a limited amount of upper-division course work taken to meet the background requirement in partial fulfillment of graduate degree requirements. Although this list is not exhaustive, commonly required prerequi\u00ad site courses within each of the required background areas are as follows: Air Quality: Engineering MAEllO, MAE162, or MAE164. Environmental CBEMS116/216. Fluid Theory and Design: CBEMSllO. Core Requirement Students must complete an advanced mathematics course, either CBEMS230 (Applied Engineering Mathematics I), CEE283 (Mathematical Methods in Engineering Analysis), or MAE200B (Engineering Analysis II). Areas of Emphasis Each student selects a primary area of emphasis within Environ\u00ad mental Engineering: Water Quality, Water Resources, or Air Qual\u00ad ity and Combustion. To achieve the interdisciplinary objectives of the program, students are required to take at least two electives outside their primary area, one each in two different areas. These outside electives may also be taken from approved courses in other academic units, including the Schools of Social Ecology, Physical Sciences, and Medicine. Electives within each of the emphasis areas in Engineering are listed below. Water Quality: CBEMS210 (Reaction Engineering), CBEMS214 (Bioremediation), (Transport Phenomena), CBEMS234 (Bioreactor Engineering), CEE263 (Advanced Biological Treatment Processes), Treatment Models), CEE269 (Haz\u00ad ardous Waste Treatment and Disposal), Earth System Science 201B (Global Biogeochemistry). UC IRVINE - C,EE272 (Transport Phenomena in Saturated Porous Media), CEE274B (Transport Phenomena in Unsaturated Porous Media and Fractures), CEE275 (Coastal Engi\u00ad neering), CEE276 Water Hydrology), CEE277 (Transport Estuaries), CEE278 (Flow in and Estuaries), CEE279B (Computation in Subsurface Hydrology), Earth System Science 201C System Change). Air Quality and Combustion: MAE210 (Advanced Fuilqamentals of Combustion), MAE215 (Advanced Combustion Technology), MAE230A (Advanced Incompressible Fluid Dynamics 1), MAE231 (Fundamentals of Turbulence), MAE232 (Atmospheric Turbulence), MAE233 (Turbulent Free Shear Flows), MAE260 (Issues Related to Atmospheric Processes), MAE261 (Air Pollution Modeling), MAE264 (Combustion Particulates and Aerosols), MAE280 (Digital Data Acquisition and Analysis), Earth System Science 201A (Physical Climate). MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two options are available for M.S. degree students: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Both options require the completion of 36 units of study. Study plans for both options must also include two graduate courses from outside the student's pri\u00ad mary area of emphasis. Plan I. Thesis Option A thesis option is available to students who prefer to conduct a focused research project. Students selecting this option must com\u00ad plete an original research investigation and a thesis, and obtain approval of the thesis by a thesis committee. Of the 36 required units, at least 20 must be graduate courses (numbered 200-289), including either CBEMS230, MAE200B, or CEE283. A maximum of eight M.S. research units and up to eight units of upper-division undergraduate elective courses may be applied to the degree with the prior approval of a faculty advisor. Plan II. Comprehensive Examination Option Alternatively, students may select a comprehensive examination option in which they must successfully complete 36 units of study and pass a comprehensive examination. At least 24 units must be graduate courses (numbered 200-289), including either CBEMS230, MAE200B, or CEE283. Up to 12 units may be taken as upper-divi\u00ad sion undergraduate elective courses. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. concentration in Environmental Engineering requires the achievement of original and significant research that advances the discipline. Doctoral students are selected on the basis of an out\u00ad standing record of scholarship and potential for research excellence. The doctoral study program is tailored to the individual student in consultation with a faculty advisory committee. There are no spe\u00ad cific course requirements, however, additional mathematics courses beyond those required for a M.S. degree are generally required, reflecting the student's specific research interests. Within this flexi\u00ad ble framework, the School maintains specific guidelines that out\u00ad line the milestones of a typical doctoral program. All doctoral stu\u00ad dents should consult the Environmental Engineering program guidelines for details, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty, passage within the first year of a preliminary examination or similar assessment of the student's background and potential for success, research prepara\u00ad tion, formal advancement to candidacy by passing a qualifying examination in the third year (or second year for students who entered with a master's degree), completion of a significant research investigation, and the submission and oral defense of an acceptable dissertation. Engineering 205 Committees for preliminary and Ph.D. qualifying examinations and the doctoral committee must have at least one Environmental Engi\u00ad neering faculty member from outside the student's area of emphasis. The student's dissertation topic must be approved by the student's doctoral committee. The degree is granted upon the recommenda\u00ad tion of the doctoral committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years (four years for students who entered with a master's degree). The maxi\u00ad mum time permitted is seven years.

During the past two decades, MSE has become an impor\u00ad tant component of modern engineering education, partly because of the increased level of sophistication required of engineering materials in a rapidly changing technological society, and partly because the selection of materials has increasingly become an inte\u00ad gral part of almost every modern engineering design. In fact, fur\u00ad ther improvements in design are now viewed more and more as primarily materials and manufacturing issues. Both the develop\u00ad ment of new materials and the understanding of present-day mate\u00ad rials demand a thorough knowledge of basic engineering and scien\u00ad tific principles including, for example, crystal structure, mechaniCs, mechanical behavior, electronic, optical and magnetic properties, thermodynamics, phase equilibria, heat transfer, diffusion, and the physics and chemistry of solids and chemical reactions. The field of MSE ranks high on the list of top careers for scientists and engineers. The services of these engineers and scientists are required in a variety of engineering operations dealing, for exam\u00ad ple, with design of semiconductors and optoelectronic devices, development of new technologies based on composites and high\u00ad temperature materials, biomedical products, performance (quality, reliability, safety, energy efficiency) in automobile and aircraft components, improvement in nondestructive testing techniques, corrosion behavior in refineries, radiation damage in nuclear power plants, fabrication of steels, and construction of highways and bridges. Subjects of interest in Materials Science and Engineering cover a wide spectrum, ranging from metals, optical and electronic materi\u00ad als to superconductive materials; ceramics, advanced composites, and biomaterials. In addition, the emerging new research and tech\u00ad nological areas in materials are in many cases interdisciplinary. Accordingly, the principal objective of the graduate curriculum is to integrate a student's area of emphasis-whether it be structural materials, chemical processing, mechanics of solids, or electronic devices-into the whole of materials engineering and manufactur\u00ad ing technology. Such integration will breed. familiarity with other disciplines and provide students with the breadth they need to face the challenges of current and future technology. Students may pursue either the M.S. or Ph.D. degree in Engineering with a concentration in MSE. Recommended Background Given the nature of Materials Science and Engineering as an inter\u00ad disciplinary program, students having a background and suitable training in either Materials, Engineering (Biomedical, Civil, Chemical, Electrical, and Mechanical), or the Physical Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Geology) are encouraged to participate. Rec\u00ad ommended background courses include an introduction to materials, thermodynamics, mechanical properties, and electrical/opticaU magnetic properties. A student with an insufficient background may be required to take remedial undergraduate courses following matriculation as a graduate student. Core Requirement Because of the interdepartmental nature of the concentration, it is important to establish a common foundation in Materials Science and Engineering for students from various backgrounds. This foun\u00ad dation is sufficiently covered in MSE courses that are listed below and that deal with the following topics: Crystal Structure and Crystal Defects: MSE200 (Atomic Structure and Properties of Materials). Physical and Electrical Properties: MSE205 (Materials Physics). Thermodynamics and Transport Phenomena: one course from MSE252 (Theory of Diffusion), MSE253 (Kinetic Phenomena in Materials), CBEMS240 (Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics), or Chemistry 230 (Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetic Theory). Processing of Materials: one course from EECS 176 (Fundamentals of Solid-State Electronics and Materials), MSE255A (Design with Ceramic Materials), or MSE270 (Materials Processing). Electives These electives represent courses in areas of emphasis. Typical examples for elective courses in various areas of emphasis are listed below. Chemical Processing: CBEMS210 (Reaction Engineering), CBEMS220 (Transport Phenomena), CBEMS230 1), CBEMS240 (Chemical Engineering Ther\u00ad modynamics), MSE210 Techniques and Analysis). Electronic and Photonic Materials: EECS277 A-B (Advanced Semiconductor Devices I, tions), EECS285B (Lasers and Photonics), EECS280A-B (Advanced Engineering Electromagnetics I, II). Mechanics of Solids: CEE242 (Advanced Strength of Materials), CEE243 (Mechanics of Composite Materials), CEE246 (Structural Performance and Failure), CEE281 (Finite Element Method in Continuum Mechanics). Optoelectronics Packaging: CEE281 Element Method in Continuum Mechanics), CBEMS280 (Optoelectronics EECS188 (Optical ElectroniCs), EECS279 (Micro Sensors and Actuators), EECS285A (Optical Communications), EECS285B (Lasers and Photonics), EECS285C (Integrated and Fiber Optics), MSE272 (Microelectronic and Photonic Materials and Technology). Physics and Chemistry of Materials: Chemistry 213 (Chemical Kinetics), Chemistry 225 (Polymer Chemistry), Chemistry 230 (Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetic Theory), Chemistry 252 (Special Topics in Physical Chemistry), Physics 221 (Elasticity), Physics 239A (Plasma Physics), Mathematics 292A (Applied Mathematics). Structural Materials: MSE210 (Materials Characterization Tech\u00ad niques and Analysis), MSE251 (Dislocation Theory), MSE255A (Design with Ceramic Materials), MSE255B (Science of Compos\u00ad ite Materials), MSE256A (Fracture of Engineering Materials), MSE259 (Transmission of Electron Microscopy), MSE263 (Com\u00ad puter Techniques in Experimental Materials Research), MAE200B (Engineering Analysis). It should be noted that specific course requirements within the areas of emphasis are decided based on consultation with the Director of the MSE concentration and the faculty advisor; that in selecting electives, students are encouraged to take courses which are not in their area of emphasis; and that MSE courses which are not selected to satisfy the core requirement can also serve as elec\u00ad tives under the Structural Materials emphasis. Furthermore, stu\u00ad dents in the MSE concentration who are interested in an area of emphasis other than Structural Materials are urged to take one course which covers aspects related to mechanical behavior such as Dislocation Theory (MSE251) and Fracture of Engineering Materi- als (MSE256B). . MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE A minimum of 36 units is required for the M.S. degree. Two options are available, a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. For the thesis option, students are required to complete a research study of great depth and originality and obtain approval for a complete program of study. A committee of three full-time faculty members is appointed to guide development of the thesis. At least 21 units must be taken from courses numbered 200-289, among which 12 units are from MSE core courses and nine units are in the area of emphasis approved by the faculty advisor and the UC IRVINE - 2006-2007graduate advisor. Up to eight units of CBEMS296, EECS296, or CEE296 and up to eight units of undergraduate elective courses taken as a graduate student at UCI can be applied toward the 36- unit requirement. For the comprehensive examination option, stu\u00ad dents are required to complete 36 units of study. At least 24 units must be taken from courses numbered 200-289, among which 12 units are from MSE core courses and 12 units are in the area of emphasis approved by the faculty advisor and the graduate advisor. Up to eight units of undergraduate elective courses taken as a grad\u00ad uate student at UCI can be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. Part-time study for the M.S. degree is available and encouraged for engineers working in local industries. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. degree in Engineering with a concentration in Materials Science and Engineering requires a commitment on the part of the student to dedicated study and collaboration with the faculty. Ph.D. students are selected on the basis of outstanding demon\u00ad strated potential and scholarship. Applicants must hold the appro\u00ad priate prerequisite degrees from recognized institutions of high standing. After substantial academic preparation, Ph.D. candidates work under the supervision of faculty advisors. The process involves extended immersion in a research atmosphere and culmi\u00ad nates in the production of original research results presented in a dissertation. Milestones to be passed in the Ph.D. program include the follow\u00ad ing: acceptance into a research group by the faculty advisor during the student's first year of study; successful completion of the Ph.D. preliminary examination; preparation for doing research, comple\u00ad tion of The Henry Samueli School of Engineering teaching require\u00ad ments; the development of a research proposal; passing the qualify\u00ad ing examination which assesses the candidate's preparation and potential for research and evaluates the Ph.D. thesis research pro\u00ad posal; successful completion of the research; development and approval of the dissertation; and public presentation and defense of the dissertation. There is no foreign language requirement. The preliminary examination, to be taken during the second year of the Ph.D. program, is based on the core courses in MSE and courses taken in the area of emphasis. The examination committee is appointed by the MSE Director with subsequent approval by the School's Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. Students must advance to candidacy in their third year (second year for those who entered with a master's degree). The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the doctoral committee and the Dean of Gradu-\u00b7 ate Studies. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years (four years for students who entered with a master's degree). The maximum time permitted is seven years.

Biomedical engineering combines engineering expertise with med\u00ad ical needs for the enhancement of health care. It is a branch of engineering in which knowledge and skills are developed and applied to define and solve problems in biology and medicine. Stu\u00ad dents choose the biomedical engineering field to be of service to people, for the excitement of working with living systems, and to apply advanced technology to the complex problems of medical care. Biomedical engineers may be called upon to design instru\u00ad ments and devices, to bring together knowledge from many sources to develop new procedures, or to carry out research to acquire knowledge needed to solve new problems. During the last 20 years, we have witnessed unprecedented advances in engineering, medical care, and the life sciences. The combination of exploding knowledge and technology in biology, medicine, the physical sciences, and engineering, coupled with the changes in the way health care will be delivered in the next cen\u00ad tury, provide a fertile ground for biomedical engineering. Biomed\u00ad ical engineering, at the confluence of these fields, has played a vital role in this progress. Traditionally, engineers have been con\u00ad cerned with inanimate materials, devices, and systems, while life scientists have investigated biological structure and function. Bio\u00ad medical engineers integrate these disciplines in a unique way, com\u00ad bining the methodologies of the physical sciences and engineering with the study of biological and medical problems. The collabora\u00ad tion between engineers, physicians, biologists, and physical scien- . tists is an integral part of this endeavor and has produced many important discoveries in the areas of artificial organs, artificial implants, and diagnostic equipment. The Department offers a B.S. degree in Biomedical Engineering, a four-year engineering curriculum. This program prepares students for a wide variety of careers in Biomedical Engineering in indus- . try, hospitals, and research laboratories or for further education in graduate school. The Department also offers a B.S. degree in Biomedical Engineer\u00ad ing: Premedical, a four-year engineering curriculum taken with required premedical courses. It is one of many majors that can serve as preparation for further training in medical, veterinary, or allied health professions. It is also suitable for students interested in pursuing graduate work in Biomedical Engineering and other biomedical areas such as physiology, neurosciences, and bioinfor\u00ad matics. The curriculum has less engineering content but more bio\u00ad logical sciences than the Biomedical Engineering major. Areas of graduate study and research include biophotonics, bio\u00ad medical nanoscale systems, biomedical computational technolo\u00ad gies, and tissue engineering. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Undergraduate Major in BiC?medical Engineering Program Educational Objectives: Graduates of the Biomedical Engineering Program will: (1) demonstrate a broad knowledge in the field of biomedical engineering; (2) communicate effectively the relevant biomedical engineering problem to be solved across the engineering, life science, and medical disciplines; (3) demon\u00ad strate critical reasoning as well as quantitative and design skills to identify, formulate, analyze, and solve biomedical engineering problems; (4) lead and manage biomedical engineering projects in industry, government, or academia that involve multidisciplinary team members. (Program educational objectives are those aspects of engineering that help shape the curriculum; achievement of these objectives is a shared responsibility between the student and UCI.) Biomedical Engineering students learn engineering and principles of biology, physiology, chemistry, and physics. They may go on to design devices to diagnose and treat disease, engineer tissues to repair wounds, develop cutting-edge genetic treatments, or create computer programs to understand how the human body works. The curriculum emphasizes education in the fundamentals of engi\u00ad neering sciences that form the common basis of all engineering subspecialties. Education with this focus is intended to provide stu\u00ad dents with a solid engineering foundation for a career in which engineering practice may change rapidly. In addition, elements of bioengineering design are incorporated at every level in the cur\u00ad riculum. This is accomplished by integration of laboratory experi\u00ad mentation, computer applications, and exposure to real bioengi\u00ad neering problems throughout the program. Students also work as teams in senior design project courses to solve multidisciplinary proqlems suggested by industrial and clinical experience. NOTE: Students may complete only one of the following programs: the major in Biomedical Engineering, the major in Biomedical Engineering: Premedical, or the minor in Biomedical Engineering. ADMISSIONS High School Students: See page 197. Transfer Students. Preference will be given to junior-hive! appli\u00ad cants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of calculus, one year of calculus-based physics (mechanics, electricity, and magnetism with laboratory), one year of chemistry (with labora\u00ad tory), and one additional approved course for the major. Students are encouraged to complete as many of the lower-division degree requirements as possible prior to transfer. Students who enroll at UCI in need of completing lower-division course work may find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degrees.

Private biomedical industry has indicated a keen interest in engi\u00ad neers that have a more traditional engineering degree (i.e., electri\u00ad cal engineering), but also possess some in-depth knowledge of bio\u00ad medical systems. Hence, the minor in Biomedical Engineering is designed to provide a student with the introductory skills necessary to perform as an engineer in the biomedical arena. Admissions. Students interested in the minor in Biomedical Engi\u00ad neering must apply through The Henry Samueli School of Engi\u00ad neering Student Affairs Office and must have a UCI cumulative GPA of 2.5 or higher. NOTE: Students may not receive both a minor in Biomedical Engi\u00ad neering and a specialization in Biochemical Engineering within the Chemical Engineering major. Requirements for the Minor in Biomedical Engineering Mathematics Courses: Mathematics 2J, 3D. Engineering Topics Courses: BMEl, BME50A-B, BME120, BME121. Technical Electives: Students select, with the approval of a faculty advisor, two technical elective courses: BMEllOA, BMEllOB, BME130, in Biomedical Engineering The Biomedical Engineering faculty have special interest and expertise in four thrust areas: Biophotonics, Biomedical Nanoscale Systems, Biomedical Computational Technologies, and Tissue Engineering: Biophotonics faculty are interested in photomedicine, laser microscopy, optical coherence tomography, medical imaging, and phototherapy. Biomedical Nanoscale Systems faculty are inter\u00ad ested in molecular engineering, polymer chemistry, molecular motors, design and fabrication of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), integrated microsystems to study intercellular signaling, UC IRVINE - 2006-2007and single molecule studies of\u00b7protein dynamics. Biomedical Com\u00ad putation faculty are interested in computational biology, biomed\u00ad ical signal and image processing, bioinformatics, computational methods in protein engineering, and data mining. The Department offers the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Biomedical Engineering. Required Background Because of its interdisciplinary nature, biomedical engineering attracts students with a variety of backgrounds. Thus, the require\u00ad ments for admission are tailored to students who have a bachelor's degree in an engineering, physical science, or biological science discipline, with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher in their upper\u00ad division course work. The minimum course work requirements for admission are six quarters of calculus through linear algebra and ordinary differential equations, three quarters of calculus-based physics, three quarters of chemistry, and two quarters of biology. Students without a physics, chemistry, or engineering undergradu\u00ad ate degree may be required to take additional relevant undergradu\u00ad ate engineering courses during their first year in the program; any such requirements will be specifically determined by the BME Graduate Committee on a case-by-case basis and will be made known to the applicant at the time of acceptance to the program. The recommended minimum combined verbal and quantitative por\u00ad tion of the GREis 1200, or a minimum combined MCAT score in Verbal Reasoning, Physical Sciences, and Biological Sciences problems of 30. A minimum score of 600 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is recommended of all international students whose native language is not English. In addition, all applicants must submit three letters of recommendation. Exceptionally promising UCI undergraduates may apply for admis\u00ad sion through The School of Engineering's acceler\u00ad ated M.S. and M.S./Ph.D. program, however, these students must satisfy the course work and letters of recommendation require\u00ad ments\u00b7 described above. Core Requirement All students are required to take a set of core courses which total 22 units: BME 210, BME220, BME221, BME230A, BME230B, andBME240. Elective Requirement The remaining 14 units required to fulfill the course requirements for the M.S. and Ph.D. degree are comprised of elective courses offered within The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and the Schools of Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Medicine. A minimum of eight of the elective units must be taken from The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. The group of elective courses must be approved by the BME Graduate Committee, for M.S. students, or, for Ph.D. students, the student's graduate advi\u00ad sory committee, and are chosen to meet the specific needs of each student. The electives must provide breadth in biomedical engineer\u00ad ing, but also provide specific skills necessary to the specific research the student may undertake as part of the degree requirements. Areas of Emphasis Although a student is not required to formally choose a specific research focus area, four research thrust areas have been identified for the program: Biophotonics, Biomedical Nanoscale Systems, Biomedical Computational Technologies, and Tissue Engineering. These areas capitalize on existing strengths within The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and UCI as a whole, interact in a synergistic fashion, and will train biomedical engineers who are in demand in both private industry and academia. Biophotonics. This research area includes the use of light to probe individual cells and tissues and whole organs for diagnostic' and therapeutic purposes. The research areas include both fundamental Biomedical Engineering 211 investigation on the basic mechanisms of light interaction with bio\u00ad logical systems and the clinical application of light to treat and diagnose disease. Current and future foci of the faculty are: (1) microscope-based optical techniques to manipulate and study cells and organelles; (2) development of optically based technologies for the non-invasive diagnosis of cells and tissues using techniques that include fiber-optic-based sensors, delivery systems, and imag\u00ad ing systems; and (3) development of optically based devices for minimally invasive surgery. Nanoscale Systems. This class of research areas encompasses the understanding, use, or design of systems that are at the micron or submicron level. Current strengths within The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and the UCI faculty as a whole include bio\u00ad materials, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and the design of new biomedical molecules. The focus of biomedical engineering research in this area is the integration of nanoscale systems with the needs of clinical medicine. Projected areas of growth include: (1) micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) for biomedical devices and biofluid assay; (2) programmable DNA/ molecular microchip for sequencing and and (3) bio\u00ad materials and self-assembled nanostructures for biosensors and drug delivery. Biomedical Computational Technologies. computa\u00ad tional technologies include both advanced computational tech\u00ad niques, as well as advanced biomedical database systems and knowledge-base systems. Computational technologies that will be developed in this research area include: (1) methods for biomedical analysis and diagnosis such as physical modeling of light-tissue interactions, atomic-level interactions, image processing, pattern recognition, and machine-learning algorithms; (2) language instruction and platform standardization; and (3) machine-patient interfaces. Areas of research related to biomedical database sys\u00ad tems include the development of new technologies which can cap\u00ad ture the rich semantics of biomedical information for intelligent reasoning. Tissue Engineering. The term tissue engineering was officially coined at a National Science Foundation workshop in 1988 to mean \"the application of principles and methods of engineering and life sciences toward fundamental understanding of structure\u00ad function relationships in normal and pathological mammalian tis\u00ad sues and the development of biological substitutes to restore, main\u00ad tain, or improve tissue function.\" Tissue engineering draws on experts from chemical engineering, materials science, surgery, genetics, and related disciplines from engineering and the life sci\u00ad ences. Much of the current research in the field involves growing cells in three-dimensional structures instead of in laboratory dishes. For the most part, cells grown in a flat dish tend to behave as individual cells. But grow a cell culture in a three-dimensional structure, and the cells begin to behave as they would in a tissue or organ. Tissue engineers are testing different methods of growing tissue and organ cells in three-dimensional scaffolds that dissolve once the cells reach a certain mass. The hope is that these cell cul\u00ad tures will mature into fully functional tissues and organs. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two options are available for the M.S. degree: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Both options require the stu\u00ad dent to specify an area of specialty, and to complete a minimum of 36 units, at'least 28 of which must be at the 200 level including the 22 units that comprise the core courses as described above. The degree will be granted upon the recommendation of the Director and The Henry Samueli School of Engineering Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. Plan 1: Thesis Option A thesis option is available to students who prefer to conduct a focused research project. Students selecting this option must select UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 212 UCI 2006-07 The Henry Samueli School of Engineering a thesis advisor and complete an original research investigation including a written thesis, and obtain approval of the thesis by a thesis committee. A maximum of eight M.S. research units (i.e., EECS296) may be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Option Alternatively, students may select a comprehensive examination option in which they must successfully complete 36 units of study and pass a comprehensive examination. The preliminary examina\u00ad tion in the Ph.D. program, described below, will serve as the com\u00ad prehensive examination. However, the passing grade to qualify at the Master's competency level will be lower than the grade required for a student to advance in the Ph.D. program. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. degree requires the achievement of an original and sig\u00ad nificant body of research that advances the discipline. Students with a B.S. degree may enter the Ph.D. program directly, provided they meet the background requirements described above. The Graduate Committee will handle applicants on a case-by-case basis, and any specific additional courses required by the student will be made explicit at the time of admission. Each student is matched with a faculty advisor, and an individual program of study is designed by the student and a faculty advisory committee. There are no additional course requirements beyond that of the M.S. degree. Four milestones are required: (1) success\u00ad ful completion of 36 units of course work beyond the bachelor's degree, at least 28 of which must be at the 200 level including the 22 units of core course requirements; (2) successful completion of a preliminary examination at the Ph.D. competency level; (3) for\u00ad mal advancement to candidacy by successfully passing a qualifying examination; and (4) completion of a significant body of original research and the submission of an acceptable written dissertation and its successful oral defense. The preliminary examination will normally be taken at the end of the first year (May). A student must take it within two years of matriculating in the program, and must either have passed all of the core courses or have an M.S. degree prior to taking the exami\u00ad nation. The Graduate Committee prepares the examination and sets two minimum competency levels, one for awarding the Master's degree and the second for continuing on in the Ph.D. program. Stu\u00ad dents who fail to pass at the Ph.D. level may retake the examina\u00ad tion once within six months of the initial attempt. Students who fail the second attempt will not be allowed to continue in the pro\u00ad gram. Students who pass either attempt at the Master's competency level will be awarded an M.S. degree. After passing the prelimi\u00ad nary examination at the Ph.D. competency level, students are matched with a BME faculty advisor and design an individual pro\u00ad gram of study with their advisor. Advancement to candidacy must be completed between the ninth and twelfth quarters of enrollment, usually during a student's third year (second year for students who entered with a master's degree). (Special exceptions can be made, but a formal request with justifi\u00ad cation must be supplied in writing to the Director.) The qualifying examination follows campus and The Henry Samueli School of Engineering guidelines and consists of an oral and written presen\u00ad tation of original work completed thus far, and a coherent plan for completing a body of original research. The qualifying examina\u00ad tion is presented to the student's graduate advisory committee, which is selected by the student and faculty advisor and must have a minimum of five faculty (including the faculty advisor). Of these five faculty, a minimum of three must be affiliated BME faculty. In addition, a minimum of two faculty must have part of their primary appointment in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. The Ph.D. is awarded upon submission of an acceptable written dissertation and its successful oral defense. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the graduate advisory committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years (four years for students who entered with a master's degree). The maximum time permitted is seven years. GRADUATE PROGRAM IN MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATION BIOLOGY The graduate program in Mathematical and Computational Biology (MCB) is a one-year \"gateway\" program designed to function in concert with selected department programs, including the Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering. Detailed information is available online at http://mcsb.bio.uci.edu/ and in the School of Biological Sciences section of the Catalogue, page 156.

Undergraduate Major in Chemical Engineering Program Educational Objectives: (1) provide students with a solid foundation and training in chemical engineering fundamen\u00ad tals to enter professional and chemical engineering practice and to enter into graduate study at leading universities; (2) provide a broad background in engineering sciences and their applications to chemical engineering practices as it relates to design, development, research, and teaching in industry, government, or a university; (3) allow students to personalize their curriculum to prepare them for traditional chemical engineering careers and diverse careers in areas such as medicine, biotechnology, the environment, and mate\u00ad rials processing; (4) provide opportunities for teamwork, open\u00ad ended problem solving, and critical thinking. (Program educational objectives are those aspects of engineering that help shape the cur\u00ad riculum; achievement of these objectives is a shared responsibility between the student and UCI.) Chemical Engineering uses knowledge of chemistry, mathematics, physics, biology, and humanities to solve societal problems in areas such as energy, health, the environment, food, clothing, shelter, and materials and serves a variety of processing industries whose vast array of products include chemicals, petroleum products, plastics, pharmaceuticals, foods, textiles, fuels, consumer products, and elec\u00ad tronic and cryogenic materials. Chemical engineers also serve society in improving the environment by reducing and eliminating pollution. The undergraduate curriculum in Chemical Engineering builds on basic courses in chemical engineering, other branches of engineer\u00ad ing, and electives which provide a strong background in humanities and human behavior. Elective programs developed by the student with a faculty advisor may include such areas as applied chemistry, biochemical engineering, chemical reaction engineering, chemical processing, environmental engineering, materials science, process control systems engineering, and biomedical engineering.

Since the beginning of history, materials have played a crucial role in the growth, prosperity, security, and quality of human life. In fact, materials have been so intimately related to the emergence of human culture and civilization that anthropologists and historians have identified early cultures by the name of the significant materi\u00ad als dominating those cultures. These include the stone, bronze, and iron ages of the past. At the present time, the scope of materials science and engineering has become very diverse; it is no longer confined to topics related to metals and alloys but includes those rel\u00ad evant to ceramics, composites, polymers, biomaterials, n.anostruc\u00ad tures, intelligent materials, and electronic devices. In addition, pre\u00ad sent activities in materials science and engineering cover not only areas whose utility can be identified today, but also areas whose utility may be unforeseen. The services of materials scientists and UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 216 UCI 2006-07 The Henry Samueli School of Engineering engineers are required in a variety of engineering operations deal\u00ad ing, for example, with emerging energy systems, design of semi\u00ad conductors and optoelectronic and nano devices, development of new technologies based on composites and high-temperature super\u00ad conductivity, biomedical products, performance (e.g., quality, relia\u00ad bility, safety, energy efficiency) in automobile and aircraft compo\u00ad nents, improvement in nondestructive testing techniques, corrosion behavior in refineries, radiation damage in nuclear power plants, and fabrication of advanced materials. The undergraduate major in Material Science Engineering (MSE) provides students with a thorough knowledge of basic engineering and scientific principles. The undergraduate curriculum in MSE includes: (a) a core of Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics; (b) basic Engineering courses; (c) Materials and Engineering core; and (d) technical courses in Materials Science, Engineering, and Sciences. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of MSE and its intimate relations with other Engineering disciplines (Aerospace, Biomed\u00ad ical, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Environmental, and Mechanical Engineering), qualified students will be able to satisfy in a straightforward manner the degree requirements of their Engi\u00ad neering major and the MSE major.

It serves a variety of processing industries whose vast array of products include chemicals, petroleum products, plas\u00ad tics, pharmaceuticals, foods, textiles, fuels, consumer products, and electronic and cryogenic materials. It also serves society to improve the environment by reducing and eliminating pollution. Chemical engineering is an engineering discipline that has its strongest ties with the molecular sciences. This is an important asset since sciences such as chemistry, molecular biology, biomedi\u00ad cine, and solid-state physics are providing the seeds for future technologies. Chemical engineering has a bright future as the disci\u00ad pline which will bridge science with engineering in multidisciplinary environments. Biochemical Engineering is concerned with the processing of bio\u00ad logical materials and processes that use biological agents such as living cells, enzymes, or antibodies. Biochemical Engineering, with integrated knowledge of the principles of biology and chemical engineering, plays a major engineering role in the rapidly develop\u00ad ing area of biotechnology. Career opportunities in Biochemical Engineering are available in a variety of industries such as biotech\u00ad nology, chemical, environmental, food, petrochemical, and pharma\u00ad ceutical industries. The principle objectives of the graduate curriculum in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering are to develop and expand students' abilities to solve new and more challenging engineering problems and to promote their skills in independent thinking and learning in preparation for careers in manufacturing, research, or teaching. These objectives are reached through a program of course work and research designed by each student with the assistance, advice, and approval of a primary faculty advisor and a faculty advisory committee. Programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering are offered. Chemical Engineering and Materials Science 217 MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two plans are available for the M.S. degree: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Opportunities are available for part-time study toward the M.S. degree. Students who enter the program with a B.S. degree in chemical engineering must take at least six graduate-level courses (22 units), while students who enter without undergraduate preparation in chemical engineering are required to take three to five additional prerequisite courses (Mathematics 105A-B-C and Engineering CBEMS40B, CBEMSllO, CBEMS112, and CBEMS120A). A detailed program of study for each entering student is formulated in consultation with a faculty advisor and must be approved by the graduate advisor. Plan 1: Thesis Option The thesis option requires completion of 38 units of study (eight of which can be taken for study in conjunction with the thesis research topic); the completion of an original research project; the writing of the thesis describing it; and successful defense of the thesis. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Option The comprehensive examination option requires a minimum of 36 quarter units in approved courses, at least 28 of which must be from graduate courses in the 200 series in Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and back\u00ad ground of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with an advisory com\u00ad mittee which takes into consideration the objectives and prepara\u00ad tion of the candidate. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. There are no specific course requirements, but there are several milestones to be passed: acceptance into a research group by the faculty advisor, successful completion of the Ph.D. preliminary examination, formal advancement to candidacy in the third year (second year for students who entered with a master's degree) by passing the qualifying examination which assesses the candidate's preparation for research and evaluates the proposed original research, successful completion of the research, and presentation and successful defense of the dissertation. There is no foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement. Ph.D. students have to meet departmental research requirements as a research assistant or equivalent, with or without salary. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years (four years for stu\u00ad dents who entered with a master's degree. The maximum time per\u00ad mitted is seven years. Graduate Study in Materials Science and Engineering 0 Materials Science and Engineering focuses on the development of new materials and new applications for materials in engineering.

Electives Faculty advisors should be consulted on the selection of elective courses. All graduate courses offered in CBEMS are potential elec\u00ad tives. Graduate-level courses offered in other Engineering depart\u00ad ments and relevant graduate courses from other schools may also be taken as electives. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE The M.S. degree reflects achievem~nt of an advanced level of com\u00ad petence for professional practice of materials science and engineer\u00ad ing. Two options are available: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Plan 1: Thesis Option For the M.S. thesis option, students are required to complete a research study of great depth and originality and obtain approval for a complete program of study. A committee of three full-time faculty members is appointed to guide development of the thesis. A minimum of 36 units is required for the M.S. degree. For the thesis option, at least 21 units must be taken from courses num\u00ad bered 200-289, among which 15 units are from MSE core courses and at least six units are from elective courses approved by the graduate advisor. Up to eight units of 296 and up to eight units of undergraduate elective courses can be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. Full-time graduate students must enroll in the depart\u00ad mental seminar each quarter unless exempt by petition. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Option For the comprehensive examination option, students are required to complete 36 units of study and a comprehensive examination. At least 24 units must be taken from courses numbered 200-289, among which 15 units are. from MSE core courses and at least nine units are from elective courses approved by the graduate advisor. Up to eight units of undergraduate elective courses can be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. Full-time graduate students must enroll in the departmental seminar each quarter unless exempt by petition. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. degree in Materials Science and Engineering requires a commitment on the part of the student to dedicated study and col\u00ad laboration with the faculty. Ph.D. students are selected on the basis of outstanding demonstrated potential and scholarship. Applicants must hold the appropriate prerequisite degrees from recognized institutions of high standing. After substantial preparation, Ph.D. candidates work under the supervision of faculty advisors. The process involves extended immersion in a research atmosphere and culminates in the production of original research results presented in a dissertation. Milestones to be passed in the Ph.D. program in order to remain in good standing include the following: acceptance into a research group by the faculty advisor at the end of the stu\u00ad dent's first y'ear of study; successful completion of the Ph.D. pre\u00ad liminary examination by the end of the second year; preparation for pursuing research and the development of a research proposal culminating in passing the Qualifying Examination by the end of the third year of the Ph.D. program. Students must advance to can\u00ad didacy in their third year (second year for students who entered with a master's degree). The course requirements for the Ph.D. are the same as for the M.S. Students must enroll in the departmental seminar each quarter unless exempt by petition. However, most Ph.D. students take sev\u00ad eral courses beyond the M.S. degree requirements. The preliminary examination is based on the five core courses for the M.S. Students who have completed an MSE M.S. degree elsewhere must have a written approval by the graduate advisor to waive required MSE core courses, if they have taken the equivalent courses elsewhere. Final examination involves the oral presentation and defense of an acceptable dissertation in a seminar attended by students and fac\u00ad ulty. The Ph.D. degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years (four years for stu\u00ad dents who entered with a master's degree). The maximum time per\u00ad mitted is seven years. Relationship of M.S. and Ph.D. programs. Students applying with the objective of a Ph.D. are admitted to the M.S./Ph.D. pro\u00ad gram only if they are likely to successfully complete a Ph.D. pro\u00ad gram. These students do not formally reapply to the Ph.D. program after completing the M.S. degree. Students who apply to the M.S.\u00ad only program must formally apply for the Ph.D. program if they UC IRVINE - 2006-2007desire to continue on for a Ph.D. Financial support is usually reserved for those students who plan to complete the Ph.D. The normal time to complete M.S. and Ph.D. degrees is two and five years, respectively.

Civil Engineering is described as the art of sustainably harnessing the great powers of nature for the use and convenience of human beings. The success of this endeavor is evident all around us. The inhospitable arid plain which greeted the early settlers in Southern California has been transformed into a thriving regional commu\u00ad nity largely by the application. of civil engineering. The goal of the Civil Engineering curriculum is to prepare graduates for a career in practice, research, or teaching. At the undergraduate .level a common core of fundamental subjects is provided, and stu\u00ad dents are required to specialize in their senior year. Specializations are offered in General Civil Engineering, Environmental Hydrol\u00ad ogy and Water Resource Engineering, Structural Engineering, and Transportation Systems Engineering. Concentrations are offered in Computer Applications, Engineering Management, Infrastructure Planning, and Mathematical Methods. Graduate opportunities are in three major thrust areas: structural analysis, design, and reliabil\u00ad ity; transportation systems engineering; and water resources and environmental engineering. The career opportunities in civil engineering are varied as in any other discipline. Graduates may look forward to long-term careers in major corporations, public bodies, the military, private consult\u00ad ing firms, or to being self-employed in private practice. History has shown a civil engineering education to be a good ground for many administrative and managerial positions. Environmental Engineering involves designing environmental pro\u00ad tection or remediation strategies for multiple resources-water, air, and soil, often with combinations of physical, chemical, and bio\u00ad logical treatment methods in the context of a complex regulatory framework. The goal of the Environmental Engineering curriculum is to pre\u00ad pare graduates with a strong basic science background, particularly in chemistry and biology, and to provide students with a broad exposure to several environmental engineering science disciplines. Courses relating to transport processes, water quality control, air quality control, and process design are included in the core. Career opportunities in environmental engineering are diverse. Graduates generally find careers related to pollution control and the remediation of air, water, and soil environments. Undergraduate Major in Civil Engineering Program Educational Objectives: Graduates of the program will (1) be knowledgeable of the historical context, the state-of-the-art, and emerging issues in the field of civil engineering and its role in contemporary society; (2) demonstrate critical reasoning and requi\u00ad site quantitative skills to identify, formulate, and resolve civil engi\u00ad neering problems, and to create designs that reflect economic, environmental, and social sensitivities; (3) display a systems view\u00ad point, critical thinking, effective communication and interpersonal skills, a spirit of curiosity, and conduct reflecting a professional and ethical manner; (4) exhibit a commitment to lifelong learning and professional development, involvement in professional activity and public service, and achievement of professional licensure; (5) reflect a broad intellectual training for success in multidisciplinary professional practice, in civil engineering or diverse related careers, and toward achieving leadership roles in industry, govern\u00ad ment, and academia. (Program educational objectives are those aspects of engineering that help shape the curriculum; achievement . Civil and Environmental Engineering 223 of these objectives is a shared responsibility between the student and UCI.) The curriculum provides the opportunity to obtain a firm founda\u00ad tion in engineering science and to develop the techniques of analy\u00ad sis and design, which are basic for the successful practitioner. Emphasis is placed on developing problem-solving skills. ADMISSIONS High School Students: See page 197. Transfer Students. Preference will be given to junior-level appli\u00ad cants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of calculus and either one year of calculus-based physics (mechanics, electric\u00ad ity, and magnetism with laboratory), plus one semester of chem\u00ad istry (with laboratory) or one year of chemistry (with laboratory) plus one semester of engineering physics (mechanics with labora\u00ad tory); and three additional approved courses for the major. Students are encouraged to complete as many of the lower-division degree requirements as possible prior to transfer.

Graduate Study in Civil Engineering Civil Engineering addresses the technology of constructed environ\u00ad ments and, as such, embraces a wide range of intellectual endeav\u00ad ors. The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering focuses its graduate study and research program on three areas: \u00b7 structural and geotechnical engineering, including aspects of soil mechanics, structural dynamics, earthquake engineering, and relia\u00ad bility and risk assessment; transportation systems engineering, including traffic operations and management, advanced informa\u00ad tion technology applications, travel behavior, and transportation systems analysis; and water resources and environmental engineer\u00ad ing, including hydrology, water resources, contamination manage\u00ad ment, and pollution control technologies. The Department offers the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Civil Engineering. Students may also pursue M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering through The Henry Samueli School of Engineering graduate con\u00ad centration in Environmental Engineering. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE The M.S. degree reflects achievement of an advanced level of com\u00ad petence for the professional practice of civil engineering. Two plans are available to those working toward the M.S. degree: a the\u00ad sis option and a course work option. Opportunities are available for part-time study toward the M.S. degree. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 226 UCI 2006-07 The Henry Samueli School of Engineering Plan I: Thesis Option The thesis option requires completion of 36 units of study (eight of which can be taken for study in conjunction with the thesis research topic); the completion of an original research project; the writing of the thesis describing it; and presentation of the thesis research findings in a public seminar. Of the 36 units, a minimum of 20 units must be in nonresearch, graduate-level courses. Plan II: Course Work Option The course work option requires the completion of 36 units of study, at least 30 of which must be in nonresearch graduate-level courses. The remaining six units may be earned as graduate-level course work, individual research, or upper-division undergraduate units. \u00b7 Concurrent Master's Degree Pr9gram with Planning, Polley, and Design The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and the Department of Planning, Policy, and Design (PPD) in the School of Social Ecology offer a concurrent degree program that allows students 'to earn both a master's in Civil Engineering (M.S.) and a master's in Urban and Regional Planning (M.U.R.P.) in two years (instead of in more than three years). The concurrent degree program requires 72 units of study and is organized around two tracks: (1) transportation systems, and (2) environmental hydrology and water resources. The program core comprises 15 graduate courses for the transportation systems track,.\u00b7imd 13 graduate and two undergraduate courses for the environmental hydrology and water resources track. Students choose between a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. The thesis option requires completion of 72 units of study (eight of which may be taken in conjunction with the thesis research); completion of an original research project and the writing of a thesis to describe it; completion of required core courses; and completion of enough units of approved electives to meet the total requirement of 72 units. The comprehensive exami\u00ad nation option also requires completion of 72 units of study as well as a professional report, which represents a substantial piece of planning practice, as the capstone event. These units of study include core courses and enough units of approved electives to meet the total requirement of 72 units, with no redundancy of core courses in either CEE or PPD. Electives may include as many as eight units of independent study or approved undergraduate courses. Undergraduates seeking admission to the concurrent master's degree program should have a strong record of course work in dis\u00ad ciplines related to .civil engineering and urban planning, and they must meet the requirements for admission in both departments. For more information about these requirements, see http://www.eng. uci.edu/cee/grad/requirements, and http://www.seweb.uci.edu/ ppd/adniissions.uci. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. degree indicates attainment of an original and significant research contribution to the state-of-the-art in the candidate's field, and an ability to 'communicate advanced engineering concepts. The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and back\u00ad ground of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is forinulated in consultation with a faculty advisor who takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate. The program of study must be approved by the faculty advisor and the Graduate Advisor of the Department. \u00b7 There are no specific course requirements. Within this flexible framework, the School maintains specific guidelines that outline the milestones of a typical doctoral program. All doctoral students should consult the Civil Engineering program's guidelines for details, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty; early assessment of the student's research potential (this includes a preliminary examination), research preparation, formal advancement to candidacy by passing the qualifying examination in the third year(second year for stu\u00ad dents who entered with a master's degree), completion of a signifi\u00ad cant research investigation, and the submission and oral defense of an acceptable dissertation. There is no foreign language require\u00ad ment. Ph.D. students have to meet departmental research require\u00ad ments as a research assistant or equivalent, with or without salary. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years (four years for students who entered with a master's degree). The maximum time permitted is seven years. THE INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES The Institute of Transportation Studies at Irvine (ITS) is part of a multicampus research unit of the University of California. Several faculty studying transportation systems engineering in the Depart\u00ad ment of Civil and Environmental Engineering participate in the Institute. Students choosing to focus their studies in transportation will find strong interdisciplinary opportunities between the Depart\u00ad ment and ITS. See the Office of Research section of the Catalogue for additional information. THE URBAN WATER RESEARCH CENTER The Urban Water Research Center focuses on five integrating water issues in urban areas: (1) supply, demand, and distribution; (2) water quality; (3) urban ecology; (4) water reuse; and (5) institu\u00ad tions and public policy. In each of these areas the Center eriables the issues to be addressed in an integrated way from the biological and earth, economical, engineering public policy, and public health points of view. The Center is the collaborative effort of the Depart\u00ad ment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, the Department of Earth System Science, and the School of Social Ecology.

Electrical and Computer Engineering is a broad field encompassing such diverse subject areas as computer systems, distributed com\u00ad puting, computer networks, control, electronics, photonics, digital systems, circuits (analog, digital, mixed-mode, and power electron\u00ad ics), communications, signal processing, electromagnetics, and physics of semiconductor devices. Knowledge of the mathematical and natural sciences is applied to the theory, design, and imple\u00ad mentation of devices and systems for the benefit of society. The Department offers two ABET-accredited undergraduate degrees: Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. The Department also offers a joint undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering, in conjunction with the Donald Bren School of Infor\u00ad mation and Computer Sciences; information is available in the Interdisciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue. Some electrical engineers focus on the study of electronic devices and circuits that are the basic building blocks of complex electronic systems. Others study power electronics and the generation, trans\u00ad mission, and utilization of electrical energy. A large group of elec\u00ad trical engineers studies the application of these complex systems to other areas, including medicine, biology, geology, and ecology. Still another group studies complex electronic systems such as automatic controls, telecommunications, wireless communications, and signal processing. Computer engineers are trained in various fields of computer sci\u00ad ence and engineering. They engage in the design and analysis of digital computers and networks, including software and hardware. Computer design includes topics such as computer architecture, VLSI circuits, computer graphics, design automation, system soft\u00ad ware, data structures and algorithms, distributed computing, and computer networks. Computer Engineering courses include pro\u00ad gramming in high-level languages such as C++ and Java; use of software packages for analysis and design; design of system soft\u00ad ware such as compilers, debuggers, and operating systems; and application of computers in solving engineering problems. Labora\u00ad tories in both hardware and software experiences are integrated within the Computer Engineering curriculum. The undergraduate curricula in Electrical Engineering and Com\u00ad puter Engineering provide a solid foundation for future career growth, enabling graduates' careers to grow technically, adminis\u00ad tratively, or both. Many electrical and computer engineers will UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 232 UCI 2006-07 The Henry Samueli School of Engineering begin work in a large organizational environment as members of an engineering team, obtaining career satisfaction from solving mean\u00ad ingful problems that contribute to the success of the organization's overall goal. As their careers mature, technical growth most natu\u00ad rally results from the acquisition of an advanced degree and further development of the basic thought processes instilled in the under\u00ad graduate years. Administrative growth can result from the develop\u00ad ment of management skills on the job and/or through advanced degree programs in management. Graduates of Electrical and Computer Engineering will find a vari\u00ad ety of career opportunities in areas including wireless communica\u00ad tion, voice and video coding, biomedical electronics, circuit design, optical devices and communication, semiconductor devices and fabrication, power systems, power electronics, computer hard\u00ad ware and software design, computer networks, design of computer\u00ad based control systems, application software, data storage and retrieval, computer graphics, pattern recognition, computer model\u00ad ing, parallel computing, and operating systems. Undergraduate Major in Computer Engineering Program Educational Objectives: Graduates of the program will (1) demonstrate the successful practice of, or accomplish advanced study in, computer engineering, including its scientific principles, rigorous analysis, and creative design; (2) have a broad-based knowledge of relevant, state-of-the-art and emerging issues in engi\u00ad neering with emphasis on computer engineering, demonstrated through productive careers in public or private sectors, or the attain\u00ad ment of advanced degrees; (3) demonstrate skills for effective com\u00ad munication and responsible teamwork, show professional attitudes and ethics suitable for a multidisciplinary working environment, and engage in lifelong learning. (Program educational objectives are those aspects of engineering that help shape the curriculum; achieve\u00ad ment of these objectives is a shared responsibility between the stu\u00ad dent and UCI.) The undergraduate Computer Engineering curriculum includes a core of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Engineering courses in fundamental areas fill in much of the remaining curriculum. ADMISSIONS High School Students: See page 197. Transfer Students. Preference will be given to junior-level appli\u00ad cants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of calculus, one year of calculus-based physics (mechanics, electricity, and magnetism with laboratory), one course in computational methods (C, C++), and two additional approved courses for the major. Students are encouraged to complete as many of the lower-division degree requirements as possible prior to transfer.

The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering offers two undergraduate B.S. degree programs: one in Mechanical Engi\u00ad neering and the other in Aerospace Engineering. M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering are also offered. Mechanical engineers design, manufacture, and control machines ranging from robots to aircraft and spacecraft, design engines and power plants that drive these machines, analyze the environmental impact associated with power generation, and strive to promote environmental quality. To achieve their goals, mechanical engineers use mathematics, physics, and chemistry together with engineering science and technology in areas such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, dynamics, controls, and atmospheric science. Mechanical Engineering students at UCI learn the problem-solving, modeling, and testing skills required to contribute to advances in modern technology. Mechanical Engineering undergraduates complete required courses that provide engineering fundamentals and technical electives that allow students to study particular areas of interest. Specializations are available in: Aerospace Engineering, Energy Systems and Envi\u00ad ronmental Engineering, Flow Physics and Propulsion Systems, and Design of Mechanical Systems. Independent research opportunities allow students to pursue other avenues for focusing their studies. Aerospace Engineering deals with all aspects of aircraft and space\u00ad craft design and operation, thus requiring the creative use of many different disciplines. Aerospace engineers work on the forefront of technological advances and are likely to be leaders in scientific discoveries. The undergraduate curriculum in Aerospace Engineering includes courses in subsonic and supersonic aerodynamics, propulsion, controls and performance, light-weight structures, spacecraft dynamics, and advanced materials. In the senior capstone course, students work in teams on the preliminary design of a commercial jet transport. Career opportunities for Aerospace Engineering graduates are in the broad range of aerospace industries, including manufacturers of aircraft, spacecraft, engines, and aircraft/spacecraft components; makers of aircraft/spacecraft simulators; and government research laboratories. Undergraduate Major in Aerospace Engineering Graduates of the program will have the professional and scientific education that allows them to be successful as career engineers and in the most demanding graduate programs. Specifically, they will (1) demonstrate a fundamental understanding of the analytical tools and physical models that provide the foundation of engineer\u00ad ing science and allow the analysis, modeling, and problem solving in aerodynamic, structural, thermal, mechanical, control, and envi\u00ad ronmental processes; (2) use design principles, and synthesize and creatively combine such principles, with engineering science for successfully confronting current research and practical systems, and their sustainability, in aerospace engineering; (3) exhibit a sys\u00ad tems view, critical thinking, and an ability to effectively communi\u00ad cate, work within teams, and assume leadership roles; (4) practice ethical responsibilities; and (5) innovate, keep current with respect to technological change, move beyond traditional aerospace engi\u00ad neering disciplinary boundaries, and improve their skills through a lifelong process of learning. The undergraduate Aerospace Engineering curriculum includes a core of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Engineering courses in fundamental areas constitute much of the remaining curriculum. ADMISSIONS High School Students: See page 197. Transfer Students. Preference will be given to junior-level appli\u00ad cants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of calculus, one year of calculus-based physics (mechanics, electricity, and magnetism with laboratory), one course in general chemistry (with laboratory), and two additional approved courses for the major. Students are encouraged to complete as many of the lower-division degree requirements as possible prior to transfer. Students who enroll at UCI in need of completing lower-division course work may find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degrees.

Graduate Study in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering The Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering faculty have special interest and expertise in four thrust areas: continuum mechanics; power, propulsion, and environment; micro/nanomechanics; and systems and design. Continuum mechanics faculty study the physics of fluids, physics and chemistry of solids, and structural mechanics. Areas of empha\u00ad sis in fluid mechanics include incompressible and compressible turbulent flows, multiphase flows, chemically reacting and other nonequilibrium flows, aeroacoustics, aerooptics, and fluid-solid interaction. In the field of solid mechanics, resear.ch and course work emphasize theoretical and computational approaches which contribute to a basic understanding of and new insight into the properties and behavior of condensed matter. General areas of interest are large-strain and large-rotation inelastic solids, constitu\u00ad tive modeling, and fracture mechanics. Computational algorithms center on boundary element methods and the new class of meshless methods. Studies in structural mechanics involve the analysis and synthesis of low-mass structures, smart structures, and engineered materials, with emphasis on stiffness, stability, toughness, damage tolerance, longevity, optimal life-cycle costs and self-adaptivity. Research in power, propulsion, and environment encompasses aerospace propulsion, combustion and thermophysics, fuel cell technologies, and atmospheric physics and impacts. In aerospace propulsion, particular emphasis is placed in the areas of turboma\u00ad chinery, spray combustion, combustion instability, innovative engine cycles, and compressible turbulent mixing. The topic of combustion and thermophysics addresses the fundamental fluid\u00ad dynamical, heat-transfer, and chemical mechanisms governing cbmbustion in diverse settings. Fuel cell research encompasses the development of fuel-cell technology, hybrid engines, and thermionic devices. Activities cover the thermodynamics of energy systems, the controls associated with advanced energy systems, and systems analyses. The area of atmospheric physics and impacts deals with the modeling and controlling of chemical pollution, par\u00ad ticle dispersion, and noise emission caused by energy-generation and propulsion devices. Research on atmospheric turbulence addresses the energy exchanges between theEarth's land and ocean surfaces and the overlying atmosphere. Micro/nanomechanics encompasses the thrusts of miniaturization engineering, mechatronics, and biotechnology. Miniaturization engineering is relevant to the development of small-scale mechani\u00ad cal, chemical and biological systems for applications in biotechnol\u00ad ogy, automotive, robotic, and alternative energy applications. It involves the establishment of scaling laws, manufacturing methods, materials options and modeling from the atom to the macro sys\u00ad tem. Mechatronic design is the integrated and optimal design of a mechanical system and its embedded control system. Main focus research is the design, modeling, and characterization of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS). Particular emphasis is placed on analysis and design of algorithmic methods and physical systems that realize sensor-based motion planning. The thematic area of biotechnology involves the understanding, modeling, and application of fundamental phenomena in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and chemistry towards the development of bio-sensors and actuators. Systems and design research Is conducted in the areas of dynamic systems optimization and control, biomechanical engineering, robotics and machine learning, and design engineering. Advanced concepts in optimization and control are applied to the areas of biorobotics, flight guidance, learning systems, micro sensors and actuators, flexible structures, combustion, fuel cells, and fluid-opti\u00ad cal interactions. Biomechanical engineering integrates physiology with engineering in order to develop innovative devices and algo\u00ad rithms for medical diagnosis and treatment. The focus of robotics and machine learning is the creation of machines with human-like intelligence capabilities for learning. Faculty in design engineering develop methodologies to address issues ranging from defining the size and shape of components needed for force and motion specifi\u00ad cations, to characterizing performance in terms of design parame\u00ad ters, cost and complexity. Aerospace engineering research\u00b7 efforts combine specialties from each of the four thrust areas toward the design, modeling, and operation of complex systems. The Department offers the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two plans are available to pursue study toward the M.S. degree: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Opportuni\u00ad ties are available for part-time study toward the M.S. degree. The Plan of Study for both options must be developed on consultation with a Faculty Advisor and approved by the Department Graduate Advisor. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Plan 1: Thesis Option The thesis option requires completion of 36 units of study; the completion of an original research project with a Faculty Advisor, the writing of the thesis describing it; and approval of the thesis by a thesis committee. This plan is available for those who wish to gain research experience or as preparation for study toward the doctoral degree. To complete the required 36 units, students must complete 24 units in graduate courses numbered MAE200-289, 9 units of MAE296, and 3 units of MAE298. With the approval of the Department Graduate Advisor, three courses in the MAE200-289 range may be replaced by technical or scientific graduate courses in other departments and up to one senior-level technical or scientific undergraduate course in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering or other departments. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Option The comprehensive examination option requires completion of 36 units of study, 33 units of which must be from graduate courses numbered MAE200-289, and 3 units of which must be MAE298. With the approval of the Department Graduate Advisor, four courses in the MAE200-289 range may be replaced by technical or scientific graduate courses in other departments and up to two \u00b7 senior-level technical or scientific undergraduate courses in MAE or other departments. In addition, up to 6 units in the MAE200-289 range may be replaced by an equal number of units of MAE294, which includes execution and documentation of a research or design project. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The doctoral program in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering is tailored to the individual needs and background of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with a faculty advisor who takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate. Within this flexible framework the Department maintains specific guidelines that outline the milestones of a typical doctoral pro\u00ad gram. All doctoral students should consult the Departmental Ph.D. guidelines for program details, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty; comple\u00ad tion of six non-research courses beyond M.S. degree requirements; passage of a preliminary examination or similar assessment of the student's background and potential for success in the doctoral pro\u00ad gram; course work; meeting departmental teaching requirements, which can be satisfied through service as a teaching assistant or equivalent; research preparation; formal advancement to candidacy in the third year (second year for students who entered with a mas\u00ad ter's degree) through a qualifying examination conducted on behalf of the Irvine division of the Academic Senate; development of a research proposal; completion of a significant research investiga\u00ad tion, and completion and defense of an acceptable dissertation. There is no foreign language requirement. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Students enrolled in the Ph.D. program must take a full-time load (minimum of 12 units). The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years (four years for students who entered with a master's degree). The maximum time permitted is seven years. Before seeking admission, Ph.D. applicants are encouraged to communicate directly and in some detail with prospective faculty , sponsors. The student's objectives and financial resources must coincide with a faculty sponsor's research interests and research support. Financial aid in the form of a teaching assistantship or fellowship may not cover the period of several years required to complete the program. During the balance of the period the student will be in close collaboration with the faculty research advisor.

At the core of the educational mission of the humanities is the goal of imparting to students critical tools of analysis, ways of seeing, knowing, explaining, describing, and understanding, that will allow them to comprehend the world around them, Consider some of the challenges that we all face: the pressures created by demographic change, rapid economic expansion, and increased ethnic and cul\u00ad tural diversity; the development of new technological forms, partic\u00ad ularly those related to computers and the Internet; and the increas\u00ad ingly complex problem of human interaction with the environment Equipping students to understand and analyze such phenomena is precisely what a liberal education in the humanities accomplishes. In the words of a \"Manifesto for the Humanities,\" prepared for the President of the University of California, it is humanities that pro\u00ad vide \"the ability to express oneself clearly and accurately; the skill of critical evaluation, both of ideas and actions; the courage to make choices based on shared values and priorities; the opportu\u00ad nity to conduct an intensive conversation with the traditions, pre\u00ad sent and past, that help make us who we are, and above all, who we will be; and as a result, the ability to understand and make sense of other people and their cultures,\" Humanistic inquiry is in no way isolated from the \"real world,\" cordoned off in some ivory tower; rather its central goal is to equip students to enter into that real world as critically thinking citizens. Because language is the humanist's essential tool and the tradi\u00ad \u00b7tional medium of historical record, philosophical speculation, and literary creation and criticism, the School of Humanities places special emphasis on language and training in composition. The campuswide Writing Program is housed in the School of Humani\u00ad ties, as are our distinguished programs in creative writing and the Program in Academic English/English as a Second Language. The School of Humanities also offers programs in over a dozen foreign languages, both classical and modern, and requires that its majors take two years or the equivalent of foreign language study. The pursuit of critical literacy involves analyzing and understand\u00ad ing our immediate culture, and one way to do this is through the study of foreign languages and the cultural systems they entail. We rarely scrutinize or analyze something we know as intuitively as our native language, yet it is by means of this language that we organize and express our thoughts. The \"foreignness\" of a foreign language permits us to objectify an entire linguistic system, to observe its structure and its usage, and then to make comparisons with our own linguistic situation. The knowledge of one's native language, gained by this kind of comparative observation, is the foundation of critical reflection on texts of any nature-historical, philosophical, literary, political, legal, scientific, or other. Serious study of a foreign language is, therefore, crucial to any university education that aims at fostering critical thinking and objective self\u00ad reflection. In 2001, the School established the International Center for Writing and Translation, which sponsors research programs that address the importance of \"conversations\" among languages. A crucial part ofthe School's curriculum is the Humanities Core Course, which integrates the study of philosophy, literature, film and the arts, and history along with !ower-division writing. Inter\u00ad disciplinary studies are also an essential feature of the Humanities Honors Program and programs in Film and Media Studies, Com\u00ad parative Literature, Global Cultures, Religious Studies, and Humanities and Arts. The Department of Asian American Studies and the Interdisciplinary Programs in African American Studies, Latin American Studies, and Women's Studies are also located in the School. With faculties that draw on the Social Sciences as well, these programs are excellent examples of how the Humanities reaches across the boundaries of disciplinary knowledge. Students majoring in the humanities are particularly well-prepared for careers in all fields in which analysis, judgment, and argument are important Humanities students have moved into business, the law, education, politics, public policy, academia, and journalism. Employers in all sectors are placing increasing emphasis on the recruitment of college graduates who can write and think. These skills are ultimately more important to many employers than a spe\u00ad cific form of technical training, and it is these skills that are imparted most effectively in the School of Humanities. For stu\u00ad dents who leave the School with a solid grounding in critical analysis, research, and communication, the sky is the limit DEGREES African American Studies .........................................................

HUMANITECH\u00ae 170 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-7445 World Wide Web: http://www.humanities.uci.edu/humanitech HumaniTech's mission is to work with Humanities faculty and graduate students in the discussion, incorporation, problem solving, and facilitation of technology in their teaching and research. This mission is accomplished through a variety of functions: (1) educa\u00ad tion and outreach for Humanities faculty through faculty workshops, one-on-one consultations, and group consultations; (2) research, collection, and dissemination of information on intellectual property rights; particularly in digital formats; (3) sponsorship of annual teaching colloquia; (4) sponsorship of annual lecture series on intellectual issues regarding the intersection of humanities and technology; (5) liaison with the Humanities bibliographers in the coordination of both the School's and the Library's efforts to sup\u00ad port technologically qased instruction and research; (6) liaison with the UC system's online library (CDL, or California Digital Library); and (7) liaison with the various technological arms of the UCI campus, such as NACS (Network and Academic Computing Services), the Instructional Resource Center, and EEE (the Educa\u00ad tional Electronic Environment). HUMANITIES CENTER 175 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-3638 World Wide Web: http://www.humanities.uci.edu/hctr/ Michael Szalay, Director The Humanities Center fosters intellectual dialogue between the faculty and students of UCI and the communities of Orange County and beyond. Its goals are to promote a wide range of inter\u00ad disciplinary work in the humanities, and to facilitate the sharing of that work with audiences within and beyond the disciplinary units that it represents. The Center works to fulfill these goals by award\u00ad ing grants to Humanities faculty and graduate students for research in the humanities; coordinating and sponsoring lectures, confer\u00ad ences, and other events on\u00b7campus; and distributing a quarterly e-newsletter to faculty, graduate students, and alurrmi of the School of Humanities. HUMANITIES INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCE CENTER AND COMPUTING FACILITY The Humanities Instructional Resource Center (HIRC) and the Humanities Computing Facility (HCF) share space in Humanities Hall and provide comprehensive technology support for instruc\u00ad tion, research, and faculty and staff development. HIRC and HCF also serve as the center for innovative technology-mediated instruc\u00ad tion within the School of Humanities. HIRC services and facilities include video and audio libraries and audiovisual equipment. HCF includes the computer laboratories, fee-based laser printing, video editing, support for wireless net\u00ad working in the Humanities quad, and computing consultation.

HUMANITIES OUT THERE (H.O.T.) PROGRAM 168 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-9735 Julia Reinhard Lupton, Director H.O.T. is an outreach program between UCI's School of Humani\u00ad ties and local schools. The program consists of a series of five\u00ad week workshops on selected topics in the humanities. Each quarter, there are at least 15 workshops on topics such as U.S. Literature, World Literature, U.S. History, and World History. Each workshop sends out a team of five or more undergraduates to a K-12 class\u00ad room, supervised by faculty and advanced graduate students in the humanities. Requirements for undergraduates include: attending at least five training sessions at UCI; attending at least five tutoring sessions at a local school; a number of electronic journal entries; and a three\u00ad to five-page paper with an academic focus. Undergraduates can earn two units of H.O.T. credit each quarter through Humanities 195. INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR WRITING AND TRANSLATION 179 Humanities Instructional Building World Wide Web: http://www.hnet.uci.edu/icwt Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Director Established in 2001, the International Center for Writing and Translation (ICWT) in the UCI School of Humanities fosters writ\u00ad ing, translation, and criticism in multilingual and international con\u00ad texts. It links existing faculty research interests in cultural literacy to general discussions about linguistic and cultural issues relevant to the diverse, multiethnic, and multilingual student population at UCI and the population of California more generally. The Center's programs are premised on the principle that knowledge is a result of reciprocal contact and linkages based on equality and respect. In this model, The Center is dedicated to highlighting and supporting literary works, languages, performance, and oral traditions of cul\u00ad tures that span the globe. The following goals are integral to the general mission of the Cen\u00ad ter: (1) supporting writers working in various languages and diverse genres, including creative nonfiction, through grants and fellowships; (2) fostering research and discussion of the theory, practice, aesthetics, and politics of translation, broadly conceived; (3) supporting translations of work of literary merit; (4) sponsoring conferences, workshops, and public fora on writing and translation, as well as reading and performances; and (5) supporting activities of UCI faculty, students, and the surrounding community involving the far-reaching themes of cultural and media literacy and cross cultural transposition. The Center is a partner of the International Institute of Modern Letters at Las Vegas. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 252 UCI 2006-07 School of Humanities DR. SAMUEL M. JORDAN CENTER FOR PERSIAN STUDIES AND CULTURE 4800 Berkeley Place; (949) 824-1662 World Wide Web: http://www.humanities.uci.edu/persianstudies/ Daniel Schroeter, Acting Director The Dr. Samuel M. Jordan Center for Persian Studies and Culture serves as a resource for the research, instruction, and study of Per\u00ad sian history and culture. The Center was made possible through the generosity of Dr. Fariborz Maseeh and The Massiah Foundation. Undergraduate Programs HUMANITIES UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 143 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-5132 World Wide Web: http://www.humanities.uci.edu/undergrad/ Jill Robbins, Associate Dean In addition to 23 majors and 28 minors, the School also offers a formal concentration in Medieval Studies and courses in Arabic, Hebrew, Italian, Persian, Portuguese, Tagalog, and Russian. The academic counselors in the Humanities Undergraduate Coun\u00ad seling Office, located in 143 Humanities Instructional Building, help all students in planning a program of study. Transfer students in particular need to consult an academic counselor to determine major requirements. Students who expect to pursue graduate study also should consult with appropriate faculty members to ensure proper preparation. The academic counselors assist freshmen and sophomores who are interested in the humanities but who have not chosen a major in the School. They are especially knowledgeable about University regulations, requirements in and outside the School, course con\u00ad tent, options to major, and other matters that may present difficul\u00ad ties. For the first two years, students in Humanities are encouraged to explore the various disciplines represented in the School. During that time the academic counselors are prepared to help the unde\u00ad clared student keep options to a major open, plan a coherent pro\u00ad gram of humanistic study, and reach an eventual decision about the major. Generally each major stipulates a one-year course that is both an introduction to the discipline and a prerequisite to the major itself. Students who plan wisely will construct programs that include a good number of such courses. NOTE: In many undergraduate courses in the School of Humani\u00ad ties, additional meetings between individual students and the instructor may be required. Many courses are composed of both lectures and required discussion sessions. Undergraduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on com-\u00b7 mittees of various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, by participating as mentors for new Humanities majors, and by working as peer academic advisors in the Undergraduate Counseling Office. Humanities Peer Mentor Program The Humanities Peer Mentor Program is designed to address some of the academic, cultural, and social needs of disadvantaged stu\u00ad dents in the School of Humanities. The program features two\u00ad tiered mentoring, with successful upper-division students mentor\u00ad ing small groups of new students, and the student mentors in turn working with faculty and staff. Another focus of the program is to encourage and assist student mentors to go on to graduate school. Participants attend workshops on topics such as study skills, library research, time management, and careers, as well as take part in a . variety of social events, and keep journals in which they express their ideas and raise issues for their mentors. Call (949) 824-5132 for additional information. HUMANITIES HONORS PROGRAM 143 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-5132 Victoria A. Silver, Director The Honors Program of the School of Humanities is a two-y~ar, upper-division program designed to challenge superior students from all fields by providing special opportunities for interdiscipli\u00ad nary work within an intellectually charged framework. Small semi\u00ad nars and the opportunity for independent research are some of the advantages offered by the program, which is open by invitation to all UCI students regardless of their majors. Students in the program benefit from their involvement in the cam\u00ad pus community of Humanities scholars. They enjoy a close rela\u00ad tionship with the faculty and profit from intense interaction with their intellectual peers. A comprehensive advising program involv\u00ad ing Honors faculty advisors as well as specially trained Honors peer advisors ensures that Humanities Honors students continually receive tiniely, individualized advice about their academic careers. Formal as well as informal gatherings, including student-organized social activities ranging from coffee hours to theater parties, aug\u00ad ment a wide range of campus activities. Humanities Honors students have the opportunity to become some of the campus' best informed scholars on a broad range of topics: from artificial intelligence to medical ethics, from Shakespeare to Gilbert and Sullivan, from problems of the ancient Near East to the dilemmas of modernity. Humanities Honors students complete a two-part course\u00b7of study. In their junior year, students take three quarters of an interdiscipli\u00ad nary Proseminar (Humanities H120) organized about a single topic or problem, such as crime and punishment, the other, the develop\u00ad ment of religion in the West, the self, nature, or the American dream. The sequence is designed to compare and contrast modes of analy\u00ad sis and critical thinking in history, literary studies, and philosophy. In a small seminar setting, students are encouraged to become reflective about their own chosen disciplines. In their senior year, students take a sequence beginning in the fall with a Senior Honors Seminar (Humanities H140), and continuing in the winter and spring with the Senior Honors Thesis (Humani\u00ad ties H141) and the Senior Honors Colloquium (H142), prepared as an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member on a topic chosen by the student. Students present their theses in an informal gathering with their faculty advisors in the spring, and a prize is awarded for the year's outstanding thesis. In both sequences the Honors students benefit from their close association with exceptional scholars and the challenge and sup\u00ad port of their intellectual peers. Students interested in learning how the Humanities Honors Pro\u00ad gram will fit into their regular courses of study are encouraged to contact the Senior Academic Counselor in Humanities; telephone (949) 824-5132. CAMPUSWIDE HONORS PROGRAM The Campuswide Honors Program is available to selected high\u00ad achieving students from all academic majors from their freshman through senior years. For more information contact the Campus\u00ad wide Honors Program, 1200 Student Services II; telephone (949) 824-5461; e-mail: honors@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www. honors.uci.edu/. UC IRVINE 2006-2007HUMANITIES INTERNSHIP PROGRAM 166 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-1392 World Wide Web: http://www.humanities.uci.edu/intern/ Jill Robbins, Director The Humanities Internship Program is designed to bring highly qualified Humanities majors together with public sector employers and nonprofit companies in the Orange County area who are look\u00ad ing for employees with excellent skills in writing and communica\u00ad tion. Local employers who participate in the program believe that Humanities students' education in critical thinking, writing, com\u00ad munication, and analysis equip them to be successful employees in their firms. Interns are placed for the academic year and preceding summer, working 10-15 hours a week for hourly salaries of $10. (No course credit is earned.) Employers offer committed supervisors to student interns, and interns are involved in a meaningful aspect of the firm's ongoing business. The internship relationship can become the basis for long-term employment with the firm. Interns participate in quarterly meetings with a program coordina\u00ad tor at UCI to discuss their work experiences and benefit from one another's insights. At the end of each quarter of the internship, the student provides an assessment of the experience. The program coordinator also conducts on-site visits with the interns and their supervisors. The Internship Program is open to all Humanities majors who are in good academic standing and will have completed at least two quarters of academic work at UCI as a Humanities major by the end of the quarter in which they are selected for the program. Only students who will have completed the Humanities Core Course (or the Core Course substitution) by the end of that quarter will be eligible. Applications are available online and in the Humanities Undergrad\u00ad uate Study Office, 143 Humanities Instructional Building, in mid\u00ad to late-winter quarter. The deadline for submission of all applica\u00ad tion materials is early April. CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION The Center for International Education, which includes the Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program (EAP) and the International Opportunities~ Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of the many worldwide opportunities that exist for study, work, internship, vol\u00ad unteering, and research. School of Humanities majors and minors can benefit from a broader perspective of their fields by studying for one year at a university in such countries as China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, or the United Kingdom through EAP. Students can also augment their exposure to other cultures with programs sponsored through lOP. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue or an academic counselor for additional information. FOREIGN LANGUAGE PLACEMENT AND PROGRESSION The following policies apply to all UCI students taking foreign lan\u00ad guage courses. Foreign Language Progression. Within the beginning and inter\u00ad mediate foreign language instructional sequences (lA-B-C and 2A\u00ad B-C, and for Latin and Greek, 1A-B-C and lOOA or lOOB), stu\u00ad dents must earn a grade of C or better in order to advance to the next level of instruction. Humanities 253 Foreign Language Placement. Placement tests are required for the following languages: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (for students with no previous college course work), and Vietnamese. Contact the UCI Testing Office for information; telephone (949) 824-6207; e-mail: testoff@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www. testingoffice.uci.edu/. Placement tests are recommended but not required for German and French language courses. The purpose of placement testing is to ensure success in UCI language courses. For other foreign languages, students entering UCI with previous high school foreign language training are placed as follows: in gen\u00ad eral, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school foreign language will normally enroll in 1B-, 1C-, 2A-, or 2B-levellanguage courses, respectively. Students who opt to \"go back\" one quarter will earn credit (i.e., a student with three years of high school foreign language may opt to take lC instead of 2A). If it has been five or more years since the last high school course, the student may begin at 1A for credit. Exceptions must have the approval of the appropriate course director and the Associate Dean, Undergraduate Study. Transfer students will not receive credit for repeating at UCI foreign language courses for which they received credit upon matriculation to UCI even if they are placed by testing into the equivalent of a previously taken course. Of specific note for Humanities majors, once a student begins instruction in a foreign language, the student must complete each course in the sequence until the requirement is satisfied. If any course is skipped, the student will be required to complete an addi\u00ad tional course beyond the 2C level in order to meet the School of Humanities foreign language requirement. Humanities majors must also take all required levels of language for a letter grade. If any course is taken Pass/Not Pass, the student will be required to complete an additional course beyond the 2C level for a letter grade in order to meet the School of Humanities f<;>reign language requirement. Foreign Language Advanced Placement Credit. Students cannot earn units or grade points at UCI in courses from which they have been exempted on the basis of Advanced Placement credit. How\u00ad ever, since Advanced Placement awards a maximum of 8 units for scores of 4 and 5, students may elect to take 2C or the equivalent for credit. Native Speakers of Languages Other Than English. A native speaker of a foreign language, defined by the University as some\u00ad one who attended the equivalent of secondary school in another country where the language of instruction was other than English, may be exempted from taking third-year language study in that language for some majors offered by the School of Humanities. In this case, the student must substitute appropriate upper-division courses in the major to replace the number of exerript~d courses. For example, if a native speaker of French is exempted from French lOOA and lOOB, that student must replace those two courses with two other upper-division French courses offered by the Department of French and Italian. Repeating Deficient Foreign Language Grades. First-and sec\u00ad ond-year foreign language courses and third-year foreign language composition courses are sequential and each is prerequisite to the next. This is generally true also of fourth-year Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Students wishing to repeat a deficient grade in one of these courses must repeat it prior to continuing on to the next level of the language. A student may not take a lower-level course for credit once a more advanced level has been completed with a pass\u00ad ing grade. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 254 UCI 2006-07 School of Humanities REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59.:...(54. School Requirements Satisfactory completion of the following, which must be taken for letter grades: Humanities IA-B-C, taken in the freshman year*; two years of work in a single acceptable foreign language, either modern or classical (through 2C), or equivalent competence; quar\u00ad terly consultation with an assigned advisor and the advisor's written approval for the program of study decided upon. *Transfer students in all majors in the School of Humanities, except Asian American Studies, may substitute for the Humanities Core Course appropriate course work in English composition, liter\u00ad ature, history, and philosophy, as described on the School of Humanities Web site at http://www.humanities.uci.edu/undergrad/ requirements/core_alt.html. See the Asian American Studies sec\u00ad tion for specific information about substitution courses for this major. Maximum Overlap Between Major Requirements: Students completing double majors within the School of Humanities may count no more than two departmental/major requirements for both majors simultaneously (i.e., a double major in Comparative Litera\u00ad ture and Spanish can count only two upper-division Spanish litera\u00ad ture courses for both majors). Maximum Overlap Between Major and Minor Requirements: Students completing majors and minors within the School of Humanities may count no more than two departmental/major requirements for both a major and a minor. No course may be counted for two minors. Normal Progress in the Major: School of Humanities majors are expected to take at least one course required for their major pro\u00ad gram each quarter as well as make progress toward the completion of the School's foreign language requirement. School Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for each major must be completed successfully at UCI. Completion of a minor program is optional; however, forcer\u00ad tification in a minor, at least four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. See individ\u00ad ual major and minor requirements for specific courses and how participation in the Education Abroad Program (EAP) can affect the residence requirement. Exceptions are considered on a case-by\u00ad case basis and decided in consultation with the appropriate depart\u00ad ment or faculty member. Off-campus Internship Policy. In most cases, Humanities students are not allowed to earn credit for off-campus internships. However, if a department or program determines that the internship is acade\u00ad mically appropriate and promotes the student's academic goals, the student may take the internship as Independent Study and credit will be given. A maximum of four units total may be earned for internships; how\u00ad ever, the units may not be counted toward the student's major requirements. (No credit is given for paid internships, such as those offered through the Humanities Internship Program.) The sponsoring department or program and the instructor will in all cases require a substantial academic product, such as a paper, growing out of the internship. A student who wishes to seek approval for an unpaid off-campus internship and earn course credit must file an Independent Study form with the Humanities Undergraduate Study Office prior to beginning the internship. Change of Major. Students who wish to change their major to one offered by the School of Humanities should contact the Humanities Undergraduate Counseling Office for information about change-of-major requirements, procedures, and policies. Information is also available at http://www.due.uci.edu/Change_of_Major.html. Graduate Programs HUMANITIES GRADUATE STUDY AND RESEARCH 172 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-4303 Cecile Whiting, Associate Dean The School offers a wide program of graduate degrees. Although the Master's degree is offered in most departments, the programs emphasize the Ph.D. and give distinct preference in admission to those students who intend to take that degree. An exception is the two-year Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing). In addition to the seminars offered by the various departments, the School sponsors a number of interdisciplinary seminars annually. These courses are taught by faculty members from various depart\u00ad ments. Further, several departments offer a few students the oppor\u00ad tunity to do part of their work for the Ph.D. in a related discipline. A limited number of students are accepted annually to study for teaching credentials. This program is a cooperative effort between the School and the UCI Department of Education. Graduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School by serving on committees of the various departments and sitting with the faculty in its meetings.

The program's curriculum encourages students to investigate the African American experience from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and theoretical approaches. Among the topics explored in the course offerings are the process of colonization and the forced migration of African people, the positionality of African people in the racialized symbolic and social orders of the western hemisphere, the rhetoric produced by and about African people, and the cultural and aesthetic values associated with \"blackness\" and \"Africanness.\" The Program offers a B.A. degree program in African American Studies and a minor. Descriptions for courses offered by the departments are available in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue and on the Program Web site at http://www.hnet.uci.edu/afarnl. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES UCI graduates with a B.A. degree in African American Studies enhance their chances of success in the job market and in the highly competitive arena of graduate and professional school admissions, especially in the fields of medicine and other health professions, law, and business.

Art History is the study of works of art and other visual artifacts from all regions of the world and all periods of history. Consequently, the undergraduate curricu\u00ad lum in Art History, with its global perspective, is one of the most diverse disciplines in the humanities. Through Art History students learn how to describe and interpret a range of objects including sculpture, painting, photography, architecture, and so-called \"new media\" such as video or performance art. These skills, along with the program's intense focus on writing and verbal expression, pre\u00ad pare students to think critically and to express themselves clearly at a time when visual communication is becoming ever more important. Because works of art are always created within a larger cultural context, Art History courses are a good way to understand what other places or times were like. Students may explore, for example, ancient Greece, nineteenth-century Japan, or even the twenty-first century United States. Majors in Art History are thus welcome to take related courses in other fields of the humanities. Students are encouraged to pursue the study of language beyond the minimum requirements, and because of its international per\u00ad spective, Art History is a particularly good major for students interested in studying abroad. There are many study centers throughout the world associated with the University's Education UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Abroad Program. Special scholarships are available for \u00b7the Pacific region program. CAREERS FOR THE ART HISTORY MAJOR Following their graduation, students with a B.A. in Art History have found employment in art galleries, auction houses, and muse\u00ad ums, and they have entered graduate programs with a view to careers in university teaching, curatorial work, and art conserva\u00ad tion. Moreover, with its strong emphasis on developing critical skills in writing, speaking, and analysis, Art History also provides an excellent preparation for many other careers. UCI graduates have pursued professional paths ranging from medicine and law, to business and education, to information technologies and architec\u00ad ture. As in the case of arts administration or intellectual property law, some of these professional pursuits have depended on and continue to make use of training in the arts. \u00b7 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64.

The Department is committed to a twofold purpose: (1) disseminating interest in and knowledge of Classical Civilization through the teaching of Greek and Latin lan\u00ad guage and literature; and (2) helping students, through courses in Classical literature, history, civilization, mythology, and religion taught through English translations, to appreciate the achievements of Greek and Roman culture and their pervasive influence on our own civilization. The Department offers both a major in Classics (with an emphasis on Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and a major in Classical Civiliza\u00ad tion in which most of the required courses are in English transla\u00ad tion. Students are encouraged to consult with the Classics faculty regarding the appropriate choice of major and design of their programs. For the Classics major, study of the Classics must be based on competence in both Greek and Latin. The Classics program is designed to provide the student with this competence as rapidly as possible, so that by the end of first-year Greek or Latin the student has already been introduced to some of the major Classical authors in the original language. From then on, courses are devoted. to reading and interpreting the literature of ancient Greece and Rome. In addition to their training in the languages, students increase their knowledge of the literature, history, and thought of the ancient world through the close study of some of its finest writers .. The major in Classical Civilization is designed for students who do not plan to concentrate on the Classical languages or pursue gradu\u00ad ate study in the Classics, yet wish to obtain an undergraduate UC IRVINE - 2006-2007degree based on a sound knowledge of the Classical world. This major requires one year of study (or its equivalent) in either Greek or Latin and a minimum of I 0 courses taught in English translation concerning such topics as Classical literature, civilization, history, archaeology, art, drama, and philosophy. Students entering UCI with previous Greek or Latin training can be given advanced standing. Usually, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school Latin (or Greek) will enroll in Latin (or Greek) 1B, 1C, and 100A or 100B, respectively. Place\u00ad ment may vary, depending on the extent of the student's prepara\u00ad tion. Students with transfer credit for Greek and/or Latin may not repeat those courses for credit. Students with high school training in the Classical languages are encouraged to consult with the Clas\u00ad sics faculty before enrolling in Classics courses. The Department adheres to the policy of giving its students an opportunity to participate in the departmental decision-making process. Student representatives, elected from and by the under\u00ad graduate majors, participate in all open departmental meetings. Representatives are responsible for maintaining close liaison with their constituency, for representing the students' interest in curricu\u00ad lum and personnel matters, and for the evaluation of both the acad\u00ad emic program and the academic staff. Inquiries regarding language placement, prerequisites, planning a program of study, or other matters related to the Department's offerings should be directed to the Office of the Chair, Humanities Office Building II, telephone (949) 824-6735. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59--64. School Requirements: See page 254. Foreign Language Placement and Progression: See page 253. Departmental Requirements for Majors Two separate majors: Classics (with an emphasis in Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and Classical Civilization. Classics (Greek emphasis): Classics 36A, B, C; six upper-division courses in Greek 100-1 04; Greek 11 0; three upper-division courses in Latin 100-104. Greek .120 may be substituted for Greek 100-104. Classics (Latin emphasis): Classics 37A, B, C; six upper-division courses in Latin 100-104; Latin 110; three upper-division courses in Greek 100-104. Classics (Linguistics emphasis): two possible plans of study. Greek concentration-six upper-division courses in Greek 100-104; three upper-division courses in Latin 100-104; Linguistics 3, 10, 20, 170 (Greek 120 recommended) or Latin concentration-six upper-division courses in Latin 100-104; three upper-division courses in Greek 100-104; Linguistics 3, 10, 20, 170. Classical Civilization: Latin (or Greek) I A-B-C, or equivalent; Classics 36A, B, Cor 37 A, B, Cor 45A-B-C; five upper-division Classics courses; two additional upper-division courses in related fields such as Classical history, Classical philosophy, or Classical art. These two courses may be taken in another UCI department. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper-divi\u00ad sion courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for Minors The Department offers minors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilization. Greek: Greek 1A-B-C; six upper-division courses in Greek 100-104. Greek 120 may be substituted for one course at the 100 level. Classics 263 Latin: Latin 1A-B-C; six upper-division courses in Latin 100-104. Classical Civilization: Classics 36A, B, C or 37 A, B, C or 45A\u00ad B-C; five upper-division Classics courses, one of which may be in a related field such as history, art history, or philosophy. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, providing course content is approved in advance by the appropriate department chair. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The Department believes in close consultation with students on academic advising and program planning. Students planning to major (or minor) in Classics or Classical Civilization are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty at the earliest possi\u00ad ble moment to learn about the various programs. Subject-Matter Preparation Program in Latin. (NOTE: Due to changes in State requirements, this program is under revision. Contact the Humanities Undergraduate Study Office for program status.) The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC)-approved subject-matter preparation program in Latin is designed to provide the prospective teacher with rigorous training in all aspects of the Latin language and culture. First and foremost is language competency: students are required to take four years of college-level Latin or the equivalent. Emphasis is placed upon the acquisition of firm grammatical understanding, as expert mastery of Latin grammar enables a teacher to use inductive approaches to Latin learning as well as more traditional methods. In addition, stu\u00ad dents are required to complete the historical/cultural survey class, Classics 37 A, B, C, in order to gain an understanding of the history and culture of Rome in its Mediterranean context. Students\u00b7are also asked to take several upper-division Classical Civilization classes on Roman topics in order to deepen their understanding of ancient Rome. Because vocabulary-building skills are now often taught along with Latin, students are required to take Classics 5, an ety\u00ad mology class. Through Linguistics 3, students gain a theoretical understanding of the nature of language. Classics 201 provides stu\u00ad dents with an introduction to the use of technology in the class\u00ad room by focusing upon electronic resources in Classics; it enables students to utilize these resources in teaching, to construct Web pages, and to integrate multimedia tools into the classroom. For students with undergraduate degrees from other institutions, some substitutions for these requirements are permitted. Every effort is made to work with the student's previous undergraduate training. Specific course requirements are available in the Classics Depart\u00ad ment. Students interested in completing the subject-matter program in Latin are encouraged to contact the Undergraduate Advisor in the Classics Department or a Department of Education advisor. The Department of Classics encourages students to take advantage of educational opportunities abroad while making progress toward their UCI degree. Classics and Classical Civilization majors and minors can benefit from a broader perspective of the field by study\u00ad ing for periods ranging from one quarter to one year at any number of universities all over the world through the UC Education Abroad Program. Students can also augment their exposure to Greek, Latin, and Classical civilizations by studying for a summer or during the academic year in Greece or Italy at programs sponsored by other academic institutions through the International Opportunities Pro\u00ad gram. See the Department of Classics Undergraduate Program Director for additional information. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES The study of the ancient world is a valuable possession for modern life. The discipline of Classics is an important part of a well\u00ad rounded education. Greek and Latin language and literature, his\u00ad tory and philosophy, mythology and religion make an excellent UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 264 UCI 2006-07 School of Humanities basis for exploring all periods of Western culture down to tbe pre\u00ad sent ~ay. Classics is an interdisciplinary study; exploring human culture by a variety of methods from a variety of points of view. For this reason, the student who chooses to major in Classics or Classical Civilization may find many professional opportunities open. Graduate and professional schools in medicine, law, management, and other fields welcome students with training in Classics. So do many business corporations. Business, industry, and technology are well acquainted with the value of an education in Classics. They are aware that students with a strong background in a respected and challenging major such as Classics are disciplined thinkers who can express themselves in clear, coherent, and cogent lan\u00ad guage, capabilities that are considered valuable in future physi\u00ad cians, lawyers, and managers. There are also specific vocational opportunities open to the gradu\u00ad ate in Classics or Classical Civilization. A major in this field may lead to a career in high school teaching, or (after appropriate fur\u00ad ther study) in college or university teaching. It is also an excellent preparation for advanced study in other academic disciplines such as archaeology, history, comparative literature, philosophy, and lin\u00ad guistics, as well as for theological studies and for work in a wide range of tbe humanities and socia:J sciences. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques.

Students accepted into the program may enroll at any of tbe three campuses, but normally apply for admission through UCI, which is the main location for instruction and administration. Applications are reviewed by an admissions committee composed of faculty members from all three campuses. The goal of the program is to provide a graduate education that unites the main currents of modem literary, cultural, and social-sci\u00ad entific theory with the traditional skills and methodologies of clas\u00ad sical philology. Candidates for degrees are expected to exhibit facility in Greek and Latin, competence in research, including the\u00ad oretical approaches to texts and objects, technical mastery of com\u00ad puting for research and teaching, and experience in teaching. These goals are realized thro).lgh the four core courses (Classics 200A-B\u00ad C and 201) and seminars (Classics 220). All entering students are admitted into the Ph.D. program. With the exception of those granted advanced standing because they hold the M.A. degree in Classics from another institution, entering stu\u00ad dents may be awarded an M.A. along the way, however, the M.A. degree is not requisite for the Ph.D. requirements. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Master of Arts in Classics The requirements for the M.A. degree are two years (six quarters) of course work, passage of a special set of examinations, and com\u00ad pletion of a Master's paper. M.A. students must successfully com\u00ad plete a minimum of 12 approved, seminar-level courses. The nor\u00ad mal course load is three 200-level courses each quart~r distributed as follows: nine quarters of Classics 220; three quarters of Classics 200A-B-C, and 201; a fourth quarter may be substituted for a Clas\u00ad sics 220. Up to one quarter of Classics 290 for research and writ\u00ad ing of the Master's paper may be substituted for a Classics 220. If remedial work is required in Greek or Latin, with the Graduate Advisor's approval, one enhanced upper-division Greek or Latin course (enrolled as a Classics 280) may be substituted for a Clas\u00ad sics 220. With the Graduate Advisor's approval, M.A. students may substitute one external graduate seminar in a relevant area outside of Classics (at any of the three participating campuses) for a Classics 220. A reading knowledge of either German, French, Italian, or an equivalent language, demonstrated by examination or other means, is also required. At the end of a student's M.A. stud\u00ad ies, a positive vote of the program faculty is necessary for continu\u00ad ation in the Ph.D. program. The expected time for completion of the M.A. degree is two years. Doctor of Philosophy in Classics The requirements for the Ph.D. degree are three years (nine quar\u00ad ters) of course work. Minimum course requirements are four quar\u00ad ters of Classics 200A-B-C, and 201; 12 quarters of Classics 220; two external graduate seminars, from departments or programs out\u00ad side of Classics. These may be taken from the offerings of any of the three campuses. Students may take up to two quarters of enhanced upper-division Greek or Latin courses (enrolled as 280s) in place of Classics 220s with permission of the Graduate Advisor if remedial work is required in Greek or Latin. Where appropriate, in the third year of course work, a second Classics 200A, B, or C, may be substituted for a 220. Classics 280, Independent Study (supervised research), may be substituted for Classics 220s only with the permission of the Graduate Advisor. \u00b7up to 12 equivalent graduate-level courses completed elsewhere may be substituted for Tri-Campus Program courses with approval of the Joint Executive Committee. Classics 280 may be used, normally in the fourth year, to provide time to work on the Greek and Latin reading lists and to prepare for Qualifying Examinations, but these courses do not count toward the required 18 courses. Students are encouraged to take courses and seminars in relevant areas outside the program at any of the three campuses. At this stage, and during the fourth year of study, students are expected to have read extensively in the pri\u00ad mary texts, in literary history and theory, and in ancient history. In addition, experience in supervised teaching and/or research activity is normally required. In order to qualify as a candidate for the Ph.D. and enter the dissertation stage, a student must pass a set of seven qualifying examinations, including Greek and Latin transla\u00ad tion, Greek and Roman history, history of Greek and Roman litera\u00ad ture, a \"special area\" that can be fulfilled by either an extensive research paper or by a three-hour written examination, and an oral examination administered by the candidacy committee to be taken only after the other examinations have been passed. Ph.D. students must also demonstrate reading proficiency in one modern research language (normally German and French or Italian) by the end of their second year either through appropriate course work or by examination. Proficiency in a second modern research language is expected by the end of the third year. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is four years. The normal time for com\u00ad pletion of the Ph.D. is six years, and the maximum time permitted is seven years. The facilities, course offerings, programs, and individual faculty mentorship of all three campuses are available to students in the Classics 265 UC Tri-Campus Graduate Program in Classics. In addition, pro\u00ad gram resources are enhanced through a cooperative teaching arrangement among the Tri-Campus Program and the Classics graduate program at UC Los Angeles and at the University of Southern California. Thesaurus Linguae Graecae\u00ae The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae\u00ae (TLG\u00ae) is a research center at UCI. TLG\u00ae has created a digital library of Greek literature, a unique resource for research in Greek literary and linguistic stud\u00ad ies. Although administratively separate, TLG\u00ae is closely affiliated with the Department of Classics. Information is available in the Office of Research section of this Catalogue.

Because it does not limit study by nation, language: period, or medium, Comparative Litera\u00ad ture tends to orient itself by defining and analyzing questions. Hence, Comparative Literature emphasizes theoretical approaches (critical theory, political theory, feminism, psychoanalysis, and more) and produces new theories. Areas in which the Department UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 268 UCI 2006-07 School of Humanities of Comparative Literature offers courses include postcolonial stud\u00ad ies, comparative American studies, critical theory, film studies, rhetoric, and queer theory. CAREERS FOR THE COMPARATIVE LITERATURE MAJOR The study of Comparative Literature trains students to do indepen\u00ad dent research, learn languages, and think and write analytically, always in an international context. This helps qualify majors for careers in education, international relations, law, government, com\u00ad munications, or journalism, and for graduate study in the humani\u00ad ties, education, or law. An undergraduate degree in Comparative Literature is widely taken to indicate intellectual ambition. Undergraduate Program Comparative Literature offers a major and a minor. The major focuses on the study of literature and culture from around the globe and across historical periods. While students in Comparative Literature study novels, plays, films, and poems written in English, emphasis is placed on works originally in other languages. Most of these will be studied in translation; to ensure that students have the experience of encountering another culture from the inside, how\u00ad ever, two upper-division courses must be taken in literature or cul\u00ad ture in an original language other than English. Another key com\u00ad ponent of the program is the study of critical theory, or the methods required to think about works analytically and philosophi\u00ad cally. Comparative Literature is well suited for students interested in international issues, the history of inter-and cross-cultural con\u00ad tact, and the ways in which literatures and cultures dialogue with one another across time and space. Most Comparative Literature classes are small and intimate and emphasize student discussion. The Department also sponsors meetings and activities for majors so that students can get to know one another. The Comparative Literature 50A, B, C series introduces students to a geographically and chronologically broad selection of works not limited to the western tradition. This series studies literatures and cultures in dialogue and in a historically intensive way, and through the lenses of genre and medium. Transfer students may be required to take one or more courses in this sequence, depending on the courses they have taken previously. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: See page 254. Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Major CL courses, two of which must be Comparative Literature courses and two of which may be drawn from Compara\u00ad tive Literature, English, Creative Writing, or upper-division literature courses in a foreign language (in addition to any such courses used to fulfill the Comparative Literature foreign language requirement). Competence in\u00b7a foreign language sufficient for reading and under\u00ad standing literature and culture in that language, fulfilled by two upper-division courses in literature or culture in that language. NOTE: One upper-division course in literature or culture in transla\u00ad tion may substitute for one upper-division course in a foreign lan\u00ad guage. If this option is taken, students are usually required to match language and literature (e.g., if the student's foreign lan\u00ad guage is German, then the student must rake a course in German literature or culture in translation). Some languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Viet\u00ad namese, ordinarily require three years of language study for compe\u00ad tence. Students who wish to study these languages may take three years of language training and one approved upper-division course in literature or culture of that language in translation in order to ful\u00ad fill the major's language requirement. Here again, literature and lan\u00ad guage should be matched. Students who have completed two years of Greek or Latin fulfill this requirement as well. In both cases, the second year covers literary texts and thus meets the requirement for doing advanced work in these languages. If the student intends to go on to graduate work, the study of a second foreign language is highly recommended. Study abroad through the UC Education Abroad program is encouraged. Residence Requirement for the Comparative Literature Major: ~R 100A, CL 101, and three upper-division literature courses must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Minor CL language literature course in the origi\u00ad nal language or a third year of languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese. Residence Requirement for the Comparative Literature Minor: Four upper-division courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program, providing course content is approved by the appropriate program advisor or chair. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The Department offers close consultation for academic planning. All students should plan courses of study with faculty advisors. Students who wish to pursue double majors, special programs, or study abroad are urged to seek advising as early as possible. Graduate Program Comparative Literature faculty are particularly equipped to guide students in critical theory, postcolonial studies, and comparative American studies. Comparative Literature is engaged with disci\u00ad plines such as psychoanalysis, rhetoric, political theory, narrative theory, and gender studies, and many small seminars in these fields are offered. The M.A. degree is considered to be a step toward the Ph.D.; only students intending to complete the doctorate are admit\u00ad ted to the program. Applicants must hold a B.A. or equivalent degree and should normally have majored in Comparative Litera\u00ad ture, English, or a foreign literature. Majors in other disciplines (e.g., philosophy, history, visual studies, women's studies, ethnic studies) will be considered, provided that a sufficient background in literary and cultural studies and in at least one foreign language is demonstrated. The Department offers a track in (1) Comparative Literature with an emphasis in a literary tradition, (2) Comparative Literature with an emphasis in Translation Studies, and (3) Comparative Literature with an emphasis in Critical Theory. (See the departmental gradu\u00ad ate student handbook for a description of these emphases.) Gradu\u00ad ate students in Comparative Literature may also complete an emphasis in Chinese Language and Literature, Classics, East Asian \u00b7 Cultural Studies, French, German, Japanese Language and Litera\u00ad ture, or Spanish. Emphases in Asian American Studies, Feminist Studies, and Critical Theory are available through the School of Humanities. Within these emphases, students enroll in sequences of courses that highlight individual interests and expertise. In con\u00ad sultation with advisors, students may also develop individualized curricula that cut across these and other offerings in the Depart\u00ad ment and School. A minor field specialization is recommended. This optional com\u00ad ponent promotes engagement with a field or methodology outside UC IRVINE - 2006-2007the student's specialization. It may be of a national, historical, dis\u00ad ciplinary, or methodological nature, with the student of western postmodern literary theory and forms engaging in a focused study of ancient Greek or Roman philosophy and culture, for example, or the student of East Asian languages and diasporic literatures may work in anthropology or ethnography. This optional component of the student's program may be fulfilled through course work, inde\u00ad pendent studies, or a Qualifying Examination topic. For the graduate student in Comparative Literature, proficiency in foreign languages is essential. Ability to study theoretical and liter\u00ad ary traditions in their original languages (e.g., Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, or Russian) is usually expected, and a classical language (Arabic, Greek, and Latin) is indispensable. The student's own area of specialization may require the mastery of still other languages. Competence in two foreign languages is required for the Ph.D. and is verified through examination. The Department recognizes that most of its graduate students intend to become teachers, and believes that graduate departments should be training college teachers as well as scholars-indeed, . that teaching and scholarship complement one another. Thus candi\u00ad dates for the Ph.D. are expected to acquire experience in teaching, and all Ph.D. candidates gain supervised training as part of the seminar work required for the degree. Several substantial fellowships are available to graduate students. The Schaeffer Fellowship provides $20,000 plus fees for up to two years to Ph.D. students in Comparative Literature for whom trans\u00ad lation will be a crucial element of their dissertation work. Scholars translating literary or historical texts or archival materials not pre\u00ad viously reliably available in English as part of their dissertation research are eligible. Multiple fellowships per year may be awarded. Students interested in the Schaeffer Fellowship should contact the Department prior to applying to the Ph.D. program. The Murray Krieger Fellowship in Literary Theory is intended for an outstanding entering graduate student pursuing the Ph.D. in Comparative Literature or English who demonstrates a primary interest in theory as theory relates to literary texts. A range of other fellowships is also available to students in the Department. Master of Arts in Comparative Literature Entering students are assigned a faculty advisor who usually serves as the chair of the student's M.A. examination committee (which consists of at least two other members of the faculty). Nine courses and an examination are required to complete the degree. The nor\u00ad mal academic load for both M.A. and Ph.D. candidates is three courses a quarter; teaching assistants take two courses in addition to earning credit for University teaching. Only in exceptional cir\u00ad cumstances will students be permitted to undertake programs of less than six full courses during the academic year. The M.A. examination is normally taken during the quarter in which the student completes course work. For the examination, the candidate submits an M.A. paper and a statement of purpose out\u00ad lining past and future course work and preliminary plans for the Ph.D. qualifying examination. The M.A. examination consists of a discussion of the student's paper and the statement of purpose. In practice, it resembles an extended advising session, but with partic\u00ad ularly close attention to the student's paper. Doctor of Philosophy in Comparative Literature The doctoral program in Comparative Literature prepares the stu\u00ad dent for a professional career in the research and teaching of com\u00ad parative literary and cultural studies. Some students also choose to enter professions (e.g., specialized research, nonprofit organiza\u00ad tions, international cultural exchange) in which the specialized work in a specific field indicated by an advanced degree is highly desirable. Comparative Literature 269 Normally, students who have not done graduate work at another university must complete at least 16 courses. Upon completion of the course work, the student takes a qualifying examination on six areas formulated by the student in consultation with the four fac\u00ad ulty members who make up the examination committee. The topics should combine historical breadth and some generic variety with specialization. The examination is part written, part oral, according to a formula decided by the student and the committee. The exami\u00ad nation as a whole should reflect the student's ability to work in at least two foreign languages. \" After passing the qualifying examination, the student forms a dis\u00ad sertation committee of three faculty members, formulates a disser\u00ad tation topic in consultation with them, and submits a prospectus for the dissertation along with a preliminary bibliography. Study toward the Ph.D. culminates in the dissertation. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is four years. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is seven years, and the maximum time per\u00ad mitted is nine years.

Students take a total of four years of courses in the modern language, in which comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing are stressed. Studies of texts take place throughout the curriculum: the first three years students read texts in translation and the fourth year they read in the original language. The literature-in-translation courses consist of general introductory overviews as well as more specific topics at the intermediate level for those students whose language proficiency is insufficient to cope with difficult literary texts. At the advanced level, course con\u00ad tent focuses. on reading texts in the original language and rotates among significant literary and cultural topics. In these courses, the curriculum integrates the study of East Asian literatures with theo\u00ad retical issues that shape the study of world literature in general. In this way, the student gains the dual perspectives of studying East Asian cultures on their own terms as well as recognizing the affini\u00ad ties these civilizations share with the emerging world culture. CAREERS FOR THE MAJOR Studies in East Asian languages and literatures will give the stu\u00ad dent the intensive linguistic and cultural preparation needed to pur\u00ad sue a career involving these important Pacific Rim nations. In an era in which the United States is seeking to come to grips with the challenges and opportunities presented by this vital area of the world, the training in language and literature offered by the depart\u00ad mental faculty will serve the student well in a variety of endeavors, such as international business, law, government service, journal\u00ad ism, teaching, and other careers involved with public affairs. Undergraduate studies in an East Asian language are also a valu\u00ad able preparation for those students intent upon pursuing graduate study in any field of East Asian language or culture. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. Undergraduate Program The Department offers three undergraduate majors: the B.A. degree program in Chinese Language and Literature, the B.A. degree pro\u00ad gram in Japanese Language and Literature, and the B.A. degree pro\u00ad gram in East Asian Cultures. In addition, minors are offered in Chi\u00ad nese Language and Literature and Japanese Language and Literature. East Asian Languages and Literatures 271 PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The student and the faculty advisor (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program that both fulfills the requirements of the major and covers the student's areas of interest in allied fields outside East Asian Languages and Literatures. Students who plan to enroll in a language course in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese will be placed on the basis of a written test and oral interview in the respective language, regard\u00ad less of their language background or proficiency, unless they have taken previous course work in the same language at UCI. (The number of years of high school-level study is taken into account only as a reference.) The written test is typically administered through the Testing Office; the oral interview, by the appropriate faculty, who will evaluate students' oral/aural abilities in the target language and consider results from the written placement test and any prior exposure to the language to determine their proper place\u00ad ment level. In the case of some languages, students in the first-year levels will be placed in either heritage classes (for students who have had exposure to the language in question through family ties) or non-heritage classes (for students with no exposure). The faculty encourages students who are serious about improving their East Asian language ability in reading, writing, and speaking to take advantage of opportunities to immerse themselves in the relevant language by studying abroad through the University's Education Abroad Program (EAP) or through the International Opportunities Program (lOP). Students can gain substantially from first-hand experience of the culture they have studied academically while still making progress toward their UCI degree. Programs are available for one quarter, one semester, or one year. More informa\u00ad tion is available from academic c_ounselors; see also the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: See page 254. Foreign Language Placement and Progression: See page 253. Departmental Requirements for the Majors Three separate majors: Chinese Language and Literature, Japanese Language and Literature, and East Asian Cultures. Chinese Language and Literature: Completion of Chinese 3C or equivalent; Chinese lOOA-B-C, lOlA, B, C; East Asian Languages and Literatures 190; one course dealing with the literature or cul\u00ad ture of another East Asian country; and at least four additional courses in Chinese literature, history, art history, linguistics, or comparative literature, of which one may be a lower-division East Asian course offered by the Department. Japanese Language and Literature: Completion of Japanese 3C or equivalent; Japanese guages and Literatures 190; one course dealing with the literature or culture of another East Asian country; and at least five additional courses in Japanese literature, history, art history, linguistics, or comparative literature, of which one may be a lower-division East Asian course offered by the Department. East Asian Cultures: Completion of Chinese 3C, Japanese 3C, or Korean 3C; two quarters of East Asian Languages and Literatures 155, with different topics; East Asian Languages and Literatures 190; and nine additional upper-division courses, at least three of which must pertain to a country other than the one of language specialization; up to four of these courses may b~ taken outside the Department, with the approval of the undergraduate advisor. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 272 UCI 2006-07 School of Humanities Residence Requirement for the Majors: At least five upper-divi\u00ad sion courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Students are encouraged, however, to complete up to a year of their language study in approved programs of study abroad. Requirements for the Minors Two separate minors: Chinese Language and Literature and Japan\u00ad ese Language and Literature. Chinese Language and Literature: A three-quarter sequence selected from Chinese 3A-B-C, lOOA-B-C, or lOlA, B, C; and four courses selected from the East Asian Languages and Litera\u00ad tures offerings on Chinese topics and/or the upper-division courses in Chinese. Japanese Language and Literature: Either Japanese 3A-B-C, lOOA-B, or lOlA, B, C; and four courses (or five courses, if the lOOA-B sequence has been chosen) selected from the East Asian Languages and Literatures offerings on Japanese topics and/or the upper-division lOlb fourth year jap. Residence Requirement for the Minors: A minimum of four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, providing course con\u00ad tent is approved in advance by the appropriate department chair. Graduate Program The Department offers a Ph.D. degree program in East Asian Lan\u00ad guages and Literatures, with concentrations in Chinese, Japanese, and East Asian Cultural Studies. The M.A. degree may be awarded to Ph.D. students in progress toward the doctoral degree. The graduate program emphasizes rigorous training in language and textual analysis, with equal attention given to the historical, social, and cultural dimensions of literary study. In addition to more traditional vocabularies of criticism and theory, the curricu\u00ad lum encourages exploration of recent challenges to established conceptual and methodological frameworks. The program builds on the foundation of a faculty whose research interests engage major issues in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean literature and cul\u00ad ture, while developing connections with the larger community of scholarship at UCI. Because the graduate program is designed to prepare students for both college-level teaching and advanced research, each student will be required to serve, under direct faculty supervision, as a teaching assistant in an appropriate undergraduate course offered through the Department. As noted below, one quarter's worth of this teaching may be counted as part of the required course work toward completion of the degree. Assuming that a student is enrolled full-time and enters the program with no major deficiencies in background or training, normal time needed to complete the Ph.D. degree is seven years from matricula\u00ad tion. The maximum time permitted is eight years. For students admitted with an M.A. degree or its equivalent from another insti\u00ad tution, certain course requirements may be waived upon the approval of a faculty advisory committee, with a consequent reduc\u00ad tion in normative time for completion of the Ph.D. The following graduate emphases are available: Critical Theory (see the Humanities Special Programs section); Feminist Studies (see the Women's Studies section); and Comparative Literature (see below, following the Ph.D. program requirements). MASTER OF ARTS IN EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES Students are not admitted to an M.A.-only degree program but may be granted an M.A. in recognition of progress toward the Ph.D., normally after six quarters of course work and submission of two approved seminar papers, which will serve as the M.A. examination. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES Requirements for Admission In addition to meeting the general requirements for admission to graduate study at UCI, specified by the Office of Graduate Studies, all students must present the following for review by an admissions committee composed of members of the faculty in East Asian Lan\u00ad guages and Literatures: records of prior scholastic performance, including all college transcripts; three letters of recommendation; samples of written work; and aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination. Although the Department does not require entering students to have received an undergraduate degree compa\u00ad rable to its own, it recommends as much preparation in an East Asian language as possible. It also welcomes applications from students whose language training may not be as extensive but who have shown promise in the study of related disciplines. The study of appropriate European languages is encouraged as well. General Requirements Upon admission to the program, the student is assigned a graduate advisor, in consultation with whom an advisory committee consist\u00ad ing of two additional faculty members is constituted. The student and committee plan a program of study consisting of 15 graduate courses. Before advancement to candidacy (normally after three years of graduate study), the student must have: (1) completed required course work as detailed below; (2) prepared one paper of publish\u00ad able quality; (3) completed language requirements as listed below; (4) prepared five research reports on current scholarly articles to be decided upon in consultation with the faculty advisor; and (5) passed the qualifying examinations on four topics to be selected in consultation with the faculty advisory committee no more than two quarters before the examinations are to be taken. At least one of the topics should be related directly to the student's projected area of specialization in dissertation research. Students who complete the qualifying examinations successfully are advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is four years. They then write their doctoral dissertation on a topic developed in consultation with the faculty advisory committee. Some period of study abroad, for enhancement of language proficiency and/or dissertation research, is strongly encouraged. Concentration in Chinese Course Work. Each student is required to complete: three courses from Chinese 201-204; Chinese 211A-B or 212A-B; Chinese 213A\u00ad B; Chinese 214; and seven additional courses (of which one may be in the graduate teaching program) as determined upon consulta\u00ad tion with faculty advisors. At least three of these additional courses must be taken outside the Department on a relevant topic in literary or cultural theory.

Its main literary concerns are critical, theoretical, and historical. The Department recognizes its continuing obligation to help all stu\u00ad dents write English with clarity and grace. Students are given the opportunity to participate in departmental affairs through elected representatives to departmental committees. Each quarter both undergraduate and graduate students taking classes within the Department have the opportunity to evaluate their courses and teachers. CAREERS FOR THE ENGLISH OR LITERARY JOURNALISM MAJOR The study of literature helps students express their ideas clearly, do independent research, and think analytically and imaginatively. These capabilities will help qualify majors for careers in education, law, technical writing, communications, journalism, public rela\u00ad tions, business, and management. Departmental advisors encourage their students to investigate various career options before complet\u00ad ing their undergraduate educations. For those students interested in going on for a credential in sec\u00ad ondary school teaching, UCI has a CCTC-approved single-subject\u00ad matter preparation program in English. English 277 The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. Undergraduate Program All of the Department's areas of study emphasize a variety of criti\u00ad cal approaches in the reading and criticism of literature. Two majors, as well as an emphasis in Creative Writing, are offered: English. This major seeks to introduce students to the entire range of literatures written in English, from British and American to African, Asian, and Australasian literatures. The major emphasizes the differences among historical periods and various genres, and encourages exploration of a broad range of literary theories. It also offers students the opportunity to do significant work in Creative Writing. Creative Writing is an emphasis within the English major focus\u00ad ing on the writing of poetry and fiction. The emphasis aims to encourage the creative powers of students while introducing them to the disciplines of reading and practical criticism, often in a workshop setting. Under certain circumstances, creative writing courses may partly satisfy the writing portion of the UCI breadth requirement (Category I). Literary Journalism. This major was created to meet the needs of a growing number of students who wish to read, study, and write nonfiction prose that has transcended the limits of daily journalism. This is prose that has evolved into a distinct branch of literature, prose that adopts the aims and techniques of the finest fiction. The\u00b7 program provides majors with a solid foundation in nonfiction writing and an equally solid background in areas such as literary history, which together will help make students more informed writers. Literary journalism is an emerging field of study that is known by varying names, including creative 'nonfiction, the literature of fact, and literary nonfiction. The Nieman Foundation at Harvard Univer\u00ad sity holds an annual national conference on narrative journalism; there are anthologies devoted to it; many colleges offer courses in it, or feature it as an option within their majors. UCI's program builds on existing departmental strengths: its nationally ranked pro\u00ad grams in creative writing, literature, and literary theory. Literary Journalism majors take three intensive writing seminars, and are expected to develop a portfolio of work by graduation which they can present as evidence of their skill for purposes of employment or future education. At the same time, majors are asked to take a comprehensive look at the theory, history, and context of literary journalism. Among other forms, they study and write narratives, memoirs, profiles, histories, and personal essays, in subject areas as varied as science, politics, justice, travel, sports, food, and popu\u00ad lar culture. They use as models a multitude of writers, ranging from Daniel Defoe, James Boswell, and Stephen Crane to George Orwell, John Hersey, Lillian Ross, Joseph Mitchell, Gay Talese, John McPhee, Joan Didion, Tom Wolfe, Tracy Kidder, Calvin Trillin, Hunter Thompson, Truman Capote, and Norman Mailer. While it differs from an applied journalism major that focuses pri\u00ad marily on newspaper writing, the major in Literary Journalism is excellent preparation for students planning to enter graduate pro\u00ad grams in journalism, as well as for those interested in the many careers requiring sophisticated writing skills.

PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Students should plan coherent programs of study with their faculty advisors, including undergraduate seminars, workshops and semi\u00ad nars in writing (for students choosing a Literary Journalism major or Creative Writing emphasis), and courses in allied areas outside the Department. It is possible to combine a cluster of courses in lit\u00ad erature with other majors in the sciences and social sciences, and to use an English or Literary Journalism major as preprofessional training in government, law, or medicine. Students who wish advice in planning such programs should consult both the Depart\u00ad ment and people in'their prospective professional areas. A student who intends to continue with graduate work is urged to study a second foreign language before graduation. Students are also encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity to study abroad through the Education Abroad Program. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue or an academic counselor for additional information. Subject-Matter Program in English. (NOTE: Owing to changes in State requirements, the subject-matter program in English is under revision. Please check with the Humanities Undergraduate Study Office for program status.) English majors wishing to obtain a single-subject credential in English may complete a California Commission on Teaching Credentialing (CCTC)-approved subject\u00ad matter program in English. The program can be easily satisfied in tandem with major requirements, especially with early and careful planning. Program requirements include specific courses in Eng\u00ad lish, course work in linguistics and education, in-class K-12 expe\u00ad rience, and a portfolio. Interested students should contact the Department of English for further information. Students who intend to pursue a single-subject or multiple-subject teaching cre\u00ad dential should consult the UCI Department of Education as early. as possible to ensure that they understand the departmental and State requirements. Graduate Program The Department's three principal undergraduate offerings-English and American Literature, the English major with a Creative Writ\u00ad ing emphasis, and Literary Journalism-are reflected in the gradu\u00ad ate programs, which, at this level, also involve collaboration with the Department of Comparative Literature: M.A. and Ph.D. in Eng\u00ad lish, M.A. and PlliD. in Comparative Literature, M.F.A. in English (Creative Writing)\\ and an emphasis in Creative Nonfiction within the Ph.D. degree in English. A student's courses for the M.A. and Ph.D. in English may include a specialization in American litera\u00ad ture as well. The faculty is particularly equipped to guide students with special interests in criticism and theory, an area which candi\u00ad dates\u00b7 for the Ph.D. in English or in Comparative Literature may ' stress by adding the Schoolwide Critical Theory emphasis. Appli\u00ad cants for graduate degrees in English must submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) including the Subject Test in Literature in English. Ordinarily students are not admitted to the English program unless they plan to continue, and are qualified to UC IRVINE - 2006-2007continue, to the degree of Ph.D. Students are admitted to the M.F.A. program chiefly on the basis of submitted creative work. Specific requirements for the graduate degrees will be established by consultation between members of the faculty and the candidate. First-year graduate students or candidates for the Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) plan a program with an assigned advisor; candidates for the Ph.D. plan witli an advisor and three\u00ad person committee. At the time of the M.A. examination, the Grad\u00ad uate Committee evaluates the student's graduate career up to that \u00b7point and offers advice about future prospects. Candidates for liter\u00ad ary degrees are encouraged to study philosophy, history, foreign languages and literatures, and the fine arts. Only in exceptional circumstances will students be permitted to undertake programs of less than six full courses during the acade\u00ad mic year. The normal expectation is enrollment in three courses each quarter; Teaching Assistants take two courses in addition to earning credit for University Teaching. Students who are not teach\u00ad ing should be able to complete course work in two years. The Ph.D. qualifying examination should be taken within a couple of quarters after courses are finished. The Ph.D. in English normally should be completed in seven years or less. The Department recognizes that many of its graduate students intend to become teachers, and it believes that graduate departments should be training college teachers as well as scholars-indeed, that teaching and most literary scholarship complement one another. Thus the Department has initiated a program by which all its Ph.D. candidates may gain supervised training as part of the formal semi\u00ad nar work required for the degree. M.F.A. candidates also have the opportunity to participate in this program. Candidates for the Ph.D. are expected to acquire experience in teaching. The Murray Krieger Fellowship in Literary Theory is intended for an outstanding entering graduate student who is pursuing the Ph.D. in English or Comparative Literature and who demonstrates a pri\u00ad mary interest in theory as theory relates to literary texts. A range of pther fellowships is.also available to students in the Department. Emphasis in Creative Nonfiction Students admitted to the emphasis in Creative Nonfiction must meet all course, language, and examination requirements for the Ph.D. in English. Their course work must include: (a) three writing workshops in nonfiction; (b) three courses in nonfictional literature or rhetoric; and (c) if needed for the projected dissertation, one course outside the Department. Students must also conduct a dis\u00ad sertation defense. School Emphases Schoolwide graduate emphases are available in Asian American Studies, Critical Theory, and Feminist Studies. Refer to the appro\u00ad priate sections of the Catalogue for information. ENGLISH Master of Arts in English Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate advisor who will supervise the student's program. The M.A. plan of study includes (1) the completion of course work, as advised, for three quarters or the equivalent; (2) demonstrated proficiency in reading a designated foreign language, modern or classical; and (3) the submission of materials (including a statement about work accom\u00ad plished and plans for future study, and a sample essay) to the Grad\u00ad uate Committee, who will review and assess the student's progress, recommend whether further study toward the Ph.D. is advisable, and, if so, give advice about areas for further study. The Department of English sponsors a Summer M.A. Program in English designed for teachers and returning students. The M.A. degree in English is awarded to candidates who complete 32 units of graduate course work through two consecutive summers in the English 279 program and submit an acceptable Master's essay. Applicants from outside the State of California may apply for the program. Master of Fine Arts in English The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) is a degree in creative writing. The M.F.A. degree is normally conferred upon the completion of a two-to three-year residence. Each quarter the candidate will be enrolled in either the poetry or fiction section of the Graduate Writers' Workshop, which will constitute two-thirds of a course load, the other course to be selected in consultation with the stu\u00ad dent's advisor. It is expected that M.F.A. candidates will complete at least one supervised teaching seminar. In addition to course work, the candidate is required to present as a thesis an acceptable book-length manuscript of poetry or short sto\u00ad ries or a novel. Doctor of Philosophy in English The program for the Ph.D. in English requires about two years of full-time enrollment in regular courses beyond the B.A.; profi\u00ad ciency in the reading of two acceptable foreign languages, modern or classical; satisfactory performance on designated examinations; and the dissertation. The languages acceptable depend upon the nature of the student's program as determined by the student's advisors. Reading compe\u00ad tence in one of these languages must be established in the first year of residence, and competence in the second before the Qualifying Examination. Competence in the two languages required for the Ph.D. is verified through examination. Upon completion of course work the student is examined in three areas: (I) a primary field; (2) a secondary field; and (3) theory and/or criticism. Upon satisfactorily completing this Qualifying Examination, the student is admitted to candidacy for the degree. As soon after com\u00ad pletion of the Qualifying Examination as is practical, the student presents a dissertation prospectus for the approval of the doctoral committee. The dissertation itself must also be approved by the committee, which may or may not require an oral examination on it. All work for the Ph.D. degree must be in courses limited to graduate students. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is four years. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is seven years, and the maximum time permitted is nine years.

Because Europe is both a geographical place and an idea which changes throughout history, it has had different meanings at different times and in dif\u00ad ferent places. The study of Europe thus requires an open, pluralis\u00ad tic, and interdisciplinary curriculum that takes a critical approach to the idea (or ideas) of Europe. The program provides a multidis\u00ad ciplinary view of Europe as a whole and of its historical, political, and cultural formation and global implications. It also provides a focus on a specific area of European experience that cuts across traditional disciplinary and national boundaries. Participation in an Education Abroad Program in a European country is strongly rec\u00ad ommended for all European Studies majors. Students may elect to emphasize one of the following areas: Medieval Studies, Early Modern Europe (1450-1789), Modern Europe (1789-present), Encounters with the Non-European World, British Studies, French Studies, German Studies, Italian Studies, The Mediterranean World: Past and Present, Russian Studies, or Spanish-Portuguese Studies. As an alternative, students may define their own emphasis in consultation with a program advisor and with the approval of the European Studies Advisory Board. Because there are so many emphasis options within the major, stu\u00ad dents are assigned for academic advising to members of the Euro\u00ad pean Studies Advisory Board and are required to consult with their advisor on a quarterly basis. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES A degree in European Studies prepares its graduates to enter advanced degree programs in international business, history, law, and political science. The strong academic skills and professional orientation acquired by European Studies majors are necessary to pursue successful careers in such fields as international banking, law, journalism, management, public relations, publishing, and government service. Humanities graduates in general learn to express ideas clearly, do independent research, and think analyti\u00ad cally and imaginatively-the required tools for success beyond the undergraduate career. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: See page 254.

Whether printed on roadside billboards or broadcast into our homes via television, the media greatly influence our sense of who we are and how we live. Yet so much of our exposure to the sights and sounds of film, TV, video, advertising, and new technologies is taken for granted. Those sights and sounds are so pervasive, and in many cases so enjoy\u00ad able, that we rarely pause to consider how they act upon us and how we interact with them. An undergraduate education in Film and Media Studies provides students with an opportunity to explore the appeal and to begin to understand the operation of these complex meaning-producing machines we call cinema, tele\u00ad vision, and new digital technologies, and to interrogate the inter\u00ad relationships of visual media and sound and music as forms of media. The course work for the B.A. degree program in Film and Media Studies trains students to read and understand the audio-visual lan\u00ad guages of modem media and new technologies and to analyze images from socioeconomic, political, aesthetic, and historical per\u00ad spectives. Learning these critical viewing skills involves learning new ways of seeing. The Film and Media Studies curriculum is systematic and comprehensive; upper-division courses have between 20 and 70 students and are typically taught by regular fac\u00ad ulty. During the 2005-06 academic year, there were more than 275 Film and Media Studies majors enrolled at UCI. The Department of Film and Media Studies familiarizes students with the history, theory, and art of cinema and other media. Courses focus on a range of topics, including directors, period styles, gen\u00ad res, national cinemas, the history and criticism of television, sound theory and popular music, and developments in new technologies. Additional courses offer students hands-on experience in video production and screenwriting. The program provides its majors with a thorough appreciation of the modem media's roles in con\u00ad temporary society. Regular course offerings are complemented by film and video screenings and series at the School of Humanities Film and Video Center. Film and Media Studies, in cooperation with other units at UCI, regularly invites scholars, digital artists, directors, producers, and screenwriters to campus to share their work and perspectives with students. Film and Media Studies at UCI is unique in its\u00b7concentration on the history, theory, and criticism of cinema, television, popular music and sound, and new technologies. The faculty has published books and articles on topics that include fantastic cinema, avant\u00ad garde directors, ethnographic film, film and postmodemism, horror cinema, hip-hop and cinema, television performance, and new technologies. In order to cover the extra costs generated by the purchase and rental of media and production equipment demanded by the spe\u00ad cialized Film and Media Studies curriculum, the School of Human\u00ad ities charges a laboratory fee of $20 per course to all students tak\u00ad ing Film and Media Studies courses. Film and Media Studies students can complete professional intern\u00ad ships in the fields of film, television, or digital media production, distribution, writing, and related areas for elective course credit. Film and Media Studies students also have the opportunity to spend their junior year in France studying at the Inter-University Center for Film and Critical Studies in Paris, through the Univer\u00ad sity's Education Abroad Program. Information is available both in the Film and Media Studies Office and the Education Abroad Pro\u00ad gram Office. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES A degree in Film and Media Studies will provide students with a variety of opportunities leading to a career choice or to further education at the graduate or professional level. Graduates from the program have gone on to a host of different careers. Some have pursued graduate work in critical film studies at leading institu\u00ad tions such as the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Iowa. Others have entered M.F.A. programs in pro\u00ad duction at places like the University of Southern California, UCLA, or San Francisco State University. Many are now at work in various sectors of the entertainment industry as feature film edi\u00ad tors, executives in film and video distribution companies, network television producers, and independent filmmakers. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including\u00b7 career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques.

Regosin, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Professor of French (sixteenth-century French literature) ' Undergraduate Program in French The Undergraduate Program in French offers a broad humanistic course of study designed for students in the liberal arts. The orien\u00ad tation of the program is multidisciplinary, where the study of liter\u00ad ature is linked to critical, cultural, and historical concerns. Courses reflect the faculty's interest in the related disciplines of history, philosophy, anthropology, women's studies, cultural studies, and comparative literature, and express its conviction that the study of French literature and culture is enriched by pursuing its relations with other disciplines, fields, and cultures. \u00b7 Lower-division language courses encourage students to participate in the creative process of language, to think in French as they learn to understand, speak, read, and write. These courses are taught entirely in French, and the approach to teaching stresses the inter\u00ad dependence of the four basic language skills and makes them mutually reinforcing. The Language Laboratory is used to comple\u00ad ment classroom activity. At the intermediate lower-division level, texts of contemporary lit\u00ad erary and social interest provide the focus for advanced conversa\u00ad tion, reading, and composition. After the second year, advanced courses in conversation and writing enable students to attain a greater degree of proficiency, preparing them for further study in the multidisciplinary upper-division program. All upper-division offerings are taught in the seminar mode. Because classes are limited in size, they promote and encourage participation and discussion and facilitate direct contact with professors. In the introductory courses in literature, texts are stud\u00ad ied in their historical context. The student learns to analyze and interpret different types of creative literature and is introduced to various critical concepts and vocabularies. At the more advanced level, the multidisciplinary courses bring together material and methodologies from the various disciplines in order to address interpretive problems of French literature, culture, and history. In \u00b7recent years, courses have been offered in literature and political opposition, monsters and madness in Renaissance literature, cubism in painting and poetry, ethnography and literature, French cinema, autobiography, Francophone literature, and Albert Camus and Algeria. The content of courses changes yearly according to the interests of both faculty and students. Placement examinations are not required, although an optional placement examination is available. Students will be placed in French language courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school French will be considered equal to one quarter of a UCI French course. Thus, for example, students with two years of high school French language will be placed in lC, while students who have completed three years in high school will be placed in 2A. Students in 2A will, however, be informed of their level of competency in French by taking a diagnostic test the first day of class. Students who place in 2A but who have scored below what is expected for successful performance in 2A will be informed that they may either remain in 2A or choose to enroll in lC instead. Transfer students who have had a previous course (or courses) in French from another college or university who want to enroll in any French lA through 2C course at UCI must take a copy of their transcript to the Humanities Undergraduate Study Office in order to receive authorization to enroll in the appropriate course. Student representatives serve on departmental committees. These representatives also participate in Department meetings and are responsible for student evaluation procedures. CAREERS FOR THE FRENCH MAJOR The great majority of students who major in French pursue careers in business and commerce, where they can take advantage not only of their proficiency in French language but also of their knowledge UC IRVINE - 2006-2007of French literature and culture. Many students also go on to Jaw school, to medical school, and to careers in the diplomatic service. In recent years, graduates have entered the field of education in increasing numbers. The Department's multidisciplinary approach to the study of literature teaches students to think critically and develops analytical skills that can be applied to a wide range of problems. It also helps students to develop the interpretive and writing skills necessary to express their own ideas clearly and per\u00ad suasively. Whether they enter business or professions such as law, education, or government, French majors acquire the intellectual and communicative skills requisite for success. The UCI Career Center provides service to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: See page 254. Foreign Language Placement and Progression: See page 253. Departmental Requirements for the Major French lOOA-B, lOlA-B-C, and nine other upper-division courses taught in the Department. Students may take up to two courses from the Department offerings taught in English. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper-divi\u00ad sion courses (above lOlA-B-C) required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor French lOOA-B plus five other French courses, four of which must be upper-division and four of which must be taught in French. Pre\u00ad requisite: French 2C or equivalent. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, providing course content is approved in advance by the appropriate department chair. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Students should consult with the faculty to plan a coherent pro\u00ad gram of courses to fulfill the major requirements. The Department encourages students to study in France, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or indepen\u00ad dently. Information is available in the Department Office. Students should consult with faculty members concerning career plans in areas such as teaching, industry, journalism, Jaw, and civil service. Undergraduate Minor in Italian Studies Foreign Language Placement and Progression: See page 253. The minor in Italian Studies is an interdisciplinary curriculum that allows students to go beyond second-year Italian and engage in various aspects of Italian culture by taking courses in Italian litera\u00ad ture in the Department of French and Italian and other courses related to Italian history and culture in the Departments of Art His\u00ad tory, Comparative Literature, English, Film and Media Studies, History, and Philosophy. French and Italian 287 Departmental Requirements for the Minor Italian 1A-B-C, 2A-B-C; and seven upper-division courses selected from the followi~g two lists, when topics are appropriate. At least five of the seven courses must be from Jist A. A. Art History 120, 121, 125, 198; Comparative Literature CL 103; Film and 112A; Italian lOlA, 101B, lOlC, 150; Philosophy 132. (No more than two courses may be taken from any department, with the exception of Ital\u00ad ian courses.) B. Art History 107, 198; Classics 140, Minor: At least four upper-divi\u00ad sion courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken at an Italian university through the UC Education Abroad Program, provided they are approved in advance by the Director of the Minor. Students who complete significant course work on Italian topics while participating in the Education Abroad Program in Italy are. encouraged to pursue their interest in Italian studies through the special Humanities interdisciplinary major, leading to a B.A. degree in Humanities. Interested students should consult the Senior Academic Counselor in the Humanities Undergraduate Study Office. Graduate Program in French The Department of French and Italian offers a graduate program in French with a strong theoretical, cultural, and multidisciplinary ori\u00ad entation. In addition to their specialties in the traditionally consti\u00ad tuted fields of French literature, the faculty is actively involved in related disciplines such as philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropol\u00ad ogy, history, women's studies, cultural studies, and comparative lit\u00ad erature. A theoretical and multidisciplinary approach to literature is a demanding one requiring, among other things, a restless critique of its own evaluations and concepts. In small seminars designed to stimulate intellectual exchange, stu\u00ad dents and faculty explore literature written in French within the context of relevant historical, cultural, or theoretical issues. They raise questions engaged by literary discourse and study critically the theories formulated to account for it. Courses tend to cross lines between disciplines and to emphasize both the close reading of texts and modern theories of history, culture, literature, and crit\u00ad icism. Students are encouraged to pursue their work in related fields outside the Department. They are also strongly encouraged to study abroad at some point during their graduate career. MASTER OF ARTS IN FRENCH The Master of Arts degree is considered to be a step toward the Ph.D. degree; only students intending to pursue studies for the doc\u00ad torate are admitted to the program. Performance on the Master's examination, usually given in the second year of graduate study, determines entrance into the doctoral program. Most candidates take a minimum of 11 graduate courses. All entering graduate stu\u00ad dents are counseled by the graduate advisor. During the winter quarter of each year, the teaching performance and academic record of each student who is a Teaching Assistant are evaluated. All graduate students are also given a written evaluation of their work on a course-by-course basis. Proficiency in a foreign lan\u00ad guage in addition to French is required for the M.A. degree (profi\u00ad ciency is defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C). All M.A. candidates are required to pass the Master's examination. Plan I allows particularly well-prepared students to receive special permission to take nine courses and to write a short thesis, for which UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 288 UCI 2006-07 School of Humanities two course credits are given. Under Plan II candidates take a mini\u00ad mum of 11 courses and have the option of taking a written exami\u00ad nation or of writing a research paper. The written examination con\u00ad sists of essays that demonstrate skills of literary analysis and an understanding of theoretical concepts and their application to the study of specific literary texts. The research paper involves a care\u00ad fully developed and well-documented analysis that reflects exten\u00ad sive critical reading. In all cases students also take an oral exami\u00ad nation that focuses on the written essays or the research paper and that seeks as well to test the student's broader knowledge. The Master's examination is normally given at the end of the winter quarter of the second year of studies. Students who are Teaching Assistants normally take the examination in the fifth quarter of their studies. Students transferring to the program from other graduate institu\u00ad tions may receive credit for up to two courses, subject to the approval of the Department. A maximum of five courses may be transferable from other UC graduate programs, with departmental approval. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN FRENCH Upon successful completion of the Master's examination and admission to the Ph.D. program, or upon admission with a Mas\u00ad ter's degree from an accredited institution, a Guidance Committee is appointed in consultation with the student. The Guidance Com\u00ad mittee advises the student in the choice of courses to help prepare for the written and oral Qualifying Examinations leading to advance\u00ad ment to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The Committee is com\u00ad prised of five faculty members: three from the Department, one from outside the Department who represents the student's outside area of specialization, and, for the qualifying examination, another faculty member not affiliated with the Department who represents the faculty-at-large. One member of the Committee is expected to direct the dissertation. Language Requirements: A reading knowledge of two foreign languages relevant to the student's area of specialization and sub\u00ad ject to .the approval of the Guidance Committee. Course Requirements: A minimum of 15 graduate courses or seminars in French beyond the B.A. and three graduate courses outside the Department in areas related to the field of specializa\u00ad tion are required. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with particular emphasis in literary theory by taking additional course work in the Department and in the Critical Theory Program beyond the minimum number required. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with an emphasis in Comparative Literature by taking a minimum of five courses in the Comparative Literature program. A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. Teaching: Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, as far as it is possible, all candidates without previous teaching experience are required to participate in a program of supervised teaching for at least one year. Qualifying Examination-Written and Oral: Upon completion of course work, the student takes a series of examinations involving problems of a critical and interpretive nature. The Ph.D. Examina\u00ad tion encourages focus and depth at a time when the student's area of specialization and eventual dissertation topic should be taking an increasingly clearer shape. In consultation with the Guidance Com\u00ad mittee, the student defines the precise nature and scope of four top\u00ad ics for the examination, which consists of written and oral parts. Upon successful completion of the written and oral Qualifying Examinations, the student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is four years. Dissertation: The dissertation topic chosen by the candidate will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. The dissertation must be defended in an oral examination and approved by the Doctoral Committee before the candidate is recommended for the degree. Three faculty members, chosen by the candidate, proposed by the Department, and appointed on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, constitute the Doctoral Commit\u00ad tee which directs the preparation and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doctoral Committee supervises an oral defense, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral dissertation, and certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is four years. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is seven years, and the maximum time permitted is eight years.

Smith, Ph.D. Princeton University, Director of the .Critical Theory Institute, Department Chair and Professor of German, and Professor of Comparative Literature (eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature and intellectual history, literary theory) The Department of German pursues a program of German studies as part of the humanistic endeavor to understand and evaluate cul\u00ad ture. Departmental courses are focused on language, literature, and film in context, that is, within the historical, social, intellectual, and political circumstances of their production and continuing recep\u00ad tion. Clearly, we come to understand ourselves and our immediate culture much better through the study of different languages and cultural systems. Therefore, university language study is not merely a matter of memorizing vocabulary and practicing pronunciation. It is the serious investigation of a foreign linguistic system and the cultures which are defined by it. It is difficult-in fact, nearly impossible-for us to scrutinize and analyze something we know as intimately as our native language, and yet this is the order by which we formulate our thoughts and the order which may some\u00ad times formulate our thoughts for us. The \"foreignness\" of a foreign language allows us to objectify an entire linguistic system, to observe its structure and its usage, and then to make comparisons with our own linguistic situation. This kind of knowledge of one's native language is the foundation of critical reflection on texts of any nature-historical, philosophical, literary, political, legal, jour\u00ad nalistic, and others. Thus, serious study of a foreign language is absolutely crucial to a university education. The Department teaches its language courses with this principle in mind and seeks to provide its students with a framework for these linguistic and cultural comparisons. Department literature and film courses offer a variety of critical perspectives from historical, social, or politically engaged readings to feminist and post-structuralist analysis. Topics range from stud\u00ad ies of individual authors, periods, and genres to the history of Ger\u00ad man-language literature and film, the theory of criticism, and the relations of German-language literature to other literatures. Undergraduate Program The Department offers a major and a minor in German Studies. The major can be combined as a double major with any other UCI course of study; see an academic counselor for information. All courses in the Department are taught in German to the extent compatible with the aim of the course. In the lower-division lan\u00ad guage courses students develop skills in speaking, listening, read\u00ad ing, and writing through an engaging, collaborative, task-based curriculum. The courses place a great deal of emphasis on mean\u00ad ingful cultural literacy in German, employing a diverse range of authentic texts and materials from the beginning, including avid use of Internet resources. During the second year (intermediate), students benefit from a curriculum based on authentic literary and cultural content (theater, media) and simulation of \"real world\" sit\u00ad uations. These courses have the additional goal of contributing to students' education in the humanities and developing their skills in critical thinking. After completion of the intermediate level, students enroll in the German 100 series (Advanced Reading, Writing, Oral Communica\u00ad tion) and in Introduction to German Literature and Culture (Ger\u00ad man 101), which provides an introduction to genre, periodization, and the German terminology used in critical analysis. This course is taken in preparation for the upper-division literature and film courses (German 102, 117, 118, 119, 120), which range histori\u00ad cally from the Reformation to the present and cover a variety of topics and approaches. A further series of courses (German 130, 140, 150, 160) is taught in English for both German Studies stu\u00ad dents and those who do not speak the language, and covers topics in German literature and culture, literary theory, and criticism as well as German-language cinema. Students are encouraged to participate in work-and study-abroad programs in German-speaking countries. The Department recom\u00ad mends the University's Education Abroad Program (EAP) in Got\u00ad tingen, Germany. Gottingen is an old university city in central Ger\u00ad many, where EAP students complete an advanced language program and enroll in university courses with great success, usu\u00ad ally achieving native or near-native fluency during this exciting year abroad. EAP also offers semester- and year-long programs in Berlin and Bayreuth. All EAP courses are accepted for UCI gradu\u00ad ation credit and many contribute to fulfillment of the German Studies major and minor requirements. More information is avail\u00ad able from the academic counselors. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007German placement tests are recommended but not required for stu\u00ad dents who have successfully completed foreign language classes in high school or elsewhere. To obtain information about the German placement test, please contact the UCI Testing Office at (949) 824- 6207. Students with college-level course work should present their transcript to an academic counselor in the Humanities Undergradu\u00ad ate Study Office, 143 Humanities Instructional Building, or call (949) 824-5132 for assistance in determining which UCI course to\u00b7 take. Apart from the optional placement test, students are placed in Ger\u00ad man language courses according to the number of years of previ\u00ad ous study. In general, one year of high school German is consid\u00ad ered equal to one quarter of a UCI German language course. CAREERS FOR THE GERMAN STUDIES MAJOR The ability to speak and write German can open up opportunities in communications, foreign trade and banking, transportation, gov\u00ad ernment, science and technology, tourism, library services, and teaching. Because German plays such an important role in modern technology, employers in international law, business, the foreign service, the airline industry, journalism, professional translating, and all levels of education increasingly seek students with a knowl\u00ad edge of German. German is excellent preparation for professional schools. It can be combined successfully with work in the natural sciences, business and management, and the computer sciences, and it is invaluable for advanced work in the humanities and the arts. Recent graduates of the German Department have begun careers in international law, business, the foreign service, the airline industry, journalism, and all levels of education, including university teaching. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: See page 254. Foreign Language Placement and Progression: See page 253. Departmental Requirements for the Major Fourteen upper-division courses are required, which must include: German lOOA, B, C; German 101; eight upper-division courses in German literature and culture; and two courses selected from Ger\u00ad man 140, 150, 160, Linguistics 3, Comparative Literature CL 50A, B, C, courses in German history, German philosophy, or German political science, as approved by the advisor for the major.

Residence Requirements for the Major: At least five of the upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Seven upper-division courses are required, which must include: German lOOA, B, C and German 101. Not more than one course from German 140, 150, or 160 may be counted for the minor. Ger\u00ad man 139 may not be used to satisfy minor requirements. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses are required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four rrtay be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, providing course content is approved in advance by the appropriate department chair. German 291 Distinguished Visiting Professors The Department's Distinguished Visiting Professors program brings students into direct contact with some of the outstanding scholars in the field of German Studies. Distinguished Visiting Professors typically visit for one quarter, during which they teach a graduate course and an undergraduate course and present a lecture to which students, faculty, and other members of the University community are invited. Program participants include Bengt Algot S0renson (Odense), Uwe Ketelsen (Bochum), Peter State), Hans Wysling (Zurich), Hans-Wolf Jager (Bremen), Norbert Oellers (Bonn), Hans Rudolf Vaget (Smith College), Heinrich Detering (Gottingen), Ulker Gokberk (Reed College), Stephanie Hammer (UC River\u00ad side), Helmut Schneider (Bonn), Richard Gray (University of Washington), Ursula Mahlendorf (UC Santa Barbara), Sander Gilman (Emory University), and Irmela von der Liihe (Freie Uni\u00ad versitat, Berlin). Graduate Program In its graduate courses the Department stresses theoretical under\u00ad standing of the nature of literature and culture. Seminars focus on German literary and cultural development after 1700. An emphasis in Critical Theory is available to graduate students in all depart\u00ad ments of the School of Humanities. A graduate emphasis in Femi\u00ad nist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. In addition, graduate students in German may choose to complete an emphasis in Comparative Literature. The graduate program in German is essentially a Ph.D. program. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of full-time graduate study. The Department will decide after completion of the M.A., at the latest, whether or-not to permit the student to continue in the Ph.D. program. The M.A. thus may be in some cases a ter\u00ad minal degree. In those cases where the student enters the UCI graduate program in German with an M.A. from another institu\u00ad tion, the Department will evaluate the student's progress during the first year of study before deciding to allow continuation toward the Ph.D. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. MASTER OF ARTS IN GERMAN Before entering the program, a candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. Students with a bachelor's degree in another subject may be considered for admission. Nor\u00ad mally their course of studies will have to be extended in order to make up for the deficiency. However, each case is considered indi\u00ad vidually by the faculty. The minimum course requirement for the M.A. degree is nine courses, eight of which must be taken within the Department of German. Reading knowledge of a foreign lan\u00ad guage other than German also is required for the M.A. degree. Whenever possible, a candidate is urged to complete this require\u00ad ment before entering the program. Further requirements follow. The Preparation of a Reading List. All candidates should prepare as early as possible a list of works read in the field of German lit\u00ad erature, both primary texts and critical works. This list should preferably be augmented by critical texts and by works from other literatures which, in the candidat~'s opinion, relate to the German works on the list. Since it should ultimately contain representative selections from various eras of German literature and some works of criticism, a tentative list must be discussed with the graduate advisor before the end of the fall quarter of the year in which the UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 292 UCI 2006-07 School of Humanities candidate expects to receive the M.A. Candidates should indicate on the list a number of works with which they are especially famil\u00ad iar. In its final form (including works read during the course of study both in and out of class) the list will be submitted together with the essay two weeks before the oral examination. It is the stu\u00ad dent's responsibility to keep the reading list current. The Master's Essay. The purpose of the written part of the M.A. comprehensive examination is to show the candidate's methodolog\u00ad ical progress in interpreting German literature. It consists of an essay in which a text is elucidated and related to: (a) pertinent works by the same author, (b) its social and historical context, and (c) other works of German or other literatures with which the can\u00ad didate is familiar. The level of the discussion will normally be enhanced by the candidate's knowledge of the relevant secondary literature. The topic of the essay should be tentatively formulated and reported to the graduate advisor before the end of the second quarter of the student's residence. The Oral Examination. During the oral examination the following items will be discussed: (a) the essay, (b) the reading list. The dis\u00ad cussion based on the reading list will focus on works which the student knows well, but may broaden into other areas. One Year of Residence. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN GERMAN The Department requires a minimum of 22 approved courses from students entering with a bachelor's degree. These may include courses in philosophy, history, comparative literature, and others suitable for the individual student's program of study. The student also will participate in each of the German Department's colloquia. The student will augment the reading list and keep it current dur\u00ad ing the whole course of study. At least two years of residence are required. Students entering with the master's degree will be advised individ\u00ad ually as to remaining course requirements. Since the majority of Ph.D. candidates choose careers as teachers, the German Department recogqizes its obligation to offer them preparatory experience. Therefore, all candidates for the Ph.D. are required to teach under the supervision of a faculty member at least one course in each of three quarters (for which they will receive credit as German 399). Three of these courses may be counted toward the 22 courses required for the Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination. There are two parts to the examina\u00ad tion. In order to fulfill the written examination requirement the stu\u00ad dent will choose either (1) to present a lecture to the faculty and to the other graduate students, or (2) to write a three-part examination (one part on a significant author, one on a major genre, and one on an historical period) within a period of two weeks. The examina\u00ad tion essays or the lecture will be on a text or texts selected by the faculty from a reading list submitted by the student for the compre\u00ad hensive examination. The second part of the comprehensive exami\u00ad nation is the formal oral qualifying examination of up to three hours duration ranging over the whole field of the student's stud\u00ad ies, to be taken within two weeks after completion of the written examination. The student will submit the reading list at least two weeks before the written examination after consultation with the members of the examination committee. Language Requirements. The candidate must demonstrate read\u00ad ing knowledge of two languages or extensive competence in one language other than German or English. Choice of language(s) depends on the student's area of specialization. French and Latin are recommended. For the various ways in which these require\u00ad ments may be fulfilled, the student should see the graduate advisor. Dissertation. Toward the end of the second year of study, the stu\u00ad dent should formulate a tentative dissertation topic. Three faculty members proposed by the Department and appointed on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and comple\u00ad tion of the dissertation. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory through the signature of the Committee members on the signature page of the dissertation. Time to degree. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is four years. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is six years, and the maximum time permitted is eight years.

In recent decades, the intensified processes of globalization have meant that cultural practices, sym\u00ad bolic systems, and the intersectional formations of gender, sexual\u00ad ity, race, ethnicity, and class have increasingly spanned national UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 294 UCI 2006-07 School of Humanities boundaries. But, on the other hand, this feature of the world today was shaped by and is as much a feature of the past. The aim of the Global Cultures major is to provide students with a humanistic framework for understanding the problem and processes of global\u00ad ization in relationship to change across time and space, the forma\u00ad tion and contestation of identity, and theoretical and discursive practices that shape philosophical speculation and belief. Students may choose one of the following approved emphases or may define their own emphasis in consultation with a program advisor and with the approval of the Global Cultures Committee. Atlantic Rim: Explores the movement of people and cultures in relationship to the historical and contemporary experience of soci\u00ad eties that are adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean, including, among oth\u00ad ers, west Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, and western and northern Europe, as well as the British archipelago. Hispanic, U.S. Latina/Latina, and Luso-Brazilian Cultures: Exam\u00ad ines the historical, political, and cultural formations of regions where Spanish and Portuguese are spoken, including Spain, Portu\u00ad gal, Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries in the Western Hemisphere, and the Latino!Latina population in the United States. Locating Africas (Nation, Culture, and Diaspora): Examines Africa as a diverse geographical and political expression, including its historical, political, and cultural formation locally, regionally, and globally. Locating Asias (Nation, Culture, and Diaspora): Examines Asia as a diverse geographical and political expression, including its his\u00ad torical and cultural formation locally, regionally, and globally. Locating Europes and European Colonies: Examines Europe as a diverse geographical and political expression, including its histori\u00ad cal and cultural formation locally, regionally, and globally. Pacific Rim: Explores the movement of people and cultures in rela\u00ad tionship to the historical and contemporary experience of societies that are adjacent to the Pacific Ocean, including, among others, India, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, the United States, Central and South America, and Malayasia. Inter-Area Studies: Includes comparative studies of the geographi\u00ad cal regions outlined in the above six emphases, for instance, the analysis of Africans in Asia, or the cultural, historical, and political connections between the Atlantic and the Pacific Rim. Because there are so many emphasis options within the major, stu\u00ad dents will be assigned for academic advising to a member of the Global Cultures Committee or a Core faculty member and are required to consult with their advisor on a quarterly basis. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Students in this major will be well prepared to do what other Humanities majors do after graduation: work in business, law, edu\u00ad cation, politics, public policy, academia, and print and television media. Global Cultures majors will be especially qualified for careers in the foreign service and international business. Students majoring in Humanities are particularly well prepared for careers in all fields in which analysis, judgment, and argument are impor\u00ad tant. The Global Cultures major will equip students with a knowl\u00ad edge and understanding of the complexities of the diverse world in which they live. Perhaps nowhere more than in the State of Cali\u00ad fornia, the contemporary workforce is constituted by people who have crossed geographic and cultural boundaries and who are embodiments of the forces of globalization that this major will help students to understand better. Global Cultures majors will thus be particularly sensitive to the challenges and opportunities pre\u00ad sented by the multicultural society of which they are a part. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search,. and interview techniques.

The Department presents a variety of approaches to history, and each emphasizes basic disci\u00ad plinary skills: weighing evidence, constructing logical arguments, and exploring the role of theory in historical analysis and human action. The Department offers a number of lower-division courses open to nonmajors as well as majors, most of which fulfill.part of the UCI breadth requirement. The Department requires all majors to take an introductory course in three of five regional histories-United States history, European history, Latin American history, East Asian history, or Middle East and African history. These courses are also open to nonmajors. Students who are interested in the study of history but are major\u00ad ing in other disciplines may minor in History. The minor incorpo\u00ad rates elements of the Department's program for majors but allows students enough flexibility to pursue programs in other depart\u00ad ments and schools. Upper-division courses range from the examination of individual nation-states (e.g., Chinese history), to studies of the relations among nation-states (e.g., Emergence of the Modern Middle East), to historical analyses of political, socio-economic, and cultural fac\u00ad tors (e.g., Women in the United States). Students are also provided the opportunity for small-group learning experiences in a series of colloquia in social history, political history, international history, intellectual history, social thought, and comparative history. The colloquia are conducted as discussion groups and involve close reading and analysis of secondary texts. The research seminar is a one-quarter seminar in primary materials that culminates in the writing of a research paper. The faculty strongly encourages History majors and minors to take advantage of the University's study abroad programs and to experi\u00ad ence a different culture for a quarter or longer while making UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 296 UCI 2006-07 School of Humanities progress toward their UCI degree. Moreover, students who are interested in the history of a particular country or region should seriously consider participation in University of California pro\u00ad grams within that country or area. UCI's Center for International Education, which includes both the Education Abroad Program (EAP) and the International Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of the many worldwide opportunities. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue or an academic counselor for additional information. CAREERS FOR THE HISTORY MAJOR The training and discipline derived from historical studies provide a valuable experience for all educated persons seeking to under\u00ad stand themselves and their world. Many students who complete undergraduate degrees in the Department of History go on to grad\u00ad uate school in a variety of fields, including history, law, business, international relations, and teacher education. Students interested in teaching history at the intermediate and high school levels should consult with an academic advisor in the Department of His\u00ad tory, School of Humanities Undergraduate Counseling Office, or Department of Education about course work and enrollment requirements for the state-approved history/social science subject matter preparation program. The study of history is valuable preparation for many other careers as well. The strong academic and professional orientation acquired by History majors is necessary to pursue successful careers in such diverse fields as advertising, banking, journalism, management, public relations, publishing, and government service. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: See page 254. Departmental Requirements for the Major Fourteen courses are required: three courses from the History 70 series, Problems in History (History 70A Asia, 70B Europe, 70C United States, 70D Latin America, Middle East and Africa, 70F Transregional History); three upper-division History courses with a regional or thematic focus decided upon in consultation with a faculty advisor, at least one of which is devoted to the period prior to 1800; two colloquia (History 190), one of which is fol\u00ad lowed by a research seminar (History 192); two additional upper\u00ad division History courses outside the regional or thematic focus area; and three additional lower-or upper-division History courses. Residence Requirement for the Major: A colloquium (History 190), a research seminar (History 192), and three upper-division History courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By peti\u00ad tion, two of the five may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, provided that course content is approved in advance by the Chair of the History Undergraduate Program Committee. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Seven courses are required: a year-long survey in world history (History 21A, 21B, 21C), United States history (History 40A, 40B, 40C), or three courses in problems of history (History 70A Asia, 70B Europe, 70C United States, 70D Latin America, 70E Middle and Africa, 70F Transregional History); and four upper-divi\u00ad sion History courses. Residence Requirement for the Minor: At least four upper-divi\u00ad sion History courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, providing course content is approved in advance by the Chair of the Undergraduate Program Committee. Graduate Program The M.A. and Ph.D. degree programs in History are designed to provide students with both advanced historical skills and a rigorous grounding in historical theory. This combination of theoretical study with training in historical method reflects the Department's conviction that scholars should be encouraged to deal with signifi\u00ad cant questions about the past and to approach these questions in a methodologically sophisticated way. This approach requires that the student develop the critical abilities necessary to deal with primary sources, secondary syntheses, and the interrelationship of history and theory. Candidates for a Ph.D. in History are expected to gain teaching experience as an integral part of their graduate training. Ordinarily this is accomplished through service as a teaching assistant. Basic to the curriculum is the Department's course in History and Theory which deals with both theoretical texts and historical studies that have utilized theoretical concepts and models. The course directs attention to the diverse implications of modernity, to the groups who dominated and were dominated by it, and to the costs and benefits of the process. These matters can be studied most sat\u00ad isfactorily by the historian whose theoretical self-consciousness and methodological facility have been systematically and carefully developed. The colloquium, a reading course that examines a field's chief his\u00ad torical works, enriches the student's knowledge of the main areas of historical research and develops critical reading skills. A collo\u00ad quium series is offered annually in American history; biannually (depending on demand) in modern European history, early modern European history, Lati'n American history, \"South and Southeast Asian history, East Asian history, world history, Middle Eastern and North African history, and ancient history; and occasionally in medieval history. A student may prepare a dissertation in any of these fields. In addition to the History and Theory sequence and the major field colloquia, students also take a proseminar/research seminar sequence during their first year. The proseminar provides an orien\u00ad tation to the literature on a broad historical subject, and the associ\u00ad ated seminar offers guidance in research and writing on problems within this broad area. Students awarded M.A. degrees at other institutions before entering the graduate program at UCI may be exempted from this requirement, subject to evaluation of their M.A. theses. During the second year of study, Ph.D. students normally take a colloquium series in their second field. They also take a two-quar\u00ad ter research seminar where they have an opportunity to work on problems of their own choosing; students who entered the program with an M.A. degree must also take this seminar. In addition; inde\u00ad pendent reading and research courses are provided for advanced, specialized study in tutorial form. The immediate objective for the doctoral student is to develop two fields of competence in addition to History and Theory. Compe\u00ad tence in the two fields is demonstrated by the satisfactory comple\u00ad tion of three courses in each of these areas. A comprehensive oral examination on the student's major field follows fulfillment of all degree requirements. However, those students who elect a second field administered by another program or department (e.g., Critical Theory, Asian American Studies, Feminist Studies) must complete requirements, which sometimes include a written examination, for that field. Competence in History and Theory is demonstrated by satisfactory completion of History 200A and 200B. History 200C may be taken as an elective. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007The subsequent objective, to write a distinctive dissertation, is of crucial importance. To assist in accomplishing both objectives, the Department offers intensive consultation with the faculty as well as a lively intellectual atmosphere. Students have long shared in the decision-making processes of the Department, which engages tlie entire historical community at UCI in the collective pursuit of excellence. Students profit also from a vigorous visiting speakers program that brings scholars from other campuses and other nations to meet and interact with UCI students and faculty. Requirements for Admission. Although it is desirable that an applicant have the equivalent of an undergraduate major in History, the Department also considers students who have previously spe\u00ad cialized in other subject areas and who show promise of sustained and self-disciplined work in history. Typically, a minimum under\u00ad graduate grade point average of 3.3 (B+) is required for admission, with evidence of better work in history. In addition, all applicants are asked to submit three letters of recommendation and scores from the Graduate Record Examination. An example of written work in history from undergraduate courses is also required. A departmental interview may also be required. Students are accepted for admission for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is January 2. MASTER OF ARTS IN HISTORY Program of Study. The M.A. program emphasizes the theoretical and historiographical dimensions of history. Each candidate for the M.A. will choose a graduate advisor who will supervise the stu\u00ad dent's program. Nine courses are required for the degree: three in a colloquium series, a proseminar and related first-year research seminar, a secondary emphasis of two related courses (History and Theory 200A and 200B, or other), a thesis course or preparation class for the written examination in the major field (taken as 291), and another elective course. Students who decide to pursue the Ph.D. afte~ completion of the M.A. program need to consider Ph.D. course requirements when selecting courses. Language Requirement. Students in the M.A. program whose major field requires use of foreign language sources demonstrate competence in a foreign language in the process of writing the first-year research paper and thesis. Other M.A. students do not have to meet a foreign language or alternative skills requirement. Plan 1: Thesis. The master's thesis represents a revision of the first-year research paper, equivalent to a scholarly article of 40-50 typescript pages, under the supervision of a professor in the stu\u00ad dent's major field and reviewed and approved by a three-member thesis committee, at least two of which must be History faculty members. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination. At the end of the final quarter the M.A. candidate must pass a comprehensive written examination administered by three faculty members covering the student's major field (e.g., America, Early Modem Europe) and focused upon material assigned in the three-quarter colloquium series. Time Limits. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in acade\u00ad mic residence and can be completed during that term if full-time study is undertaken. However, it is expected that many M.A. stu\u00ad dents are employed and need to enroll on a part-time basis. There\u00ad fore, students are allowed up to three years of graduate study to complete the degree. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN HISTORY Ph.D. students are advised to begin tl,J.eir graduate work at UCI, since those who have taken the M.A. elsewhere will be expected to enroll in the same courses that are required of all incoming stu\u00ad dents, with the exception of the First-Year Research Seminar. Sub\u00ad ject to evaluation of their M.A. theses, these students will be History 297 exempted from this requirement. In the second and third years, the greater experience of those who enter with an M.A. may work to their advantage in speeding them to the qualifying examination. First-Year Review. To be admitted formally into the doctoral pro\u00ad gram, students must satisfactorily pass a departmental evaluation at the end of their first year of study; this includes students who entered with an M.A. from another institution. Emphasis in Creative Nonfiction. In addition to meeting admis\u00ad sion requirements, applicants must submit an additional writing sample that demonstrates aptitude for the program. During their program of study, students take three of the writing workshops or their equivalents that are offered through the International Center for Writing and Translation. They also write a dissertation that meets traditional intellectual standards for academic rigor and is accessible to an audience beyond the academy. Emphasis in the History of Gender and Sexuality. To complete this emphasis, students take three courses emphasizing feminist studies and/or queer theory in three different fields. At least two of these courses must be taken in the History Department; the third course may be either a History Department course or one of the three core graduate seminars offered through the Program in Women's Studies. Program of Study. The Department requires doctoral students to prepare themselves in three different areas: 1. History and Theory. 2. The first field (such as Modern Europe), which is designed as a teaching field as well as the focus of the student's dissertation. 3. The second field (such as American History or Critical Theory), which is designed as a second teaching field. The courses required in this preparation include the History and Theory sequence, colloquium series in both fields, First-Year Pro\u00ad seminar/Research Seminar sequence, and the Second-Year Research Seminar. The normal academic load is three courses per quarter. However, students may be eligible for approved part-time status, which allows them to take a lighter course load at reduced fees for a maximum of two academic years. Every doctoral student will be assisted by a departmental advisor in the student's general area of study who will be responsible for approving defined fields, guiding the student to consultant faculty, and supervising the examination. Ph.D. students can be awarded an M.A. after fulfilling require\u00ad ments for residence and one language and successfully completing 36 units, including 28 in required courses. They also take a two\u00ad hour oral examination with an advisor. Language Requirements. All students, except as specified below, must demonstrate a reading knowledge of two foreign languages prior to taking the Ph.D. candidacy qualifying examination. Com\u00ad petency in a language may be established either by passing a depart\u00ad mental examination (proctored in the department office) or through extensive language use in one of the research seminars. The spe\u00ad cific languages that may be used to satisfy this requirement depend on the students' first fields, subject to their advisors' approval. Students may substitute for one of their language requirements one or a sequence of two graduate courses in an allied discipline or rel\u00ad evant methodology (e.g., critical theory, political theory, cultural anthropology, Asian American studies, feminist theory, art history, linguistics, statistics, quantitative methods), at the discretion of their major field advisors. Students choosing this option are nor\u00ad mally expected to write a substantial paper and must demonstrate that the allied discipline or methodology used to fulfill the require\u00ad ment is of value to historical inquiry. The course(s) taken to satisfy a language requirement may not count toward fulfilling the requirement for the second field. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 298 UCI 2006-07 School of Humanities Qualifying Examination and Dissertation. In preparation for the oral Qualifying Examination, the student will present to the Ph.D. Candidacy Committee a portfolio of three papers totaling at least 45 pages on subjects related to the major field (but not from required colloquia courses). Successful completion of this examination results in the student's advancement to Ph.D. candidacy. The nor\u00ad mal time for advancement to candidacy is four years for students who need two foreign languages and three years for those who opt for courses in an allied discipline to fulfill their second language requirement. Within one academic quarter of the oral examination, new candidates must meet in a colloquy with their Doctoral Com\u00ad mittee to present their dissertation proposal. Once the Doctoral Committee approves the proposal, the student begins intensive work on the dissertation. The research and writing involved in this effort may require from one to four years. At the end of this period an oral defense of the dissertation, focusing on the adequacy of the student's research and thesis, is normally held. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within seven years. The maximum time permitted is nine years. For students who substitute courses in an allied discipline for their sec\u00ad ond language requirement, the normal time to the degree is six years, and the maximum permitted is eight years.

It insists on the productive inter\u00ad section of these two fields as the focus of each student's program. Students improve their critical and historical sophistication while learning about the process of performance and creative work, a combination that equips them to participate more effectively in a society that increasingly joins critique and creation just as closely as it fuses image and information. Humanities and -Arts students investigate the symbolic dimension of human behavior and identity, an interest shared by many critics and artists alike. Often, this interest is expressed in the context of interdisciplinary programs designed to facilitate contact among faculty and students from a wide range of different academic disci-Humanities 305 of Humanities, is required for admission to Humanities and Arts.

There is also a steadily growing market in private industry for students whose training combines skills sharpened by both the Humanities and Arts. Business demands graduates with strong writing and analytic skills, talents stressed in the Humani\u00ad ties. They also desire people with creativity and visual skills who have experience putting their original ideas into practice, some\u00ad thing emphasized in the Arts. Graduates will have special skills that will enable them to work in professional fields directly allied with the Arts, including museum work, art foundations, art criti\u00ad cism, journalism, theatre, and the entertainment industry. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. Application Process for the Humanities and Arts Major New students are not admitted directly to the Humanities and Arts major. Continuing students apply to change their major to Humani\u00ad ties and Arts no earlier than the fall quarter of their sophomore year. Complete information about changing majors to Humanities and Arts is available at http://www.due.uci.edu/Change_of_Major.html. Students must submit a transcript and meet the change-of-major cri\u00ad teria for each of the two departments they propose to combine.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS \u00b7Undergraduate Major in Humanities The interdisciplinary major in Humanities is one of the many options available to a student who wants to select a major in the School of Humanities. As such, the major in Humanities is on a par with the major in Spanish, the major in Classics, the major in Philosophy, and other majors in the School. The major in Humani\u00ad ties accommodates students who want to organize their undergrad\u00ad uate education around a humanistic perspective on a topic, a field, or a problem which is interdisciplinary in scope (e.g., Literature .and Politics in Twentieth-Century America; The Problem of Com\u00ad munity; Social and Religious Thought in the Age of the Reforma\u00ad tion; Italian. Society and Culture). The student enters the program . at the end of the sophomore year and, in consultation with the Humanities Major Committee, devises an individually tailored set \"of \"major requirements,\" not all of which need be offered in the \u00b7 School of Humanities. The Committee will assign an advisor on \u00b7the basis of the student's own preference, if possible. At the end of the senior year the student will prepare, under the advisor's supervision, a long paper (40-50 pages) in. the area of the special major. This requirement is satisfied by taking Humanities 199. A student majoring in Humanities must also meet the regular School, .. \";: )j.\u00b7 UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 306 UCI 2006-07 School of Humanities UCI, and University requirements for graduation.

One set of courses develops skills in critical reading, writing, and analysis that are necessary in dealing with legal issues. Another set presents theoretical and analytical perspectives on ethical, political, and social issues relevant to the law. A final set focuses on specific legal issues from a humanistic perspective. Lower-division require\u00ad ments primarily develop foundational skills in the first set, whereas upper-division requirements build on these skills by addressing the concerns from the other sets. The minor does not include how-to courses on particular legal practices. Requirements for the Minor Lower-Division: Philosophy 29 or Classics 75; either one of the following four-course combinations: Humanities lA-B-C (or the Humanities Core substitution) and one course from Philosophy 4, 5, or 9 or Phil~sophy 1, 4, and either 5 or 9, plus one course from Philosophy 10, 11, 12, 13, or 9 (if not taken above). Upper-Division: Six courses from among a list of quarterly approved courses, at least one each from philosophy, history, and literature or classics. Consult the School of Humanities Web site (http://www.humanities.uci.edu) or an academic counselor for cur\u00ad rently approved courses. Students considering a career in law are strongly encouraged to take advantage of other law-related courses offered across the cam\u00ad pus and of extracurricular activities such as the Pre-Law Society. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses required for the minor must be successfully completed at UCI. Two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, provided course content is approved in advance by the appropriate department chair.

They present compellingly different models for social organization, historical development, and cultural com\u00ad mitments. The many countries of this large and complex region provide challenges and opportunities whether one plans to be a scholar, a business person, or a diplomat. The minor in Asian Stud\u00ad ies draws upon the expertise of faculty throughout UCI to create opportunities for students to explore Asian topics in a variety of fields, to develop advanced language skills, and to acquire a broader perspective as they apply the disciplinary training of their major field to effective and informed studies of Asian subjects. The minor is open to all UCI students. Requirements for the Minor Students choose one country and language of specialization.

Although there is no change in the existing Ph.D. program require\u00ad ments or procedures, if the student wishes to have a letter (signed by the Dean and by the Director of Critical Theory) testifying that the student has satisfactorily added this theoretical dimension to the graduate program, then additional requirements must be met. Critical theory at UCI is understood in the broad sense as the study of the shared assumptions, problems, and commitments of the vari\u00ad ous discourses in the humanities. The faculty regards critical the\u00ad ory not as an adjunct to the study of one of the traditional human\u00ad istic disciplines but as a necessary context for the study of any humanistic discipline. Admission to the emphasis may be granted by the Critical Theory Committee in response to the student's petition. The petition nor\u00ad mally is submitted by the middle of the second year of graduate study, after completion of the Critical Theory Workshop, and upon the recommendation of the Workshop's instructor or a faculty rep\u00ad resentative of the student's department. Requirements: (1) a three-quarter Critical Theory Workshop, con\u00ad ducted preferably by a team of instructors, conceived as a reading group, and developed with the input of all participants, where sig\u00ad nificant texts are discussed and analyzed in class. No term papers are required, and the course is graded Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory only. Students receive credit for this course only in the spring quar\u00ad ter. For the first two quarters, the course is 0 units with IP grading; (2) three Humanities 270 courses offered under the supervision of the Committee. At least three such courses will be offered each quarter; (3) participation in two mini-seminars (six-eight hours) offered by visiting scholars (and sponsored by the Committee) on the visiting scholar's ongoing research; and (4) a research paper written under the guidance of a three-member committee (selected by each individual student in consultation with the Director of the Emphasis), with at least one member from outside the student's own department. The paper may (but need not) be part of the student's dissertation.

Walsh, M.B.B.S., Ph.D. University of Queensland, Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior\u00b7 Philosophy addresses itself to questions that arise insistently in every area of human experience and in every discipline within the university. Each discipline inevitably poses problems concerning the nature of the standards appropriate to it and the place of its subject matter within the total framework of human knowledge. If we are to understand science or art or literature, or such human practices as religion and moral thought, we are bound to address ourselves to philosophical issues relating to their nature, the uses of reason appropriate to them, and the contributions they make to our understanding and appreciation of ourselves and the world in which we live. CAREERS FOR THE PHILOSOPHY MAJOR The study of argument and the precision and clarity of thought and writing required of Philosophy majors are excellent preparation for a variety of careers. Many undergraduates trained in Philosophy go on to professional schools in medicine, business, or law. The ana\u00ad lytical skills developed in Philosophy courses are especially useful in legal education; indeed, many UCI Philosophy graduates have been successful at top law schools. Former Philosophy students have also used their skills to advantage in careers in government, business, teaching, law enforcement, and computer programming. Many Philosophy majors also continue their education at the grad\u00ad uate level, either in philosophy or a related discipline. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni inCluding career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. Undergraduate Program Instruction in philosophy relies essentially upon discussion in which students are active participants. Wherever possible, there\u00ad fore, classes are limited in size in order to permit sustained inter\u00ad changes between students and instructor. So~e of the courses offered are of general interest to all students. Others are designed to explore issues that arise in selected and spe\u00ad cial disciplines such as art or science. The undergraduate advisor should be consulted for advice about courses best suited to the spe\u00ad cialized needs of particular students. The program of course offerings is also designed for those Philoso\u00ad phy majors whose intention may be either to enter some profes\u00ad sional school upon graduation (e.g., law) or to engage in graduate work in philosophy. The faculty encourages Philosophy majors and minors to seriously consider expanding their perspective through an experience of study abroad. The Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program (EAP) and the Interna\u00ad tional Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of many worldwide opportunities for study and research. Specifically, those interested in analytic philosophy could consider the EAP programs in the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, Aus\u00ad tralia, and New Zealand, and those interested in Continental philos\u00ad ophy could consider the EAP programs in France, Germany, and Italy. See the Center for International Education section of the Cat\u00ad alogue or an academic counselor for additional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: See page 254. Departmental Requirements for the Major Philosophy 30 or 104; 10, 12, and either 11 or 13; Philosophy 101, 102, 103, and five additional quarter courses from Philosophy 100, 105-199. Students planning to go on to graduate school are strongly advised to take Philosophy 105A and 105B. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Three courses selected from Philosophy I, 4, 5, 30 or from 10, 11, 12, 13, 30 or from 20, 21, 22, 23, 30; and four additional upper\u00ad division courses selected from Philosophy 100-157. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, providing course content is approved in advance by the appropriate department chair. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Graduate Program The Ph.D. program in Philosophy is jointly and cooperatively administered by the Department of Philosophy in the School of Humanities and the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Sci\u00ad ence (LPS) in the School of Social Sciences. The graduate program has two distinct tracks-the Philosophy track and the LPS track\u00ad both of which begin from a common core of shared requirements in history of philosophy, logic, ethics, and metaphysics/epistemol\u00ad ogy. Students are advised to apply to the track whose faculty, areas of specialization, and curriculum most closely correspond to their interests. The Philosophy track is described here. See the Depart\u00ad ment of Logic and Philosophy of Science for a description of the LPS track. UCI's Philosophy Department is committed to providing students a well-rounded graduate education, including central areas of con\u00ad temporary philosophy and a solid foundation in the history of phi\u00ad losophy. While many of our students choose to specialize in the history of Philosophy or the Continental tradition; areas in which the Department enjoys international recognition, students with other areas of specialization are welcome and well represented. Those with interests in mathematics, the natural sciences, or the social sciences are encouraged to take courses in Logic and Philos\u00ad ophy of Science and to include LPS faculty members on their dis\u00ad sertation committees. The cooperative two-track program provides students the benefits of faculty expertise in a host of areas. Every year the Philosophy Department invites distinguished philosophers from other universities to present their work to fac\u00ad ulty and graduate students. Participation in this colloquium series, though not mandatory, contributes significantly to graduate educa\u00ad tion. Colloquia sponsored by Logic and Philosophy of Science might also be of interest to Philosophy track students. Every new graduate student is assigned a faculty member whose purpose is to oversee the student's progress through the major requirements for the advanced degree. The student consults with this faculty member each quarter about progress and any adminis\u00ad trative or academic difficulties. Each student's overall record is evaluated by the Philosophy Department each year, customarily during the first two weeks of April. When the student has satisfied the residency requirement and the history, logic, field, tools of research, and portfolio requirements, the Candidacy Committee supervises the qualifying examination and the development of a dissertation project, and the subsequent writing of the dissertation itself. The Chair of this committee is the principal person with whom the graduate student will consult on the dissertation. MASTER OF ARTS IN PHILOSOPHY There is no list of courses required for the M.A. degree. The M.A. program in Philosophy takes one year at a minimum. The student may elect to follow either of the following routes to the.degree: write a thesis on a subject to be chosen in consultation with an advisor and defend the thesis in an oral examination, or satisfy the logic and portfolio requirements for the Philosophy track. Refer to the Office of Graduate Studies section for information on the mini\u00ad mum number of courses required for the M.A. degree. Advancement to candidacy for the M.A. degree is not automatic, but requires formal application to the Dean of Graduate Studies via the Philosophy Department Office. Application must be made with the recommendation of the Philosophy Department and must take place before the beginning of the quarter in which the student expects to receive the degree. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN PHILOSOPHY There is no set number of courses required for the Philosophy track, so that work can be tailored to the individual student's needs Philosophy 313 and interests. However, as a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree, every student is required to have some experience in teaching. The Philosophy track is designed to take six years for the normally qualified student, and the maximum time permitted is nine years. A master's degree is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. The following items are requirements for the Ph.D. degree. Distribution Requirements. Students are required to take a range of courses designed to expose them to the various historical peri\u00ad ods and fields of philosophy. No particular courses are required; when course offerings are announced, students are notified about which courses can be used to satisfy which requirements. In some cases, the requirement satisfied will ultimately depend on the con\u00ad tent of the student's term paper(s). The Distribution Requirements are: 1. History. To satisfy this requirement, students must receive a grade of B or better in at least four courses covering at least three of the following areas: Ancient, Medieval, Modern Empiricism, Modern Rationalism, Kant, Nineteenth Century, and Twentieth Century. 2. Field. To satisfy this requirement, students must receive a grade of B or better in two courses in value theory, one course in logic, and one course in metaphysics/epistemology. These requirements must be completed by the end of the seventh quarter in residence. Tools of Research. This requirement allows students to pursue the tool which they and their advisors deem most useful for their area of concentration, either a foreign language or some course of study outside philosophy. To satisfy this requirement, a student must pass an examination in a single appropriate foreign language or receive a grade of B or better in each of three appropriate graduate-level courses in a discipline other than philosophy. The two-hour foreign language examination (administered by the\u00b7 Philosophy Department) requires students to translate, with the aid of a dictionary, passages from one or two philosophical authors. For the second option, courses of study outside philosophy will be approved (by the Philosophy Department Director of Graduate Studies) when they bear on a student's area of philosophical con\u00ad centration. Though the courses must be in a discipline other than philosophy, they may in fact be taught in the Philosophy Depart\u00ad ment or the LPS Program (e.g., a course in mathematical logic taught by an LPS faculty member). This requirement must be completed by the end of the ninth quar\u00ad ter in residence. The Portfolio. A portfolio is an extended writing sample designed to demonstrate a student's ability (a) to understand, analyze, and evaluate positions and arguments in classical and contemporary philosophical literature, and (b) to formulate and defend an origi\u00ad nal philosophical thesis. These virtues must be displayed at a level of sophistication that indicates the student's ability to write a Ph.D. dissertation. The portfolio must be submitted to the Graduate Coordinator at the end of the fourth week of the student's seventh quarter in residence. Portfolios will be evaluated by the entire faculty of the Philosophy Department. (Philosophy track students may request that relevant LPS faculty also be present at the evaluation meeting.) Candidacy Examination. In preparation for the candidacy exami\u00ad nation, students consult with their thesis advisor and other appro\u00ad priate faculty to prepare a reading list. on their area of concentra\u00ad tion and a brief dissertation proposal. Students apply for candidacy by filing appropriate forms, including a list (devised in consultation with their advisor) of appropriate members for their Candidacy Committee; one of these, the External Examiner, must come from outside the School of Humanities. The Committee is then appointed UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 314 UCI 2006-07 School of Humanities by the Philosophy Department, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, to administer the oral candidacy examination on the reading list and proposal to determine whether or not the student is prepared to begin work on the dissertation. This requirement must be completed by the end of the tenth quarter in residence. The Philosophy Department Chair, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, then appoints a Doctoral Committee (typically taken from the Candidacy Com\u00ad mittee and naturally including the dissertation advisor) to supervise the writing of the dissertation. Dissertation Defense. Students must defend their dissertation dur\u00ad ing an oral examination administered by their Doctoral Committee. THE SALZBURG EXCHANGE PROGRAM The Department of Philosophy and the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science jointly administer an Exchange Program with the University of Salzburg. The program has two parts. The Scholarly Exchange provides opportunities for faculty and graduate students in Philosophy and LPS to visit Salzburg and for faculty and graduate students from Salzburg to visit one or the other of the UCI units. The Program also sponsors joint conferences, held alter\u00ad nately in Irvine and in Salzburg; these are co-sponsored by Salzburg and the UCI Interdisciplinary Program in the History and Philoso\u00ad phy of Science. To be eligible for the Salzburg Exchange, a graduate student must \u00b7 have advanced to candidacy. The selected student spends one semes\u00ad ter in Salzburg, usually teaching one course in the general area of the thesis topic. An upper-division course may be taught in Eng\u00ad lish, but lower-division courses must be taught in German. (Some previous visitors have learned serviceable German by attending a Goethe institute during the preceding summer.) Typically, a Salzburg visitor will receive a Salzburg Fellowship intended to cover travel expenses, and a stipend; those who teach while in Salzburg will also receive a salary intended to cover living expenses (including health and dental insurance). Application should be made to the Philosophy Department's Salzburg Exchange Director by November 1 and should include a curriculum vita and syllabi for possible courses to be taught. The Director and/or the Philosophy Department Graduate Coordinator should be consulted for further information. OPTIONAL EMPHASIS IN CRITICAL THEORY The School of Humanities offers an emphasis in Critical Theory that can be appended to the Philosophy track. A student interested in the emphasis begins by taking the three-quarter Critical Theory Workshop. With the recommendation of a workshop instructor or a Critical Theory faculty member in the Philosophy Department, the student may then apply to the Critical Theory Committee for admission to the emphasis. Emphasis students must complete the following requirements in addition to the usual Philosophy track requirements. The Critical Theory Workshop. Students must successfully com\u00ad plete the three-quarter Critical Theory Workshop. This sequence is conceived as a reading group, normally conducted by a team of instructors, and developed with the input of all participants. Significant texts are discussed and analyzed in class; no term papers are required. (Students receive 0 units and In-progress grades for the fall and winter quarters; passing students receive 4 units and a Satisfactory grade for the spring quarter. Advanced Critical Theory Requirement. Students must receive a grade of B or better in three Humanities 270 courses offered under the supervision of the Critical Theory Committee. At least three such courses will be offered each year. With the approval of the Philosophy Department, these courses can be used to satisfy the tools of research requirement. Mini-Seminar Requirement. Students must participate in two committee-sponsored mini-seminars (six-eight hours each) offered by visiting scholars on their ongoing research. Research Paper Requirement. Students must complete a research paper under the guidance of a three-member committee, selected in consultation with the Director; at least one member must be from outside of the Philosophy Department. This paper may (but need not) be part of the portfolio or dissertation. Upon completion of the emphasis requirements, a letter certifying that fact, signed by the Dean of Humanities and the Director of the Critical Theory Emphasis, will be added to the student's dossier. OPTIONAL EMPHASIS IN FEMINIST STUDIES A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information.

The cur\u00ad riculum seeks to provide a wide-ranging academic understanding and knowledge of the religious experience in society through study in the Schools of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Social Ecology, and the Claire Trevor School of the Arts. As an interdisciplinary academic discipline, the study of religion offers a rigorous, system\u00ad atic, and dispassionate intellectual inquiry into various aspects of religious systems, their practitioners and outlooks, and their goals and expressions. It employs a wide variety of approaches and methods in order to understand the role of religion in both human experience and thought. Students in the Religious Studies major complete an emphasis in either Judaism/Christianity/Islam or in World Religious Traditions. CAREERS FOR THE RELIGIOUS STUDIES MAJOR Majoring in Religious Studies is an excellent preparation for living in a multicultural society and for a variety of careers in counseling, teaching, commerce, writing, government, the arts, and profes\u00ad sional religious leadership. The major's emphasis on broad under\u00ad standing, critical thinking skills, and clear written expression pro\u00ad vides an effective springboard for graduate study in the humanities and social science or professional schools in medicine, law, or business. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: See page 254.

Green, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Professor Emeritus of Russian (eighteenth-century Russian theatre and literary theory, Pushkin, Chekhov, Kuzmin, Russian Symbolist theater, cabaret theatre, Russian literature and theater of the 1920s) Victorina Lefebvre, Ph.D. Lomonosov Moscow State University, Lecturer in Russian (methods of teaching, comparative study of Soviet and American culture, Russian language and literature) Lynn Mally, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Professor of History (modern Russian and Soviet history) Lora Mjolsness, Ph.D. University of Southern California, Los Angeles, Lecturer in Russian (nineteenth- and twentieth-century and contemporary . children's literature; Soviet and Russian animation; Russian folklore) Spanning both Europe and Asia, Russia is one of the world's domi\u00ad nant political entities. Its rich cultural traditions have enhanced \u00b7world literature, theater, art, and dance. As the world's first social\u00ad ist state, it became a major political rival of the United States after the Second World War. In the past decade, Russians have aban\u00ad doned their socialist system and are now in the process of making a rocky transition to capitalism. Although Russia lost sizeable amounts of territory in this transition, the Russian language now serves as the lingua franca throughout many areas formerly con\u00ad trolled by the Soviet Union. While the demand for specialists in various sectors of government has eased, relationships between our countries at other levels of society are growing more active and business opportunities are exciting and ~ewarding. Other areas in which the need for Russian language competence is evident right now include trade, environ\u00ad mental protection, social services, law, medicine, and technology. All students in Russian language courses are encouraged to take part in the UC Education Abroad Program and spend a portion of their junior or senior year studying in Russia. Additional informa\u00ad tion is available in the Center for International Education section of this Catalogue. The Russian Studies minor is a multidisciplinary curriculum com\u00ad bining the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Social Ecology. It is designed to introduce students to the rich history and culture of Russia and provide them with the intellectual and linguistic tools necessary for sustained engagement with this area of the world.

UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Spanish Placement To enroll in Spanish lA or any Spanish course through the 2C (or 5) level: Students without previous background in Spanish must take a copy of their high school transcript to the Humanities Undergraduate Counseling Office in 143 Humanities Instructional Building (HIB), open daily 9 a.m.-noon and 1--4 p.m., to activate their eligibility to enroll in Spanish lA. Any student with a previ\u00ad ous course (or courses) in Spanish from another college or univer\u00ad sity who wants to enroll in any Spanish lA through Spanish 5 course at UCI, must take a copy of their college transcripts to the Humanities Undergraduate Counseling Office in order to receive authorization to enroll in the next course. Students who graduated from a high school in a Spanish-speaking country, or who gradu\u00ad ated from a Spanish Academy, must take a copy of their transcripts to the Spanish Department in 322 Humanities Hall to determine where they should be placed. Students with previous high school background in Spanish wanting to enroll in any Spanish lA through Spanish 5 course at UCI for the first time must take the placement test. Eligibility to enroll in any Spanish lA through Spanish 5 course at UCI will be based on the result of that placement test. Students who have already met the UCI language other than English breadth requirement for grad\u00ad uation with SAT Subject Test scores, International Baccalaureate (IB) scores, or Advanced Placement (AP) examinations, and plan to enroll in a Spanish course at UCI, are still required to take the Spanish placement test. Students cannot earn units or grade points at UCI in courses from which they have been exempted on the basis of IB or AP credit, even if the placement test result recom\u00ad mends enrollment in such a level. Students currently enrolled in any Spanish lA through Spanish 2B course at UCI will be eligible to enroll for the next course within the series without having to take the placement test, provided they receive a C or better in the previous course within the series. Native or near-native speakers who place into Spanish 2C and whose home language is Spanish are encouraged to enroll in Span\u00ad ish 5, Spanish for Native Speakers, instead. Placement testing is offered throughout the summer and the acade\u00ad mic year. For information about registering for the placement test, contact the Testing Office, 2200 Student Services II; telephone (949) 824-6207; e-mail: testoff@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www.testingoffice.uci.edu/plt/. To enroll in Spanish lOA, lOB, or beyond: An active prerequisite check system is in place for Spanish lOA and lOB. In order to enroll in Spanish lOA a student must have passed Spanish 2C or 5. The prerequisite for Spanish lOB is lOA. Students who have satisfied the required prerequisite at another college or university, or who graduated from a high school in a Spanish-speaking country, or who graduated from a Spanish Academy must take a copy of their transcript to the Humanities Undergraduate Study Office in order to receive authorization to enroll in the appropriate course. All courses in Spanish and Portuguese, unless specifically stated, are taught in the foreign language. By the end of the first year, stu\u00ad dents attain mastery of the basic structure of the language and abil\u00ad ity to converse on everyday topics, as well as to read and write at an elementary level. In the second year, emphasis is put on gradually raising the level of the student's ability to read and write. A third-year two-quarter sequential course stresses composition and introduces literary analysis. Further, a course in phonetics aims to perfect pronuncia\u00ad tion and presents historical and dialect variants of Spanish. In addi\u00ad tion to giving students a sense of literary history, the introductory Spanish and Portuguese 321 courses in literature, also to be taken in the third year, introduce stu\u00ad dents to elements of.literary research and writing. The courses in Hispanic culture combine a panoramic overview with a close look at a specific country or topic, and require a final research project. Upper-division literature and film courses offer a more detailed analysis of specific texts and require a final research paper. Although a major in Portuguese is not offered, advanced literature courses are available. In addition, an undergraduate minor is offered. The faculty encourages Spanish majors or minors who are serious about improving their Spanish language ability in reading, writing, and speaking to take advantage of opportunities to immerse them\u00ad selves in the Spanish language by studying in Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, Spain, or other Spanish-speaking countries through the Education Abroad Program (EAP) or through the International Opportunities Program (lOP). Programs are available for the sum\u00ad mer, one quarter, one semester, or one year. While studying abroad, students can continue to make progress toward their UCI degree. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue or an academic counselor for additional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: See page 254. Foreign Language Placement and Progression: See page 253. Departmental Requirements for the Major Spanish 2C (or Spanish 5, for native speakers) or the equivalent is a prerequisite to Spanish lOA.

CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Spanish is particularly useful in international business or trade, community or social service, and in foreign service. Spanish majors interested in writing may look to publishing, writing, or editing positions. Majoring in Spanish is excellent preparation for graduate and pro\u00ad fessional study in law, medicine, social welfare, library science, business or public administration, education, international relations, journalism, or advanced study in Spanish. An option available to Spanish majors is UCI's 3-2 Program offered by The Paul Merage School of Business, in which students may earn a bachelor's degree in Spanish and a master's degree in ~anagement in five years rather than the usual six. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. Visit http://www.career.uci.edu for addi- tional information. \u00b7 Distinguished Visiting Professors The Department's Distinguished Visiting Professors program brings students in direct contact with some of the outstanding intellectuals in the field of Spanish, Latin American, and Chicano/United States Latino literatures and cultures.

Graduate Program All graduate courses in the Department are taught in either Spanish or Portuguese, unless otherwise indicated in the course description. MASTER OF ARTS IN SPANISH The Master of Arts degree in Spanish is a two-year program of study designed to expose the beginning graduate student to all peri\u00ad ods of peninsular, Latin American, and Chicano/Latino literature and culture. The degree is awarded upon the successful completion of course work and written and oral comprehensive examinations. A minimum of 10 courses must be completed with a letter grade; at least eight of these must be graduate seminars. Required course work includes one course in Theory (239A or B), and one course in Chicano!Latino literatures. Proficiency (defined as the equiva\u00ad lent of completing 2C) in a foreign language other than Spanish is required; it is recommended that master's students take Portuguese as their foreign language, although other languages are accepted. Students may choose a focus in literature, linguistics, or creative writing. Master's candidates must complete a minimum of three quarters of course work in the Department; the maximum time to complete the master's program is two years. Students entering with a bachelor's degree must satisfy the requirements for a master's degree before they proceed toward a Ph.D. This includes the mas\u00ad ter's level examinations and course work. Normally ortly students intending to work toward the Ph.D. are admitted to the graduate program. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN SPANISH The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a Ph.D. degree in Spanish with a specialization in Spanish, Spanish-American, or Chicano!Latino literatures and cultures. The program integrates period and genre studies with work in literary and critical theory, linguistics, sociohistorical studies, and cultural studies. The Department seeks to professionalize its Ph.D. candidates not as narrow specialists but rather as scholars and critics acquainted with a range of fields that relate to and enhance their discipline. Gradu-\u00b7 ate emphases in Comparative Literature, Critical Theory, and Fem\u00ad inist Studies are available; other areas of study (for example, film, history) may be designed with approval from the student's Ph.D. guidance committee. The Department has been traditionally com\u00ad mitted to excellence in teaching, both in its own practice and in the formation of its graduates.\u00b7 Language Requirements In addition to Spanish and English, all doctoral candidates shouid have the necessary command of Portuguese to successfully com\u00ad plete a graduate course in Portuguese. An additional foreign lan\u00ad guage (with proficiency equivalent to the 2C level) is also required; this requirement may be satisfied by examination or course work. The selection of a second foreign language must be approved by the student's guidance committee and is based on the specific research interests and field of study of the candidate. Course Requirements A minimum of 20 courses beyond the B.A. or 10 beyond the M.A. are required. One course in linguistics (diachronic or synchronic), and one graduate course in Luso-Brazilian literature are required at the Ph.D. level. Note that these requirements may include course . work completed in the master's program; the remaining elective courses are selected with the approval of the student's guidance committee to prepare for the doctoral examination and the disserta\u00ad tion. Students are encouraged to take more than the minimum number of required courses. A student who transfers into the doctoral program from elsewhere must take a minimum of 10 graduate courses at UCI, of which seven must be in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. With regard to students who enter the Ph.D. program with their master's degree from another institution, the Ph.D. guidance committee will determine the number of courses that will be accepted. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with an emphasis in Comparative Literature by taking a minimum of five courses in the Comparative Literature program. The Department offers an emphasis in Critical Theory designed to focus upon theoretical issues considered within the contextual real\u00ad ities of the Iberian Peninsula, Latin'America, and U.S. Latino com\u00ad munities. Ph.D. students may earn a certificate in critical theory by UC IRVINE - 2006-2007taking four courses in theory, one of which should be taken outside the Department. To obtain all necessary application materials and for further information, contact the Emphasis Coordinator. Teaching The Department recognizes its responsibility to train all Ph.D. can\u00ad didates as teachers and requires that all doctoral students with no prior teaching experience complete a minimum of three quarters of language teaching (Spanish 399). Moreover, all doctoral students are encouraged to complete a teaching practicum by co-teaching an upper-division course with a professor and enrolling in Spanish 292, which is graded Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory only. Qualifying Examination Upon completion of course work, the Ph.D, student advances to candidacy by passing the written and oral qualifying examinations by unanimous decision. The qualifying examination requires the student to develop two topics in close consultation with the exami\u00ad nation committee. One topic must present a critical problem from a historical perspective, while the other may focus on a more specific area within the student's major field of interest. Students are encouraged to incorporate theoretical and Interdisciplinary compo\u00ad nents into the formulation of their topics. A two-hour oral exami\u00ad nation that includes discussion of the written examinations is also required. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is four years. Dissertation A dissertation topic is chosen by the candidate in consultation with the dissertation director and committee, and normally falls within the major field covered by the qualifying examinations. The candi\u00ad date presents a study plan to the dissertation committee, which approves the proposal and a preliminary research outline. The stu\u00ad dent submits drafts of chapters to the dissertation director who cor\u00ad rects and approves the drafts and circulates them to otht;:r commit\u00ad tee members for commentary. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is seven years, and the maximum time permitted is eight . years. Courses in Portuguese LOWER-DIVISION lA-B-C Fundamentals of Portuguese (4-4-4) F, W, S.

Wiener, Ph.D. Harvard University, Professor of History (recent American history, theory and history) The graduate program in Visual Studies, administered jointly by the faculties of the Department of Art History and the Department of Film and Media Studies, offers students the opportunity to pursue a doctorate in the cultural analysis of visual artifacts and experiences. Visual Studies synthesizes methodological insights from both com\u00ad ponent disciplines in order to examine the social practices of visual representation and visuality itself. The program leads to a Ph.D. degree in Visual Studies. While the program (in certain instances) grants an M.A. to students on route to their Ph.D., it admits only those students intending to complete their doctorate at UCI. In addition, an emphasis in Visual Studies, described later in this section, is available to Ph.D. and M.F.A. students in all depart\u00ad ments at UCI. ADMISSION The program is open to students applying with either a bachelor's or a master's degree, and applicants must meet the general require\u00ad ments for admission to graduate study at UCI. A recent sample of academic writing-such as a representative undergraduate paper, or the master's thesis or a major research paper written at the master's level-should be submitted with the application packet. The deadline for application is January 15, and the program accepts applicants for admission during the fall quarter only. Addi\u00ad tional information is available from the Graduate Advisor for the Visual Studies program. LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS All students are required to demonstrate a reading knowledge of at least one foreign language and are strongly encouraged to develop competence in a second. Students consult with the Graduate Advisor and/or their principal advisor(s) to determine the appropri\u00ad ate language to be tested, based on their interests and program of study. Advisors, moreover, may require the demonstration of read\u00ad ing knowledge in additional languages according to the scholarly demands of the student's specific field. All language requirements must be satisfied before students are awarded a master's degree or, if they enter with an M.A., before they are advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. COURSE REQUIREMENTS Beyond the core series (Visual Studies 291, 292, 293A), students admitted with a B.A. are required to complete an additional 11 courses for a total of 14 courses. Out of this total, at least 10 courses (including the core series) must be within the program in Visual Studies (i.e., bearing Visual Studies, Art History, or Film and Media Studies course numbers) and at least two courses are to be from outside the Visual Studies discipline. In order to establish a level of expertise in one conventionally defined discipline, students enter\u00ad ing with a B.A. must take (among their 10 courses noted above), at least three courses that have a strong component of art history or at least three courses that have a strong component of film studies. Courses bearing Art History or Film and Media Studies numbers automatically satisfy this requirement for their respective fields. In addition, particular seminars offered as Visual Studies 295 may satisfy either the art history or film studies requirement; a list of qualifying seminars is available in the program office. Students admitted with an M.A. must complete an additional five courses beyond the core series, for a total of eight courses. While students may accrue units both for University Teaching (Art His\u00ad tory 399 or Film and Media Studies 399) and Reading for the Qualifying Examination (Visual Studies 298), these do not count toward the required number of courses. QUALIFYING EXAMINATION By the end of the second year for students entering with a B.A., or the end of the first year for those entering with an M.A., students must reach agreement with one of the program's professors to serve as principal advisor. During the fall quarter of the following year-in most cases, the final quarter of standard course work-the student will work informally with the principal advisor who will supervise one examination field; two additional faculty members supervising examination fields, at least one of whom must be a member of the Visual Studies faculty; a fourth member from the Visual Studies faculty who will not supervise an examination field but will participate in the oral examination; and a designated \"out\u00ad side\" member who must be a member of the UCI faculty but can\u00ad not hold either a primary or joint appointment in Visual Studies, Art History, or Film and Media Studies. Except in extraordinary circumstances (to be adjudicated by the program's Graduate Com\u00ad mittee), students are required to include at least one member from Art History and one from Film and Media Studies among the three faculty members supervising the examination fields. The student and principal advisor define three fields to be exam\u00ad ined by the faculty. The fields should combine historical breadth and some variety in media. Over the course of the following two quarters, students normally enroll in eight to twelve units per quar\u00ad ter of Reading for the Qualifying Examination (Visual Studies 298) during which time they prepare reading lists in close consultation with their principal advisor and field supervisors, arid complete the reading of those lists. The examination takes place near the end of those two quarters of study, normatively at the end of the academic year. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007The first part of the examination consists of a written component, in which the student is called upon to respond to questions posed in the three examination fields. The student's written responses are circulated to all committee members. An oral examination follows, normally within two weeks, and consists of questions prompted both by the student's reading lists and by the written examinations. Based on the student's written and oral performance, the commit\u00ad tee will determine whether the student has successfully passed the examination; if so (and provided all language requirements have been satisfied), the student is then advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is three years. If the committee is not satisfied with the student's per\u00ad formance, it may also decide to \u00b7reexamine the student on one or more fields after a specific interval. Except in extraordinary cir\u00ad cumstances, no student will be given more than two chances \u00b7to pass any given section of the examination. DISSERTATION Within six months of advancement to candidacy, each student must submit a prospectus that defines the scope, approach, and rationale for a proposed dissertation. The student and the principal advisor consult to determine the composition of a doctoral committee of three members including the principal advisor, which then must unanimously approve the prospectus before the student proceeds with the dissertation. The doctoral committee, on the basis of the candidate's past academic performance and proposed dissertation topic, may require additional course work or other forms of prepa\u00ad ration for the dissertation. The doctoral committee, under the direc\u00ad tion of the principal advisor, supervises the student's research pro\u00ad gram and ultimately approves the dissertation. The normative time for completion of the Ph.D. program is six years, and the maxi\u00ad mum permitted is eight years. GRADUATE EMPHASIS IN VISUAL STUDIES In addition to the doctoral program in Visual Studies described above, the Program in Visual Studies also offers an emphasis in Visual Studies available to Ph.D. and M.F.A. students in all depart\u00ad ments at UCI. Satisfactory completion of the emphasis is certified by the Graduate Advisor in Visual Studies and is noted in the stu\u00ad dent's dossier. Admission to the Program Students must first be admitted to, or currently enrolled in, a Ph.D. or M.F.A. program at UCI. Applicants must submit to the Graduate Advisor in Visual Studies a summary of prior undergraduate and graduate course work related to Visual Studies, institutions attended, and major(s), together with a brief statement of purpose, including career objectives, areas of interest and research, record of research, teaching, professional accomplishments, and/or creative work. Lack of prior course work does not preclude admission, so long as a compelling statement of research interests congruent with the emphasis makes the case. Admission to the emphasis is on a rolling basis. The Graduate Advisor tracks students' progress toward fulfillment of the emphasis requirements and meets with students to advise them on a program of study, as required. Emphasis Requirements Minimum course work for the graduate emphasis in Visual Studies consists of four courses: Visual Studies 291 and three additional elective Visual Studies seminars. For doctoral students, the qualifying examination and dissertation topic should incorporate Visual Studies as a central concern. One area of the Ph.D. qualifying examination should be on a Visual Studies topic, and one member of the candidate's qualifying exam\u00ad ination committee and dissertation committee is normally a mem\u00ad ber of the Visual Studies faculty. There are no requirements con\u00ad cerning qualifying examinations or theses for M.F.A. students. Women's Studies 327 Graduate Courses in Visual Studies Graduate students may also enroll concurrently in any upper\u00ad division lecture course with the approval of the instructor. 291 Theories of Vision and Visuality (4). Introductory seminar surveys the key theories of vision and visuality. Examines the theoretical texts that have, over the past several decades, enabled the emergence of the hybrid discipline of Visual Studies and ad_slresses the recent polemics written in support of and opposition to this new disciplinary practice. 292 Visual Studies and Historiography (4). History of art history and film studies to 1980. Examines the ways in which the visual has been constructed and places these constructions in their institutional and cultural contexts.

The Program's goal is to foster both critical and creative analysis of the various disci\u00ad plinary perspectives-historical, political, economic, representa\u00ad tional, technological, and scientific-that have (or have not) constituted women, gender, and sexuality as objects of study. By emphasizing a rigorous interdisciplinary perspective in their teach\u00ad ing and research, the Women's Studies faculty seek to produce new knowledge about the social meanings of gender, race, class, and sexuality, and to equip students with a range of analytical and methodological skills. The field of women's studies has developed at a phenomenal rate from a handful of student-initiated courses in the early 1970s to more than 600 programs in colleges and universities across the United States offering degrees at the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. levels. UCI's Program in Women's Studies was founded in 1975 and has grown significantly since that time. The program offers a B.A. degree in Women's Studies, a minor in Women's Studies, a minor in Queer Studies, and a graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies. Women's Studies provides a unique intellectual community for undergraduate and graduate students, where faculty and students share a commitment to interactive teaching and learning. Students work closely with faculty and the program's academic coordinator to plan a coherent program of study and to anticipate work toward advanced degrees and a wide variety of career options. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES A degree in Women's Studies prepares students for the expanding opportunities available in graduate programs and in numerous careers in both the public and private sectors. As more women work, business and corporations find the need for increased knowledge about women, and the growth of women's organizations and agen\u00ad . cies-at the local, national, and global levels-is creating new opportunities for graduates with specializations in Women's Studies. Graduates bring unique skills and knowledge to the professions of law, medicine, social work, teaching, counseling,. and to govern\u00ad ment service, all of which increasingly require expertise on issues concerning women and gender. A background in Women's Studies develops critical and analytical skills which prove valuable in the full range of life choices. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. In addition, the Women's Studies Office provides more specialized career counseling and information on graduate programs in Women's Studies and related fields.

Satisfactory completion of the emphasis is certified by the Director of Women's Studies and is noted in the student's dossier. Admission to the Program Applicants must first be admitted to, or currently enrolled in, one of the participating programs noted above. Applicants must submit to the Women's Studies Graduate Program Committee: (1) an application form listing prior undergraduate and graduate course work related to Feminist Studies, institutions attended, and majors(s); and (2) a one-to two-page statement of purpose, includ\u00ad ing career objectives, areas of interest and research, record of research, teaching, community, and/or creative work. The Committee determines admissions, in consultation with the Women's Studies Core Faculty, based upon the extent to which the applicant's research interests relate to Feminist Studies, the appli\u00ad cant's previous course work, and research or other experience related to Feminist or Women's Studies. Lack of prior course work does not preclude admission, so long as a compelling statement of research interests congruent with the graduate emphasis makes the case. Emphasis Requirements Minimum course work for the graduate emphasis in Feminist Stud\u00ad ies consists of four courses: two core courses, Women's Studies 200A-B, a coherent sequence normally taken in consecutive quar\u00ad ters; and any two courses selected from the list of courses in Femi\u00ad nist Studies approved by the Committee, as long as one of these is a graduate course in the student's own department or area of inter\u00ad est. In keeping with the interdisciplinary focus of this emphasis, it is highly recommended that the other be a course from a discipline outside that department or area. The course requirements for Ph.D. and M.F.A. candidates are the same. For doctoral students, the qualifying examination and dissertation topic should incorporate gender as a central category of analysis. One member of the candidate's qualifying examination committee and of the candidate's dissertation committee is normally a mem\u00ad ber of the Women's Studies and affiliate faculty. There are no requirements concerning qualifying examinations or theses for M.F.A. students.

From pioneering computer science courses more than three decades ago to the creation of the Donald Bren School of Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Sciences (ICS), UCI continues to be an institute that leads information technology education and research across the globe. The Bren School of ICS began as a department in 1968 and has given creation to some of computing's most significant advance\u00ad ments including revolutionizing computer-aided drafting tech\u00ad the creation of the current Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1 ); development of the Internet standards for HTTP and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI); the founding of the Apache HTTP Server Project that produces the software for over 60 per\u00ad cent of public Internet Web sites; and the creation of the Domain Information and Computer Sciences 333 Name System (DNS) that translates Web and e-mail addresses into the numeric system used to route information along the Internet. The vibrant ICS community continues to explore innovative topics ranging from building complete computer systems on chips smaller than a human fingernail to developing user interface systems that allow engineers on opposite sides of the world to collaborate effec\u00ad tively. From improving how first responders communicate during a crisis situation, to applying computer science to analyze biological data and thereby expediting biological research, ICS continues to focus on how to bring computing and information technology to bear in solving a diverse set of problems from across the Univer\u00ad sity and throughout the industry. Named a school in December 2002, and renamed in honor of phil\u00ad anthropist Donald Bren for his visionary leadership and generous gift in June 2004, ICS has created three departments that, when combined with the School's natural interdisciplinary nature, give way to the creation of new areas of study and research. ICS is one of less than 40 computer-specific schools in the country and one of only a handful to have established a department dedicated to the study of informatics alongside a more traditional department of computer science and a forward-thinking partnership with its department of statistics. This three-department structure affords ICS a unique perspective of the information technology disciplines and allows the flexibility to build educational programs that explore the many applications of the computing discipline: com\u00ad puter architecture and embedded systems;' security, privacy, and cryptography; programming languages and compilers; artificial intelligence and machine learning; visual computing; biomedical informatics; scientific computing; theory of computing; information access and management; software and information and computing; arts computation engineering; and computer science education. By blending research with education in multiple disciplines, ICS is leading interdisciplinary efforts that provide students with an edu\u00ad cation for the future of computer science, now. COMPUTING RESOURCES The School offers a wide range of instructional machines, includ\u00ad ing UNIX servers and workstations, G5 iMacs, more than 300 high-performance Pentium IV PCs, and several specialized labs. There are more than 700 varying types of UNIX workstations, servers, and PCs that support research ranging from computational biology, ubiquitous computing, and homeland security, to visual\u00ad ization, graphics, and multimedia research initiatives. The School's wireless network follows the IEEE 802.11 b/g standards and employs access points deployed throughout the ICS complex for 100 percent signal coverage. DEGREES Computer Science ...................................................................... B.S. Computer Science and Engineering* with The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. See the Inter- disciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue for information. Honors Honors at graduation, e.g., cum laude, magna cum laude, summa cum laude, are awarded to approximately 12 percent of the gradu\u00ad ating seniors. Students are nominated for honors based on criteria such as grade point average (including overall and in courses required for the major); number of upper-division Bren School of ICS courses completed beyond the minimum; courses taken out\u00ad side the Bren School of ICS beyond required breadth; and research UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 334 UCI 2006-07 Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences activities. To be eligible for honors, a general criterion is that stu\u00ad dents must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a Uni\u00ad versity of California campus by the end of the winter quarter of the academic year in which they graduate. Other important factors are considered (see page 55). CAREERS Graduates of the Donald Bren School of Information and Com\u00ad puter Sciences pursue a variety of careers. Many graduates specify, design, and develop a variety of computer-based systems comprised of software and hardware in virtually every application domain, such as aerospace, automotive, biomedical, consumer products, engineering, entertainment, environmental, finance, investment, law, management, manufacturing, and pharmacology. Graduates also find jobs as members of research and development teams, develop\u00ad ing advanced technologies, designing software and hardware sys\u00ad tems, and specifying, designing, and maintaining computing infra\u00ad structures for a variety of institutions. Some work for established or start-up companies while others work as independent consul- \u00b7 tants. After a few years in industry, many move into management or advanced technical positions. Many students also use the undergrad\u00ad uate major as preparation for graduate study in computer science or another field (e.g., medicine, law, engineering, management). UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The School's undergraduate program prepares students for profes\u00ad sions and careers in industry and provides students with the tools for advanced education at the graduate level. Many graduates fol\u00ad low career paths immediately after graduation; others go on to advanced study in a variety of fields, including computer science, management, engineering, law,' and medicine. An ICS undergradu\u00ad ate education is a blend of scholarship, science, technology, and practical application that forms an excellent foundation for profes\u00ad sional life in the twenty-first century and prepares a student with serviceable skills useful for a lifetime. The basis of the undergraduate program is a set of fundamental courses in mathematics and computer science, supplemented by breadth requirements from other academic disciplines. A premium is placed on writing and quantitative skills. Students\u00b7 start early with hands-on experience with advanced computing systems, and intense use of computer and network technologies continues throughout the undergraduate program. Students study data organi\u00ad zation, algorithm design and analysis, design and organization of hardware and network systems, software engineering, artificial intelligence, social aspects of system design and use, and manage\u00ad ment of technology. In the process, students work with state-of\u00ad the-art hardware and software technologies, learn several contem\u00ad porary programming languages, and make extensive use of computer-based utilities such as electronic mail. The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences offers four majors: Information and Computer Science (ICS); Computer Science (CompSci); Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), offered jointly with the Henry Samueli School of Engineer\u00ad ing; and Informatics. There are also programs of study leading to minors in Information and Computer Science and in Informatics. B.S. in Information and Computer Science. The overall field of information and computer science spans a vast spectrum of top\u00ad ics. At the one end, it includes computer system design and net\u00ad working, detailing how modern computer hardware an\u00b7d networks operate on a day-to-day basis. At the other end are human factors, such as how software should be structured to facilitate cooperative\u00b7 work among groups of people. The B.S. in Information and Com\u00ad puter Science (ICS) provides students with a broad introduction to. these topics. Through the selection of elective courses, students may choose to specialize in one or more of six areas: artificial intelligence, computer systems, implementation and analysis of algorithms, information systems, networks and distributed systems, or software systems. See page 335. B.S. in Computer Science. Computer science as an area of study has been around for over four decades now. During that time, the field has evolved and grown considerably. The Computer Science (CS) major provides students with an education that focuses on the operation of computers and the software that runs them. Addition\u00ad ally, students may take a variety of courses to broaden their knowl\u00ad edge and/or specialize in particular areas. For instance, the major is well-suited for a more in-depth study in traditional topics such as artificial intelligence, advanced data structures, expert systems, and computer graphics, as well as more modern topics such as compu\u00ad tational biology and computer games. See page 338. B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering. This program is designed to provide students with the fundamentals of computer sci\u00ad ence, both hardware and software, and the application of engineering concepts, techniques, and methods to both computer systems engi\u00ad neering and software system design. The Computer Science and Engineering major gives students access to multidisciplinary prob\u00ad lems in engineering with a focus on total systems engineering. Stu\u00ad dents learn the computer science principles that are critical to devel\u00ad opment of software, hardware, and networking of computer systems. From that background, engineering concepts and methods are added to give students exposure to circuit design, network design, and digi\u00ad tal signal processing. Elements of engineering practice include sys\u00ad tems view, manufacturing and economic issues, and multidiscipli\u00ad nary engineering applications. The program is administered jointly by the Department of Computer Science in the Bren School of ICS and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. See page 362 in the Catalogue's Interdisciplinary Studies section. B.S. in Informatics. Within the overall discipline of information and computer science, the Informatics major is concerned with the relationship between what is inside the computer and what is out\u00ad side. The Informatics major addresses the broad set of issues sur\u00ad rounding design, ranging from initial requirements gathering to estimating and measuring the impact of alternative solutions-all from a multidisciplinary perspective that includes computer sci\u00ad ence, information science, organizational science, social science, and cognitive science. See page 342.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND COURSES The Bren School of ICS Honors Program The Bren School of ICS Honors Program provides selected upper\u00ad division students an opportunity to carry out a research project under the direction of a faculty member in the School. Students who have completed the necessary course work and meet academic eligibility guidelines must submit a formal application. Eligible students participate in the ICS Honors Seminar (ICS H197); which provides an introduction to the range of current faculty research, Each student then affiliates with an ICS faculty advisor who agrees to supervise a minimum of two quarters of independent research. The Honors Program student prepares a final written report of the independent research and submits a copy for review to both the faculty advisor and the Honors Program advisor. If each advisor verifies that the conducted research was of honors quality, the stu\u00ad dent is deemed to have successfully completed the Bren School of ICS Honors Program. Successful completion of the Honors Pro\u00ad gram earns the student a certificate and medal from the School. Further, a notation of successful completion is added to the stu\u00ad dent's transcript. For more information about course requirements; application procedures, and deadlines (which may be different for students who enter UCI as freshmen or transfers), visit http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugradlhonors/index.php, or contact the Student Affairs Office at (949) 824-5156.

Admissions Freshman Applicants: See pages 38-42. Transfer Applicants: Junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall and who sat\u00ad isfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission. Applicants must satisfy the following requirements: 1. One year of discrete mathematics if available; if not, first-year calculus. (A semester of pre-calculus and a semester of calculus may not be used to fulfill this requirement.) 2. One year of computer science courses, including a UC-transfer\u00ad able programming course involving concepts such as found in C++, Java*, Eiffel, or another object-oriented high-level lan\u00ad guage; programming-only courses such as Basic, Fortran, Cobol, Pascal, and C are not acceptable. Students should select De\u00ad transferable courses that do not focus strictly on learning a pro\u00ad gramming language but instead focus on topics such as object\u00ad oriented design, data structures, algorithms, and computer architecture, if such courses are available. *Java is strongly rec\u00ad ommended as it is used in most programming-related courses. The lower~division requirements consist of five quarters of ICS courses, seven quarters of math courses, and three quarters of either physics, chemistry, or biology which must be taken in a cer\u00ad tain order and which are prerequisites for upper-division courses. Students who transfer to UCI in need of completing any part of this sequence may find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degree.

Informatics is the interdisciplinary study of the design, application, use, and impact of information technology. It goes beyond techni- . cal design, to focus on the relationship between information system design and use in real-world settings. These investigations lead to new forms of system architecture, new approaches to system design and development, new means of information system imple\u00ad mentation and deployment, and new models of interaction between technology and social, cultural, and organizational settings. Undergraduate Major in Informatics Within the overall discipline of information and computer science, the Informatics major is the most outward looking. Traditional computer science concerns itself primarily with the internal fea\u00ad tures, structure, and behavior of computer systems; the Informatics major focuses more on the relationship between what is inside the computer and what is outside. So, courses in the Informatics major study software architecture; software development, design, and analysis; work; and other topics that address the relationship between information technology design and use in social and organizational settings. As such, the Informatics major addresses the broad set of issues surrounding design, ranging from initial requirements gathering to estimating and measuring the\u00b7 impact of alternative solutions-all from a multidisciplinary per\u00ad spective that includes computer science, information science, orga\u00ad nizational science, social science, and cognitive science. Courses in the degree program are carefully designed to offer exten\u00ad sive treatment of the conceptual underpinnings of the discipline and provide in-depth practical experiences, often performed on real\u00ad world examples and involving outside organizations sponsoring the . project. Students completing the major will be exceptionally suited for advanced careers in information technology or for further study at the graduate level. Specific careers include, but certainly are not limited to: software engineer; software architect; system, software, and information analyst; system, software, and information designer; project manager; and interface and interaction designer. Career choices include new start-ups, multinational corporations, small software houses, consultancy, and game companies. In~ormatics majors may also choose to complete the Game Culture and Technology concentration, an interdisciplinary course of study requiring a total of eight courses (32 units) from the Bren School of ICS and Claire Trevor School of the Arts (Department of Studio Art); admission criteria and course requirements are described on page 335. More information is available online at http://www.ics.uci.edu/ informatics/ugrad. ADMISSIONS Freshmen Applicants: See pages 38-42. Transfer Applicants: Students transferring into the major must satisfy the following requirements: 1. Completion of one year of college mathematics. Courses equiva\u00ad lent to ICS 6A/Mathematics 6A (discrete mathematics), Statis\u00ad tics ?/Mathematics 7 or Statistics 67/Mathematics 67, and Phi\u00ad losophy 29 or Philosophy 30 or Mathematics 13 (symbolic logic) are preferred as this facilitates scheduling after transfer to UCI. A semester of pre-calculus and a semester of calculus are not sufficient to satisfy this requirement. 2. Completion of one year of computer science courses. The course work must contain at least one UC-transferable programming course involving the concepts of object-oriented programming in such languages as C++, Java, Smalltalk, or Eiffel, or functional programming in such languages as Scheme, Lisp, or ML. Pro\u00ad gramming-only courses in Basic, Fortran, Cobol, Pascal, or C are not acceptable. It is strongly recommended that students select UC-transferable courses that do not focus strictly on learning a programming language but instead focus on topics such as software design, software engineering, human-computer interaction, programming language concepts, data structures, and algorithms, if such courses are available. Additional courses beyond the one UC-transferable program\u00ad ming course required for admission are strongly recommended. Transfer students must enter UCI with knowledge of Java since it is used in many of the lower-division Informatics require\u00ad ments and serves as a foundation for upper-division program\u00ad ming-related courses. Courses equivalent to Informatics 41, 42, 43 are strongly pre\u00ad ferred, although courses equivalent to ICS 21, 22, 52 are accept\u00ad able as alternatives. 3. Completion of at least one year of college-level courses in Eng\u00ad lish composition, academic writing, research writing, or techni\u00ad cal writing. Students should have strong reading and writing skills and facility with quantitative reasoning and critical, logi\u00ad cal thinking. Courses in design would also be beneficial, though not required. Students who transfer to UCI in need of completing any part of this sequence may find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degree.

GRADUATEPROGRAMINICS The University of California is the State's primary research institu\u00ad tion, and the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sci\u00ad ences is the only independent computer science school on any UC campus. Established in December 2002 when the 35-year-old Department of Information and Computer Science was promoted to independent school status, ICS embodies the University's tradition of excellence as a world leader in information and computer sci\u00ad ences. ICS recently received a $20-million endowment from The Irvine Company Chairman Donald Bren to assist in recruiting and retaining distinguished faculty scholars. ICS began construction on a new, six-story research and administrative facility during the winter of 2004 with completion expected in December 2006. Committed to increasing diversity in computing, ICS created the Ada Byron Research Center in 2003 to address research and outreach topics aimed at increasing the participation of women and other underrep\u00ad resented populations in computer science and information technology. Faculty and student-driven research in ICS is supported through a variety of grants, gifts, and contracts from public and private insti\u00ad tutions such as the State of California, the U.S. Department of Education, various U.S. defense agencies, the National Science Information and Computer Sciences 345 Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, NASA, and several companies, including Boeing, Conexant, Fujitsu, HP, ffiM, Intel, Microsoft, Raytheon, Siemens, Sun, Toshiba, and Unisys. Since 2000, ICS has received more than $79 million in extramural fund\u00ad ing, in addition to the recent $20-million endowment. Faculty within the School are active participants and leaders of numerous research institutes spanning computer science, including: the Insti\u00ad tute for Genomics and Bioinformatics; Institute for Software Research; Center for Embedded Computer Systems; California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology; Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing; Arts Com\u00ad putation Engineering; Center for Cyber-Security and Privacy; Cen\u00ad ter for Research on Information Technology and Organizations; Laboratory for Ubiquitous Computing and Interaction; Large-scale Data Analysis; Network Systems Center; and the Ada Byron Research Center. ICS offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Information and Computer Science. Enrollments in the M.S. program are being limited to those students with an undergraduate degree in computer science or a closely related field. Both M.S. and Ph.D. students may complete one of the following concentrations: Computer Science (CS); Informatics (INF); Infor\u00ad matics in Biology and Medicine (ffiaM); and Statistics (Stats). Three additional concentrations are available to M.S. students\u00ad Embedded Systems; Knowledge Discovery in Data; and Arts Computation Engineering (ACE). In addition, the School also offers a general M.S. degree that does not identify with any spe\u00ad cific concentration. The M.S. and Ph.D. degree program in Networked Systems is supervised by an interdepartmental faculty group. Information is available in the Interdisciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue. ADMISSION Applicants will be evaluated on the basis of their prior academic record. Applicants for the M.S. degree are expected to have a bach\u00ad elor's degree in computer\u00b7science or a related field. Those who do not have an undergraduate degree in computer science may take the Computer Science Advanced GRE test to demonstrate sufficient background in the field. Scores are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Ph.D. applicants will be evaluated in t~eir potential for creative research and teaching in Information and Computer Science. Applicants are expected to have (1) skills in computer programming at least equivalent to those obtained in college-level courses in pro\u00ad gramming and language development; (2) skills in mathematics equivalent to those obtained in complete college-level courses in logic and set theory, analysis, linear algebra and modern algebra, or probability and statistics; (3) data structures, analysis of algorithms, automata theory, or formal languages; and (4) computer architectures. All applicants are evaluated on the materials submitted: letters of recommendation, official GRE test scores, official college tran\u00ad scripts, and personal statement. For more information, contact the ICS graduate counselor at (949) 824-5156 or send e-mail to gcounsel@ ics.uci.edu. Financial Assistance Financial assistance is available to Ph.D. students in the form of fellowships, teaching assistantships, and research assistantships. Although assistance varies, it is the School's goal to support all entering Ph.D. students, subject to availability of funds. Interna\u00ad tio~al students who are not citizens of countries where English is either the primary or dominant language, as approved by Graduate Council, and who apply for teaching assistantships must take the Test of Spoken English (TSE) or the Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit (SPEAK) examination and earn a minimum score of 50 to be considered for an award. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 346 UCI 2006-07 Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences Financial assistance may be available through teaching assistant\u00ad ships and corporate internships for ICS M.S. students. Students with a Previously\u00b7 Earned Master's Degree Credit for one or all required courses may be given at the time of admission to those students who have completed a master's degree in computer science or a closely related field. Course equivalency will be determined by the ICS Associate Dean for Graduate Stud\u00ad ies following a written recommendation from a sponsoring research advisor. Research advisors can require that a student take additional courses when this is appropriate. An additional M.S. degree will not be awarded if the student cur\u00ad rently holds an M.S. degree in computer science or a related field from another university. Course Substitutions A student who has taken relevant grad)late courses at UCI or another university may petition to have a specific course certified as equivalent to one which satisfies ICS requirements. The petition should describe the course and can be approved either by a com\u00ad mittee composed of the student's faculty advisor, the ICS Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and a faculty member who is in the con\u00ad centration area in which the course is taught, or by the ICS Graduate Policy Committee. Only two courses can be substituted. Master of Science Program The Master of Science program offers concentrations in the same areas as the Ph.D. concentrations described under the Doctor of Philosophy heading below. For each of these concentrations, the course requirements for the M.S. are determined by the concentra\u00ad tion track and are identical to those of the Ph.D., although comple\u00ad tion plans differ. In addition, the Master of Science program offers a general M.S. in ICS, a concentration in Embedded Systems, a concentration in Knowledge Discovery in Data, and a concentration in Arts Compu\u00ad tation Engineering. Detailed course requirements for the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees are listed in the following pages under each concentration area. M.S. students may select one of two options: thesis plan or comprehen\u00ad sive examination plan; as described below. The normative time for completion of the M.S. program is two years. All study must be completed within four calendar years from the date of admission. Plan 1: Thesis Plan. The thesis option is available for graduate students who may wish to continue on to a Ph.D. program or those who wish to concentrate on a specific problem. To qualify for this option, students must be in good academic standing with their Department. The student must enroll in at least two quarters of Thesis Supervision (CS 298 or Informatics 298) that will substitute for two required courses as specified under the concentration area or specialization of choice. All required courses must be completed with a grade of B or better, and the student must write a research or thesis project. A committee of three faculty members (voting members of the Academic Senate) will guide the student and give final approval of the thesis. The committee will consist of an advi\u00ad sor (ICS faculty member) who is willing to supervise the thesis project, and two other faculty members (one of which must be from ICS) who are willing to serve on the committee as readers of the thesis. An oral presentation of the thesis to the committee will be required. Seminar courses such as Informatics 209S, CS 239S, CS 259S, CS 269S, and CS 279S cannot be applied to the required \"other graduate courses\" units. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan. The student com\u00ad pletes the required units as specified under the concentration area. Each course must be completed with a grade of B or better. Semi\u00ad nar courses such as Informatics 209S, CS 239S, CS 259S, CS 269S, and CS 279S cannot be applied to the required \"other graduate courses\" units. The student must take a comprehensive examination given by ICS faculty. The examination covers the core requirements and is given twice a year (fall and spring quarters). ICS GENERAL M.S.

M.S. CONCENTRATION IN KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN DATA The goal of the M.S. concentration in Knowledge Discovery and Data is to educate students in both the fundamental principles of computational methods for modeling data, as well as to provide a broad foundation in emerging methods for knowledge discovery and data mining. Technological advances in digital data collection, memory capacity, and computational power, have revolutionized our view of data analysis in the past 10 years. The volumes of data Information and Computer Sciences 347 being collected in science, business, medicine, and government are truly vast in nature. Across all of these areas, there is a rapidly increasing demand for better theories and tools to provide users with improved understanding of their data and to leverage their data for decision support. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is an emerging discipline within computer science, focused on the principles of how patterns and structure can be inferred from large data sets. It is an area of significant academic interest and research opportunity. For exam\u00ad ple, a Special Interest Group in Knowledge Discovery in Databases (SIGKDD) was recently started by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) to promote both research and professional activ\u00ad ities in this area; a new journal called Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery was started in 1997; and the field sponsors an annual international conference with over 500 attendees. In addition, the National Science Foundation has recently begun a large interdisci\u00ad plinary research program in Knowledge and Distributed Intelli\u00ad gence (KDI), based in part on recent research and interest in KDD.

UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 348 UCI 2006-07 Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences M.S. CONCENTRATION IN ARTS COMPUTATION ENGINEERING (ACE) As digital technologies infiltrate .increasingly diverse aspects of cultural practice, and human culture at large is influenced by the presence of digital technologies, there is a profound need for a new type of professional in the entertainment industry, in education, and in the arts, who can help to construct, manage, and monitor these changes. Such a professional must be technically skilled, artistically skilled, and theoretically skilled, all at an equally high and rigorous level. The goal of the M.S. concentration in Arts Computation Engineering is to provide students with a broad-based and interdisciplinary training at the intersection of digital technol\u00ad ogy and cultural and artistic practices. The ACE program is coordi\u00ad nated across the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, and the Claire Trevor School of the Arts, and places equal emphasis on technical, artistic, and critical proficiency. Strongly practical in composition, it provides students with the opportunity to explore in detail topics such as telematic performance, immersive and aug\u00ad mented environments, embodied interaction, and the cultural impact of new technologies. Graduation is by publicly presented thesis project and written the\u00ad sis, in addition to completion of course work. Required Courses The ACE concentrations in all three fields consist of a two-year curriculum. The following courses are required: ACE Core: five ACE interdisciplinary theory seminars (Informat\u00ad ics 270), four ACE studio/labs (Informatics 271~277), two ACE project internships (Informatics 279), and one quarter of ACE the\u00ad sis research (Informatics 278). (NOTE: A total of 48 units of Core courses must be completed. Any of the ACE core category courses may be reduced by one and replaced with a different ACE core course or an elective, in consul\u00ad tation with the student's advisor.) Electives: a minimum.of four ICS electives including one from each of the following three categories, passed with a grade of B or better: Theory: Fundamentals of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS 260), Data Structures (CS 261), Analysis of Algorithms (CS 263); Architecture/CAD!Hardware: Embedded Computing Systems (CS 244/lnformatics 244), Computer Systems Architectures (CS 250A), Internet (CS 232/EECS248A/Networked Systems 201), Introduc\u00ad tion to Computer Design (CS 252); Software Systems: Human-Computer Interaction (Informatics 231), Advanced Compiler Construction (CS 241), Data Management (CS 222), Software Engineering (Informatics 211), Distributed Com\u00ad puter Systems (CS 230). Two additional breadth electives: that may be chosen by students in consultation with an advisor, and/or may be assigned by the ACE program committee in consultation with the student. These courses will compensate for lacunae in the student's background and may include upper-division undergraduate courses when appropriate and approved in advance by the candidate's advisor. A program faculty member from the School of ICS will advise on elective selection and may be on the thesis committee. Doctor of Philosophy Program The Doctor of Philosophy program offers concentrations in four areas: Computer Science (CS); Informatics (INF); Informatics in Biology and Medicine (IBaM); Statistics (STATS). The program is research oriented and encourages students to work together with faculty to solve advanced problems in computer sci\u00ad ence. The program is designed for full-time study, and the normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years (four years for stu\u00ad dents who entered with a master's degree), with the exception of the Informatics concentration which has a normal time of six years. The maximum time permitted for any of the concentrations is seven years. Students enrolled in the Ph.D. program must maintain satisfactory academic progress. Teaching Requirements for the Ph.D. Program All ICS doctoral students are required to participate in a minimum of two quarters of teaching activities before graduating. Teaching activities in summer or night school or service at other U.S. univer\u00ad sities may be accepted in fulfillment of this requirement. Timeline for the Ph.D. Program All course requirements must be satisfied prior to the student's application for advancement to candidacy. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is three years (two years for students who entered with a master's degree), with the exception of the Informatics concentration which has a normal time of four years. Information on the selection of committees, advancement to candi\u00ad dacy, development of a doctoral dissertation, and final examination on the dissertation is available from the ICS Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and the ICS Graduate Student Affairs Office. CONCENTRATION IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (CS) The field of Computer Science is concerned with the design, analy\u00ad sis, and implementation of computer systems as well ;:ts the use of computation as is applied to virtually every field of study and use in the everyday world. Computer systems can range in scope from tiny embedded systems to the Internet as a whole. Research in computer science involves mathematical analysis, expirical experi\u00ad mentation, and the implementation of prototype systems. Core research areas include artificial intelligence and machine learning, bioinformatics, computer architecture, embedded systems, graphics and visual computing, databases and information management, multimedia, networked and distributed systems, programming lan\u00ad guages and compilers, security and cryptography, design and analy\u00ad sis of algorithms, scientific computing, and ubiquitous computing. The Computer Science concentration is a broad and flexible pro\u00ad gram which offers students opportunities for graduate study in the full spectrum of intellectual activity in computer science. Required Courses Each student must complete at least 38 units with an average GPA of 3.5 and at least a B in each course. Four of these are chosen from a common core; the remaining ones are electives chosen by the student and approved by the student's research advisor. Recom\u00ad mended programs for study within the areas of Computer Science are available from the ICS Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and the ICS Graduate Student Affairs Office. Each student must take ICS 200 (Seminar in Research in ICS) and at least one course from four of the following seven areas listed below: Design and Analysis of Algorithms: CS 260 Computer Archi!ecture and Design: CS 250A System Software: ~S 241 UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Artificial Intelligence: CS 271 Networks and Distributed Systems: CS 232 orCS 230 Database Systems: CS 222 Principles of Scientific Computing: CS 206 orCS 211A The remaining five courses must be approved CS, Informatics, or Statistics lecture courses and cannot include seminars. The selec\u00ad tion of courses must be approved by the student's research advisor. Research Project for the Ph.D. Degree Each student must find a faculty advisor by the end of the second year who agrees to supervise the research project. The student must take at least one independent studies course (CS 299) with the advisor and carry out a research project as part of this course. By the end of the second year, the student must present the out\u00ad come of the research in a technical report, which must be approved by the advisor. Candidacy Examination The objective of the candidacy examination is to demonstrate in\u00ad depth knowledge of an area of computer science and readiness to carry out independent research at the doctoral level in that area. The student must complete all course requirements and the research project prior to advancing to candidacy. All requirements for candidacy except the candidacy exam must be completed by the end of the second year. In addition, the student must at least attempt the candidacy exam by the end of the second year. If the student does not pass the candidacy exam by the end of the second year, the student will be allowed until the end of the first quarter of the third year to pass the exam. The Candidacy Committee will consist of five faculty members, the majority of whom must be members of the student's program, to administer the exam accord\u00ad ing to the UCI Senate regulations. The student takes an oral exam, administered by the five-member committee, during which the stu\u00ad dent is tested on knowledge relevant to the chosen area of special\u00ad ization. Each area is defined by a set of topics and reading list, which are maintained by the Computer Science Department office. Dissertation Topic Defense The student must produce a substantial written document repre\u00ad senting the student's dissertation plan. This must include the pro\u00ad posed dissertation abstract, a dissertation outline, and a detailed plan for completing the work. A dissertation defense committee is formed in accordance with UCI Senate regulations. The disserta\u00ad tion committee must approve the student's proposal. At the discre\u00ad tion of the student's advisor, the student may be required to give an oral presentation of the proposed plan to the committee. This must be completed by the end of the fourth year. Doctoral Dissertation and Final Examination Ph.D. students are required to complete a Ph.D. dissertation in accordance with Academic Senate regulations. In addition, they must pass an oral dissertation defense which consists of a public seminar presenting results followed by a private examination by the doctoral committee and other interested members of the faculty of the Computer S~ience Department. Graduate Program in Mathematical and Computation Biology The graduate program in Mathematical and Computational Biology (MCB) is a one-year \"gateway\" program designed to function in concert with selected department programs, including the Ph.D. concentration in Computer Science. Detailed information is avail\u00ad able online at http://mcsb.bio.uci.edu/ and in the School of Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences section of the Catalogue, page 156. Information and Computer Sciences 349 CONCENTRATION IN INFORMATICS (INF) Informatics is the interdisciplinary study of the design, application, use, and impact of information technology. It goes beyond techni\u00ad cal design to focus on the relationship between information system design and use in real-world settings. These investigations lead to new forms of system architecture, new approaches to system design and development, new means of information system imple\u00ad mentation and deployment, and new models of interaction between technology and social, cultural, and organizational settings. In the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, Informatics is concerned with software architecture, software development, design and analysis, programming languages, ubiqui\u00ad tous computing, information retrieval and management, human\u00ad computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and other topics that lie at the relationship between information tech\u00ad nology design and use in social and organizational settings. Effec\u00ad tive design requires an ability to analyze things from many differ\u00ad ent perspectives, including computer science, information science, organizational science, social science, and cognitive science. Rele\u00ad vant courses in those disciplines are therefore an integral part of the program and give this concentration a unique interdisciplinary flavor-which is imperative as the computing and information technology fields play such a pervasive role in our daily lives. Students who choose the Informatics concentration must complete a Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 200), the Informatics Core, and a focus track in either General Informatics, Software, or Interactive and Collaborative Technology. All courses must be passed with a grade of B or better. Ph.D. students must additionally write a sur\u00ad vey paper with an extensive bibliography, and a research paper of publishable quality. Informatics Core: Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 200), Human\u00ad Computer Interaction (Informatics 231 ), Software Engineering (Informatics 211), Social Analysis of Computing (Informatics 261), three quarters of Seminar in Informatics (Informatics 209S), and two four-unit graduate lecture courses in ICS, outside the field of Informatics. General Informatics Track (INF:GEN) Additional Informatics Core: Introduction Com\u00ad puting (CS 248A/Informatics 241), Information Retrieval, Filter\u00ad ing, and Classification (CS 221). Software Electives: two courses chosen from: Formal Specifica\u00ad tion and Modeling (Informatics 213), Software Architecture (Infor\u00ad matics 221), Software Analysis and Testing (Informatics 215), Software Processes (Informatics 217), Applied Software Design Techniques (Informatics 223), Advanced User Interface Architec\u00ad ture (Informatics 235), Software Environments (Informatics 219).

Special Topics: two courses of Informatics 295 taught by Infor\u00ad matics faculty. M.S. students pursuing the thesis option must substitute two four\u00ad unit courses in Thesis Supervision (CS 298 or Informatics 298) for two courses from the Electives or Special Topics. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 350 UCI 2006-07 Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences Software Track (INF:SW) Software has transformed society in dramatic and powerful ways. From the World Wide Web to pilotless vehicles to spreadsheets, software systems inform, control, and enhance daily activities. Software research at UCI is aimed at creating new software tech\u00ad nology and solutions, furthering the information revolution. Per\u00ad spectives of engineering, science, mathematics, and human-com\u00ad puter interaction guide the work. The central goal of all the research is improvement in software development, evolution, deployment, quality, and cost-effectiveness. Specific research emphases of the faculty members in the concen\u00ad tration include: analysis and testing, software understanding, empirically guided analysis, environments, software architectures, hypermedia, workflow, user interface software, process, formal methods, specification languages, extensible component-based software systems, distributed event-based systems, and program\u00ad ming languages. A valuable and unusual feature of the concentra\u00ad tion is the opportunity to work with the Software group's industrial partners. These companies provide opportunities for internships, support research projects, and provide a test-bed for evaluation of \u00b7-. new ideas. Graduates of the program have taken careers in research universities, industrial research laboratories, colleges, and industry. \u00b7 Background: Students must have basic competency in the follow\u00ad ing computer science topics: programming language concepts, data structures, analysis of algorithms, automata theory or formal lan\u00ad guages, artificial intelligence, computer architecture, and operating systems. The software faculty will evaluate, upon entry to the Ph.D. program, whether a student has satisfied these requirements through courses taken previously (e.g., at the undergraduate level) or through equivalent experience. Satisfaction of any unfulfilled requirements may be achieved through either graduate or under\u00ad graduate classes in an individualized program worked out with a Software area graduate advisor. Required Courses Software Electives: five courses from Knowledge-Based User Interfaces (Informatics 233), Formal Specification and Modeling (Informatics 213), Software Architecture (Informatics 221), Soft\u00ad ware Analysis and Testing (Informatics 215), Software Processes (Informatics 217), Applied Software Design Techniques (lnformat\u00ad ics 223), Advanced User Interface Architectures (Informatics 235), Software Environments (Informatics 219), Special Topics taught by Software area faculty (Informatics 295; no more than two). ICS Breadth: three graduate courses outside of Software, drawn from a list maintained by the Software faculty. M.S. students pursuing the thesis option must substitute two four\u00ad unit courses in Thesis Supervision (CS 298 or Informatics 298) for ;: two of the Software Electives. Interactive and Collaborative Technology Track (INF:ICT) UCI enjoys an international reputation for its research on the human and social dimensions of computer system design and use. There are two principal strands to this work. The first concerns the interaction between people and computers, including novel forms of interactive experience beyond traditional desktop computing. The second concerns the role that computer systems can play in collaborative work between individuals, groups, and organizations. T:; Examples of topics that ICT researchers investigate include: adop\u00ad ' tion and systems; universal interactive sys\u00ad tems; design principles for information visualization; and new patterns of computer-mediated work such as virtual teams. The approach used places equal emphasis on three areas of investi\u00ad gation-empirical, theoretical, and technical. The empirical work involves studying technology in use, using both laboratory tech\u00ad niques and fieldwork investigations of real-world settings. The theoretical research employs and develops analytic understanding of the relationships among technology, people, organizations, and social settings. Finally, in the technical work, ICT researchers \u00b7 develop new models and. technologies for interaction with and col\u00ad laboration through technology. Students in the ICT track gain a thorough grounding in all three areas. The cornerstone of this approach is to study real use of technology, as it occurs in real-world settings. ICT researchers believe that the success or failure of technology depends on how people can fit that technology into real practice, balancing technical, cognitive, social, and cultural dimensions. Using an interdisciplinary approach, ICT research aims at a deeper understanding of interaction with and collaboration through technology, and at exploiting these insights for the design of better systems. Required Courses ICT Electives (group 1): two courses chosen from: Computeriza\u00ad tion, Work, and Organizations (Informatics 263), Theories puterization and Information Systems (Informatics 265), Qualita\u00ad tive Research Methods in Information Systems (Informatics 203) or Social Ecology 217 or Management 290, Quantitative Research Methods in Information Systems (Informatics 205) or Descriptive Multivariate Statistics I (Informatics 207) or Social Science 201A\u00ad B. ICT Electives (group 2): two courses chosen from: Introduction to Ubiquitous Computing (CS 248AIInformatics 241), Knowledge\u00ad Based User Interfaces (Informatics 233), Advanced User Interface Architectures (Informatics 235), Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (Informatics 251). ICT Breadth: Students must choose four courses outside of Infor\u00ad matics that form a coherent area of study. Students are encouraged, but not required, to take them outside of ICS. A maximum of two ICT Electives may be substituted by Informat\u00ad ics 295 courses taught by ICT faculty. M.S. students pursuing the thesis option must substitute two four-unit courses in Thesis Super\u00ad vision (CS 298 or Informatics 298) for two of the ICS Breadth courses. CONCENTRATION IN INFORMATICS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE (IBAM) Biology and medicine have become data-intensive information sci\u00ad ences. Massive data acquisition technologies, such as sequencing, high-throughput drug screening, and DNA arrays, gen\u00ad erate information in quantities that overwhelm conven\u00ad tional approaches. Cost-effective health care and quality medical decision-making require integrating large amounts of up-to-date information and knowledge. Biological systems have also inspired computer science advances with new concepts, including genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, computer viruses and syn\u00ad thetic immune systems, DNA computing, artificial life, and hybrid VLSI-DNA gene chips. New computational opportunities such as these create a critical need for theoretical and algorithmic advances in storing, retrieving, networking, processing, analyzing, and visu\u00ad alizing biomedical information. Informatics in Biology and Medicine is an interdisciplinary con\u00ad centration at the interface between computer sciences, biological sciences, and medicine. It addresses problems that are specific to the information technologies in biology, medicine, and health care. Research topics include gene finding, protein structure and func\u00ad tion prediction, structural and functional genomics, proteomics, electronic patient record systems, medical decision support sys\u00ad tems, guideline-based health care, medical information access, and human-computer interfaces for medical applications. To make advances in these areas, society needs people with knowledge and skills that bridge those taught in conventional biological, medical, UC IRVINE - 2006-2007and computer science curricula. This area provides for such an interdisciplinary computer science education. Background: Students should have already taken at least one undergraduate course in basic biology, or must make up that deficit during their first year with one of these courses:.

Additional Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Each student must write a survey paper and a research paper of publishable quality and pass a comprehensive examination prior to advancing to candidacy. CONCENTRATION IN STATISTICS (STATS) Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting empirical data. Statistical principles and methods are important for addressing questions in public policy, medicine, industry, and vir\u00ad tually every branch of science. Interest in statistical methods has increased dramatically with the abundance of large databases in Information and Computer Sciences 351 fields like computer science (Internet and Web traffic), business and marketing (transaction records), and biology (the human genome and related data). It is the substantive questions in the var\u00ad ious areas of application that drive the development of new statisti\u00ad cal methods and motivate the mathematical study of the properties of these methods. Research in Statistics can range from mathematical studies of the theoretical underpinnings of a statistical model or method to the development of novel statistical models and methods and a thor\u00ad ough study of their properties. Frequently, statistics research is motivated and informed by collaborations with experts in a particu\u00ad lar substantive field. Their scientific studies and data collection efforts may yield complex data that cannot be adequately handled using standard statistical methodology. Statisticians aim to develop methods that address the scientific or policy questions of the researcher. In doing so, statisticians must consider how efficiently and effectively the proposed methodology can be implemented and what guarantees can be provided as to the performance of the pro\u00ad posed methods. Such questions can often be answered using a com\u00ad bination of mathematical, analytical, and computational techniques. Background: Individuals from a variety of backgrounds can make significant contributions to the field of statistics as long as they have sufficient background in statistics, mathematics, and comput\u00ad ing. Undergraduate preparation in statistics, mathematics, and com\u00ad puting should include multivariate calculus (the equivalent algebra statistics (Sta\u00ad tistics 120A-B-C), and basic computing (ICS 21). For students with undergraduate majors outside of mathematics and statistics, it is possible to make up one or two missing courses during the first year in the program. Required Courses Statistics Course Requirements: Intermediate Probability and Sta\u00ad tistics (Statistics 200A-B-C); Statistical Methodology (Statistics 210, 211, 212); five other graduate courses in or related to statis\u00ad tics, at least three of which are offered by the Statistics Depart\u00ad ment. (For M.S. students pursuing the thesis option, two of the five courses must be substituted with two four-unit courses in Thesis Supervision, Statistics 298, CS 298, or Informatics 298.) ICS Breadth Requirement: Two courses in ICS outside of Statistics: one in Informatics and one in Computer Sciences. The entire program of courses must be approved by the Statistics Department Graduate Committee. Students with previous graduate training in statistics may petition the Committee to substitute other courses for a subset of the required courses. Other Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Additional courses required of Ph.D. students: Advanced Probabil\u00ad ity and Statistics Topics (Statistics 220A-B); Statistical Computing (Statistics 230). Each Ph.D. student is required to take a comprehensive examina\u00ad tion, ordinarily at the end of the first year, covering the material from Statistics 200A-B-C, 210, 211, and 212. Ph.D. students are required to demonstrate substantive knowledge of an application area outside of statistics (e.g., computer science, economics, cognitive sciences, biology, or medicine). Such knowl\u00ad edge can be demonstrated by course work in the application area (three quarter courses), co-authorship of publishable research in the application area, or other evidence of supervised collaborative work that is substantiated by an expert in the field. In the case of a theoretically oriented student, the outside application area may be mathematics.

Sereseres, Ph.D. University of California, Riverside, Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies, School of Social Sciences, and Associate Professor of Political Science James Diego Vigil, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Professor of Social Ecology Chicana/Latino Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to provide undergraduate students with an opportunity to examine the h!storical and contemporary experiences of Americans of Latin American origin. This diverse population includes people who trace their heritage to Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and many other Latin American and Caribbean nations. The curriculum seeks to provide an awareness, knowledge, and appreciation of the language,_history, culture, liter\u00ad ature, sociology, anthropology, politics, soc!al ecology, health, medicine, and creative (art, dance, drama, film, music) accomplish\u00ad ments in Chicana/Latino communities. The Program offers a B.A. degree in Chicano/Latina Studies and a minor. Change of Major. Students who wish to change their major to Chicana/Latino Studies should contact the program office for information about change of major requirements, procedures, and policies. Information is also available at http://www.due.uci.edu/ Change_of_Major.html. Center for Research on Latinos in a Global Society Interdisciplinary research in Chicano/Latina Studies is conducted under the auspices of the Center for Research on Latinos in a Global Society (CRLGS). Its multifold goals are: (1) to examine the emerging role of Latinos as actors in global economic, politi\u00ad cal, and cultural events; (2) to promote Latino scholarship; (3) to enhance the quality of research in Latino studies; (4) to provide a forum for intellectual exchange and the dissemination of research finding; and (5) to promote the participation of undergraduate and graduate students in research on Latino issues. The use of the term \"global society\" underscores the faculty's perception that, as a society, the United States is becoming \"globalized,\" meaning that it is increasingly affected by worldwide economic, political, demo\u00ad graphic, and cultural forces and that Latinos are at the center of this. Latinos in the United States, individually and as a sociopoliti\u00ad cal group, play important roles in the multiple processes-immi\u00ad gration, trade, international capital flow, and international political movements-which are changing the traditional demarcation between domestic and foreign, and national and international poli\u00ad tics, economics, and society. Scholarship Opportunities The Jeff Garcilazo Fellowship/Scholarship Fund, in honor and memory of the late Chicana/Latino Studies and History professor, was established to provide opportunities for students to examine the historical and contemporary experiences of Americans of Latin American origin. Funds are awarded to current UCI students. The Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), formerly the National His\u00ad panic Scholarship Fund, awards scholarships annually to students enrolled in and attending an accredited college full-time from the fall through the spring (or summer) terms. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007358 UCI 2006-07 Interdisciplinary Studies CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Many career opportunities exist for students who graduate with a B.A. degree in Chicano!Latino Studies, such as service with national and international organizations which see~. knowledge of American multicultural society in general, and of Chicano/Latino peoples and cultures in particular; positions as area specialists with state and federal government agencies; careers in t,he private sector with corporations or private organizations which have a significant portion of their activities in the U.S. and Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, and other Latin American coun\u00ad tries; and positions of service and leadership within Chicano/ Latino communities such as education, human serv.ices, law, health fields, journalism, and public policy. Students may also continue their education and pursue professional or graduate degrees. Employers and admission officers understand that many of their employees and graduates will one day work in communities with significant Chicano/Latino populations, and for this reason they give due consideration to applicants who have in-depth knowledge of Chicano/Latino culture. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. Requirements\u00b7 for the Major A. Familiarity with basic mathematical, computational, and statisti\u00ad cal tools underlying modern social sciences. This requirement is met by passing a three-course sequence in mathematics selected from Anthropology lOA-B-C, Mathematics 2A-B, 7, Psychol\u00ad ogy lOA-B-C, Social Science IOA-B-C, Social Science IOOA-B\u00ad C, or Sociology IOA-B-C. Computer education is essential for a complete social science education. This requirement can be sat\u00ad isfied by passing Information and Computer Science lOA, lOB, or 21, or Social Science 3A. This course requirement should be taken during the student's first year. (NOTE: ICS lOA, lOB, 21, and Social Science lOOA may be taken Pass/Not Pass.) B. An understanding of the fundamental concepts, analytical tools, and methods of social science. This requirement is met by tak\u00ad ing two four-unit introductory courses in the School of Social Sciences bearing a one-digit course number. These courses nor\u00ad mally should be taken during the student's first year. C. Five core courses: Chicano/Latino Studies 61, 62, 63, 101, 102. D. Spanish 2A or its equivalent; students are encouraged to con\u00ad tinue their Spanish language education through Spanish 2C. E. One comparative ethnic studies course selected from either African American Studies, Asian American Studies, or Educa\u00ad tion 124. Course must focus on the study of African American or Asian American communities in the U.S. F. Four upper-division electives are required; each course must be completed in a separate category selected from the following six: Literature, Arts, Media, Culture (Chicano/Latino Studies 110-129); History (Chicano/Latino Studies 130-139); Society, Labor, Politics, Law, Gender, Race, Ethnicity (Chicano/Latino Studies 140-159); Globalization, Transnationalism, Immigra\u00ad tion, Medicine, Dynamics (Chicano/Latino Studies 170-179); Educational Policy and Issues (Chicano/ Latino Studies 180-189). G. Three additional elective courses, two of which must be upper\u00ad division, selected from Chicano/Latino Studies courses. Elec\u00ad tives may include Field Research/Independent Studies courses (Chicano!Latino Studies 190-199). Students may obtain credit for one of these three courses through participation in a study abroad program in Mexico. Students must consult with the Pro\u00ad gram office for additional information regarding this option. Residence Requirement for the Major: A minimum of five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Courses taken through the UC Education Abroad Program will be counted toward satisfaction of the resi\u00ad dence requirement by student petition and upon prior approval of course content by the Chicano/Latino Studies Program Committee. Optional Independent Research Project Students are encouraged to pursue field research and write a sub\u00ad stantial research paper on topics of their choice urider the guidance of Chicano/Latino faculty members. Often, this project will grow out of issues examined in Chicano/Latino Studies 102 (Research Seminar). Research projects typically involve a combination of library research and fieldwork in a local \"Chicano/Latino commu\u00ad nity.\" Methods and analytical frameworks vary depending on the student and faculty advisors. Interested students should enroll in Chicano/Latino Studies 199 (Independent Study). Honors Program in Chicana/Latino Studies The Honors Program in Chicano/Latino Studies is designed to allow undergraduates to pursue field research and write an honors thesis on topics of their choice under the guidance of Chicano/ Latino Studies faculty members. Research projects typically involve a combination of library research and field research. The program is open to all senior Chicano/Latino Studies majors with a grade point average of 3.3 or better overall, with 3.5 in Chicano/ Latino Studies courses (at least five courses). Prior completion of or concurrent enrollment in Chicano/Latino Studies 101 (Research in the Latino Community) is strongly recommended. Successful completion of the Honors Program and the honors thesis satisfies the upper-division writing requirement. Although course work for the Honors Program does not start until the senior year, it is highly recommended that during the spring quarter of the junior year, students find a professor willing to serve as their research project advisor on the basis of a mutually accept\u00ad able abstract that indicates the goal and significance of their pro\u00ad ject. If extensive research is to be undertaken at this time, students should enroll in Chicano!Latino Studies 199. During the fall quarter of the senior year, students enroll in Chi\u00ad cano/Latina Studies Hl90A and write a proposal describing their research question, the relevant background literature, and the method of data collection and analysis. Field work for the project\u00b7 may begin during this quarter. In the winter quarter of the senior year, students begin or continue their research by enrolling in Chicano/Latino Studies Hl90B. In the spring quarter of the senior year, students enroll in Chicano/ Latino Studies Hl90C and complete a senior honors thesis. Honors theses are read and evaluated by the advisor and a second faculty member chosen by the Director of the Chicano/Latino Studies Pro\u00ad gram in consultation with the advisor. Requirements for the Minor Completion of three core courses: Chicano/Latino Studies 61, 62, 63; three upper-division courses selected from Chicano/Latino Studies 100-179; and Spanish 2A or its equivalent. Residence Requirements for the Minor: Other than the language requirement, no more than two courses taken at other academic institutions may be used toward satisfaction of minor. In addition to satisfying the requirements for the major or minor, . students are encouraged to take advantage of the variety of unique educational opportunities available at UCI. Through the Education Abroad Program (EAP), students receive academic credit while studying at universities in Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica, Brazil, or UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Spain. Internship opportunities with private and public institutions concerned with the Chicano/Latino communities are available in Orange County, Sacramento, and Washington, D.C. Independent research with faculty on Chicano/Latino issues is also encouraged. Student research is conducted and given academic credit through independent study or group research courses offered in each acade\u00ad mic unit. The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) and the Summer Academic Enrichment Program (SAEP) are examples of programs at UCI which allow students to work as research assistants with professors.

UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 362 UCI 2006-07 Interdisciplinary Studies Undergraduate Major in Computer Science and Engineering The undergraduate program in Computer Science and Engineering is administered by faculty from two academic units: the Department of Computer Science (CS) in the Donald Bren School of Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Sciences, and the Department of Electrical Engi\u00ad neering and Computer Sciences (EECS) in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. For faculty listings from respective depart\u00ad ments, see pages 338 and 230. Successful completion of the pro\u00ad gram leads to a B.S. degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Program Educational Objectives: Graduates of the program will (1) demonstrate broad knowledge of computer science and engi\u00ad neering; (2) design, describe, and use state-of-the-art hardware/ software systems; (3) maintain awareness of contemporary issues in computer science and engineering in a global and societal con\u00ad text and an understanding of the professional and ethical responsi\u00ad bilities of their profession; (4) demonstrate effective oral and writ\u00ad ten communication. (Program educational objectives are those aspects of computer science and engineering that help shape the curriculum; achievement of these objectives is a shared responsi\u00ad bility between the student and UCI.) This program is designed to, provide students with the fundamen\u00ad tals of computer science, both hardware and software, and the application of engineering concepts, techniques, and methods to both computer systems engineering and software system design. The program gives students access to multidisciplinary problems in engineering with a focus on total systems engineering. Students learn the computer science principles that are critical to develop\u00ad ment of software, hardware, and networking of computer systems. From that background, engineering concepts and methods are added to give students exposure to circuit design, network design, and digital signal processing. Elements of engineering practice include systems view, manufacturing and economic issues, and multidisciplinary engineering applications. Career Paths. Most likely careers will involve building the hard\u00ad ware infrastructure--computers, networks, embedded devices, as well as operating systems, compilers, and networking software. The focus is on cooperation between hardware and software to yield the highest performance. Examples of such problem areas would be in traffic management, flight control, earthquake moni\u00ad toring, automotive control, and smart homes. ADMISSIONS High School Students: Students must have completed four years of mathematics through pre-calculus or math analysis and are advised to have completed one year each of chemistry and physics. One semester of programming course work is also advised. That preparation, along with honors courses and advanced placement courses, is fundamental to success in the program. UCI requires applicants to take two SAT Subject Tests, selected from two different subject areas, for example, science and history/social studies, or literature and language. If one of the selected subject areas is mathematics, applicants must take Math Level 2. Also, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering recom\u00ad mends that freshmen applicants in Engineering majors take the SAT Subject Test, Math Level 2, as one of the two required SAT Subject areas. Transfer Students. Students are encouraged to complete as many of the lower-division degree requirements as possible prior to transfer, including one year of calculus, one year of calculus-based physics (mechanics, electricity, and magnetism with laboratory), one year of programming with at least one course in object-ori\u00ad ented programming (Java recommended), and one additional approved transferable course for the major (an approved math, sci\u00ad ence, or CSE course). Students who enroll at UCI in need of com\u00ad pleting lower-division course work may find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degrees.

Bryant and Peter A. Bowler, Co-Directors Core Faculty Peter A. Bowler, Ph.D. University of California, Irvine, Director of the UC/ Arboretum, UC Natural Reserve System Academic Coordinator. and Senior Lecturer with Security of Employment, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and Social Ecology Peter J. Bryant, Ph.D. University of Sussex, Director of the Graduate Program in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Biochemistry and Professor of Developmental and Cell Biology Michael L. Burton, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Anthropology and Social Ecology William S. Reeburgh, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Professor of Earth System Science Susan E. Trumbore, Ph.D. Columbia University, Professor of Earth System Science The interdisciplinary minor in Global Sustainability trains students to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the human population to live in a sustainable relationship with the resources available on this planet. As a result of population growth and the pursuit of higher stan\u00ad dards of living, humanity has initiated many global trends that can\u00ad not be sustained indefinitely. Some of these trends are physico\u00ad chemical in nature, such as the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and the increasing pollution of our environment, including the accumu\u00ad lation of ozone-depleting chemicals with consequent increase of ultraviolet radiation at the earth's surface, and the buildup of car\u00ad bon dioxide that is almost certainly causing global warming. Other trends are biological ones including the degradation of agricultural land, the destruction of many kinds of wildlife habitat with associ\u00ad ated high rates of species extinction, and the depletion of wildlife populations by over-exploitation. Global changes are also taking place in the human situation including loss of cultural diversity, a growing income gap between rich and poor nations leading to deepening poverty and additional pressure for biological resource exploitation, accelerating urbanization with associated social prob\u00ad lems, and regional population and economic imbalances leading to escalating political tensions and potential for conflict. This program examines the causes of, and interrelationships between, these prob\u00ad lems and considers new approaches to solving them. Its goal is to provide broad, interdisciplinary training that will allow students to better understand and effectively deal with the serious environmen\u00ad tal problems that we will face in the twenty-first century. The minor is open to all UCI students. Course descriptions are available in the academic department sections of the Catalogue.

Weinberger, Ph.D. Case Western Reserve University, Professor of Neurobiology and Behavior Peter Woodruff, Ph.D. University of Pittsburgh, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy The minor in the History and Philosophy of Science is intended for students who wish to study the history of science, the philosophical foundations of scientific inquiry, and the relationship between sci\u00ad ence and other fields. The history of science explores how science is actually done and how it has influenced history. This may involve tracking down an idea's source or its influences, evaluating the cul\u00ad tural forces at work in the generation of a scientific theory or the reaction of culture to science, or taking a detailed look at the work of a particular scientist or movement within science. The philosophy of science is concerned with determining what sci\u00ad ence and mathematics are, accounting for their apparent successes, and resolving problems of philosophical interest that arise in the sciences. Philosophy of science courses cover such topics as the role of logic and language in science and in mathematics, scientific explanation, evidence, and probability. These courses may also Interdisciplinary Studies 365 cover work that has been done on the philosophical problems in specific sciences-for example, the direction of time in physics, the model of mind in psychology, the structure of evolution theory in biology, and the implications of GOdel's incompleteness theorems for mathematics.\u00b7 The minor is available to all UCI students. Course descriptions may be found in the academic department sections of the Catalogue. Requirements for the Minor Completion of seven courses as follows: 1.

The program offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Networked Systems. The Networked Systems program provid~s education and research opportunities to graduate students in the areas of computer net\u00ad works and telecommunication networks. Networked Systems include telephone networks, cable TV networks, cellular phone networks, and the Internet, as well as other emerging networks. Networked Systems are inherently interdisciplinary. By their design, they connect devices such as computers and phones using communications methods. Networked Systems therefore must address the combination of software, hardware, and communica\u00ad tions. As a result, the Networked Systems area spans traditional departmental boundaries. At a minimum, the area draws heavily from Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. At UCI, these areas are housed in two departments, CS and EECS. The Networked Systems program unites the strengths of these two departments and provides integrated M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in this area. Program requirements include core, breadth, and concentration courses. The core courses are taken by all Networked Systems stu\u00ad dents and form a foundation for networking topics. The breadth courses may be selected from technical courses (including distrib\u00ad uted systems, algorithms, data structures, operating systems, data\u00ad bases, random processes, and linear systems) and management and applications of technology (including educational technology, man\u00ad agement of information technology, and social impact). The con\u00ad centration courses may be selected from a long list including . courses on networks; performance, middleware, communications, and operations research. Core, breadth, and concentration course lists are available on the Networked Systems Web site at http://www. networkedsystems.uci.edu or from the Networked Systems Pro\u00ad gram Office. As an alternative to the Networked Systems program, students interested in networks may wish to consider: the Systems concen\u00ad tration, offered by the CS Department, which includes courses in networks, compilers, computer architecture, distributed systems, algorithms, and data structures; the Computer Networks and Dis\u00ad tributed Computing concentration, offered by the EECS Depart\u00ad ment, which includes courses in networks, algorithms, operating systems, databases, and computer architecture; or the Electrical Engineering concentration, offered by the EECS Department, which includes courses in networks, random processes, communi\u00ad cations, linear systems, and signal processing. Admission Prospective graduate students apply directly to the Networked Sys\u00ad tems program, specifying whether they wish to pursue the M.S. degree only, the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, or the Ph.D. degree only. Applicants who do not hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Sci\u00ad ence, Computer Engineering, or Electrical Engineering may be required to take supplementary course work to demonstrate suffi\u00ad cient background in the field. Applicants are evaluated on the basis of their prior academic record and their potential for creative research and teaching, as demonstrated in their application materials including official uni\u00ad versity transcripts, letters of recommendation, GRE test scores, and statement of purpose. Master of Science Program Students pursuing the M.S. degree may choose either Plan I (The\u00ad sis Plan) or Plan II (Comprehensive Examination Plan.) Both plans require the completion of three core courses; three courses chosen from the breadth course list, with at most two chosen from the Management and Applications of Technology list; and five courses chosen from the concentration course lists, with at least one course chosen from at least three different concentrations. Students following Plan I complete the 11 courses above and a thesis. Students following Plan II must complete two additional courses chosen with the approval of the advisor, for a total of 13 courses. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Doctor of Philosophy Program The Ph.D. degree requires the following 15 courses: three core courses; four courses chosen from the breadth course list, with at most two chosen from the Management and Applications of Tech\u00ad nology list; six courses chosen from the concentration course lists, with at least one course chosen from at least three different con\u00ad centrations; and two additional courses, chosen with the approval of the research advisor. Students must also complete three teaching practicum courses (ICS 399) and a dissertation. Courses applied to the M.S. degree can also be applied to the Ph.D. degree. Students who have taken similar graduate-level courses at another university may petition to apply these courses to the Ph.D. requirements. Ph.D. students who have served as teaching assis\u00ad tants, readers, or tutors at another university may petition to apply this experience toward the teaching practicum requirement. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is three years (two for students who entered with a master's degree). The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is six years (five for students who entered with a master's degree), and the maximum time permitted is seven years.

UC IRVINE - 2006-2007SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES Ronald J. Stern, Dean 180 Rowland Hall Academic Counseling: (949) 824-6507 World Wide Web: http://www.physsci.uci.edu/ The School of Physical Sciences offers both professional training and general education in the Departments of Chemistry, Earth Sys\u00ad tem Science, Mathematics, and Physics and Astronomy. The fac\u00ad ulty, active .in research and graduate education, are at the same time vitally concerned with undergraduate teaching. Curricula of the School are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of stu\u00ad dents ranging from those with little technical background who seek insight into the activities and accomplishments of physical scien\u00ad tists to those seeking a comprehensive understanding that will pre\u00ad pare them for creative research in physical science. Over the course of the past century and a half, physics, chemistry, and mathematics have evolved into interdependent but separate intellectual disciplines. This development is reflected in the depart\u00ad mental structure of the School of Physical Sciences. In the same period, these fundamental disciplines have moved into domains of abstraction unimagined by early scientists. This trend to abstraction with its concomitant increase in understanding of the physical uni\u00ad verse provides the major challenge to the student of the physical sciences. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry, while providing the foundation of the technology that dominates contemporary civiliza\u00ad tion, underlie to an ever-increasing extent the new developments in the biological and social sciences. Earth system science is grounded in the traditional physical sciences while breaking new paths in the quantitative study of changes in the global environment. DEGREES Chemistry ............................................................... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Earth and Honors Criteria used by the School of Physical Sciences in selecting candi\u00ad dates for honors at graduation are as follows: Approximately 1 per\u00ad cent will be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. Honors are awarded on the basis of a student's performance in research, cumulative grade point average., and performance in upper-division courses in the major. Students considered for honors at graduation must have completed 72 units in residence at a University of California campus by the end of the winter quarter of the academic year in which they grad\u00ad uate. Other important factors are considered (see page 55). The School of Physical Sciences also grants special honors to students who have distinguished themselves by their work in their major subject. Undergraduate Programs Each department offers courses that are of value to nonmajors and majors in the sciences. The programs for majors are designed to meet the needs of students planning careers in business or industry, of students planning advanced professional study, and of students planning graduate work that continues their major interest. Stu\u00ad dents who wish to complete a coordinated set of courses beyond the introductory level in Mathematics and in Earth and Atmos\u00ad pheric Sciences may pursue minors in these areas. Introductory courses in chemistry, mathematics, and physics meet the needs of students majoring in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering and. are also appropriate for students in other disciplines who seek a rigorous introduction to the physical sciences. In addition, a number of courses within the School have few or no prerequisites and are directed particularly toward students majoring in areas remote from the sciences. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Students who choose a major in the School of Physical Sciences have a variety of academic advising and counseling resources avail\u00ad able to them. In addition to faculty advisors, there is a Chief Acade\u00ad mic Advisor in each department who is responsible for interpreting degree requirements, reviewing student petitions, and assisting with special advising problems. An academic advising and counseling staff, employed in the Associate Dean's Office, is available to serve a broad range of student advising needs. In consultation with their faculty advisor or an academic counselor, students should plan a course of study leading to a major in one of the departments of the School. In carrying out this major, students may often concentrate very heavily in a second department within the School or in some other school. Occasionally students choose to pursue a double major. Permission to do so may be sought by a petition submitted to the Office of the Associate Dean of Physical Sciences. All initial courses of study for majors include mathematics through calculus, and calculus is a prerequisite for much of the upper-divi\u00ad sion work in each major. A student interested in any of the physi\u00ad cal sciences should continue mathematical training beyond these prerequisite courses. Furthermore, students interested in either physics or chemistry usually will include work in both of these subjects in their undergraduate careers. Students in the physical sciences are urged to acquire a working knowledge of computer programming at an early stage of their University studies. This can be accomplished by taking Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science 21, Chemistry 5, Engineering CEElO, MAElO, or Physics 53. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES The majority of graduates continue their education beyond the Bachelor's degree level. Many pursue advanced academic degrees in preparation for careers in scientific or medical research, engi\u00ad neering, or postsecondary education. Other students will complete a secondary education credential in order to prepare for careers teaching high school mathematics and science. Some students enter professional school in areas such as medicine, dentistry, law, or business administration. Students who choose not to continue their studies beyond the baccalaureate level most frequently find employment in private business or industry. In\u00b7addition to technical areas directly related to their major fields of study, students often enter careers in less obviously related fields such as computing, systems analysis, engineering, journalism, marketing, or sales. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. SPECIAL PROGRAMS Preparation for Teaching Science and Mathematics Students interested in teaching science and mathematics should consider the programs in science and mathematics education offered by the Departments of Chemistry, Mathematics, and UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 370 UCI 2006-07 School of Physical Sciences Physics and Astronomy. The concentration in Chemistry Educa\u00ad tion, the specialization in Mathematics for Education, and the con\u00ad centration in Physics Education each provide strong grounding in the fundamentals of one discipline. At the same time, these pro\u00ad grams emphasize the breadth in natural sciences needed to satisfy the requirements for the secondary teaching credential during the mandatory year of study following award of the B.S. degree.

The curriculum of the Department is designed to sat\u00ad isfy the diverse needs of these students and others who may have occasion to study chemistry. The year course Chemistry lA-B-C (or the Honors sequence Chemistry H2A-B-C) is prerequisite to all study in the Department at more advanced levels. The subject mat\u00ad ter of this course serves also as.a thorough introduction to the var\u00ad ied aspects of modem chemistry for students who do not wish to pursue their studies beyond the introductory level. In order to enroll in Chemistry lA, students must pass the Chem\u00ad istry Placement Examination, which is given in late spring, sum\u00ad mer, and during Orientation Week prior to the beginning of fall quarter. A preparatory course, Chemistry lP, is offered in summer Chemistry 371 and fall for those who do not pass the Chemistry Placement Exam\u00ad ination or who need additional preparation prior to entering Chem\u00ad istry lA. A grade of Cor better in Chemistry lP automatically qualifies the student for Chemistry lA. Completion of a one-year sequence in organic chemistry, either Chemistry 51 A-B-C or H52A-B-C, is required for Chemistry majors and for students of the life sciences. Certain advanced courses required of Chemistry majors may also be of interest to others. The undergraduate program of the Chemistry Department empha\u00ad sizes close contact with research. Chemistry majors are urged to engage in research or independent study under the direction of a faculty member. A handout describing the procedures for arranging an undergraduate research opportunity is available from the Chem\u00ad istry Undergraduate Program Office, 1202 Natural Sciences II. Much of the important chemical literature is being and has been printed in foreign languages, principally German, Russian, Japanese, \u00b7 Chinese, and French. Reading competence in one or more of these languages is desirable, and Chemistry majors are encouraged to acquire this competence. Chemistry majors who are interested in teaching chemistry at the secondary level are urged to consider completing the optional con\u00ad centration in Chemistry Education. A two-year post-baccalaureate program for the M.S. in Chemistry and a California Secondary Teaching Credential is described in the Chemistry Graduate Pro\u00ad gram section. Chemistry majors who plan subsequent study in medical, dental, or other professional schools \u00b7should request information concerning admission requirements directly from the schools which they seek to enter. Counseling about preparation for a career in the health sciences is provided by the health science advisors in the School of Biological Sciences. Those intending to pursue graduate studies in chemistry should discuss their plans with a faculty member no later than the fall quarter of their senior year. Admission to the Major Students may be admitted to the Chemistry major upon entering the University as freshmen, via change of major, and as transfer students from other colleges and universities. Information about change of major policies is available in the Physical Sciences Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office and at http://www.due.uci.edu/Change_of_ Major.html. For transfer student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the foilowing required courses: one year of general chemistry with laboratory and one year of approved calculus. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: None. Departmental Requirements Basic Requirements: Mathematics 2A-B-D, 7B-D-E 7LB-LD, Chemistry lA-B-C and LC H52A-B-C H52LA-LB-LC), Chemistry 107 107L, 131A-B-C (or 130A-B-C), Chemistry 151 and 151L.

(Chemistry 180 can be counted toward this requirement no more than once.) At least three of the courses used to satisfy the Elective Require\u00ad ment must be courses offered by the Chemistry Department, including at least one lecture course and one laboratory course. Optional American Chemical Society Certification: For ACS Certification the program must include Biological Sciences 98 or Chemistry 128; Mathematics 2J and 3D. Optional Concentration in Biochemistry: The program must include Biological Sciences 97, 98, 99; Chemistry 128, 128L; and three advanced biology in Chemistry Education: The program must include Education 173 (or 176), Physical Sciences 114 (two quarters), and three science breadth electives offered by one department from the following list: Earth System Science 51, 53, 55, 122, 130, 164; Mathematics 2E, 2J, 3A, 3D, 7; Physics 20A, 51 A, SIB. One quarter of Physical Sciences 114 can be replaced by one quarter of Chemistry 191 or 192. The Chemistry elective requirement is reduced for students in this concentration to two lecture courses and two laboratory courses. Of these, three must be courses offered by the Chemistry Department. HONORS PROGRAM IN CHEMISTRY The Honors Program in Chemistry is a research-based program offered to selected Chemistry majors during their final year. Appli\u00ad cants to the program must have completed their junior year with a grade point average of at least 3.3 overall and in their Chemistry courses. They must also have demonstrated the potential of carrying out research of honors quality, as judged by the Chemistry faculty member who will supervise their research. Students in this program enroll in Honors Research in Chemistry (Chemistry H180A-B-C) throughout their senior year and submit a formal thesis late in the spring quarter. They also enroll in the Honors Seminar in Chem\u00ad istry (Chemistry H181), in which they receive instruction in scien\u00ad tific writing and present a formal research seminar. Successful completion of Chemistry H181 satisfies the UCI upper-division writing requirement. Students who complete these requirements, whose grade point average remains above the 3.3 standard, and whose research is judged to be of honors quality will graduate with Departmental Honors in Chemistry. The Department also offers an Honors General Chemistry sequence, H2A-B-C. This course in general chemistry is designed for mem\u00ad bers of the Campuswide Honors Program (CHP) and other highly qualified students. It covers the same material as Chemistry lA-B-. C, but in greater depth. Additional information is available from the Chemistry Undergradu\u00ad ate Program Office. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The departmental requirements leave the student a great deal of lat\u00ad itude in choice of courses; the student can choose to pursue inter\u00ad ests ranging from biochemistry on the one hand to chemical physics on the other. Many of the basic requirements above coin\u00ad cide with those of the School of Biological Sciences. For this rea\u00ad son a double major in Chemistry and Biological Sciences is popu\u00ad lar. The Department is approved by the American Chemical Society to offer an undergraduate degree certified by the Society as suitable background for a career in chemistry or for graduate study in chemistry. While it is not mandatory, it is desirable for students to pursue a course of study that the Department judges to merit a certified degree. Specifically, the following courses must be included in the program of study: Biological Sciences 98 or Chem\u00ad istry 128; and Mathematics 2J and 3D. These courses must be taken for a letter grade. , Students should consult with their academic advisors on courses of study. A Chemistry major normally takes Chemistry lA-B-C and ILA-LB-LC (or H2A-B-C and H2LA-LB-LC), Mathematics 2A-B\u00ad D, and required writing courses during the freshman year. Students are encouraged to enroll in at least one freshman seminar during the freshman year; freshman seminars probe timely scientific top\u00ad ics and allow students to interact with faculty in an intimate envi\u00ad ronment. The sophomore year should include Chemistry 5, 51A-B\u00ad C, and 51LA-LB-LC (or H52A-B-C and H52LA-LB-LC); the Physics 7 sequence should be completed no later than the fall quar\u00ad ter of the junior year. The balance of the freshman and sophomore program can be chosen at the student's discretion with considera\u00ad tion given to progress toward completion of the UCI breadth requirement. In the junior year all Chemistry majors should enroll in a year sequence of physical chemistry and in Chemistry 151/151L (fall), 107 (winter), and 107L (spring). Chemistry 130A-B-C and 13IA\u00ad B-C are equivalent courses in physical chemistry. They have the same prerequisites and expect the same level of chemical and mathematical rigor. Both are acceptable to satisfy the physical chemistry requirement for the major. Chemistry 131A-B-C devel\u00ad ops the topic beginning from a molecular or microscopic point of view and proceeds to the macroscopic description of matter; appli\u00ad cations may address primarily gas phase systems. Chemistry 130A\u00ad B-C, on the other hand, commences with the macroscopic descrip\u00ad tion; this approach may be of particular interest for applications of physical chemistry in biology, materials science, and engineering. Students should choose between the two courses on the basis of their interests. Because of significant differences in the sequence of topics, students starting in one series may not switch to the other in subsequent quarters. During the junior and senior years the Chemistry Department elec\u00ad tives requirement should be fulfilled, as should other University and departmental requirements. Sample programs for Chemistry majors, American Chemical Soci\u00ad ety-certified Chemistry majors, the Biochemistry concentration, the Chemistry Education concentration, and Chemistry-Biological Sci-, ences double majors are shown in the accompanying charts. Sam\u00ad ple programs for Chemistry majors wishing to emphasize chemical physics, computational or theoretical chemistry, chemical synthesis and reactivity, or materials or polymer science in their undergradu\u00ad ate programs are available from the Chemistry Undergraduate Pro\u00ad gram Office, 1202 Natural Sciences II. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007The faculty encourages Chemistry majors to enhance their educa\u00ad tion by studying abroad for one or more quarters, or during the summer. In most cases, the Chemistry EAP advisor can help stu\u00ad dents plan a program of study that will not extend the time it takes to graduate. Also, study abroad can enhance students' applications for admission to graduate and professional schools. For more infor\u00ad mation about opportunities to study abroad, see the Center for International Education section of this Catalogue or visit the Phys\u00ad ical Sciences Student Affairs Office.

The Ph.D. degree is granted in recognition of breadth and depth of knowledge of the facts and theories of modem chemistry and an ability to carry out independent chemical research demonstrated through submission of an acceptable doctoral dissertation. The M.S. degree may be earned either through submission of an acceptable Master's thesis (Plan I) or through an approved program of gradu\u00ad ate course work and a comprehensive oral examination (Plan II). A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for admission to the Ph.D. program. Students in the Ph.D. and M.S. Plan I (Thesis) programs are required to complete a minimum of seven approved courses (or 28 units), including six graduate-level courses (or 24 units), in chem\u00ad istry. The M.S. Plan II (Non-Thesis) program requires that the stu\u00ad dent complete 10 graduate-level chemistry courses (or 40 units) and a comprehensive oral examination. Graduate students are expected to attain grades of B or better to remain in good academic stand\u00ad ing. The comprehensive oral examination assesses the competence of the candidate in the areas of chemistry covered by the chosen course work, with uri~nimous agreement among the three examina\u00ad tion committee members required for satisfactory completion. Progress toward the Ph.D. degree during the first year is assessed by a written examination administered after completion of the first year of study. This examination covers either research accomplish\u00ad ments during the first year or comprehensive knowledge acquired in course work. The time and content of the examination depends upon the student's specific area of interest. Training in teaching is an integral part of each graduate program, and al) graduate degree candidates are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least four quarters during their gradu\u00ad ate career. Participants in the Ph.D. program take an oral\u00b7 examination for for\u00ad mal Advancement to Candidacy. This examination normally comes in a student's second or third graduate year and consists of an oral defense before a faculty committee of the student's dissertation research project, and an original research proposition conceived, developed, and documented by the student. The committee may examine the student at this time on any subject it deems relevant to the independent pursuit of chemical research. The most important component of the Ph.D. program is the doc\u00ad toral dissertation, which must describe the results of original research performed by the student under the supervision of a fac\u00ad ulty member of the Department. The criterion for acceptability of the dissertation is that its contents be of a quality suitable for pub\u00ad lication in a scientific journal of high editorial standards. Each Ph.D. candidate is expected to present the work described in the completed dissertation in a seminar before the Department, follow- , ing which the candidate will be examined on the contents of the dissertation by a committee of the faculty. A Master's thesis pre\u00ad sented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the M.S. under Plan I must also describe the results of a student's original research performed under the direction of a faculty member. However, no public oral defense of the Master's thesis is required. Residency requirements specify a minimum of six quarters in residence at UCI for Ph.D. candidates and three quarters for M.S. candidates. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five\u00b7 years, and the maximum time permitted is seven years. CONCENTRATION IN PROTEIN ENGINEERING SCIENCE Several faculty in the Department of Chemistry, in conjunction with faculty in the School of Biological Sciences and The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, participate in the joint graduate program in Protein Engineering. This interdisciplinary graduate program offers students the opportunity to work with faculty in any of the participating academic units; take course work in the areas of protein structure, function, and molecular biology; and earn the Ph.D. in Chemistry, Biological Sciences, or Engineering with a concentration in Protein Engineering Science. Additional informa\u00ad tion is available in the School of Biological Sciences section of the Catalogue and through the graduate program in Protein Engineer\u00ad ing office in the Biological Sciences Administration Building. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN CHEMISTRY WITH A TEACHING CREDENTIAL In cooperation with the UCI Department of Education, the Chem\u00ad istry Department sponsors a coordinated two-year program for the M.S. degree in Chemistry and the California Single Subject Teach\u00ad ing Credential. The M.S. degree may be obtained under either Plan I or Plan II described below. Prospective graduate students inter\u00ad ested in this program should so indicate on their graduate applica\u00ad tion and should request a detailed description of the program from the Chemistry Department Graduate Affairs Office or the Depart\u00ad ment of Education. The following lists specify requirements for each of the graduate programs offered by the Department of Chemistry. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN CHEMISTRY PLAN I (Thesis Plan) Completion of a minimum of seven approved courses (or 28 units), including six graduate-level courses (or 24 units) in chemistry (as specified by the Department and excluding Chemistry 280, 290, 291, and 399) with maintenance of an average grade ofB or better in all course work undertaken. Completion of the teaching requirement. Completion of three quarters in residence at UCI. Submission of an acceptable Master's thesis. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN CHEMISTRY PLAN II (Non-Thesis Plan) Completion of 10 graduate-level courses (or 40 units) in chemistry (excluding Chemistry 290, 291, and 399 and counting Chemistry 280 no more than once) with an average grade of B or better.

CONCENTRATION IN CHEMICAL AND MATERIALS . PHYSICS This is an interdisciplinary program between condensed matter physics and physical chemistry, which is designed to eliminate the barrier between these two disciplines. Students with B.S. degrees in Physics, Chemistry, or Materials Science and Engineering, are encouraged to apply to the program. The goal of the concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics (ChaMP) is to provide students with a broad interdisciplinary education in the applied physical sci\u00ad ences that emphasizes modern laboratory and computational skills. The program accepts students for both the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees. Upon admission to the program, students are assigned two faculty advisors, one from the Department of Physics and Astron\u00ad omy, and one from the Department of Chemistry, to provide guid\u00ad ance on curriculum and career planning. The curriculum for the M.S. program includes a summer session to assimilate students with different undergraduate backgrounds; for\u00ad mal shop, laboratory, and computational courses; a sequence on current topics to bridge the gap between fundamental principles and applied technology; and a course to develop communication skills. The required courses include thirteen core courses and three electives (subject to advisor approval) as follows: Core: Chemistry 206, 208, 229A, 231A-B-C, 232A-B, 266; two courses from the following group: Chemistry 228, 230, Physics 211, 222; one course from each of the following two groups: Physics 133 or 238A or Chemistry 236; Physics 129 or 273 or Chemistry 139. Electives: Chemistry 213, 225, 226, 229B, 232C, 233, 243, Engineering EECS278, In addi\u00ad tion to the required courses, M.S. students complete a master's thesis. Students are required to advance to candidacy for the mas\u00ad ter's degree at least one quarter prior to filing the master's thesis. There is no examination associated with this advancement, but the thesis committee needs to be selected and appropriate forms need to be filed. The M.S. program prepares students to compete for high-tech jobs or to begin research toward a Ph.D. degree. Chemistry 375 Successful completion of the M.S. degree requirements qualifies students for the Ph.D. program. Progress toward the Ph.D. degree is assessed by a written comprehensive examination administered in the summer after completion of the first year of study. This examination covers comprehensive knowledge acquired in course work, and the content of the examination depends upon the stu\u00ad dent's specific area of interest. Participants in the Ph.D. program take an examination for formal advancement to candidacy. It is typically taken within one year of successful completion of the comprehensive examination. To sat\u00ad isfy normal progress toward the degree, it must be taken by the end of the student's third year. The examination is comprised of two parts: (a) a written report on a topic to be determined in con\u00ad sultation with the research advisor and (b) an oral report on research accomplished and plans for completion of the Ph.D. dissertation.

Earth System Science is inherently interdisciplinary in scope, linking the fields of oceanography, atmospheric and terrestrial sciences, climatology, hydrology, biol\u00ad ogy, physics, and chemistry to understand the climate system and global biogeochemical cycles. These fields have traditionally been taught in different departments, which has hindered students who want to learn about all of the disciplines that interact to control the global environment. At the undergraduate level, courses are designed to educate both science and non-science majors in the basic processes driving the Earth system, including elemental cycling, Earth's climate, and global environmental problems. Undergraduates can pursue a major in Earth and Environmental Sciences or a minor in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. The Department also offers a group of lower-division breadth courses appropriate for non-science majors. At the graduate level, the Department offers the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Earth System Sci\u00ad ence. Graduate study emphasizes laboratory, field, and modeling studies of global change in the environment through study of phys\u00ad ical, chemical, and biological processes within and between the atmosphere, oceans, and terrestrial systems. Undergraduate Program The objective of the major is to prepare students to understand the rapidly evolving field of Earth System Science. Students work with faculty and graduate stl!dents to obtain a quantitative understanding of the Earth system. Both the major and the minor consist of a set of required core courses and a group of elective courses drawn from offerings in Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineer\u00ad ing, and Social Ecology. The core courses provide a broad scien\u00ad tific foundation of the physical, chemical, and biological principles needed to understand the complex interactions of the atmosphere, ocean, and land that drive the Earth's climate and biogeochemical cycles. Majors develop the analytical and quantitative skills needed to understand sensitive environmental issues. In their junior and senior years, ESS students are encouraged to focus on a particular area within Earth System Science and to choose electives within ESS and campuswide that build a coherent core of knowledge. Focus areas include but are not limited to cli\u00ad matology, biogeochemical cycles, oceanography, hydrology, terres\u00ad trial sciences, atmospheric sciences, environmental policy and planning, and resource management. Alternatively, the focus could be on chemical, physical, or biological processes across these dis\u00ad ciplines. This flexible program is designed to accommodate the particular interests of each student. Majors are encouraged to \u00b7become directly involved in scientific research working with a fac\u00ad ulty member by taking Earth System Science 199 for several quar- ters, typically in the senior year. The UCI upper-division writing requirement may be fulfilled by taking Earth System Science 199 and 198 in the senior year. Many ESS students go on to graduate school programs and careers as research scientists in academic, public, or private institutions. Students are prepared to enter the workforce dire.ctly as scientists in a diverse array of fields including environmental policy and planning, environmental consulting, air quality monitoring and assessment, laboratory analysis, scientific research, science education, natural resource management, wildlife management, conservation and environmental protection, and water resource management. The minor is open to all students (except Earth and Environmental Sciences majors), but it is primarily designed for students in the natural sciences and engineering who wish to explore interdiscipli\u00ad nary problems and broaden their studies to include the application of their fields to understanding the Earth system. Admission to the Earth and Environmental Sciences Major Students may be admitted to the Earth and Environmental Sciences major upon entering the University as freshmen, via change of major, and as transfer students from other colleges and universities. Information about change of major policies is available in the Physical Sciences Student Affairs Office and at http://www.due.uci. edu/Change_of_Major.html. For transfer student admission, prefer\u00ad ence will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of calculus and one year of either UC IRVINE - 2006-2007general chemistry (with laboratory) or calculus-based physics (with laboratory).

J]ndergraduate preparation should involve mathematics including differential equations, a year-long sequence of physics and of chemistry, and courses in general biology, ecol\u00ad ogy, or geology. Entering graduate students plan their courses and research with the help of the Earth System Science Advisory Com\u00ad mittee of academic and research faculty. Students are admitted to the Ph.D. program only; the Master's degree is awarded upon - progress to the Ph.D. To complete the course requirements for the Ph.D. program, a mini\u00ad mum of 10 approved graduate-level courses, including the core cur\u00ad riculum, must be completed with an average grade of B <_>r better. All courses must be approved by the student's Advisory Committee. The core curriculum consists of Earth System Science 200, 202, 204, 206, 208, 210, 212, 218, and 298. These courses are described below. Students are also expected to participate in the Earth System Science seminar. Additionally, Ph.D. students are required to com\u00ad plete a teaching assistant training program and to have a minimum of two quarters of experience as a teaching assistant, provided opportunities are available. Academic Senate regulations specify a minimum period of residence of six quarters for Ph.D. candidates. Enrollment in a minimum of 12 units of graduate/upper-division course work per quarter is required. Registration in every regular academic session is neces\u00ad sary until all requirements for the degree have been completed, unless a formal Leave of Absence is granted by the Office of Grad\u00ad uate Studies. All Ph.D. requirements must be completed within 15 quarters in residence (five years), excluding summer quarters. Exceptions must be put to a vote of the Earth System Science fac\u00ad ulty. The maximum time permitted is seven years. A single departmental Qualifying Examination for all eligible Earth System Science students is administered during the fall quar\u00ad ter. This examination determines the student's readiness to begin research for the dissertation and should be taken following comple\u00ad tion of the core course work and summer research, during the fall quarter of the second year. The Qualifying Examination consists of both written and oral parts. The written portion of the examination emphasizes breadth, general knowledge, and the ability to integrate and use information covered in the core curriculum and other course work. The oral examination provides an opportunity to clar\u00ad ify questions arising from the student's performance on the written examination. Following completion of the Qualifying Examination, those stu\u00ad dents who receive a recommendation to continue Ph.D. work will pursue research on a potential dissertation topic and then take the Advancement to Candidacy Examination. This oral examination is given by .a faculty committee, including extra-departmental faculty. Concurrent with this examination, the Ph.D. candidates present a research seminar to the entire Earth System Science Department outlining their proposed dissertation work. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is three years. A dissertation based on original research and demonstrating critical judgment, intellectual synthesis, creativity, and clarity in written communication is required for the Ph.D. degree. The dissertation must summarize the results of original research performed by the student under the supervision of a faculty member of the Depart\u00ad ment. The criterion of acceptability of a dissertation is that its con\u00ad tents be judged by the committee as suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal of high editorial standards. The dis\u00ad sertation may be a compilation of published papers or manuscripts accepted for publication, so long as a major proportion of the mate\u00ad rial has been produc~d independently by the candidate. The format UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 382 UCI 2006-07 School of Physical Sciences and content are approved by the Dissertation Committee, and Uni\u00ad versity requirements for style, format, and appearance are met.

The curriculum in mathematics includes opportunities for supervised individual study and research, and is augmented by seminars and col\u00ad loquia. It is designed to be compatible with curricular structures at other collegiate institutions in California in order to enable students transferring to UCI to continue their programs of mathematics study. Mathematics 385 Undergraduate Program The Department offers a B.S. degree in Mathematics. Within this program there are five tracks; besides the standard track, there are four specializations or concentrations (in Mathematics for Eco\u00ad nomics, Applied and Computational Mathematics, Statistics, and Mathematics for Education). In addition, the Department offers a minor in Mathematics. Undergraduate mathematics courses are of several kinds: courses preparatory to advanced work in mathematics, the exact sciences, and engineering; courses for students of the social and biological sciences; and courses for liberal arts students and those planning to enter the teaching field. Admission to the Major Students may be admitted to the Mathematics major upon entering the University as freshmen, via change of major, and as transfer students from other colleges and universities. Information about change of major policies is available in the Physical Sciences Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office and at http://www.due.uci.edu/Change_of_ Major.html. For transfer student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the required course work of one year of approved calculus.

In addition to satisfying the requirements for the major in Mathematics (in any one of its tracks), participants must complete at least one of the two series Mathematics 205A-B-C (Introduction to Graduate Analysis) or 206A-B-C (Introduction to Graduate Algebra) with a grade of C or better. If Mathematics 205A-B-C is not taken, then 140A-B-C-D must all be completed. If Mathemat~ ics 206A-B-C is not taken, then 120A-B and 121A-B must all be completed. In terms of satisfaction of the Mathematics major requirements, Mathematics 205A-B-C counts as the equivalent of four upper\u00ad division courses, specifically 140A-B-C-D; and 206A-B-C count!' as the equivalent of four upper-division courses, specifically, 120A-B and 121A-B. The graduate sequences may be taken in place of or in addition to the undergraduate courses name<!,.. , \u00b7. Students must apply for the Honors Program no later than the fall quarter of their senior year. Those who are accepted enroll in the Honors Seminar (Mathematics H195A-B) during thewinter and spring quarter of their senior year. At the end of the spring quarter students submit an Honors thesis, which is designed and completed under the supervision of the Honors Seminar faculty. (Mathematics H195B may be counted toward tpe major requirements as one of the five additional courses in area H.) Upon approval of the thesis by the Department's Honors Committee and completion of all other requirements, students graduate with Honors in Mathematics, and this distinction is noted on their transcript. Requirements for the Minor One course selected from Mathematics 13, 120A, or 140A, plus six additional upper-division lecture courses in Mathematics (plus the associated laboratories, where applicable) nuptbered 100-188. NOTE: Nearly all upper-division courses in Mathematics have Mathe\u00ad matics 2A-B-J as prerequisites, and many courses have additional . prerequisites such as Mathematics 2D, 2E, 3A, and/or 3D. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The application process for the specializations and concentrations is designed to make sure the student gets suitable advising in plan\u00ad ning a program of study. For all Mathematics majors, or prospec\u00ad tive majors, assistance in planning a program of study is available from the Mathematics Department Undergraduate Advisor and the advisors for the various tracks, as well as from the academic coun\u00ad selors for the School of Physical Sciences. The following sample programs are only examples. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Majors should consider taking Mathematics.H2D in place of 2D and H2E in place of 2E. Those in the specialization for Education should note that MathematiCs 124, 161, 180, and 184 rriay not be offered more than once every other year and thus should be taken when offered.

Math. 121B Breadth/Elective Breadth/Elective Graduate Program Graduate courses are designed to meet the needs of students doing graduate work in mathematics and in those disciplines that require graduate-level mathematics for their study. Among the fields cov\u00ad ered are analysis, algebra, applied and computational mathematics, mathematical biology, functional analysis, geometry and topology, probability, ordinary and partial differential equations, and mathe\u00ad matical logic. In addition to formal courses, there are seminars for advanced study toward the Ph.D. in various fields of mathematics. Topics will vary from year to year. Each seminar is conducted by a faculty member specializing in the subject studied. Enrollment will be sub\u00ad ject to the approval of the instructor in charge. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN MATHEMATICS The Master's program serves a dual purpose. For some students it will be a terminal program of mathematics education; for others it will lead to study and research at the doctoral level. To earn the Master of Science degree, the student must satisfy course and resi\u00ad dency requirements, and pass Comprehensive Examinations admin\u00ad istered by the Graduate Studies Committee of the Department. The total number of required courses for the M.S. degree is 12 courses, completed with satisfactory performance. Students are required to complete at least one series of the following courses: Mathematics 210A-B-C, 220A-B-C, or 230A-B-C. At most one undergraduate course may count as an elective course, provided it is sponsored by rank faculty and approved by the Graduate Advi\u00ad sor. At most one elective course (of at least three units) is allowed outside the Department. Students will take Advisory Examinations in Algebra and Analysis upon entrance to the graduate program. The Advisory Examination in Algebra is based on the courses Mathematics 120A and 121A-B plus some advanced topics in group theory and linear algebra; stu\u00ad dents who do not pass this examination will be asked to take the Mathematics 206A-B-C sequence. The Advisory Examination in Analysis is based on the courses Mathematics 140A-B-C-D; stu\u00ad dents who do not pass this examination will be asked to take the Mathematics 205A-B-C sequence. Students must pass two Comprehensive Examinations, one in Algebra and one in Analysis, before the beginning of their second year in the graduate program and will be given, at most, two chances to pass each examination. Students who have passed the Advisory Examination will be exempted from taking the corre\u00ad sponding Comprehensive Examination. Mathematics 199, 297, 298, 299, and 399 may not be used to fulfill course requirements. The residency requirement ordinarily is satisfied by full-time enrollment for three quarters immediately preceding the award of the M.S. degree. When appropriate, a leave of absence may be granted between matriculation and the final quarters of study. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN MATHEMATICS WITH A TEACHING CREDENTIAL In cooperation with the UCI Department of Education, the Depart\u00ad ment of Mathematics sponsors a coordinated program for the M.S. degree in Mathematics and the California Single Subject Teaching Credential. This option requires 12 courses, at least eight of which must be graduate courses. Three thesis courses (Mathematics 299) may be used as part of the course work for this option. The Advi\u00ad sory and Comprehensive Examination requirements are the same as for the regular Master's degree. Prospective graduate students inter\u00ad ested in this program should so indicate on their applications and can request a detailed description of the program from the Depart\u00ad ment of Mathematics or the Department of Education. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN MATHEMATICS When accepted into the doctoral program, the student embarks on a program of formal courses, seminars, and individual study courses to prepare for the Ph.D. Qualifying Examinations, Advancement to Candidacy Examination, and dissertation. All students will take Advisory Examinations in Algebra and Analysis upon entrance to the graduate program. The Advisory Examination in Algebra is based on the courses Mathematics 120A and 121A-B, plus some advanced topics in group theory and linear algebra; students who do not pass this examination will be asked to take the Mathematics 206A-B-C sequence. The Advisory Examina\u00ad tion in Analysis is based on material covered in Mathematics 140A-B-C-D; students who do not pass this examination will be asked to take the Mathematics 205A-B-C sequence. All students who take Mathematics 205A-B-C (Analysis) and 206A-B-C (Alge\u00ad bra) must pass, at the beginning of their second year in the gradu\u00ad ate program, the corresponding Comprehensive Examination, which covers the material of the Advisory Examination plus Mathematics 205 or 206, respectively. Each student must choose at least two series of the following three series of courses-Mathematics 210A-B-C (Real Analysis), 220A\u00ad B-C (Complex Analysis), or 230A-B-C (Algebra)-and pass two written Qualifying Examinations from these courses before the end of their third year. Each examination may be taken twice. A student who passes the examination prior to taking the corre\u00ad sponding course will be exempted from taking the course. The Department will offer the Qualifying Examinations twice each year, during orientation week before the fall quarter and at the end of spring quarter. By the end of their second year, students must declare a major specialization from the following areas: Algebra, Analysis, Applied and Computational Mathematics, Geometry and Topology, Logic, or Probability. Students are required to take two series of courses from their chosen area. (Students who later decide to change their area must also take two series of courses from the new area.) Addi\u00ad tionally, all students must take two series of course outside their declared major area of specialization. Special topics courses within certain areas of specialization and courses counted toward the M.S. degree, other than Mathematics 205A-B-C and 206A-B-C, UC IRVINE - 2006-2007will count toward the fulfillment of the major specialization requirement. \u00b7 By the beginning of their third year, students must have an advisor specialist in their major area. With the advisor's aid, the student forms a committee for the Advancement to Candidacy oral exami\u00ad nation. This committee will be approved by the Department on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council and will have five faculty members. At least one, and at most two, of the members must be faculty from outside the Department. Before the end of the third year, students must have a written pro\u00ad posal, approved by their committee, for the Advancement to Candi\u00ad dacy examination. The proposal should explain the role of at least two series of courses from the student's major area of specializa\u00ad tion and of additional research reading material, and should have a plan for investigating specific topics under the direction of the stu\u00ad dent's adviser(s). The courses Mathematics 210A-B-C, 220A-B-C, and 230A-B-C cannot count for both Qualifying and Advancement to Candidacy Examinations. After the student meets the require\u00ad ments, the Graduate Studies Committee recommends to the Dean of Graduate Studies the advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Students should advance to candidacy by the beginning of their fourth year. Teaching experience and training is an integral part of the Ph.D. program. All doctoral students are expected to participate in the Department's teaching program. The candidate must demonstrate independent, creative research in Mathematics by writing and defending a dissertation that makes a new and valuable contribution to mathematics in the candidate's area of concentration. Upon advancement to candidacy a student must form a Thesis Committee, ideally a subcommittee of the Advancement Examination Committee,. consisting of at least three faculty members and chaired by the student's advisor. The commit\u00ad tee guides and supervises the candidate's research, study, and writ\u00ad ing of the dissertation; conducts an oral defense of the dissertation;\u00b7 and recommends that the Ph.D. be conferred UP,On approval of the doctoral dissertation. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years, and the maximum time permitted is seven years.

Yodh, Ph.D. University of Chicago, Professor of Physics (experimental particle astrophysics) Clare Yu, Ph.D. Princeton University, Professor of Physics (condensed matter theory and theoretical biophysics) Physics is that branch of science concerned with the study of nat\u00ad ural phenomena at the fundamental level. Physicists study the smallest particles of matter (quarks and leptons), nuclei, and atoms; the fundamental forces; the properties of solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas; the behavior of matter on the grand scale in stars and galaxies; and even the origin and fate of the universe. Other disciplines such as chemistry, biology, medicine, and engi\u00ad neering often build upon the foundations laid by physics. The Department of Physics and Astronomy offers courses for stu\u00ad dents of various interests, from those in the humanities and social sciences, to those in biological sciences, and to those in physics, engineering, and other sciences. Faculty members are conducting active research in several forefront areas of physical research, and there is student access to specialized research areas such as astro\u00ad physics, cosmology, elementary particle, plasma, condensed matter, biological, and medical physics at both advanced and undergradu\u00ad ate course levels. The Department offers several interdisciplinary concentrations and tracks which include courses taught by faculty in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Engineering, and Medicine. The faculty is vigorous, innovative, and engaged in everything from the traditional activities of research, education, and university service to community action, literature, and national policy making, to mention a few examples. The Department encourages student-fac\u00ad ulty interaction. Undergraduate Program The goal of the undergraduate major in Physics is to develop expert problem solvers with a broad understanding of physical principles. The program is flexible and prepares students for careers in industrial research, applications programming, education, law,. or business, as well as for graduate study in astronomy, biomedical physics, engineering, or physics. Annual mandatory meetings with faculty advisors assist students in selecting a program that matches their aptitudes and interests. In addition to the core Physics courses, students complete either a standard track (such as the track for future Ph.D. physicists), or one of the formal concentra\u00ad tions or specializations (in Applied Physics, Biomedical Physics, Computational Physics, Philosophy of Physics, Physics Education, or Astrophysics). In addition, Physics majors may find the minor in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, offered by the Department of Earth System Science, to be of interest. The three lower-division sequences in physics are distinguished by their intended audience, their mathematical prerequisites, and the extent to which they offer preparati<;>n for more advanced courses. These aspects of the beginning courses are summarized as follows: Physics 3: Intended audience: Premedical students, Biological Sci\u00ad ences Prerequisites: algebra and concurrent enrollment in Mathematics 2A. Preparation for advanced courses: Physics 7D with permission. Physics 7: Intended audience: Physical Sciences and Engineering majors. Prerequisite: concurrent enrollment in Mathematics 2. Preparation for advanced courses: Physics 51A. Physics 14-21: none. Preparation forAdvanced courses: none. Admission to the Major Students may be admitted to the Physics major upon entering the University as freshmen, via change of major, and as transfer stu\u00ad dents from other colleges and universities. Information about change of major policies is available in the Physical Sciences Student Affairs Office and at http://www.due.uci.edu/Change_of_ Major.html. For transfer student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of approved calculus and one year of calculus-based physics with laboratory for engineering and physics majors. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: None. Departmental Requirements Physics or 197; and five additional coherently related four-unit courses. (The five coherently related courses are normally satisfied by concentrations, specializations; and tracks.) * For students transferring into the major after taking Physics 51A-B, Physics 51A-B will be accepted in place of Physics 61A-B. Concentration in Applied Physics Requirements: The six additional coherently related courses required for the major must be in engineering and be approved by the Department of Physics and Astronomy. \u00b7 Concentration in Biomedical Physics Requirements: Biological Sciences 97, 98, and 99; Chemistry lA\u00ad SlA-B, (or 52A-B).

Specialization in Astrophysics Requirements: Physics 139; three astrophysics courses selected from Physics 137, 138, 144, or 145; and any two upper-division Physics electives. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Honors Program in Physics The Honors Program.in Physics provides an opportunity for selected students majoring in Physics to pursue advanced work in one of the research areas of the Department. Admission to the pro\u00ad gram is based on an application normally submitted by the sixth week of the spring quarter of the junior year. Applicants must have an overall grade point average of at least 3.4 and a grade point average in physics courses of 3.5 or better. (Exceptions to these procedures and standards may be granted in unusual circum\u00ad stances.) In selecting students for the program, the Department considers evidence of ability and interest in research. Students admitted to the program participate in a year-long course, Physics H196A-B-C, which includes two quarters of research and a final quarter in which a written thesis is submitted. If this work and the student's final GPA are deemed of honors quality by the pro\u00ad gram advisor, the student then graduates with Departmental Honors in Physics. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Physics-3 is a one-year course suitable for premedical students, students majoring in Biological Sciences, and nonscience majors. It surveys most of the important branches of physics. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Nonscience majors with some mathematical skill may wish to consider Physics 3 as an alternative to Physics 14 through 21. A student who decides to major in Physics after completing Physics 3 should meet with the Department Undergraduate Advisor for placement information. Physics 7 is an intensive four-quarter course for students in Physi\u00ad cal Sciences and Engineering who are interested in a careful quan\u00ad titative approach to macroscopic physics. Laboratory work accom\u00ad panies the course. Students with an advanced background in physics may begin the sequence with 7B upon satisfactory comple\u00ad tion of the Physics Placement Examination. Physics courses numbered between 14 and 21 are general educa\u00ad tion courses intended for nonscience majors. The content and for\u00ad mat of Physics 21 may vary from year to year. The introduction to mathematical methods (Mathematics 2E, 2J, 3D, and Physics 50), microscopic physics (Physics 61A-B), and experimental physics (Physics 52A-B-C) are normally taken in the sophomore year. Courses numbered 111 and above are for Physics majors and other qualified students. Courses numbered between 111 and 115 empha\u00ad size the mathematical and theoretical structures that have unified our understanding of nature. It should be noted that multi-quarter courses such as 111A-B must be taken and passed in sequential order. Any student who is so inclined may take more than the min\u00ad imum one quarter of advanced laboratory work. Courses numbered between 132 and 149 introduce active subdisciplines in current research. Independent research (195, 196) is strongly encouraged. Physics 196C, H196C, and 197 stress the written and verbal com\u00ad munication of research findings. Transfer students are specifically advised to seek individual con\u00ad sultation with the Department Undergraduate Advisor before deciding on a program of courses. All Physics majors must complete the core courses listed below. By the end of the junior year, each student must also select a con\u00ad centration or track. Note that alternatives to Physics major requirements can be approved upon petition to the Department and the Office of the Associate Dean. Furthermore, exceptionally prepared students are allowed to enroll in graduate-level courses; to do so requires the approval of the Department Undergraduate Advisor.

The Applied Physics concentration is designed to provide appro\u00ad priate education to students who anticipate a career in industrial or technological research. It combines the fundamental knowledge of physical processes obtained from physics courses with the techni\u00ad cal knowledge obtained from engineering courses. A student is required to complete six courses in the School of Engineering approved by the Physics and Astronomy Department. Examples of appropriate courses include Engineering EECS70, EECS 170 MAE147. Upon completion of the Applied Physics concentration, the student will receive a B.S. degree in Physics.

Students take courses in deductive and inductive logic, the philosophy and history of physics, and quantum mechanics. The emphasis on careful argu\u00ad ment makes this concentration useful for anyone who wishes to pursue a graduate degree in philosophy or law, or for other careers that employ both verbal and quantitative analysis. The Physics Education concentration is for students who plan a career in secondary education. An Education course, five general science courses, and two quarters of classroom experience com\u00ad plete the requirements for the concentration. The Astrophysics specialization is primarily taken by two types of students, those planning on going on to graduate school in astronomy or astrophysics and those planning to work in aeronau\u00ad tics or astrophysics-related industries or government research lab\u00ad oratories after receiving their bachelor's degree. It also is an excellent focus for students who anticipate careers in science jour\u00ad nalism, teaching, science administration, or public relations. The course work includes one upper-division astrophysics laboratory (139), three of four courses in astrophysics (137, 138, 144, 145), and two or more upper-division Physics courses. Of the Physics electives, students bound for graduate school are strongly advised to include Physics 113B, 115B, and 125B. Other recommended electives include Physics 131, 132, 134A-B,.135, and 136.

These degrees are awarded in recognition of demonstrated knowl\u00ad edge of the basic facts and theories of physics and of a demon\u00ad strated capacity for independent research. Active programs of research are underway in particle physics, nanophysics, biophysics, medical physics, condensed matter physics, low-temperature physics, plasma physics, gravitational physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. In general, graduate study in the physics Ph.D. program is expected to be a full-time activity. Other proposed arrangements should be approved by the Graduate Committee. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is six years of full-time study, and the maximum time permitted is seven years. Students may pursue the M.S. degree on either a full-time or part-time basis. Complementing the formal courses, the Department offers regular colloquia and informal seminars. Graduate students are members of an intellectual community and are expected to participate fully in departmental activities. Attendance at colloquia is considered an essential part of graduate study. In addition, there are regular weekly research seminars in condensed matter, particle, and plasma physics, and astrophysics. Sources of support available to graduate students include teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Students planning to pursue graduate work in Physics should obtain a copy of the Department's graduate brochure. Students admitted into the graduate program in Physics and Astronomy may elect to pursue the M.S. or Ph.D. degree with a concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics, as described in a later section. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN PHYSICS The requirements for the M.S. degree are (1) at least three quarters of residence; (2) mastery of graduate course material, which must be demonstrated by passing, with a grade of B or better, a mini\u00ad mum of eight quarter courses including: Physics 211, 213A-B, 215A, 223, at least one other course numbered between 200 and 259, and two other courses approved by the graduate advisor, which can include undergraduate upper-division courses in related areas, and (3) either Option A, a research project and written the\u00ad sis, or, Option B, a comprehensive written examination. Students following Option B should take Physics 214A. (The requirements for the M.S. degree with a concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics differ from these.) DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN PHYSICS The principal requirements for the Ph.D. degree are a minimum of six quarters of residence, passage of a written and an oral examina\u00ad tion, and successful completion and defense of a dissertation reporting results of original research. In addition, the Ph.D. candi\u00ad date must complete certain graduate course requirements. There is no foreign language requirement. Course Requirements. Students are required to exhibit mastery of the basic sequences-Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetic The\u00ad ory, Quantum Mechanics, Mathematical Physics, and Statistical Physics. A minimum of 12 quarter courses including 211, 212A, 213A-B, 214A, 215A-B, 223, at least two other courses numbered between 200 and 259, and two other courses approved by the grad\u00ad uate advisor, must be passed with a grade of B or better. Students are strongly encouraged to take Physics 211, 212A, 213A-B, 214A, 215A-B, and 223 in their first year of study. It is expected that stu\u00ad dents, having selected a research specialty, will ordinarily take the core courses in that subject in their second year of study. Students UC IRVINE - 2006-2007pursuing research in elementary particle physics ordinarily com\u00ad plete Physics 215C during their first year and Physics 234A-B-C and 235A-B during their second year. Students pursuing research in plasma physics ordinarily complete Physics 239A during their first year and Physics 239B-C-D their second year; Physics 249 is also recommended. Students pursuing research in condensed-mat\u00ad ter physics ordinarily take Physics 238A-B-C during their second year. Students pursuing research in astrophysics/cosmology ordi\u00ad narily complete Physics 240A during spring of their first year; 240B, C in their second year; and one or more of Physics 241A, B, C, D in their second or subsequent years. (The requirements for the Ph.D. degree with a concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics differ from these, as outlined below.) Comprehensive Examination. Progress toward the degree is assessed by a written comprehensive examination covering a broad range of fundamentals of physics at the graduate and advanced \u00b7 undergraduate levels. It is offered twice a year, and a student is allowed a maximum of three attempts. The first attempt must occur before the end of the fall quarter of the student's second year, and the examination must be passed by the end of spring quarter of the student's second year. Advancement to Ph.D. Candidacy. For advancement to Ph.D. candidacy, a student must pass an oral advancement examination. It is typically taken within one year of successful completion of the comprehensive examination. To satisfy normal progress toward the degree, it must be taken by the end of the student's third year. The candidacy committee that administers this examination will contain one or two faculty members from outside the Department. This oral examination will cover material principally related to the broad and general features of the student's dissertation area. \u00b7Teaching Program. Experience in teaching is an integral part of the graduate program, and all Ph.D. students are required to par\u00ad ticipate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate careers. All new teaching assistants are required to enroll in Physics 269. Students who are not citizens. from countries where English is either the primary or dominant language as approved by the UCI Graduate Council must pass either the Test of Spoken English .(TSE) or the UCI SPEAK (Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit) examination. One of these tests must be passed before such a student can qualify for a teaching assistant\u00ad ship in order to fulfill the Department's teaching requirement. The Department expects one of these tests to be passed by the end of the student's second year at UCI. Dissertation. A dissertation summarizing the results of original re\u00ad search performed by the student under the supervision of a doctor\u00ad al committee, appointed by the Department Chair on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, will be required for the Ph.D. degree. A criterion for the acceptability of a dissertation by the Department is that it be suitable for publication in a scientific journal. The dissertation must not have been submit\u00ad ted to any other institution prior to its submission to the UCI Physics and Astronomy Department. Defense of Dissertation. Upon completion of the dissertation, the student will take an oral examination, open to the public, before the doctoral committee. CONCENTRATION IN CHEMICAL AND MATERIALS PHYSICS This is an interdisciplinary program between condensed matter physics and physical chemistry, which is designed to eliminate the barrier between these two disciplines. Students with B.S. degrees in Physics, Chemistry, or Materials Science and Engineering, are encouraged to apply to the program. The goal of the concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics (ChaMP) is to provide students Physics and Astronomy 397 with a broad interdisciplinary education in the applied physical sci\u00ad ences that emphasizes modem laboratory and computational skills. The program accepts students for both the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees. Upon admission to the program, students are assigned two faculty advisors, one from the Department of Physics and Astron\u00ad omy, and one from the Department of Chemistry, to provide guid\u00ad ance on curriculum and career planning. The curriculum for the M.S. program includes a summer session to assimilate students with different undergraduate backgrounds; for-1 mal shop, laboratory, and computational courses; a sequence on current topics to bridge the gap between fundamental principles and applied technology; and a course to develop communication skills. The required courses include thirteen core courses and three electives (subject to advisor approval) as follows: Core: Physics 206, 215A-B, Chemistry 231C, 232A-B; one course from each of the following three groups: Physics 211 or 222; Physics 133 or 238A or Chem\u00ad istry 236; Physics 129 or 273 or Chemistry 139. Physics 134, 213C, 223, 224, 229B, 233A, 233B, 238A, Chemistry 213, 249, Engineering EECS278, EECS285B, MSE201, MSE259A. In addition to the required courses, M.S. students complete a master's thesis. Students are required to advance to candidacy for the master's degree at least one quarter prior to filing the master's thesis. There is no examina\u00ad tion associated with this advancement, but the thesis committee needs to be selected. and appropriate forms need to be filed. The M.S. program prepares students to compete for high-tech jobs or to begin research toward a Ph.D. degree. Successful completion of the M.S. degree requirements qualifies students for the Ph.D. program. Progress toward the Ph.D. degree is assessed by a written comprehensive examination administered in the summer after completion of the first year of study. This examination covers comprehensive knowledge acquired in course work, and the content of the examination depends upon the stu\u00ad dent's specific area of interest. Participants in the Ph.D. program take an examination for formal advancement to candidacy. It is typically taken within one year of successful completion of the comprehensive examination. To sat\u00ad isfy normal progress toward the degree, it must be taken by the end of the student's third year. The examination is comprised of two parts: (a) a written report on a topic to be determined in con\u00ad sultation with the research advisor and (b) an oral report on research accomplished and plans for completion of the Ph.D. dissertation.

The School is comprised of the Departments of Criminology, Law and Society; Environmental Health, Science, and Policy; Psychology and Social Behavior; and Planning, Policy, and Design. It has approximately 80 full-time faculty members, 2,660 undergraduate majors, and 260 graduate students. Social Ecology applies scien\u00ad tific methods to the study of a wide range of recurring social and environmental problems. Among issues of long-standing interest in the School are crime and justice in society, social influences on human development over the life cycle, urban and community planning, and effects of the physical environment on health and behavior. In summary, while ecology is the science of the relation\u00ad ship between organisms and their environments, social ecology is the science of the relationships between human populations and their environments. The faculty is multidisciplinary. It includes psychologists with a variety of specialties (e.g., developmental, clinical, social, and environmental); sociologists; program evaluators; criminologists; lawyers; urban and regional planners; environmental health scien\u00ad tists; and environmental design specialists. Faculty members con\u00ad duct research and teach courses that integrate concepts and perspec\u00ad tives of the several disciplines. This focus arises from commitment to the view that societal problems are so complex that their analy\u00ad sis requires interdisciplinary efforts (i.e., the joining of talents by people with different intellectual backgrounds). A number of faculty members are involved in interventions directed toward improving the way groups of individuals, institutions, and commu\u00ad nities function. A number of others are involved in interventions aimed at improving the quality and control of the environment. Research Facilities Social Ecology I and II and the nearby Multipurpose Academic and Administrative (MPAA) Building are wireless environments that house the School's research centers and feature many facilities for experimental research, such as wet laboratories for research and teaching in the environmental health sciences and behavioral assessment laboratories for research in human development, social relations, and legal studies. Wet laboratories are used for studying air and water pollution. Behavioral assessment laboratories are used for studying social phenomena such as parent-child interac\u00ad tion, cooperation among children, memory functions, hyperactivity, social support processes, and mock jury discussions. The School also offers students up-to-date computing facilities and assistance to ensure that their skills prepare them for either advanced (graduate) work or for the changing needs of today's workplace, which increasingly demands skills in computing and information technology.

HONORS Honors at graduation will be awarded to about 12 percent of the graduating seniors. Eligibility for such honors will be on the basis of grade point average (GPA). A minimum overall GPA of 35 is required. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus\u00b7 by the end of the winter quarter of the academic year in which they graduate. Final decisions concerning the awards of summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude are the responsibility of a committee chaired by the Associate Dean for Students. Other important factors are also considered (see page 55). Undergraduate Program The School of Social Ecology offers either a general interdiscipli\u00ad nary degree in Social Ecology or a more focused experience through degree programs in Applied Ecology; Criminology, Law and Society; Environmental Analysis and Design; Psychology and Social Behavior; Public Health Policy; and Public Health Sciences. Change of Major. Students who wish to change their major to one offered by the School should contact the Social Ecology Student Services Office for information about change-of-major require\u00ad ments, procedures, and policies. Information is also available at http://www.due.uci.edu/Change_of_Major.html. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007HONORS PROGRAM IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY The Social Ecology Honors Program provides the opportunity for selected School of Social Ecology students to pursue advanced independent study. Admission to the program is based on formal invitation and application in the spring quarter of the junior year. In order to be considered, a student must have satisfied the follow\u00ad ing requirements: completion of all lower-division Social Ecology courses required for the major; completion of at least five upper\u00ad division Social Ecology courses with a grade point average of at least 3.5 in these courses; and achievement of an overall grade point average at UCI of at least 3.2. Acceptance into the program is based upon evidence of the student's ability, interest in research, and proposed thesis project. Successful completion of the program requires two quarters of supervised, independent work on a thesis research project (Social Ecology H190A-B) and written and oral presentation of an honors thesis (Social Ecology H190W). CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Graduates of the School of Social Ecology bring a distinctive cross-disciplinary perspective to the job market. The School pro\u00ad vides a solid foundation for those students who seek jobs in plan\u00ad ning departments, mental health settings, educational institutions, and a variety of community and governmental agencies. Many Social Ecology students find that their interdisciplinary training is also useful for careers in management. The School also provides sound preparation for students who wish to apply to graduate and professional schools of law, administra\u00ad tion, public health, social welfare, psychology, sociology, criminol\u00ad ogy, and urban planning. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. Additional information is available in the Career Center section. - FIELD STUDY An important aspect of the undergraduate program is its field study requirement for majors. Field study is designed to provide students with an opportunity to examine social-environmental problems as they occur in community settings; to evaluate the merit of ideas presented in the classroom; and to conduct naturalistic observations and investigations at field sites. Under the supervision of a Social Ecology faculty sponsor, students have the opportunity to test their skills in the community, to evaluate procedures and problem-solv\u00ad ing strategies used in the work place, and to observe the links between community practices and academic ideas and issues. The settings provided for field study include a wide range of problem\u00ad oriented institutions and agencies in both the private and the public sector (e.g., Orange County Public Defender's Office; California Coastal Commission; American Red Cross; primary and secondary schools; Fairview Development Center; planning, legal, and design corporations). Students must select a placement site from those listed and approved by the School of Social Ecology. Unlisted or inappropriate placements, as well as those that could give the appearance of nepotism or preferential treatment, will not be approved. Departmental approval for field study will be determined by the Field Study Director. Field study is open only to upper-division School of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy students who are in good academic standing and have com\u00ad pleted all prerequisite course work. All field studies are taken on a Pass/Not Pass grading basis. Further information, including field study sign-up procedures and prerequisites, must be obtained from the Social Ecology Student Services Office. Social Ecology 405 Planning a Program of Study Because there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major require\u00ad ments, students should consult with the Social Ecology Student Services Office, 102 Social Ecology I, to design an appropriate program of study. Students who elect one of the majors in the School of Socia] Ecol\u00ad ogy in their freshman year might begin by taking the introductory courses required by their major. It is a good idea to take these courses early because they include fundamental concepts that are widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (cat\u00ad ~gory I) should be completed during the first year. In the sopho\u00ad more year, the student might complete three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in their major, and four electives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, statistics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the stu\u00ad dent should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements Criminology, Law and Society C7, Environmental Analysis and Design E8, Psychology and Social Behavior P9, Social Ecology 10, 13, 194, 195 (four units), and one additional upper-division course (four units) chosen from any department in the School of Social Ecology or an additional four units of Social Ecology 195. (Social Ecology 198 and 199 may not be used to fulfill this requirement.) Breadth Requirement Limitation: With the exception of cate\u00ad gories I, V, and VII, a student in any School of Social Ecology major may count toward breadth no more than three courses offered by the School of Social Ecology. Departmental Requirements: Refer to individual departments. Grade Requirement A minimum grade average of at least C (2.0) is required: (1) over\u00ad all, (2) in all courses required for the major program, including the School requirements, and (3) in the upper-division courses required for the major. Double Majors In order to double major within the School of Social Ecology, major requirements must be met for both majors without any over\u00ad lap of upper-division courses. Additional Curricular Options Students in the School of Social Ecology may combine their course work with the following University programs and should consult an academic counselor for further information.

Undergraduate Major in Applied Ecology 102 Social &ology I; (949) 824-6861 101 Biological Sciences Administration; (949) 824-5318 NOTE: The availability of this major is under review. Contact the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools at (949) 824-6703 for information. The Department of Environmental Health, Science, and Policy in the School of Social Ecology and the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences offer a B.S. degree program in Applied Ecology. The inter\u00ad disciplinary curriculum furnishes a strong undergraduate founda\u00ad tion in human-environment interactions, and develops skills in resource quality and management, molecular and genetic method\u00ad ology for environmental protection, and field sampling techniques for data collection. An Applied Ecology major receives the basic science training of a Biological Sciences major and utilizes these skills in a core of environmentally based courses taught in Social Ecology. Social Ecology brings to this major a unique combination of courses in Environmental Quality and Health, Planning and Public Policy, and Law and Society. This combination, together with a strong biology background contributed by the School of Biological Sciences and a general science background contributed by the School of Physical Sciences, enables students selecting this major to pursue interdisci\u00ad plinary learning experiences which are difficult to achieve within traditional disciplines. The first three years of the major are very\u00b7 structured, leaving the last year open for students to specialize in an area of their choice. Transfer Applicants: See page 42. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY It is important that students take the required science courses early, in order that the science background may be utilized in the Social Ecology courses. There are many required courses, and the student must plan carefully. Fot initial academic advising, students should consult the Social Ecology Student Services Office. Faculty acade\u00ad mic advisors may be either Social Ecology or Biological\u00b7 Sciences faculty members. CAREERS IN APPLIED ECOLOGY Careers.in the fields of environmental and resource management and planning are particularly suited to an Applied Ecology back\u00ad ground. Many graduates hold technical or administrative positions in, for example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency; or in California's Regional Water Quality Control Board, Air Resources Board, Department of Fish and Game, and Depart\u00ad ment of Health and Human Services; or in various county and city agencies. A variety of firms in the private sector employ Applied Ecology graduates to prepare environmental impact reports, labora\u00ad tory analyses, and planning studies. The Applied Ecology major also provides a strong academic foundation for graduate or profes\u00ad sional study in areas such as conservation and natural resources, environmental health science, microbiology, public health, law, medicine, dentistry, planning, and administration. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007408 UCI 2006-07 School of Social Ecology The Applied Ecology major provides students with a comprehen\u00ad sive treatment of basic ecological principles and their relevance to human needs. As an alternate pathway, students with related inter\u00ad ests should explore other environmental program options within The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, the School of Physical Sciences, and the School of Biological Sciences. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN APPLIED ECOLOGY University Requirements: See pages 59-64. Requirements for the Major General: Economics 1; Information and Computer Science lOA, lOB, or lOC; Mathematics 2B, 94, 97, lOOL, 194S, and one from Dl03, Dl04, Dl05, or from El03, EllO, E160, E168, and Biological Sciences E179; Environmental Analysis and Design El80 and E180L.

Environmental Biotechnology: Biological Sciences Dl29, El89, Health Science: not major in both Applied Ecology and any of the School of Biological Sciences majors. Undergraduate Program in Public Health The B.S. in Public Health Sciences and the B.A. in Public Health Policy degree programs train students in multidisciplinary approaches to public health practice and research. The degrees explore both quantitative and qualitative aspects of public health at all levels of analysis. Graduates will advance, through selective employment or further education, to become the new generation of public health professionals prepared to face the emerging chal\u00ad lenges to human health from a population perspective. Students who are interested in pursuing a premedical program should note that additional courses will be needed beyond the requirements of the public health degrees to fulfill requirements for medical school. Students admitted to the public health program are expected to for\u00ad mally declare either the B.S. or B.A. degree as early as possible, but no later than the end of the sophomore year of study. Changing from one degree program to the other is possible, but will require completion of the required lower-and upper-division courses spec\u00ad ified for each program. It is also possible for a student to enroll in both the B.S. and B.A. degree programs (double major), provided the student completes all the requirements outlined under each degree. NOTE: The School of Social Ecology Student Services Office is coordinating the undergraduate affairs activities for the College of Health Sciences' Program in Public Health. CAREERS FOR THE MAJORS For graduates with the bachelor's degrees who wish to enter the job market directly, there is a plethora of opportunities in private and public organizations for entry-level personnel in public health. These include statewide and regional health care agencies (e.g., the Orange County Health Care Agency), community clinics focusing on preventive health, water and air quality management districts, biomedical companies, health-education institutions, and activist non-governmental organizations. The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHF) has produced a com\u00ad pendium of public health career paths, many of which have become even more compelling for graduates at the proposed level. In addition to supplying practitioners for the entry-level workforce in public health, the undergraduate degrees will also prepare stu\u00ad dents to enter graduate programs in public health. ADMISSION TO THE MAJORS Freshmen: There are no specific requirements for admission at the freshman level, however completion of a college preparatory high school curriculum including two years of high school biology, a combination of natural science courses including one year each of mathematics and chemistry, and courses in health science and social sciences will be helpful.

DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINOLOGY, LAW AND SOCIETY Valerie Jenness, Department Chair The Department of Criminology, Law and Society focuses, first, on the manifestations of criminal behavior and the methods for con\u00ad trolling that behavior, and second, on the relationships and interac\u00ad tions between social processes and legal systems. Basic courses present overviews of American legal systems with particular emphasis on criminal and juvenile justice, the forms of criminal behavior, the role of law in understanding social and psychological phenomena, and the applications of sociological theory in under\u00ad standing law and legal systems. Subsequent course work provides understanding of the theoretical structures used to explain criminal behavior, the effects of crimes from the perspectives of victims, the operations of systems of justice and their underlying institutions, the goals of governmental regulation and the methods used to achieve those goals, and more advanced issues in the interactions of law and such fields as psychology, sociology, and planning. In addition, substantive areas of law, such as criminal, environmental, and family law, are introduced. The Department offers a B.A. degree program in Criminology, Law and Society. Students are provided with opportunities to become acquainted with the varieties of behavior that society chooses to control or regulate, the methods and institutions used to achieve that control or regulation, and the approaches aimed specifically at altering unacceptable behavior. In addition, there is provision for students UC IRVINE - 2006-2007410 UCI 2006-07 School of Social Ecology to use their increasing knowledge of the law, its procedures, and institutions to enhance their understanding of the social sciences. The course of study provides excellent preparation for law school and for graduate study in sociology, criminology, and criminal jus\u00ad tice. Careers for students who terminate their University education at the baccalaureate level may be developed through placements in criminal justice and regulatory agencies, in organizations determin\u00ad ing public policy, and in programs that deliver services to people who have difficulties with some aspect of the legal system. Students are strongly encouraged to select electives in a variety of departments. Courses in areas such as Psychology, Sociology, Economics, and Political Science can provide a further context for the understanding of crime, law, and criminal justice, while courses in areas such as art history, theater, and music can enhance the quality of the student's entire life. Field study placements are available in police departments, public defenders' offices, probation and parole agencies, the Orange County District Attorney's Office, the State juvenile detention sys\u00ad tem, the Orange County Victim/Witness Assistance Program, juve\u00ad nile shelters, legislative offices, and in private legal firms.

David Dooley, Department Chair The Department of Psychology and Social Behavior is concerned with human behavior in social contexts. A major objective is to investigate how different social environments (e.g., the family, school, workplace, culture) affect health and human behavior across the life span. The Department's faculty share a strong com\u00ad mitment to interdisciplinary scholarship and research that has the potential for application to important societal problems. Students begin with basic course work in developmental psychology, health and preclinical (abnormal) psychology, and social and environmen\u00ad tal psychology. Subsequent courses cover such topics as social, emotional, and cognitive development in children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly; behavior disorders and developmental psy\u00ad chopathology; cultural, social, and personality influences on behavior; attitude formation and change; health psychology; cogni\u00ad tion and emotion; stress and coping; psychology and the law; and counseling and therapy. Opportunities are available to work with faculty members on research in these and other areas. Obtaining research experience as an undergraduate also provides a valuable background for entry into many graduate programs. The Depart\u00ad ment offers a B.A. degree program in Psychology and Social Behavior. Students are given a foundation that will enable them to pursue graduate work in psychology, public health, health services, social work, counseling, or education, or to work after graduation from UCI in both the private and public sectors. Field study opportuni\u00ad ties include hospital settings, social service agencies, educational institutions, and community health clinics and counseling centers, among others. Students should be aware that psychology courses are offered in several different departments and programs at UCI. Students inter\u00ad ested in developmental, clinical, social, emotional, health, cross\u00ad cultural, or environmental psychology, or in psychology and the law, are advised to consult the course listings here in the Depart\u00ad ment of Psychology and Social Behavior section. These courses offer students a solid foundation in general psychology. Students interested in language, perception, sensorimotor integration, mem\u00ad ory, learning, mathematical psychology, and neuroscience are advised to consult the course listings in the Department of Cogni\u00ad tive Sciences and the School of Biological Sciences sections of the Catalogue.

DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING, POLICY, AND DESIGN World Wide Web: http://www.seweb.uci.edu/ppd Marlon G. Boarnet, Department Chair The Department of Planning, Policy, and Design utilizes an inter\u00ad disciplinary approach to the study of urban and regional planning, public policy issues, and the built environment. The Department faculty devote their scholarly and teaching efforts to theory-driven and empirically oriented urban research and their interests include urban and community development, environmental policy, health promotion and policy, and urban design and behavior. The faculty focus on education in urban, social, public policy, and environmen\u00ad tal problems. The Department offers the Ph.D. degree in Planning, Policy, and Design; the Master of Urban and Regional Planning professional degree (fully accredited by the national Planning Accreditation Board); and an undergraduate minor in Urban and Regional Plan\u00ad ning. The Department's graduate degree programs feature innova\u00ad tive teaching often involving students in community projects, and a significant degree of accessibility by students to faculty members. The 19 full-time faculty members in the Department are productive and influential scholars. The Department's teaching, research, and graduate training utilize UCI's proximity to both urban centers and planned communities, as well as the University's location within the dynamic and multicultural Southern California and Pacific Rim regions. Collaborative academic and research ties are maintained with UCI's Institute of Transportation Studies, Center for Global UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Peace and Conflict Studies, Newkirk Center for Science and Soci\u00ad ety, Focused Research Group on International Environmental Pol\u00ad icy, Center for Community Health, Community Outreach Partner\u00ad ship Center, Center for Unconventional Security Affairs, Center for Organizational Research, and the Urban Water Research Center. The common mission linking the Department's undergraduate, master's, and doctorate-level instruction and faculty research efforts is to bring applied research to the cause o{ bettering individ\u00ad uals, neighborhoods, communities, and regions. Southern Califor\u00ad nia has grown dramatically over the past four decades and will soon become the nation's largest urban corridor. The challenges to maintain the quality of life, provide employment opportunities, and reduce the deep socioeconomic disparities of this bi-national and multicultural metropolitan region are enormous. Extremely diverse, multiethnic communities face the necessity of solving their prob\u00ad lems in ways that are acceptable to their populations. Older central city areas that are vital to the region face issues of social and eco\u00ad nomic sustainability. The need to create employment opportunities, through the application of new technologies in industries and ser\u00ad vices, will be a constant feature of an urban region undergoing such population increases. At the same time, urban growth and transportation will have to meet increasingly stringent environmen\u00ad tal regulations that can safeguard the population's health and qual\u00ad ity of the diverse natural environments. The urban design and land\u00ad scape of most communities stand to be reshaped as never before, as the building stock ages and the need to redevelop intensifies. The Department is grouped into four major clusters, each address\u00ad ing sets of important issues to contemporary society. Faculty mem\u00ad bers and students who study urban and community development examine contemporary planning approaches to managing local, community, and regional development and explore the spatial dynamics of urbanization in diverse settings and how public policy can guide urban and regional growth to balance environmental and economic concerns. Faculty members and students engaged in design-behavior research investigate the interrelationships of peo\u00ad ple and their socio-physical environments at all scales, from micro to macro, with emphasis on urban design and community-scale issues. Faculty members and students who examine environmental policy focus on the environment and natural resources as important policy and planning issues and provide a clear understanding about how politics, economics, ethics, and institutions affect planning and policy choices. Finally, faculty members and students who study health promotion and policy investigate issues at the inter\u00ad face between (I) urban planning and health policy and (2) commu\u00ad nity and individual health. They exainine the public welfare, psy\u00ad chological, and health implications of social and physical planning, and the techniques and goals of public health policy making.

Urban and Regional Planning Minor Requirements Nine courses (36 units): Environmental Analysis and Design E8, E107U, and seven additional upper-division Environmental Analy\u00ad sis for undergraduate courses are available in the Department of Environmental Health, Science, and Policy section. NOTE: A maximum of three courses may be counted toward both the minor in Urban and Regional Planning and the majors in Envi\u00ad ronmental Analysis and Design or Social Ecology. (Environmental Analysis and Design E8 is by necessity one of the three.) Social Ecology 423 GRADUATE PROGRAMS Graduate training in the School of Social Ecology is organized around the study of contemporary problems in the social and phys\u00ad ical environment. Emphasis is placed primarily upon theory and research that have implications for policy and intervention. Prob\u00ad lems are investigated from the complementary perspectives of a multidisciplinary faculty that includes specialists in social, devel\u00ad opmental, clinical, environmental, and health psychology; urban and regional planning, public policy, and architecture; urban soci\u00ad ology; law and society; criminology; environmental health sci\u00ad ences; and public health. Among issues of long-standing interest in the School are crime and justice in society, social influences on health and human develop\u00ad ment over the life course, and the effects of the physical environ\u00ad ment on health and human behavior. The graduate curriculum emphasizes an interdisciplinary orientation, training students to draw upon the knowledge offered by several of the traditional aca\u00ad demic fields in order to examine important social, legal, and envi\u00ad ronmental problems from a perspective of breadth as well as depth. The School offers M.A., M.A.S., M.S., M.U.R.P., and Ph.D. degree programs. Doctoral students have the opportunity to pursue an individualized course of study in the principles and methods of social ecology for the Ph.D. in Social Ecology. Additional degree programs offered are: Ph.D. in Criminology, Law and Society; Ph.D. in Planning, Policy, and Design; and Ph.D. in Psychology and Social Behavior. Master's degrees include the M.A. in Social Ecology; the M.A. in Social Ecology with a concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis; the M.A.S. in Criminology, Law and Society; and the Master of Urban and Regional Planning. In addition, many students in the Ph.D. programs in Criminology, Law and Society and in Psychology and Social Behavior obtain an M.A. in Social Ecology on the way to their Ph.D. NOTE: Admis\u00ad sion is not available to the M.S. or Ph.D: programs in Environmen\u00ad tal Health Science and Policy or to the Ph.D. in Social Ecology with a concentration in Environmental Analysis and Design. Social Ecology faculty members apply diverse methods of scien\u00ad tific inquiry to study social and environmental problems. Evalua\u00ad tion research, legal research, questionnaire and survey methods, field research, naturalistic observation, and quasi-experimental techniques receive emphasis along with laboratory experimenta\u00ad tion. Collaborative research with faculty members is an jmportant component of graduate education in the School. A sampling of faculty research and teaching interests includes human stress; health promotion; biobehavioral\u00b7 bases of health and illness; program economic parenthood; personality and psychopathol\u00ad ogy; effects of chemical and social environments on early child development; urban growth management and policies; transporta\u00ad tion policies; poverty and homelessness; community design and development; regional economic development; water quality and water policy; air quality; biotechnology; epidemiology; the use of scientific information in public policy formation and litigation; community approaches to HIV/AIDS prevention; the health impacts of work environments; environmental health sciences; and processes involved in environmental regulation.

Master's Programs M.A. IN SOCIAL .ECOLOGY The M.A. degree in Social Ecology option is available to those stu\u00ad dents who have been admitted to one of the Ph.D. degree programs in Criminology, Law and Society; Psychology and Social Behav\u00ad ior; or Planning, Policy, and Design. In very rare circumstances a student may be admitted directly to the M.A. degree program in Social Ecology. Consult with the Graduate Student Services Office before submitting an application or for additional questions; tele\u00ad phone (949) 824-5918. Each M.A. degree student is assigned a faculty advisor with whom the student discusses an individual program of education. The M.A. degree program in Social Ecology requires a thesis and satis\u00ad factory completion of seven approved courses (28 units), including the Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200), Research Methods (Social Ecology 201, or its departmental equivalent), and at least one additional approved course in statistics or methodol\u00ad ogy. Other courses should be selected with regard to the student's academic and career objectives, and must be approved by the fac\u00ad ulty advisor. The seven required courses must include at least five graduate courses and must be exclusive of any directed study, inde\u00ad pendent study, or thesis courses (Social Ecology 298, 299, or 295). A grade of B or better must be achieved in all courses. Students are advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree, and a thesis committee is appointed, after a review of their graduate work and thesis plans by a faculty committee. M.A. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY WITH A CONCENTRA\u00ad TION IN DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS The M.A. in Social Ecology with a concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis offers training in the practical research skills needed to address analytical problems confronting society, busi\u00ad ness, government, and the nonprofit sector. The concentration emphasizes the Pacific Rim and issues defining Southern Califor\u00ad nia's population, such as immigration, changing household and family structure, racial and economic inequalities, and the impact of local and regional population growth. Informed by the interdis\u00ad ciplinary field of demography, the program draws on faculty and courses in the Schools of Social Ecology and Social Sciences. The concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis offers the option of additional professional certification for doctoral students already admitted to the School of Social Ecology. Admission, core course, and thesis requirements are identical to those for the gen\u00ad eral M.A. in Social Ecology. In addition, students must complete 12 uriits of designated electives in population issues or research methods. Up to two upper-division undergraduate courses may be approved to fulfill the elective requirement. Students interested in this concentration should call the Graduate Counseling Office at (949) 824-5924 for more information. M.A.S. IN CRIMINOLOGY, LAW AND SOCIETY The Master of Advanced Study (M.A.S.) in Criminology, Law and Society, the first online degree program of its kind in the Univer\u00ad sity of California system, prepares professionals for leadership positions in the criminal justice and legal communities. The cur\u00ad riculum emphasizes theoretical and practical applications on topics that are central to crime and its control, social policy, and the law. In keeping with one of the main tenets of the School of Social Ecology, faculty and students approach topics from a multidiscipli\u00ad nary perspective. This program is ideally suited for professionals interested in or working in the criminal justice or legal fields who are seeking a graduate degree for career advancement. The program consists of 52 units of course work completed over a two-year period (six quarters) plus a one-week in-residence requirement during the first summer. In lieu of a thesis, students are requir,ed to take a capstone course in the winter quarter of the second year of study. A degree is awarded upon completion of 10 required courses, plus three elective courses. One traditional face-to-face course taken on the UCI campus, in an accelerated format (five days), is required at the beginning of a student's course of study, with the remaining courses all completed online. M.S. IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND POLICY NOTE: Admission to this program is not available. The Master of Science (M.S.) in Environmental Health Science and Policy (EHSP).trains environmental professionals for applied ana\u00ad lytical and administrative positions in environmental health busi\u00ad nesses, government, and the nonprofit sector. In common with the doctoral program in EHSP, training focuses on the integration of natural and social science knowledge for the promotion of human health within a sustainable ecosystem. M.S. students must com\u00ad plete a core of five required courses: Environmental Health Science (EHS) I, II, III; Data Analysis, Part A (Social Ecology 264A); and Data Analysis, Part B (Social Ecology 264B) or Ecological Model\u00ad ing (Social Ecology 252); and three electives. Students must also complete a field study of about six months in duration, resulting in UC IRVINE - 2006-2007a defended Master's thesis and degree completion within two to three years. MASTER OF URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING The Master of Urban and Regional Planning (M.U.R.P.) program trains professionals in contemporary methods related to planning. The program is fully accredited by the national Planning Accredi\u00ad tation Board and has 19 core full-time faculty. Students gain famil\u00ad iarity with planning problems and practices through a series of courses on the growth and development of metropolitan areas, and the environmental, economic, and social challenges that modern communities face. This program views planners as mediators between the market-driven forces of metropolitan change and the environmental, economic, and social impacts of such change. The M.U.R.P. degree program requires the completion of 72 units, distributed between core and elective courses. Required courses are History of Urban Planning (U202); Theoretical Foundations of Planning (U203); Microeconomics Analysis for Urban Planning (U206); Quantitative Analysis for Planners (U214); Development -Control Law and Policy or Environmental Law and Policy (U207 or U252); Analytical Methods for Planning (U215); Regional Analysis or Housing or Demographics for Planners (U223 or U246 or U228); Professional Report (U292); and two quarters of Urban Planning Studio (U280A-B). Master's degree specializations include community development and social policy; economics and public policy; land use policy; environmental policy and planning; transportation policy; community health planning; and urban design and behavior. In addition, a written comprehensive exami\u00ad nation or a professional report is required during the second year of the program. Successful completion of the examination or pro\u00ad fessional report is required before the degree can be awarded. A thesis is not required. Some of the specific planning issues addressed include the envi\u00ad ronmental, social, health, and economic impacts of urban and regional development; regional growth management; state and municipal fiscal policy; poverty-related concerns; urban design; the operation of housing markets; land-use law and regula\u00ad tion; transportation planning; and planning for urban development in newly industrialized countries. Students are provided with a rig\u00ad orous foundation in the tools that public and private sector planners use, and also with the intellectual wherewithal to use these tools effectively in addressing planning problems. Practical experience in community planning in the form of part\u00ad time planning internships is strongly encouraged and supported as part of a student's education. Additionally, a two-quarter Planning Studio in the second year of study links classroom learning to work on a community-based and client-based planning project. Students have access to geographic information systems (ARC\u00ad GIS) courses. Students also have full access to computer laborato\u00ad ries in the two Social Ecology buildings which are equipped with word processing, statistical, spreadsheet, and database programs; electronic mail, and World Wide Web browsers. The range of employment opportunities for professional planners in the public and private sectors is expanding due to rapid metro\u00ad politan growth, rising concerns over health and environmental issues, and the continuing need for redevelopment and social ser\u00ad vices in older communities. Career paths exist in government agen\u00ad cies dealing with urban planning; economic development; trans\u00ad growth management; air quality and water treatment; public utilities; health care organizations and public health agencies; and conservation organizations and agen\u00ad cies. Many employment possibilities also exist with private con\u00ad sulting firms specializing in environmental impact assessment, with residential and commercial development firms, and many engineer\u00ad ing and architectural firms. Social Ecology 425 Concurrent Master's Degree Program with Civil and Environmental Engineering The Department of Planning, Policy, and Design (PPD) and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering offer a concurrent degree program that allows students to earn both a master's in Civil Engi\u00ad neering (M.S.) and a master's in Urban and Regional Planning (M.U.R.P.) in two years (instead of in more than three years). The concurrent degree program requires 72 uJ;J.its of study and is orga\u00ad nized around two tracks: (1) transportation systems, and (2) envi\u00ad ronmental hydrology and water resources. The program core com\u00ad prises 15 graduate courses for the transportation systems track, and 13 graduate and two undergraduate courses for the environmental hydrology and water resources track. Students choose between a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. The thesis option requires completion of 72 units of study (eight of which may be taken in conjunction with the thesis research); completion of an original research project and the writing of a thesis to describe it; completion of required core courses; and completion of enough units of approved electives to meet the total requirement of 72 units. The comprehensive exami\u00ad nation opti_on also requires completion of 72 units of study as well as a professional report, which represents a substantial piece of planning practice, as the capstone event. These units of study include core courses and eno1,1gh units of approved electives to meet the total requirement of 72 units, with no redundancy of core courses in either PPD or CEE. Electives may include as many as eight units of independent study or approved undergraduate courses. Undergraduates seeking admission to the concurrent master's degree program should have a strong record of course work in dis\u00ad ciplines related to civil engineering and urban planning, and they must meet the requirements for admission in both departments. For more information about these requirements, see http://www.eng. uci.edu/cee/grad/requirements, and http://www.seweb.uci.edu/ ppd/admissions.uci. \u00b7 Ph.D. Programs The doctoral programs offered by the School of Social Ecology prepare students for academic careers in research and teaching. Graduates also are well qualified for employment in private or gov\u00ad ernment agencies, where they can bring advanced academic train\u00ad ing; strong methodological and statistical skills, and special exper\u00ad tise to such issues as environmental health and design; urban and regional planning; criminal justice; and social policies affecting mental and physical health across the life course. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. degree is either five or six years, depending upon the specific program. Each incoming Ph.D. student is assigned a faculty advisor with whom the student should meet at least once every quarter to dis\u00ad cuss an individualized program of graduate education. A student may be formally advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree when all requirements except the dissertation have been completed, and when the student's dissertation plan has been approved by the candidacy committee appointed by the School of Social Ecology, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council. The student will appear before this committee for an oral examination. The dissertation plan will include a thor\u00ad ough examination of the history of the problem being proposed for investigation, its current status, the way in which the proposed research will further knowledge, a detailed specification of the pro\u00ad posed method of investigating the problem, and a description of the planned methods for analyzing the data collected. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is either three or four years, depend\u00ad ing upon the program. In no case will students be allowed to advance to candidacy after the end of their fifth year of study. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 426 UCI 2006-07 School of Social Ecology Formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree will be \u00b7 approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon recommendation by a unanimous vote of the student's candidacy committee. Alter\u00ad natively, the committee may recommend a course of action to strengthen the student for advancement to candidacy at a future date. When the student is advanced to candidacy, a doctoral com\u00ad mittee will be appointed on behalf of the Graduate Council. The doctoral committee, ordinarily consisting of three members of the faculty, will supervise the preparation and completion of the doc\u00ad toral dissertation. The dissertation should be completed and accepted within one to two years, and no later than three calendar years after the student's advancement to candidacy. All Ph.D. students who have not been advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by members of the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each year. At that time, the faculty may recommend that the student continue toward the Ph.D. degree, complete the M.A. degree only, or cease graduate studies in the School. Evaluation of Ph.D. students who have advanced to candidacy is the responsibil\u00ad ity of the student's doctoral dissertation committee. Ph.D. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY The Ph.D. program in Social Ecology allows students to develop a tailored course of graduate study that draws upon the knowledge of several traditional academic disciplines. This is a small distin\u00ad guished program intended for genuinely interdisciplinary doctoral students. The emphases of this training program are in keeping with the academic mission of the School, namely, its emphases on an ecological approach to research and policy, an interdisciplinary approach to research and community intervention, and the applica\u00ad tion of theory and research to community problem solving. Stu\u00ad dents are encouraged to integrate the diverse theoretical and methodological insights of several disciplines in order to analyze important social and environmental problems from a perspective of breadth as well as depth. In doing so, students gain familiarity with the classic and contemporary literature in social ecology and with the application of the ecological paradigm, as it has evolved in the natural and behavioral sciences. This program is ideally suited for independent students who wish to develop a unique interdepart\u00ad mental program of study in consultation with faculty from several departments. Each incoming student takes Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200), Research Methods (Social Ecology 201), two approved quarters of graduate-level statistics, one additional approved research methods course, and six elective courses, chosen in consultation with the faculty advisor. The normative time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years, and the maximum time per\u00ad mitted is seven years. Students are encouraged to become involved in research in their first year of study by participating in the research projects of the faculty. Students complete a supervised research project before they begin work on their doctoral disserta\u00ad tion. Research is broadly construed to include experimental meth\u00ad ods, questionnaire and interview studies, systematic field observa\u00ad tion, secondary analyses, and legal analyses. This predissertation research project should be completed during the second year in residence and must be evaluated and approved by a committee of three faculty members. Students complete the breadth requirement during their third year of study. This is accomplished through successful completion of either a written comprehensive examination or the submission of a major paper or series of papers that intensively examine specific substantive problems and bodies of research. Preferably, the per\u00ad spective taken should be multidisciplinary, but a single disciplinary approach is acceptable if it is more congruent with the student's educational goals and is acceptable to the student's committee. Each student's plans for completing the breadth requirement are developed in collaboration with a committee of three Social Ecology faculty members. Students are encouraged to meet with this committee as early as possible during their graduate career and are required to do so no later than the third quarter of their second year. When the student's plans have been approved and imple\u00ad mented, the examining committee will determine whether the breadth requirement was successfully completed, and will recom\u00ad mend additional academic work if it is deemed necessary. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is three years. The fourth, and possibly fifth, years of study are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and conducting dissertation research. Ph.D. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY WITH A CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND DESIGN NOTE: Admission to this program is not available. The doctoral concentration in Environmental Analysis and Design prepares students to conduct research on questions of vital impor\u00ad tance to professionals in environmental analysis and evaluation and on related questions on the formulation of environmental and health policy. These questions reflect an overarching concern with the effects of the natural and built environments on the health and social well-being of humans. This doctoral concentration particularly focuses on insights from a social ecological perspective. One of the concentration's strengths is its research sequence which spans the disciplines within the Depart\u00ad ment of Environmental Health, Science, and Policy and the Depart\u00ad ment of Planning, Policy, and Design. Students typically choose the majority of their graduate classes from those two departments, although students are encouraged to take classes across the campus to improve their knowledge of related fields as well. Students conduct analyses of sociocultural, behavioral, biological, chemical, and physical factors that influence health and well-being of humans, including public and private sector policy as well as the environment as a whole. They are also trained to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to enhance the health of individuals and the community as a whole. The curriculum and diversity of faculty within the concentration afford unique opportu\u00ad nities for multidisciplinary research and training. Potential employment sources for graduates include academic and research institutions; state and federal agencies; policy-making organizations; national, community, and workplace health-promo\u00ad tion programs; and a diverse range of consulting firms ranging from engineering to design. Each incoming student takes the five core courses required of most Ph.D. students, noted earlier, and eight elective courses drawn from the focal areas within this concentration: Environmental Analysis, Environmental Policy, Earthquake Geology and Environmental Hazard, Social Epidemiology, and Environmental Health. The elec\u00ad tive courses cover topics such as environmental health risks, behav\u00ad ioral epidemiology, demography, and technological hazards and change. The normative time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years, and the maximum time permitted is seven years. Students are expected to become involved in research activities in their first year of graduate study. Students complete a supervised research project before they begin work on their doctoral dissertation. This predissertation research project should be completed during the second year in residence (preferably by the end of the winter quar\u00ad ter of the second year). The research project must be evaluated and approved by a committee of three faculty members. Students com\u00ad plete the breadth requirement, described earlier, during their third year of study. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is three years. The fourth and fifth years of study are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and conducting dissertation research. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Ph.D. IN CRIMINOLOGY, LAW AND SOCIETY The study of crime, institutional responses to illegal behavior, and the interaction of law and society are the foci of the doctoral pro\u00ad gram in Criminology, Law and Society. Students exa~ine i_ss~es related to the etiology of crime, the process of changmg cnmmal behavior, social regulation, the civil justice system, and the social and cultural context of law. Students gain familiarity with a number of subjects inclu~ing se~\u00ad white collar and organized crime; policies against hate crimes; behavior of courts, juries, and regulatory agencies; envi\u00ad ronmentallaw; immigration lawmaking; Native American justice issues; and the interaction among law, culture, and identity. In gen\u00ad eral, students are introduced to the leading classical and contempo\u00ad rary issues in criminology, law and society and to ways of under\u00ad standing them through interdisciplinary research. The program aims to develop theoretical sophistication and to prepare the gradu\u00ad ate student for faculty positions at major universities; and for research and administrative work in institutions in the legal system, the criminal justice system, and related organizations. In addition to the four core courses required of most Ph.D. students (Social Ecology 200, two additional quarters of graduate-level sta\u00ad tistics, and one additional approved research methods course), stu\u00ad dents take at least five required courses, Research Methods (C201), Crime and Public Policy (C230); Theories of Crime, (C235), Law and Society, (C239), and Legal Reasoning, (C237), and three elec\u00ad tive courses in Criminology, Law and Society. These elective courses should be chosen in consultation with the student's faculty advisor. Students become involved in research activities from the earliest stages of their training and complete an independent, supervised research project during the second year of graduate study. Methods of research may include questionnaires and sur\u00ad veys, systematic field observation, computer simulation: legal analyses, and archival research. Students complete a wntten com\u00ad prehensive examination during year three, which requires them to demonstrate mastery of major theoretical, substantive, and method\u00ad ological issues in criminology, law and society. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is four years (three years for stu\u00ad dents who entered with a master's degree). The fourth and, possi\u00ad bly, fifth years of study are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and completing dissertation research. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is six years, and the maxi\u00ad mum time permitted is seven years. (For students who entered with a master's degree the time to degree is five years, with a maximum of six years.) All Ph.D. students in the Criminology, Law and Soci\u00ad ety program are required to pass a final oral defense of the disser\u00ad tation. Opportunities for field placements in legal and criminal jus\u00ad tice settings also are available. Ph.D. IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND POLICY NOTE: Admission to this program is not available. Human health and the integrity of the natural environment are inter\u00ad dependent. More now than ever, challenges in public health an~ the environment must be faced using knowledge both from the soc1al and the natural sciences. The graduate program in Environmental Health Science and Policy (EHSP) is rooted in existing disciplines, but emphasizes cross-disciplinary research that is emeq~in~ from common bases that span both the social and the natural sc1ences. To optimize flexibility, including options for primary emphasis on labo\u00ad ratory and field work, the curriculum is organized ~ound four con\u00ad centrations. The concentration in Environmental BIOtechnology pro\u00ad vides training in the use of microbial, genetic, or molecular applications for environmental monitoring, environmental cleanup, Social Ecology 427 and public health prevention and diagnostics of environmental haz\u00ad ards. The concentration in Environmental Health Science expands the conventional focus of this discipline to approach research ques\u00ad tions in an ecological context. The concentration in Environmental Management and Policy explores the linkages between physical . environmental problems and the social institutions that are both t?e1r -cause and solution. The concentration in Epidemiology and Pubhc Health embeds traditional approaches in these fields within a frame\u00ad work of physical, natural, and social systems. Within each concentration, students are expected to develop inter\u00ad ests in particular substantive problems, for example, those of the core faculty, including water quality monitoring and bioremedia\u00ad tion, toxic metals in the environment (their characterizations, expo\u00ad sure levels, and health effects), international conflict and coopera\u00ad tion in resource management, epidemiology of environmental cancers as well as of violence and injury-prevention. Students are prepared to become active researchers, able to assume positions i~ higher education, government, commerce, or the nonprofit sector m environmental health sciences and related fields. Students must elect one of the four EHSP concentrations within their first year. For all concentrations, students must complete a core of five required courses: Environmental Health Science (EHS) I, II, III; Data Analysis, Part A (Social Ecology 264A); and Data An~ly\u00ad sis, Part B (Social Ecology 264B) or Ecological Modeling (Soc1al Ecology 252). In addition, students must complete six approved electives relating to their respective concentrations. Consistent with the program's multidisciplinary nature, elective courses may be drawn not only from within the Department of Environmental Health, Science, and Policy but (with approval) from throughout the School of Social Ecology and the campus (including, for exam\u00ad ple, the College of Health Sciences and the Schools of Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Engineering). After the second year, students must submit a written doctoral research proposal. Advancement to doctoral candidacy is achieved upon successful defense of the proposal during an oral, comprehensive qualifying examination. In addition, doctoral students must serve a minimum of three quarters as a teaching assistant. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is three years. The normal time for com\u00ad pletion of the Ph.D. is five years, and the maximum time permitte~ is seven years. All Ph.D. students in the Environmental Health Sci\u00ad ence and Policy program are required to pass a final oral defense of the dissertation. Ph.D. IN PLANNING, POLICY, AND DESIGN The Planning, Policy, and Design doctorate program trains scholars to have national and international prominence in the analysis of social problems related to the built and natural environments. Fac\u00ad ulty strengths span planning, policy, and design, an~ faculty_ are at the cutting edge of teaching and research that exammes the mter\u00ad play of these three currently distinct approaches. There is a growing recognition that many pressing social problems require perspectives that combine an understanding of planning, policy process, and the built environment. For example, efforts to control transportation problems by building neighborhoods that encourage alternatives to the automobile require an understanding of travel behavior and human interactions with the built environ\u00ad ment. Understanding how to reduce tobacco use requires an appre\u00ad ciation of how behavior is shaped by programmatic interventions, community settings and norms, and policy tools. Environmental cooperation across national borders often requires under~tanding of political processes, infrastructure systems, and metro~ohtan struc\u00ad ture and governance in regions, such as the U.S.-Mex1co border, where population is concentrated in urban settlements that span the border. And, issues of public safety are increasingly related to.the design of public and private spaces, and how those spaces are used and regulated. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 428 UCI 2006-07 School of Social Ecology In all of these areas, public and private officials are increasingly working on topics that span the boundaries of several traditional academic disciplines. The PPD program is designed to give stu\u00ad dents a strong background in one of four specializations and thus to produce scholars and practitioners capable of responding to the complexity of problems facing contemporary society. The PPD program offers four specializations-urban and commu\u00ad nity development, design-behavior research, environmental policy, and health promotion and policy. Urban and Community Devel\u00ad opment examines contemporary planning approaches to managing local, community, and regional development. Students explore the spatial dynamics of urbanization in diverse settings and how public policy can guide urban and regional growth to balance environ\u00ad mental and economic concerns. Design-Behavior Research inves\u00ad tigates the inter-relationships of people and their socio-physical environments at all scales, from micro to macro, with emphasis on urban design and community-scale issues. The School of Social Ecology is an international leader in environment design research since the field's earliest developments. Environmental Policy focuses on the environment and natural resources as important pol\u00ad icy and planning issues. A clear understanding about how politics, economics, ethics, and institutions affect planning and policy choices is the emphasis of this specialization. The School has among the largest concentrations of environmental policy faculty of any planning department in the United States. Health Promo\u00ad tion and Policy focuses on the interface between planning and community and individual health, examining the public welfare, psychological, and health implications of social and physical plan\u00ad ning; and the techniques and goals of public health policy Jllaking. The Ph.D. curriculum is composed of three parts: (1) Planning, Policy, and Design core (required of all students); (2) area cores (each student affiliates with one of four areas of specialization and is required to complete the core courses for that area); and (3) elec\u00ad tives. All doctoral students take a total of 16 four-unit graduate \u00b7 courses, distributed across these three types of courses. Required courses in the Planning, Policy, and Design core are Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200); Research Design (U297); two courses in research methods/data analysis chosen from among the following: Data Analysis A (Social Ecology 264A), Data Analysis B (Social Ecology 264B), and Qualitative Research Methods: Overview (U209); and two courses selected in consultation with a faculty advisor that provide disciplinary/theo\u00ad retical orientation. In total, PPD students complete 72 units of study in their first two years. Participation in a faculty-supervised research project is required during the second year of study. The second year includes preparation for, and completion of, a comprehensive examination. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is four years. Fol\u00ad lowing this, dissertation research begins. The normative time for completion of the Ph.D. in Planning, Policy, and Design is six years, and the maximum time permitted is seven years. All Ph.D. students in the Planning, Policy, and Design Program are required to pass a final oral defense of the dissertation. Graduates with a doctorate degree in Planning, Policy, and Design are employed in a wide array of activities, ranging from university teaching and research, to administrative and research-oriented posi\u00ad tions in governmental agencies, international organizations, non\u00ad profit organizations, and private consulting practices. Ph.D. IN PSYCHOLOGY AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR The Department of Psychology and Social Behavior offers a Ph.D. program in Psychology and Social Behavior. The main goal of this program is to train behavioral scientists to apply theory and meth\u00ad ods in psychology, together with perspectives and knowledge from allied disciplines, to the analysis of human behavior and health across the life span and in diverse sociocultural contexts. This pro\u00ad gram values both basic and applied research that is relevant to the improvement of individual, community, and societal functioning. Emphasis is placed on the integration of knowledge from several subspecialties in psychology in order to understand the antecedents and developmental course of adaptive or maladaptive behavior and on the conduct of research that has implications for social policies, programs, and interventions. Training in this program emphasizes four core areas of psychology. The specialization in Developmental Psychology focuses on the development of individuals at various periods in the life course and the effects of varying social and cultural contexts on cognitive, social, and health outcomes. Health Psychology focuses on identi\u00ad fying, evaluating, and enhancing the psychosocial and behavioral factors that promote mental and physical health, prevent disease, and optimize medical treatments. The specialization in Psycho\u00ad pathology and Behavioral Disorder focuses on psychological, biobehavioral, and social environmental mechanisms that influence \u00b7the development, expression, and amelioration of psychopathology and behavioral disorder. Social and Personality Psychology focuses on the interrelations among attitudes, perceptions, motives, emotions, and personality characteristics as they affect individual functioning, interpersonal processes, and intergroup relations. In addition, several faculty offer courses and conduct research in the area of Psychology and Law, dealing with such issues as the mal\u00ad leability of memory processes, the ability of jurors to understand scientific evidence, the impact on children aild adolescents of con\u00ad tact with the legal system, and the response of the legal system to individuals with severe personality disorders. Students will learn to understand human behavior from a social ecological, contextual perspective. They will be exposed to the major theories in each specialization and learn various social sci\u00ad ence research methods. All students are encouraged to become actively involved in research from the earliest stage of their train\u00ad ing. Through close association with faculty members and participa\u00ad tion in the faculty's research projects, students learn to conduct methodologiCally sophisticated research that addresses contempo\u00ad rary psychological and social issues. Current research teams are investigating stress, coping, and social support; biobehavioral mechanisms of cardiovascular reactivity; personality factors that increase resilience to health threats; child care and its effects on child development; transitions across the life course; the effects of divorce and custody arrangement; adaptive aging; ment; culture, self, and well-being; relations between cognitive and emotional development; emotion regulation; memory and eyewit\u00ad ness testimony; violence and anger management; the development of health-risking and health-protecting behaviors during childhood and adolescence; economic stress and psychopathology/behavioral disorders; and assessment of and responses to environmental and health risks. All students take eight required core courses: Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200), Research Methods in Psychology (P201), Quantitative Methods in Psychology (P264A), Advanced Quantitative Methods in Psychology (P264B), an additional research methods/data analysis course from an approved list, Applied Psychological Research (P209A), Professional Issues in Psychology (P231 ), and Research Directions in Psychology and Social Behavior (P294A-B-C). The course on Applied Psychologi\u00ad cal Research (P209A) introduces students to the scientific, profes\u00ad sional, and ethical issues involved in conducting and translating psychological research in a variety of applied settings. Some stu\u00ad dents may wish to take a complementary (optional) course, Applied Psychological Research in Community Settings (P209B), that provides the opportunity for a supervised research internship UC IRVINE - 2006-2007in an appropriate community setting. The three-quarter course Research Directions in Psychology and Social Behavior (P294A-B\u00ad C) allows students to increase their breadth of knowledge regarding contemporary issues and controversies in psychology and social behavior by participating in the Department's weekly colloquium series and interacting with visiting scholars and other speakers. Additional courses are required for each specialization: Health Psychology (P258) and Biobehavioral Bases of Health and Illness (P273) for the Health Psychology specialization; Social Psycho!- . ogy (P214) and Personality (P233) for the Social and Personality Psychology specialization; Psychopathology and Behavioral Disor\u00ad der (P239) and Ecological Context of Behavioral Disorder (P243) for the Psychopathology and Behavioral Disorder specialization; and, for each of these specializations, two elective courses from a specified list. The Developmental Psychology specialization requires Developmental Psychology (P220), two life-span courses, plus one additional course from approved developmental electives. Finally, all students are required to select a minor specialization and complete one required specialization course and one elective course in this area. The minor specialization and elective courses should be chosen according to the plan that best meets the needs of the individual student, as determined in consultation with the stu\u00ad dent's faculty advisor and the departmental graduate advisor. In addition to courses offered by the Department of Psychology and Social Behavior and the School of Social Ecology, students may take courses offered by other departments in other schools such as the Departments of Cognitive Science, Anthropology, and Sociql\u00ad ogy in the School of Social Sciences and the Department of Neuro\u00ad biology and Behavior in the School of Biological Sciences. Students complete a supervised research project during their sec\u00ad ond year culminating in a paper that may form the basis for a pub\u00ad lication. They take a written comprehensive examination during their third year, which requires them to demonstrate mastery of the principles of social ecology and of major theoretical, substantive, and methodological issues in the study of their major and minor specializations and in the psychology of human behavior. The nor\u00ad mal time for advancement to candidacy is four years. The fourth year, and possibly fifth year, is devoted to developing and defend\u00ad ing a dissertation proposal and completing dissertation research. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is six years. Students must complete all requirements for the Ph.D. in Psychology and Social Behavior no later than their seventh year of study, adjusted for any approved leaves of absence that may have been taken. It is expected that most students will complete the degree requirements well in advance of this deadline. All Ph.D. students in the Psychol\u00ad ogy and Social Behavior program are required to pass a final oral defense of the dissertation. Potential employment sites for graduates of the program include academic institutions, research organizations, government policy institutes, health care and human services settings (e.g., hospitals, schools, community agencies), and a variety of private sector employers. The Ph.D. Program in Psychology and Social Behavior specializes in the training of researchers, not in the training of clin\u00ad ical practitioners.

The professor\u00ad ships normally are of a quarter's duration. Participants have included Martin Bronfenbrenner, Professor of Economics (Duke University) and Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; Philip Converse, Robert C. Angell Professor of Political Sciences and Sociology (University of Michigan), Pres\u00ad ident of the American Political Science Association, and member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sci\u00ad ences; Beatrice Whiting, Professor of Anthropology ~nd Education Emeritus, Gradu\\1-te School of Education (Harvard University), and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; John Whiting, Professor of Social Anthropology (Harvard University) and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; James Coleman, Professor of Sociology (University of Chicago) and member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Ameri\u00ad can Academy of Arts and Sciences; and Robin M. Williams, Department of Sociology (Cornell University) and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. OVERVIEW Undergraduate and graduate education in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences at UCI represents a commitment to modern social science. The classic subject areas of anthropology, economics, geography, linguistics, political science, psychology, and sociology are in\u00ad cluded in the School's educational programs, but these programs go well beyond the tniditional disciplines and can be characterized by the following emphases. First, the faculty recognizes the value of systematic empirical observation and quantitative analysis in the study of human behav\u00ad ior. Developments in computer science and in mathematics ori\u00ad ented toward the problems of the social sciences, and the refine\u00ad ment of techniques for the observational, experimental, and UC IRVINE - 2006-2007statistical study of human behavior, have contributed major new elements to social science. Students in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences will become familiar with the mathematical, computational, and statistical tools underlying modem social science. Second, many of the most interesting questions in the study of human behavior cannot be fixed within the traditional disciplinary boundaries. Some of the new and evolving areas which cross ortho\u00ad dox boundaries are political sociology, public policy, cognitive anthropology, arid psycholinguistics. Therefore many courses and course modules are built around these interdisciplinary social sci\u00ad ence phenomena rather than representing social science disciplines. Third, the School emp~asizes the design of hypotheses and of sys\u00ad tems of interrelated ideas as an essential part of scientific pursuit. Consequently, the educational programs place substantial emphasis on understanding social science phenomena through the develop\u00ad ment of theories that can be used to guide empirical studies. Educational opportunities for students in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences extend well beyond attendance at courses. Students may develop independent study proposals in cooperation with interested faculty members or may investigate social science applications via off-campus internships. They are invited to participate in the quar\u00ad terly evaluation of courses and instructors, to propose new courses and other modifications in existing programs, to nominate candidates for visiting faculty appointments, and to serve on School commit\u00ad tees. The School provides a variety of opportunities for faculty-stu\u00ad dent interaction, and students will find the faculty, administration, and academic counseling staff of the School highly accessible and responsive. Special Facilities The School of Social Sciences maintains several special facilities for research and education. The Social Sciences Research Laboratory, used for both faculty and student research, occupies the entire fourth floor of the Social Sciences Laboratory Building. The facility contains 40 experiment and control rooms and several specialized facilities including a vir\u00ad tual reality facility and cognition laboratory. The Farm School, a small, open, and ungraded elementary school located in a rural setting adjacent to the campus, serves as a research facility for faculty and students having interests in chil\u00ad dren and how they learn. Undergraduates receive course credit for assisting staff teachers, for developing educational materials, and for observing and analyzing child behavior at the school. Three Computer Laboratories provide access to networked sys\u00ad tems, where students can work on assignments using full-featured word-processing, database, graphics, and statistical packages. In addition, these computers provide students with access to e-mail, Internet services, and the World Wide Web. The Social Science Plaza facility contains state-of-the-art, high-tech lecture halls and is fully Internet accessible. The Social Sciences Academic Resource Center (SSARC) pro\u00ad vides personal assistance to all Social Sciences students on finding research opportunities, off-campus internships, and graduate and professional programs. The Center maintains a library of graduate school catalogues, Statement of Purpose tips and handouts, and GRE, GMAT, LSAT, and CBEST registration booklets and test preparation information. In addition, it offers a database of commu\u00ad nity and professional internships for students to attain hands-on experience in their field of study. SSARC is fully staffed and pro\u00ad vides Internet access to students, disseminates information on schol\u00ad arships, and conducts workshops on graduate school and other related post-baccalaureate opportunities. The Social Sciences Undergraduate Counseling Office provides general and detailed information about UCI, the School of Social Social Sciences 439 Sciences, and specific requirements exclusive to the majors and minors in the School to students, faculty, administrators, and the general public. SSUGCO is fully staffed with academic counselors who speak one-on-one with students regarding their UCI academic career as well as opportunities beyond the classroom. There are also eight peer academic advisors available to undergraduates for walk-in advising regarding requirements and classes. For more information, visit http://www.socsci.uci.edu/ugc/. Centers for Research The multidisciplinary Center for Cognitive Neuroscience is aimed at bringing together faculty and students interested in under\u00ad standing the relation between cognitive abilities and the neural sys\u00ad tems that support them. Center participants include 11 faculty and their laboratory members. Active areas of research in participating laboratories include visual and auditory perception, motor control, memory, speech and language, and attention, among others. This research is carried out using a variety of methods such as fMRI, EEG, MEG, TMS, as well as patient-based neuropsychological approaches. The Center for Decision Analysis, located in the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences (IMBS) in the School of Social Sciences, is a specialized research center where the objective is to facilitate interaction and common research goals among scientists whose purpose is to formulate precisely and test theories of human behavior. This is to be interpreted in a wide sense as manifested by the membership which spans the following areas: anthropology, cog\u00ad nitive science, economics, engineering, logic and philosophy of sci\u00ad ence, mathematics, political science, and sociology. Additional fac\u00ad ulty come from management science and psychobiology. To describe the focus, consider the fruitful symbiotic relationship that has existed for-millennia between mathematics and the physical sciences. A goal of IMBS is to generate a similar relationship between mathematics and the behavioral and social sciences. With high-power social scientists (several are members of the National Academy) providing insights about the field and working with the mathematicians who are involved, new mathematical approaches to analyze these issues are being developed and new kinds of mathe\u00ad matical questions are being raised. For more information, visit http://www.imbs.uci.edu/. The Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD) continues the work of the UCI Focused Research Program on Democratization that was founded in 1991 and sponsors research and training on the process of democratic transition and the expansion of the democratic process in already established democracies. CSD includes a multidisciplinary faculty from four UC campuses. CSD's activities are focused on three areas. First, faculty administer a graduate training program on empirical democratic theory. The National Science Foundation selected UCI in 1995 as a national cen\u00ad ter for the training of doctoral students in democratization issues; the five-year NSF grant provides funding for graduate fellowships and other training activities. Second, the Democracy research program aims at improving the democratic process in the United States and other established democracies as we enter the next century. The program focuses on reforms to increase the ability of citizens to express their preferences and have these preferences represented within the democratic process. Third, CSD supports research on the development of sustainable democracies in Eastern Europe, East Asia, and other new democra\u00ad cies. The New Democracies Initiative contributes to the promotion of democracy in these formerly authoritarian systems.

UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 440 UCI 2006-07 School of Social Sciences The UCI Interdisciplinary Center for the Scientific Study of Ethics and Morality was established in 2003 by a group of schol\u00ad ars interested in recent scientific research that yields insight on the origins and causes of morality. In creating the Center, UCI faculty both address a topic that is becoming one of the new frontiers in science and reflect critically on the moral implications of this new frontier. The Center focuses on the etiology of ethical behavior and differs in several important ways from existing centers dedicated to the discussion of ethics. Traditional academic apprmiches tend to origi\u00ad nate in philosophical, foundational, or religious discussions of ethics. They tend to be humanistic in orientation and emphasize abstract, theoretical considerations of what constitutes ethics and morality. The Center complements this traditional approach and explores the scientific and/or the empirically verifiable factors that influence morality, using a variety of methodologies that examine factors contributing to and driving moral action in a variety of social, psychological, and biological contexts. The Center encour\u00ad ages ties between scholars interested in ethics in humanities and the sciences-including social science, social ecology, biological sciences, and medicine-building on the interdisciplinary tradition at UCI, complementing, rather than duplicating, existing efforts. For more information, visit http://www.socsci.uci.edu/ethicscenter/ The Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies (CGPACS) is a multidisciplinary research unit housed in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences. The mission of CGPACS is to promote research on interna\u00ad tional problems and processes. The Center's current research emphases include: weapons of mass destruction, especially biologi\u00ad cal weapons; international governance, focusing on the evolution of international norms and institutions; citizen peace building; interna\u00ad tional environmental cooperation; and religion in international affairs. CGPACS also sponsors research conferences and public col\u00ad loquia on topics of ourrent significance. The Center's Margolis Lec\u00ad ture brings to UCI high-profile speakers who have played active roles in international affairs. Recent Margolis Lectures have featured Justice Louise Arbour, former chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunals; Chinese democracy activist Wei Jinsheng; Con\u00ad gressman Christopher Cox; former Secretary of State Warren Christopher; and former Secretary of Defense William Perry. For more information about CGPACS visit the Web site at http://hypatia. ss.uci.edu/gpacs. The purpose of the\u00b7UCI Center for Research on Immigration, Population, and Public Policy is to foster and conduct basic and policy-relevant research on international migration and other popula\u00ad tion processes, with a main focus ori U.S. immigration. In order to encourage multi-investigator, multidisciplinary, and interdisciplinary research projects, the Center organizes informal discussions of ideas for future research projects, \"brainstorming\" sessions about research funding opportunities, \"brown-bag\" presentations of research find\u00ad ings, and workshops and conferences. Much of the Center's research focuses on the multigenerational incorporation experiences of immi\u00ad grant groups in the United States, especially those occurring in diverse contexts such as Southern California. Investigations of this type often devote as much attention to what happens to the children and grandchildren of immigrants as to what happens to immigrants themselves. For more information, visit http://www.cri.uci.edu/. The Center for Research on Latinos in a Global Society (CRLGS) was formed in the 1999-2000 academic year. Since its founding, the Center has hosted a research colloquia series, pub\u00ad lished a series of working papers, provided grants for graduate and undergraduate students, and coordinated a series of focused research groups of faculty and graduate students. Over the next several years, CRLGS research projects will assess the political and social incorpo\u00ad ration of Latinos in Orange County and measure community atti\u00ad tudes toward resources and barriers.

Undergraduate Program PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Since there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major requirements, students should consult with the School of Social Sciences Under\u00ad graduate Counseling Office to design an appropriate program.of study. Students who select one of the School majors in their freshman year might begin by taking the one-digit courses required by their major and one of the mathematics sequences listed under Part A of the School requirements. It is a good idea to take these courses early since they include fundamental concepts that will be widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-divi\u00ad sion writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) should be completed during the first year. In the sophomore year, the student might complete the course on computing, three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in the social sciences, and four electives. Students wP.o are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, mathematics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the student should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. Change of Major. Students who wish to change their major to one offered by the school should contact the Social Sciences Undergrad\u00ad uate Counseling Office for information about change-of-major requirements, procedures, and policies. Information is also available at http://www.due.uci.edu/Change_of_Major.html. Double Majors In order to double major within the School of Social Sciences, major and school requirements must be met for both majors with no overlap of courses except for those used to satisfy the mathe\u00ad matics, computer technology, and introductory social science requirements. The mathematics and computer courses need only be taken once. Only two introductory social science classes are needed, provided this also meets the requirements of both major programs. The same two-digit and upper-division courses may not be used to meet the requirements of more than one major program. For example, a student who wishes to major in Psychology and Anthropology may take one of the mathematics sequences, Infor\u00ad mation and Computer Science lOA, lOB, or 21, or Social Science 3A, and may use Introduction to Psychology and Introduction to Anthropology to meet the major and School requirements for both programs. However, two different sets of two-digit and upper-divi\u00ad sion courses must be taken to complete the major and School requirements of the two programs. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 442 UCI 2006-07 School of Social Sciences Mathematics and Social Sciences The mathematics requirement stems from the nature of modem social science. The concepts and terms of mathematics, statistics, and computers are an important part of the social scientist's vocab\u00ad ulary. Basic knowledge of these tools is necessary to an under\u00ad standing of current literature in the social sciences, to the analysis of data, and to an intelligent use of social science models. Each candidate for a degree in the School of Social Sciences is expected to have a basic knowledge of probability, statistics, and computing. In addition, for students who are preparing for graduate school in an area of social science, it will be important to supplement the minimal mathematics requirements with additional courses related to mathematics and social science methodology. The particular courses which would be recommended are not specified here, how\u00ad ever, since they are highly dependent on the major emphasis of the student. Students who are preparing for graduate study should con\u00ad sult their advisors to determine a program of study which will give them the research skills necessary for successful graduate work. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements A. Familiarity with basic mathematical, computational, and statisti\u00ad cal tools underlying modem social sciences. This requirement is met by passing a three-course sequence in mathematics (Anthropology lOA-B-C, Mathematics 2A-B, 7, Psychology lOA-B-C, Social Science lOA-B-C, Social Science lOOA-B-C, or Sociology lOA-B-C). (NOTE: School of Social Sciences majors may not take Social Science 9A-B-C to fulfill the mathematics requirement.) Computer education is essential for a complete social science education. This requirement can be satisfied by passing Information and Computer Science lOA, lOB, or 21, or Social Science 3A. Departments may have pref\u00ad erences for specific courses. See your major department for acceptable courses. This course requirement should be taken during the student's first year. B. An understanding of the fundamental concepts, analytical tools, and methods of social science. This requirement is inet by tak\u00ad ing two four-unit introductory courses in the School of Social Sciences bearing a one-digit course number. (Such courses include Anthropology 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D; Economics 1; Linguis\u00ad tics 3; Political Science 6A, 6B, lA, 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D; Sociology 1.) These courses normally should be taken during the student's first year. (NOTE: This requirement may be fulfilled by option B of the departmental requirements for stu\u00ad dents majoring in Political Science.) C. An understanding of important advanced areas in social science. This requirement is met by passing satisfactorily nine four-unit upper-division courses in the School of Social Sciences, where at least three of these courses comprise core courses or a mod\u00ad ule. (NOTE: The major in Social Science requires 11 four-unit upper-division courses.) For modules which are listed with more than three courses, the student may normally elect to take any subset of three courses in the module. Appropriate substitu\u00ad tions may be made upon petition. D. Four additional four-unit social science courses from any level. Students are reminded that the Pass/Not Pass option is not applica\u00ad ble to course requirements A through D above or to any additional requirements listed for specific major programs. However, Infor\u00ad mation and Computer Science lOA, lOB, 21, and Social Science lOOA are exceptions to this rule and may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Courses used to meet requirements B through D above are included in the computation of the grade point average in courses required in the major program. Maximum Overlap Between Major and Minor Requirements: Students completing both a major and a minor within the School of Social Sciences may count courses taken to fulfill the School's mathematics and computer science requirement toward satisfaction of both the major and the minor. No other course overlap is allowed. TRANSFER STUDY RECOMMENDATIONS The School recommends that students wishing to transfer to UCI do the following: 1. Complete the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) prior to transfer to UCI. 2. Refer to http://www.assist.org/ for information about community college courses that will fulfill UCI lower-division major requirements. \u00b7 Specific course recommendations: Prospective Economics majors: complete a second semester of calculus (in addition to the courses required for transfer-student admission; see the Department of Economics section). Prospective International Studies majors: complete two semesters of foreign language at the intermediate level. Prospective Psychology majors: complete a three-course sequence in introductory, physiological, and either social or abnormal psychology. TRANSFER STUDENTS Freshmen and Sophomores: Students transferring to UCI as freshmen or sophomores will fulfill the regular requirements of the four-year program either through work at UCI or through transfer credit for comparable work elsewhere. Juniors: Following review by the School of Social Sciences, it may be determined that junior transfer students electing to major in one of the School's degree programs, who have good records at other accredited colleges and universities, have satisfied School requirement B and the University requirements. However, all transfer students must fulfill the upper-division writing breadth requirement (category I) while at UCI. Students anticipating transfer to UCI in their junior year should plan their curriculum so as to anticipate the special mathematics requirement (School requirement A). Every effort will be made to accommodate individual variation in back\u00ad ground, provided students are prepared to commit themselves to intensive work in areas of deficiency. Ordinarily, the typical two\u00ad year program for junior transfers is simply the last two years of the regular four-year program, except that students who have not satis\u00ad fied the mathematics requirements of the School should plan to do so in the junior year and must do so before graduation. Seniors: Students wishing to graduate with a degree in the School' by transferring to UCI in their senior year should plan their work carefully to ensure that the requirements can be met in one year of residence. In general, differences between the program at UCI and programs elsewhere make senior transfers difficult. SERVICE LEARNING, COMMUNITY SERVICE, AND INTERNSHIPS Service learning is a meaningful activity that integrates service within the curriculum. It is an opportunity for students to make positive contributions to underserved and marginalized communi\u00ad ties through academic courses, field studies, and internships. Ser\u00ad vice learning provides out-of-class experiences to reinforce under\u00ad standing of academic theory while addressing serious community concerns. When cnmbined with a structured curriculum having research components, students can explore the role of the social scientist and help seek solutions to problems affecting society. The UC IRVINE - 2006-2007School of Social Sciences' philosophy is to practice research, ser\u00ad vice, and good citizenship. The School actively supports service learning through its philoso\u00ad phy of enhancing the learning process by motivating, inspiring, and teaching students how to recognize and accept their civic responsi\u00ad bilities. The goal is to educate students about social issues and pro\u00ad vide them with the necessary tools to solve the difficult problems society faces. Under the guidance and supervision of faculty and staff, students are offered the opportunity to experience personal, professional, social, and intellectual growth through the following School of Social Sciences programs: public-and private-sector internships, community service, field studies, and the specialization in Public and Community Service within the major in Social Science. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS IN K-12 EDUCATION Undergraduate students who wish to pursue a career in the field of K-12 education are well-served in the School of Social Sciences and the Department of Education. The following interrelated pro\u00ad grams provide opportunities for students to gain knowledge and experience in this important area. Minor in Educational Studies The minor in Educational Studies allows students to explore a broad range of issues in the field of education and provides a strong foundation for K-12 teaching. Both introductory and advanced courses are included, giving students a solid preparation for later teacher credential programs and many related occupations. NOTE: A Statement of Intent is required of all students wishing to enroll in this minor. See the Department of Education section of the Catalogue for more information. Multiple Subject and Single Subject (Social Science) Preparation Course work in the Social Science major (Social Sciences for Sec\u00ad ondary School Education specialization) provides excellent prepa\u00ad ration for students wishing to obtain a multiple subject teaching credential. Students who take additional course work can satisfy the subject matter requirement for a single subject teaching creden\u00ad tial in social science. NOTE: Official enrollment in the single sub\u00ad ject program is required to satisfy this requirement. The Counsel\u00ad ing Office in 370D Social Science Tower can provide details. Department of Education Programs The Department of Education provides many other opportunities for prospective educators, including: a mentoring program which provides students with valuable experience while they work with credentialed teachers; UC Links, a program in which undergradu\u00ad ates tutor K-8 students in after-school settings; and advising ser\u00ad vices provided by counselors who assist students in planning future careers in education. Further information about these programs is available from the Department of Education counselors at 2001 Berkeley Place. Students interested in obtaining a teaching credential should see the Department of Education section of the Catalogue for information. SPECIAL PROGRAMS 3-2 Program with The Paul Merage School of Business Outstanding students who are interested in a career in management may wish to apply for entry into The Paul Merage School of Busi\u00ad ness' 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See The Paul Merage School of Business sec\u00ad tion for additional information. Campuswide Honors Program The Campuswide Honors Program is available to selected high\u00ad achieving students from all academic majors from their freshman Social Sciences 443 through senior years. For more information contact the Campus\u00ad wide Honors Program, 1200 Student Services II; telephone e-mail: Ed';'cation Abroad students have the opportunity to experience a dif\u00ad ferent culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with host universities and colleges throughout the world. Additional information is avail\u00ad able in the Center for International Education section. Interdisciplinary Minors A variety of interdisciplinary minors are available to all UCI stu\u00ad dents. The minor in Conflict Resolution, sponsored by the Interna\u00ad tional Studies program in the School of Social Sciences, provides skills in conflict analysis and resolution and a useful understanding of integrative institutions at the local, regional, and international levels. The curriculum includes training to become a certified media\u00ad tor in the State of California. Information about the following minors is available in the Interdis\u00ad ciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue. The minor in Chicano!Latino Studies is designed to provide an awareness, knowledge, and appreciation of the language, history, culture, literature, sociology, anthropology, politics, social ecology, health, medicine, and creative (art, dance, film, drama, music) accomplishments in the Chicano/ Latino communities. The minor in Global Sustainability trains students to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the human population to live in a sustainable relationship with the resources available on this planet. The minor in the History and Philosophy of Science explores how science is actuaJly done and how it has influenced history, and is concerned with determining what science and mathematics are, accounting for their apparent successes, and resolving problems of philosophical interest that arise in the sciences. The minor in Native American Studies focuses on history, culture, religion, and the environment. The three core courses serve as an introduction to the Native American experience from the perspective of different historical periods and frameworks of analysis. Information about the following interdisciplinary minors is avail\u00ad able in the School of Humanities section. The minor in African American Studies offers undergraduate students an opportunity to study those societies and cultures estab\u00ad lished by the people of the African dhispora and to investigate the African American experience from a variety of disciplinary per\u00ad spectives and theoretical approaches. The minor in Archaeology introduces students to modern archae\u00ad ological theory and practice, to different approaches and theoretical frameworks used in the reconstruction of cultures based on their material remains, and the use of such approaches and frameworks in a comparative context that emphasizes one geographic area. The minor in Asian American Studies examines the historical and contemporary experiences of Asians after their arrival in the United States and seeks to provide an awareness of the history, cul\u00ad ture (e.g., literary and creative art accomplishments), psychology, and social organization of Asian American communities. The minor in Asian Studies creates opportunities for students to explore Asian topics in a variety of fields, to develop advanced lan\u00ad guage skills, and to acquire broader perspectives. The minor in Latin American Studies is designed to develop in students an awareness, knowledge, and appreciation of Latin Ameri-\u00b7 can issues in the areas of language, history, culture, literary studies, UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 444 UCI 2006-07 School of Social Sciences sociology, anthropology, political science, health, folk medicine, and creative (art, dance, film, drama, music) accomplishments. The minor in Religious Studies focuses on the comparative study of religions in various cultural settings around the world and seeks to provide a wide-ranging academic understanding and knowledge of the religious experience in society. The minor in Women's Studies fosters critical and creative analysis of the various disciplinary perspectives-historical, political, eco\u00ad nomic, representational, technological, and scientific-that have (or have not) constituted women, gender, and sexuality as objects of study. Women's Studies also offers a minor in Queer Studies. CAREERS IN SOCIAL SCIENCES Business and industry often look to social science graduates to fill positions in management, finance, marketing and advertising, per\u00ad sonnel, production supervision, and general administration. In the public sector, a wide variety of opportunities are available in city, county, state, and federal government. Teaching is a frequently chosen career at all levels from elementary school teacher to pro\u00ad fessor. In addition, many graduates enter professional practice, becoming lawyers, psychologists, researchers, or consultants in various fields. Because all Social Sciences degrees involve an educational pro\u00ad gram that is interdisciplinary and that prepares students to under\u00ad stand quantitative methods of data analysis, graduates of the School are well-positioned for research and analysis careers at all levels of government and in private firms. Their solid grounding in contemporary social science methods and their familiarity with a broad spectrum of social scientific thinking gives them an excellent foundation for the pursuit of further training in graduate and pro\u00ad fessional programs. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. Additional information is available in the Career Center section. Graduate Program The School of Social Sciences offers graduate training in the fol\u00ad lowing areas: Anthropology (Ph.D. in Anthropology), Cognitive Sciences (Ph.D. in Psychology), Economics (Ph.D. in Economics), Logic and Philosophy of Science (Ph.D. in Philosophy), Mathe\u00ad matical Behavioral Sciences (Ph.D. in Social Science), Politics and Society (Ph.D. in Political Science), and Sociology (Ph.D. in Soci\u00ad ology). In addition, an interdisciplinary concentration in Public Choice is offered within the programs in Economics and Political Science, a specialized concentration in Transportation Economics is offered within the program in Economics, an emphasis in Social Networks is offered within the Mathematical Behavioral Sciences concentration, and a concentration in Political Psychology is offered within the program in Political Science. When an appli\u00ad cant's interests lie outside of or across these areas, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, School of Social Sciences, may, on rare occasions, appoint a three-member faculty committee to guide an independent course of study for the Ph.D. degree in Social Science. The M.A. degree in Anthropology, Economics, Philosophy, Politi\u00ad cal Science, Social Science, or Sociology may be conferred upon students in Ph.D. programs after completion of the necessary requirements. Additionally, the M.A. degree program in Social Science with a concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis is supervised by faculty from the Schools of Social Sciences and Social Ecology. Students may apply directly to this M.A. program. The M.S. and Ph.D. degree program in Transportation Science is supervised by an interdepartmental faculty group. Information is available in the Interdisciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue. In cooperation with the UCI Department of Education, students enrolled in a. School of Social Sciences graduate program may choose to pursue a teaching credential while working toward their degree. After completion of requirements for an M.A. degree, stu\u00ad dents may apply for admission into the credential program admin\u00ad istered by the Department of Education. As required by law, the applicant must pass the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST), obtain a Certification of Clearance, and successfully complete the appropriate subject area examination or an approved subject-matter program. A detailed description of the program may be obtained from the Social Sciences Graduate Office or the Department of Education. ADMISSION Potential graduate students should apply by January 15 to receive fullest consideration for financial aid. Applicants should indicate the title of the degree sought (Anthropology, Economics, Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science), and the academic area of concentration (see above). All applicants are required to submit Graduate Record Examination General Test scores. Letters of rec\u00ad ommendation and the applicant's statement of interest are impor\u00ad tant factors in the admission decision. In addition to the University admission requirements described in the Office of Graduate Studies section, individual graduate pro\u00ad grams may prescribe special requirements or expectations of appli\u00ad cants, subject to the approval of the Graduate Council. Such requirements are minimum standards only; successful applicants typically must exceed them by a substantial margin. FINANCIAL SUPPORT Many students receive financial support in the form of fellowships, teaching assistantships, or research assistantships available under grants to individual faculty. Before accepting an offer of admission with financial support for the first year, applicants should inquire about the likelihood of such support in future years. Occasionally, a newly admitted student may receive a multiyear commitment of some specified financial support, but this is not the rule. Students are also advised to seek aid from sources external to the University. (NOTE: Teaching assistantships do not include remission of fees or nonresident tuition.) LENGTH OF STUDY AND RESIDENCE The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. degree is either five, six, or seven years, depending upon the specific program. See the department sections for information. Students admitted to the M.A. concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis should be able to earn the M.A. within one\u00b7 to two years. Because the intellectual training offered by the School requires full-time study and constant contact with the faculty, the School does not accept part-time students. COMMUNITY OUTREACH The Ambassador's Council has been created to promote and enrich the School by supporting new and existing schoolwide/ department projects. It collectively acts as an official student in discussing program development with administrators and depart\u00ad ment chairs and other faculty. The Citizen PeacebuHding Program at UCI is a distinctive inter\u00ad national clearinghouse for research, education, and action on pub\u00ad lic peace processes. The Program focuses on how citizens partici\u00ad pate in these activities to prevent violent conflict and, if violence UC IRVINE - 2006-2007occurs, to promote reconciliation and sustainable peace. The pur\u00ad pose is to significantly contribute to the theory and practice of con\u00ad flict resolution. Through the Global Connect program, the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences is hoping to connect its academic and human capital with selected underrepresented schools within Orange County. Through in-class lectures and interactive lessons, students are introduced to the concepts and realities of global markets, post-cold war political identities, borderless social issues (literacy, hunger, AIDS), interna\u00ad tional organizations (the World Bank, the United Nations) and the multidimensional themes of globalization. HABLA is a broad-spectrum Latino-focused educational outreach program based in the School of Social Sciences and created by Professor Virginia Mann in June 2000 with the support of the Orange County Children and Families Commission. Its purpose is to increase the school readiness of disadvantaged children ages two-four years, by uniting faculty and students at UCI with the Santa Ana Unified School System, local Families Resource Center, Americorp/VISTA, FACT, and the national Parent Child Home Program (PCHP). Jumpstart was established on the UCI campus by School of Social Sciences Professor Virginia Mann in 2003. Students involved as Jumpstart members are paired with children participat\u00ad ing in pre-school programs in the local Orange County area. The purpose is to help young students develop language, literacy, and social skills. \u00b7social Sciences undergraduates usually serve with Jumpstart for a full school year. The UCI Jumpstart program recruits, trains, and supervises UCI students to work with Head Start and other early-childhood programs in low-income communi\u00ad ties of Orange County. The School of Social Sciences' Summer Academic Enrichment Program (SAEP) is designed to enhance the academic experience of first-generation university, low-income students. SAEP's goal is to strengthen specific analytical and research skills and to prepare participants for graduate school. DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY 4229 Social Science Plaza B; (949) 824-7602 Bill Maurer, Department Chair Anthropology is the comparative study of past and present human societies and cultures. The Department of Anthropology at UCI is at the forefront of addressing issues in contemporary theory and ethnographic methods within the discipline. The Department has a strong interdisciplinary bent, with research and teaching interests in economic anthropology, political and legal anthropology, the anthropology of finance, social history and social change, the anthropology of science, technology and medicine, identity and ethnicity, gender and feminist studies, urban anthropology, moder\u00ad nity and development, religion, visual anthropology, and the arts and expressive culture. The Department also has a strong emphasis on the study of contemporary issues, especially those concerned with emergent, fluid, and complex global phenomena such as inter\u00ad national flows of goods, peoples, images, and ideas; the relation\u00ad ship between global processes and local practices; immigration, citizenship, and refugees; population politics; violence and politi\u00ad cal conflict; ethnicity and nationalism; gender and family; food, and innovation; law; development and eco\u00ad nomic transformation; urban studies; and environmental issues. Geographic regions of expertise include China, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Oceania, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, East Africa, Latino communities of the United States, and diasporic and transnational communities in the United States and abroad. Anthropology 445 . Undergraduate Program REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: See page 442. Departmental Requirements for the Major School requirements must be met and must include 12 courses (48 units) as specified below: A. Anthropology 2A. B. Anthropology 2B, 2C, or 2D. C. Anthropology 30A or 30B. D. Three topical courses (12 units) from Anthropology 120-159, 170-179). E. Two courses (eight units) on a geographical area, from Anthro\u00ad pology 160-169. F. Four additional elective courses (16 units) from Anthropology 30A, 30B, 40-179, 180A. Students are strongly encouraged to take Anthropology 180A after they have had at least three courses beyond Anthropology 2A and 2B, 2C, or 2D. Students are also strongly encouraged to take both Anthropology 30A and 30B. The faculty encourages Anthropology majors or minors to study abroad and experience a different culture while making progress toward degree objectives. The Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program (EAP) and the Inter\u00ad national Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of many worldwide opportunities. For example, EAP offers excellent opportunities to study anthropology at many univer\u00ad sities abroad; courses taken abroad can be used to fulfill departmen\u00ad tal requirement C, D, and E. Study abroad also can provide opportu\u00ad nities for cross-cultural experience, field research, and foreign language training. The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Pro\u00ad gram (UROP) provides funding for independent field research. See the Center for International Education and the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program sections of the Catalogue for addi\u00ad tional information. Honors Program in Anthropology The Honors Program in Anthropology is designed to allow under\u00ad graduates to pursue field research and write an honors thesis on topics of their choice under the guidance of Department of Anthro\u00ad pology faculty members. Research projects typically involve a combination of library research, exploratory ethnographic inter\u00ad views, participant observation, and systematic data collection and analysis. The program is open to all senior Anthropology majors with a grade point average of 3.3 or better overall, with 3.5 in Anthropology courses (at least five courses). Successful complec tion of the Honors Program and the honors thesis satisfies the upper-division writing requirement. Students must apply to be admitted into the Honors Program. The application form is avail\u00ad able on the Departmental Web site (http://www.anthro.uci.edu); in the Department office (SSPB 4229); and in the School of Social Sciences Counseling Office (SST 370D). Although course work for the HonOFs Program does not start until the senior year, it is highly recommended that during the spring quarter of the junior year, students find a professor willing to serve as their research project advisor on the basis of a mutually accept\u00ad able abstract that indicates the goal and significance of their pro\u00ad ject. If extensive research is to be undertaken at this time, students enroll in Anthropology 199. During the fall quarter of the senior year, students enroll in Anthropology H190A and write a proposal describing their UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 446 UCI 2006-07 School of Social Sciences research question, the relevant background literature, and the method of data collection and analysis. Field work for the project may begin during this quarter. In the winter quarter of the senior year, students begin or continue ethnographic field research by enrolling in Anthropology H190B. Field research typically combines exploratory field research with fixed format data collection methods. In the spring of the senior year, students enroll in Anthropology H191 and complete a senior honor thesis that is typically 40 to 80 pages long. Honor theses are read and evaluated by the advisor and the Undergraduate Program Director.

Cognitive Sciences 451 DEPARTMENT OF COGNITIVE SCIENCES 3221 Social Science Plaza B; (949) 824-3771 Michael D'Zmura, Department Chair The Department of Cognitive Sciences is committed to the investi\u00ad gation of the abstract, complex structures that underlie human cog\u00ad nition: language, thought, memory, learning, sensorimotor integra\u00ad tion and perception. The main areas of research strength within the Department are visual and auditory perception, experimental psy\u00ad chology, cognitive psychology, mathematical psychology, and cog\u00ad nitive neuroscience. Undergraduate Program Students should be aware that psychology courses are offered in several different departments and programs. Students interested in general psychology including the areas of development, clinical, perception, learning, memory, cognitive processes, and neuro\u00ad science are advised to consult the course listings here in the Department of Cognitive Sciences section. These courses are designed to provide students with a strong foundation in general psychology. Students interested in other areas of psychology are advised to consult the course listings in the School of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy and the School of Biological Sciences sections. In anticipation that the number of students who are qualified to elect Psychology as a major will exceed the number of positions available, students applying for admission for fall 2007 should be sure to file their application before November 30, 2006. Change of Major: Information about change-of-major require\u00ad ments, procedures, and policies is available in the School of Social Sciences Undergraduate Counseling Office and at http://www.due. uci.edu/Change_of_Major.html. Excellence in Psychological Research: Psychology majors doing independent research under Psychology 199 may be eligible for participation in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). Participants can obtain research funding and have the opportunity to have their research papers published in a peer\u00ad reviewed student journal or to present them at a special conference of UCI student research. Guidelines for the program are available from the Department of Cognitive Sciences office. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 59-64. School Requirements: See page 442. Departmental Requirements for the Major in Psychology School requirements must be met and must include 18 courses (70 units) as specified below: A. Psychology 9A-B-C. B. Two introductory courses (eight units) in the social sciences chosen from Anthropology 2A or 2B, Economics 1, Linguistics 3, Political Science 6A, 6B, or 6C, Sociology 1, or, by petition, one or two quarters of Social Science HIE, HIF, or HIG, when topic is not psychology. C. A one-quarter course and laboratory in experimental psychol\u00ad ogy or research methods selected from Psychology l12A and 112LA, 112G 112LF were previously numbered liSA and llSLA.). NOTE: These courses have as prerequisites Psychology 9A-B-C and one year of mathematics/statistics (see course listings). These prerequisites are strictly enforced. Psychology 112A, 112LA are the first quarter of a multi-quarter sequence that UC IRVINE - 2006-2007452 UCI 2006-07 School of Social Sciences satisfies the upper-division writing requirement and allows stu\u00ad dents to plan and conduct research projects. Students taking these courses should plan to continue in them through at least the second quarter. Students who intend to fulfill the upper-divi\u00ad sion writing requirement in some other way should consider tak\u00ad ing Psychology 112M, 112LM, or 112P, 112LP to fulfill the lab\u00ad oratory requirement. D. Four upper-division Psychology core courses are required (16 units). These courses are designated with the ending number \"0\" and courses (four or more units each) with empha\u00ad sis in psychology, distributed as follows: (1) No more than one of the seven may be lower-division. Psy\u00ad chology 7 A, liE, 46A, 56L, 76M may not be used to fulfill this requirement. (2) Three of the upper-division courses used to satisfy require\u00ad ments D and E must be taken from one of the following modules: Psychology 110-119 (Research Methodologies), 120-129 (General Psychology), 130-139 (Perception and Sensory Processes), 140-149 and 150-159 (Learning and Cognition and Semiotics and Language combined), 160-169 (Cognitive Neuroscience), and 170-179 (Interdisciplinary Studies). (3) Certain courses offered in the School of Biological Sciences and the School of Social Ecology may be used in partial sat\u00ad isfaction of this requirement. A total of three of these courses (12 units) may be used in this way with a maximum of two from either of these Schools. The courses that may be used in this way are those in the Department of Cognitive Sciences' course listings numbered Psychology 127, 147, and 177, as well as Psychology and Social Behavior P109 (same as E108U), P121D, P134H, NllO, N159. ( 4) No more than two of the courses (each of four or more units) may be numbered 190-199. NOTE: Psychology majors are strongly encouraged to take Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences lA-B and 35 in satisfaction of the natural sciences portion of the breadth requirement (Category II). Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that students who intend to pursue postbac\u00ad calaureate work in psychology take the Psychology 112A-B-C sequence. Most psychology graduate programs require statistics (which, at UCI, may be satisfied by taking Psychology lOA-B-C, Social Science lOA-B-C, or Social Science lOOA-B-C), but some require calculus (which, at UCI, may be satisfied by taking Mathe\u00ad matics 2A-B). Honors Program in Psychology The two-year honors program in Psychology is open to selected juniors who are majoring in Psychology. It provides thorough grounding in research methods and culminates with the opportunity for basic research in some area of psychology under faculty super\u00ad vision. The program has a limited number of openings and seeks to attract outstanding students who plan to undertake postgraduate education in some field of the psychological sciences. Admission to the program is based on a formal application that is normally sub\u00ad mitted in the spring quarter of the sophomore year. Applicants should have an overall grade point average of at least 3.2 and a grade point average of at least 3.5 in psychology courses, although this requirement may be waived in unusual cases. During the junior year, students who participate in the program are expected to enroll in Honors Experimental Psychology (H111A-B\u00ad C), and in the fall quarter of the Honors Seminar in Psychology (HlOlA). As seniors, following successful completion of these junior-year requirements, Psychology honors students are enrolled in the Honors Seminar in Psychology (HlOIB-C) in the fall and spring quarters. Participants in the honors program are expected to complete course work beyond the breadth requirement in one or more of the following areas: biological sciences, mathematics, computer science, physical science, linguistics, philosophy. The honors seminar may be used to satisfy two of the courses required by Part E of the Psychology majorrequirements. To graduate with Honors in Psychology, a student must successfully complete the requirements for the B.A. degree in Psychology with an overall grade point average of 3.2 and a grade point average of at least 3.5 in Psychology courses. In addition, Honors students must success\u00ad fully complete a senior honors thesis as part of the senior-year course work.

DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS 3223 Social Science Plaza B; (949) 824-5788 David Brownstone, Department Chair Economics is concerned with the way individuals or societies allo\u00ad cate scarce resources and distribute goods and services. Any situa\u00ad tion requiring choice among competing alternatives can be viewed as an economic problem. Economic courses enable students to study the way individuals make these choices (microeconomics), the way governments make these choices (public choice), and the aggregate consequences of these choices (macroeconomics). In addition, the Economics curriculum addresses international trade, money and banking, and economic development of the less devel\u00ad oped nations. The Department of Economics is composed of faculty with inter\u00ad ests in a broad range of areas within micro-and macroeconomics, and the evaluation of public policy. It is especially strong in empir\u00ad ical microeconomics including transportation, energy, industrial organization, labor, and urban development; in political economy and public choice; in economic history; and in econometrics. Members of the Department maintain close ties with members of the Department of Political Science and The Paul Merage School of Business. Members of the Department maintain affiliations with the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, the Institute of Transportation Studies, the Institute of Global Conflict and Coop\u00ad eration, the Center for the Study of Democracy, and the program in International Studies. Undergraduate Program The Department offers majors in Economics, Business Economics, and Quantitative Economics, and an optional specializationin International Issues and Economics available to students in all three majors. In additional, an Honors Program in Economics is open to high-achieving students in all three majors. NOTE: Students may complete only one of the three Economics majors. ADMISSION TO THE MAJORS Freshmen: Preference will be given to those who rank the highest using the selection criteria as stated in the Undergraduate Admis\u00ad sions section of this Catalogue. Transfer-Student Applicants: Transfer applicants with the highest grades overall who satisfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission. All applicants must complete one course in microeconomics, one course in macroeconomics, and one semester or two quarters of approved calculus. Change of Major.

Drawing upon the School's strong quantitative tradition, it specializes in public choice, transportation economics, urban eco\u00ad nomics, econometrics, and applied microeconomics. Admission is highly selective and is limited to students whose interests mesh closely with those of the faculty. By requiring a high degree of over\u00ad lap between faculty and student research interests, the program offers extensive faculty contact within a tutorial framework. Moti\u00ad vated and well-qualified students find the graduate program highly attractive because of its small size and its great flexibility. Self-dis\u00ad cipline and an inquiring mind are prerequisites. ADMISSION The deadline for application for admission is January 15 for fall quarter. Students are admitted for winter or spring quarters only under exceptional circumstances. Late applications are considered on a space-available basis. All applicants must take the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) prior to the application deadline. Applicants whose primary language is not English must also submit Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores. To be considered for any financial aid (including a teaching assistantship), students who are not citizens of countries where English is either the pri\u00ad mary or dominant language as approved by the UCI Graduate Council must submit a passing score from the Test of Spoken Eng\u00ad lish (TSE). REQUIREMENTS All students must show competence in the core areas of microeco\u00ad nomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics. This is done by tak\u00ad ing the three-quarter required course sequences in microeconomics and macroeconomics, and the four-quarter required course sequence in econometrics. A student can take the oral candidacy examination after completing the 10 required core courses with no grade lower than a Band with a grade point average across all graduate courses of at least 3.25. The student must also complete a research paper that consists of an extended literature review in a subfield approved by the graduate committee or a replication and extension of an empirical paper published in a refereed economics journal. A well-prepared student should take this oral examination at the end of the fourth or fifth quarter. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is two years (six quarters). Students also must master two fields of applied economics by tak\u00ad ing a two-course sequence (possibly including independent reading courses) and writing a research paper in each field. Students also must enroll for at least four quarters in the graduate colloquium, in which attendance at regular Economics faculty research colloquia is supplemented by discussion of the papers presented and addi\u00ad tional reading. Students are encouraged to become conversant with areas of current economic research early in their graduate careers, in order to facilitate a timely transition from meeting course and field requirements to thinking through a dissertation research plan. Two or three quarters before the expected completion of the disser\u00ad tation, the dissertation committee will organize an oral examination of the candidate's dissertation prospectus. Ordinarily, the prospec\u00ad tus will describe in detail the dissertation, and will typically be accompanied by at least one completed chapter of the dissertation. Students are expected to complete their dissertation by the end of their fifth year. The maximum time permitted for completion of the Ph.D. is six years. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Concentration in Transportation Economics Students can also pursue a Ph.D. in Economics with a concentra\u00ad tion in Transportation Economics. This option draws upon the transportation researchers on the campus within the School of Social Sciences, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, The Paul Merage School of Business, and the School of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. Students benefit from association with the Institute of Trans\u00ad portation Studies, which facilitates student research by providing research assistantships and interdisciplinary seminars on all modes of transportation. Requirements for the concentration are the same as those described above with the following three exceptions: (1) instead of the third quarter of microeconomics and macroeconomics, students may substitute specified courses such as Discrete Choice Econometrics (Economics 223A), Advanced Travel Demand Analysis (Engineer\u00ad ing CEE220A), or Operations Research for Management (Manage\u00ad ment 201B); (2) one of the student's two required fields of compe\u00ad tence must be transportation economics; the other must be a related field such as urban economics, labor economics, industrial organi\u00ad zation, or a transportation-related field from outside economics (such as travel demand and flow theory, urban and transportation policy analysis, environmental impacts of transportation, or urban and transportation planning) subject to the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies for Economics; and (3) students must take at least one additional course from a list of designated courses in transportation and related subject areas. Concentration in Public Choice Students can also pursue a Ph.D. degree in Economics with a con\u00ad centration in Public Choice. This is an interdisciplinary field, at the intersection of Economics and Political Science, which draws on quantitative tools to model the functioning of political institu\u00ad tions. Faculty from the Departments of Economics, Political Sci\u00ad ence, and Logic and Philosophy of Science and from The Paul Merage School of Business are involved in research that supports the concentration. Students who elect this concentration are admitted under the nor\u00ad mal procedures for the program in Economics and must fulfill all the requirements for the Eco!J.omics degree with the following modifications: (I) one of the student's two required fields of com\u00ad petence must be public choice; included is a three-quarter core course in public choice, Economics 270A-B-C, which is jointly organized by faculty in the Departments of Economics and Politi\u00ad cal Science. (A background in economic theory is a prerequisite to this sequence.) The requirement for competence in a second field may be met with a one-quarter course, instead of two, if it provides sufficient fluency in the field; and (2) students must obtain a back\u00ad ground knowledge in political science equivalent to that provided by a one-year undergraduate survey course, if they do not already have it. RESEARCH FACILITIES UCI is a major research university with an excellent library, as well as special interlibrary loan arrangements with other University of California libraries. The School of Social Sciences provides a computer laboratory. The Economics Department has a smaii library with current journals and unpublished working papers from other universities. Students also have access to advanced comput\u00ad ing resources as well as PC and UNIX laboratories. Three Orga\u00ad nized Research Units, the Institute of Transportation Studies, the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations, and the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, provide research opportunities for graduate students.

(Students are strongly encouraged to go beyond these minimal requirements with additional work in the language, literature, and culture courses taught in the language.) F. International Studies majors are also required to pursue some form of international experience for a minimum of one quarter. Majors are encouraged to study abroad through the Education Abroad Program (EAP) or the International Opportunities Pro\u00ad gram (lOP), which are available for periods of a quarter, semes\u00ad ter, year, or summer. When this is not possible, work overseas (through lOP) or a domestic internship with the UCDC Intern\u00ad ship Program, the Washington D.C. Center Program, or the Social Science Internship Program (Social Science 197) with an international focus may be substituted. HONORS PROGRAM IN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES The Honors Program allows International Studies majors to engage in research leading to the completion of an honors thesis. The topic for the honors thesis is selected by the student, in consultation with a faculty advisor, and should reflect a theme consistent with the student's module in the International Studies major. The Honors Program is open to all junior and senior International Studies majors with an overall GPA of 3.0 and a 3.5 GPA in the major who have taken all three core courses (International Studies 11, 12, and 13) and at least two upper-division courses that count toward the International Studies major. Successful completion of a written senior thesis in the International Studies 190 course satisfies the upper-division writing breadth requirement. During the spring quarter of the junior year or during the summer before the senior year, students formally apply to the Honors Pro\u00ad gram. Students will be notified of their selection to the Honors Program by September 1. In the fall quarter of the senior year, stu\u00ad dents enroll in International Studies H180, Honors Research Semi\u00ad nar. In this course, each student formulates a written research plan (i.e., prospectus) for the honors thesis. Students also select a fac\u00ad ulty member who agrees to supervise the research, evaluate the written work, and approve the honors thesis. In the winter quarter of the senior year, students enroll in International Studies H190, Senior Thesis, with their faculty advisor. The faculty advisor super\u00ad vises and evaluates data collection and analysis and reads and edits chapter drafts. In the spring quarter of the senior year, students enroll in a second quarter of Senior Thesis, with their faculty advi\u00ad sor. The thesis is to be completed by the student and approved by the advisor prior to the end of the quarter. Honors students must also demonstrate a high level of language proficiency by completing two courses beyond the 2A level in language, literature, or culture taught in their chosen international language. International Studies majors are also required to pursue some form of international experience, as explained in detail in major require\u00ad ment F.

Mann: Speech perception, psycholinguistics Robert May: Semantics, syntax, philosophy of language Robin Scarcella: Sociolinguistics, second-language semiotics Language is one of the most fundamental human instincts. It is an extraordinarily intricate system that all of us master as young chil\u00ad dren without special teaching, and that gives us the ability to com\u00ad municate, tell stories, and express our deepest feelings. Linguistics is the scientific study of this human language. It is concerned with understanding the nature of language and our knowledge of it, how we acquire it, and how that knowledge is put to use. It is connected to many other fields of study, including psychology, anthropology, sociology, biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, philos\u00ad ophy, and literature. The Department offers an undergraduate minor and undergraduate courses. Linguistics Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Linguistics are met by taking seven linguistics courses (28 units) as specified below: A. Linguistics 3, 10, and 20. B. Four additional linguistics courses, three of which must be upper-division. Residence Requirement: At least three upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI.

DEPARTMENT OF LOGIC AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 721 Social Science Tower; (949) 824-1520 Jeffrey A. Barrett, Department Chair The Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science (LPS) brings together faculty and students interested in a wide range of topics loosely grouped in the following areas: general philosophy of sci\u00ad ence; philosophy of the particular sciences; logic, foundations and philosophy of mathematics; and philosophy of mathematics in application. LPS enjoys strong cooperative relations with UCI's Department of Philosophy; in particular, the two units jointly administer a single graduate program which offers the Ph.D. in Philosophy. LPS also has strong interconnections with several sci\u00ad ence departments, including Mathematics and Physics, as well as the School of Biological Sciences, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, the Departments of Cognitive Sciences and Economics, and the graduate concentration in Mathe\u00ad matical Behavioral Sciences. Graduate Program Faculty Aldo Antonelli: Logic, philosophy of mathematics, history of analytic philosophy Jeffrey A. Barrett: Philosophy of science, philosophy of physics, philosophy of quantum mechanics, epistemology William Demopolous: History of analytics, philosophy of logic and mathematics, philosophy of science Kent Johnson: Philosophy of language, philosophy of mind Penelope Maddy: Philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of logic, naturalism, history of analytic philosophy David Malament: Foundations of relativity theory, philosophy of physics Robert May: Semantics, syntax, philosophy of language Brian Skyrms: Philosophy of science, decision theory, game theory, philosophy of biology, epistemology, metaphysics Kyle Stanford: Philosophy of science, philosophy of biology, history of modern philosophy, metaphysics Kai F. Wehmeier: Logic, philosophy of mathematics, history of analytic philosophy Affiliated Faculty Francisco Ayala: Evolutionary biology, philosophy of science, philosophy of biology Patricia Churchland (UCSD): Philosophy of neuroscience and psychology Paul Churchland ( UCSD ): Philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence and cognitive neurobiology, epistemology, and perception Paul Eklof: Mathematical logic Matthew Foreman: Mathematical logic Steven Frank: Evolutionary biology Donald Hoffman: Human and machine vision Duncan Luce: Mathematical behavioral science D.A. Martin (UCLA): Logic, set theory, philosophy of mathematics James McGaugh: Neurobiology of learning and memory Yiannis Moschovakis (UCLA): Set theory, recursion theory Louis Narens: Measurement, logic, and metacognition Riley Newman: Experimental particle physics and gravitational physics Terence Parsons (UCLA): Philosophy oflanguage, metaphysics Donald Saari: Mathematical economics, mathematical behavioral science, celestial mechanics Jonas Schultz: Experimental particle physics Norman Weinberger: Neural bases of attention and learning Martin Zeman: Logic and combinatorics UC IRVINE - 2006-2007The Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science and the Department of Philosophy jointly administer a Ph.D. program in Philosophy with two independent tracks: the Philosophy track and the LPS track. Both tracks begin from a common core of require\u00ad ments in standard philosophical fields (e.g., history of philosophy, logic, ethics, metaphysics/epistemology) and branch off thereafter; both tracks offer the Ph.D. degree in Philosophy. Applicants are advised to apply to the unit whose faculty, areas of specialization, and curriculum correspond best with their interests. Students are expected to reside in the same unit as their primary advisor, but faculty in both units are available for all other academic purposes (course work, independent studies, committee membership, and more). See the Department of Philosophy in the School of Human\u00ad ities for a description of the Philosophy track. The M.A. degree in Philosophy may also be awarded to Ph.D. stu\u00ad dents who complete the necessary requirements. ADMISSIONS Applicants for the LPS track must have a bachelor's degree, but there is no formal requirement as to the field of that degree. The most natural undergraduate majors for LPS graduate students would be philosophy, mathematics, or the sciences, but those with other degrees who are interested in the LPS fields should feel free to apply. Complete applications must include GRE scores, transcripts, letters of recommendation, and a writing sample. The deadline for appli\u00ad cation is January 15. Several forms of incoming fellowship~ are available on a competi\u00ad tive basis; these include a stipend, student fees, and tuition (for out-of-state students). In subsequent years, some additional fellow\u00ad ship funding is available, but students in good standing are most often supported with teaching assistantships. REQUIREMENTS OF THE LPS TRACK All required courses must be completed with a grade of B or better. The History of Philosophy Requirement provides a broad per\u00ad spective. Graduate courses in three out of the following areas-Modern Rationalism, Modern Empiricism, Kant, and Twen\u00ad tieth Century-must be completed by the end of the seventh quar\u00ad ter in residence. The Logic Requirement acquaints students with the fundamentals of modern logic: elementary set theory, metalogic, and 205C must be completed by the end of the seventh quarter in residence. The Field Requirement provides exposure to a range of philo\u00ad sophical disciplines. One graduate course in moral philosophy and one graduate course in metaphysics/epistemology must be com\u00ad pleted by the end of the seventh quarter in residence. (These courses may not also be used to satisfy the History Requirement.) The Philosophy of Science Requirement provides exposure to.a range of philosophy of science, from general philosophy of science to the philosophies of particular sciences (e.g., physics, biology), to the philosophies of mathematics and logic. Three selected courses from LPS 240-247 must be completed by the end of the seventh quarter in residence. (These courses may be repeated as topics vary.) Courses used to satisfy the Philosophy of Science Requirement may also be used to satisfy the History or Field Requirements. The Tools of Research Requirement provides some flexibility for students with various levels of interest in pursuing the philosophy of a particular science. So, for example, a student most interested in historical issues in the philosophy of mathematics might benefit most from the study of German, while a student most interested in Logic and Philosophy of Science 473 the philosophy of quantum mechanics should take a series of grad\u00ad uate courses in physics. (Students wishing to specialize further in the philosophy of a particular science might wish to pursue more demanding options; see the Mathematics and Physics emphases, below.) To satisfy this requirement, a student must pass an exami\u00ad nation on an appropriate foreign language or receive a grade of B or better in three appropriate graduate courses in a discipline or disciplines outside philosophy by the end of the ninth quarter in residence. Though the discipline(s) here must be outside philoso\u00ad phy, they might be taught by Philosophy or LPS faculty. The two\u00ad hour language examination will be administered by an LPS faculty member and will require the \u00b7Student to translate (with the aid of a dictionary) a passage or passages from philosophical or scientific authors. The Portfolio Requirement ensures that students have acquired dissertation-level skills in the writing of philosophy: e.g., the abil\u00ad ity to isolate, understand and evaluate arguments in the philosophi\u00ad cal literature; the ability to assimilate secondary literature; the abil\u00ad ity to formulate and defend an original philosophical thesis. The portfolio is designed to display these skills. To satisfy this require\u00ad ment, a student must submit an extended writing sample, most often consisting of several individual papers, that demonstrates the skills necessary to write a Ph.D. dissertation. (A successful portfo\u00ad lio typically consists of several papers totaling around 80 pages. These may be revisions of term papers. Each paper should present and defend a definite thesis and should be accessible to faculty members unfamiliar with the literature in question. The papers in the portfolio need not be of publishable quality, but they must, collectively, demonstrate the specified skills.) Portfolios will be evaluated by the entire LPS faculty. (LPS track students may request that relevant Philosophy Department faculty also be present at the evaluation meeting.) Portfolios must be submitted by the end of the fourth week of the seventh quarter. The Candidacy Examination demonstrates that the student has a viable dissertation topic and an adequate grasp of related literature. To satisfy this requirement, a student must prepare and be examined on a reading list of canonical literature in the area of the disserta\u00ad tion and a brief (15-20 page) dissertation proposal. The reading list should in effect define the context of the proposed dissertation. The examination must be completed by the end of the tenth quarter in residence. The normal time for advancement to candidacy is 3.3 years. Dissertation Defense. Students must pass a final oral examination focussing on the content of the dissertation administered by the Dissertation Committee. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years, and the maximum time permitted is seven years. LPS TRACK EMPHASIS IN MATHEMATICS In addition to the LPS track described above, there is a more demanding option open to LPS students wishing to specialize in the foundations and/or philosophy of mathematics. Faculty in the UCI and UCLA Departments of Mathematics participate in the Mathematics emphasis. Students in the emphasis take courses and receive advising from these participating Mathematics professors, as well as from the faculty of LPS and the Philosophy Department. Mathematics emphasis students must satisfy the following require\u00ad ment in addition to the usual LPS track requirements: Mathematics Requirement. A student must receive a grade of B or better in six graduate courses in mathematics. (Some of these courses may also be used to satisfy the Tools of Research Require\u00ad ment.) In addition, the student's Candidacy and Dissertation Com\u00ad mittees must include an active member from the UCI or UCLA Departments of Mathematics. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007474 UCI 2006-07 School of Social Sciences LPS TRACK EMPHASIS IN PHYSICS In addition to the LPS track described above, there is a more demanding option open to LPS students wishing to specialize in the foundations and/or philosophy of physics. Physics emphasis students must satisfy the following requirement in addition to the usual LPS track requirements: Physics Requirement. A student must receive a grade of B or bet\u00ad ter in three sections of LPS 241 whose topics are Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics, Geometry and Spacetime, and Probability and Determinism, as well as in three additional graduate courses in Physics or Mathematics. (Students in the Physics Emphasis may also use these courses to satisfy the Tools of Research Require\u00ad ment, but not the Philosophy of Science Requirement.) SALZBURG EXCHANGE PROGRAM LPS and the Department of Philosophy jointly administer an Exchange Program with the University of Salzburg. The program has two parts. The Scholarly Exchange provides opportunities for faculty and graduate students in LPS and Philosophy to visit Salzburg and for faculty and graduate students from Salzburg to visit one or the other of the UCI units. The Program also sponsors joint conferences, held alternately in Irvine and in Salzburg; these are co-sponsored by Salzburg and the UCI Interdisciplinary Pro\u00ad gram in the History and Philosophy of Science. To be eligible for the Salzburg Exchange, a graduate student must have advanced to candidacy. The selected student spends one semester in Salzburg, usually teaching one course in the general area of the thesis topic. An upper-division course may be taught in English, but lower-division courses must be taught in German. (Some previous visitors have learned serviceable German by attending a Goethe institute during the preceding summer.) Typi\u00ad cally, a Salzburg visitor will receive a Salzburg Fellowship intended to cover travel expenses, and a stipend; those who teach while in Salzburg will also receive a salary intended to cover living expenses (including health and dental insurance). Applications from LPS graduate students (including a curriculum vita and syllabi for courses that might be taught) should be sent to the LPS Salzburg Exchange Director by November 1.

The Department has attained a reputation for producing the very best innovative and interdisciplinary scholar\u00ad ship. Faculty are engaged in the study of such key questions as the UC IRVINE - 2006-2007politics of advanced and democratizing societies, international cooperation and peace, the politics of racial and ethnic minority groups, and the origins of altruism and morality and their impact on world politics. Graduate students can pursue concentrations in public choice and political psychology and specializations in democracy studies, international relations, and race and minority politics. The Ph.D. program offers big payoffs to graduate students, in fact, because of the extended range of inquiry an interdisciplinary program affords. Political Science faculty members are regular participants in and help direct several research units on campus. The Center for the Study of Democracy, an Organized Research Unit at UCI, sponsors research and education aimed at improving the democratic process in the United States and expanding democracy around the world. The UCI Interdisciplinary Center for the Scientific Study of Ethics and Morality explores questions concerning the origins and causes of morality. The Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies (CGPACS), housed in the School of Social Sciences, is a multidis\u00ad ciplinary program dedicated to promoting scholarly, student, and public understanding of international conflict and cooperation. The Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, also located in the School of Social Sciences, offers opportunities for participation in ongoing faculty research, notably with faculty members engaged in fields of public choice and political economy. ADMISSIONS The deadline for application for fall quarter admission is January 15. Students are admitted for winter or spring quarters only under exceptional circumstances. Additional information is available in the general section on admission to Social Science graduate pro\u00ad grams. Please note especially the required examinations. REQUIREMENTS First-year students must take a core program of graduate seminars, focusing on major substantive areas as well as research methods. Students are required to complete one year of statistics, preferably before enrollment but no later than their first year. Competence in a foreign language is required. Students may substitute mastery of an advanced research skill in place of a foreign language. To acquire such a skill (which could involve course work in such dis\u00ad ciplines as economics, mathematics and computer science, or sta\u00ad tistics), students could take courses in econometrics, advanced multivariate regression, or computer science. Attendance in a col\u00ad loquium series also is required for all graduate students during their first two years in residence. Reviews and Examinations Students ordinarily are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.5 or better. At the completion of the first year, a review of per\u00ad formance in the graduate program will be conducted for each stu\u00ad dent by the Political Science faculty. A set of three papers, normally completed by the third year of study, tests the student's competence in a set of major domains for intel\u00ad lectual inquiry. These domains are determined by the student and the Political Science Graduate Director. Upon successful comple\u00ad tion of these papers and demonstration of competence in mathemat\u00ad ics and a foreign language or an advanced research skill, a candi\u00ad dacy committee is appointed to oversee the qualifying examination and the formal advancement to candidacy. Students are expected to advance to candidacy by the ninth quarter of graduate study. After the student advances to candidacy, the doctoral committee, usually composed of three members of the candidacy committee, reviews a dissertation prospectus and supervises work toward completion of the dissertation. Within six months of the oral quali\u00ad fying examination (the formal advancement to candidacy), students Political Science 477 are expected to meet with their doctoral committee, in order to dis\u00ad cuss with the members a dissertation prospectus. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is six years, and the maximum time permitted is seven years. Concentration in Public Choice Public Choice is an interdisciplinary field, at the intersection of political science and economics, which draws on sophisticated quantitative tools to model the functioning of political institutions. Public Choice examines such areas as theories of voter and party choice; the theory of constitutions; the theory of committees and elections; models of regulation; problems of public goods and externalities; rent-seeking models; and issues in social choice, social welfare, and demand revelation. This concentration is administered by an interdisciplinary commit\u00ad tee of faculty from the Departments of Political Science and Eco\u00ad nomics. Students who elect this concentration are admitted under the normal procedures for the program in Political Science and must fulfill all the requirements for the Political Science degree, with the following modifications: (1) Students must complete the three-quarter core sequence in Pub\u00ad lic Choice, which is taught jointly by Political Science and Eco\u00ad nomics faculty. This sequence is usually taken in the student's sec\u00ad ond or third year. (2) Students must complete three additional graduate-level, four\u00ad unit courses in related fields with the consent of their graduate advisor, chosen from a set of courses designated by the interdisci\u00ad plinary committee. The courses chosen are to be tailored to the individual interests and academic background of the student and usually will include at least two Economics courses (such as Econometrics, Game Theory, and Law and Economics) and one Political Science course (such as those on electoral systems, party systems, constitutions, courts). (3) Students are expected to write their dissertation on a topic related to Public Choice. Usually the dissertation advisor will be a Political Science member of the interdisciplinary committee. Concentration in Political Psychology The last two decades have seen an explosion of interest in the field of political psychology. UCI's graduate concentration is part of this development, but enjoys a rather distinctive place. The concentra\u00ad tion offers students a broader education than is typically available at other institutions. In this vein, the program aims to provide: (1) a strong background in both political science and psychology; (2) an emphasis on theoretical and conceptual issues as well as empiri\u00ad cal and methodological ones; and (3) a familiarity with research being done outside of the United States as well as within it. In this context, a number of research concerns central to the participating faculty are considered, including: social change and democratiza\u00ad tion, ideology, altruism, social and political identity, public policy, community building, mass media effects, voting behavior, and international integration. Believing in academic community, the concentration's sponsoring faculty offer a host of activities includ\u00ad ing colloquia, reading groups, and joint research opportunities to facilitate contact between students and faculty and among the stu\u00ad dents themselves. Requirements. The purpose of the concentration is to provide a course of study which supplements the Ph.D. degree in Political Science. Therefore, students are required to complete all degree requirements for the Ph.D. stipulated by the Department of Politi\u00ad cal Science. As part of or in addition to these requirements, students must take five courses: Introduction to Political Psychology I and II (Political Science 285A and 285B), and three graduate psychol\u00ad ogy courses which provide a strong background in psychology (selected from an approved group which includes courses such as Personality in Development, Society and Pathology, Personality UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 478 UCI 2006-07 School of Social Sciences Assessment, Proseminar in Cognitive Science, and Human Infor\u00ad mation Processing).

THE UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR IN SOCIAL SCIENCE The major in Social Science provides an interdisciplinary perspec\u00ad tive on the study of society, both at the individual and group leveL Using the knowledge and methods of all social scien~e disciplines, a student majoring in Social Science develops the skills to think clearly about social concepts and issues. Social Science majors have an opportunity to use their classroom knowledge in applied and individual learning experiences, such as internships, field stud\u00ad ies, or research with a faculty advisor. The core curriculum for the major exposes students to various social science methods and topics, teaching applied computer\u00ad based research and statistical analyses. Students select one of four specializations, which guides their upper-division course work. The specialization in Multicultural Studies examines the role of ethnic and cultural diversity in the economics, politics, and culture of California and the United States. The specialization in Public and Community Service provides students with internship experiences in community, public, and educational organizations. Students who choose the Research and Social Policy specialization gain a more in-depth understanding of social science research and methodol\u00ad ogy. The specialization in Social Sciences for Secondary School Education prepares students for teaching at the secondary school leveL This specialization includes a State-certified subject matter program in social sciences for teaching in California secondary schools.

The program is administered by an interdisciplinary group of faculty. Within the concentration, two optional emphases are available: Social Networks; and Games, Decisions, and Dynamical Systems. Specific requirements are detailed below; ADMISSION Admission to the concentration in Mathematical Behavioral Sci\u00ad ences requires evidence of appreciable mathematical skill and knowledge. As an absolute minimum, a candidate should have taken one full year of calculus, including calculus of several vari\u00ad ables, and one course in linear algebra, and should also provide evidence of additional mathematical depth. This depth can be man\u00ad ifested in a number of different ways including, but not restricted to, an undergraduate degree in mathematics or physical science, a high score on the mathematics portion of the GRE, or a strong undergraduate minor in mathematics. In addition, students should have some exposure to a behavioral science field. Especially useful is some experience with behavioral science modeling. Those students interested in either the emphasis in Social Net\u00ad works or the emphasis in Games, Decisions, and Dynamical Sys\u00ad tems should make this clear in their application. A student is free at any time after admission to move into or out of either emphasis, but will be subject to the requirements in effect at the time of origi\u00ad nal admission to the concentration in Mathematical Behavioral Sciences. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS Four major classes of requirements must be fulfilled. Since a num\u00ad ber of options are available, the student will, in consultation with an advisor, develop a plan of study. Quantitative/Mathematical. To be completed by the end of the third year: (1) one course each in analysis beyond calculus, abstract algebra beyond linear algebra, and logic; and (2) two quar\u00ad ters of mathematical statistics, with calculus as a prerequisite and covering the fundamentals of probability and random variables. Social Science 497 A list of courses eligible for satisfying the Quantitative/Mathemati\u00ad cal requirement is available online at http://www.imbs.uci.edu/ NEWphdprogram.html. Language/Computer. All students must be sufficiently familiar with various computer programs and languages to be able to conduct seri\u00ad ous research in their field of interest and must submit either pro\u00ad posed courses or some demonstration of competency as part of their plan of study. In addition, students must either (1) attain proficiency in reading social science technical publications in one foreign lan\u00ad guage with a substantial relevant technical literature or (2) demon\u00ad strate proficiency in computer programming considerably beyond that of the standard computer requirement. Because of the continu\u00ad ally changing nature of computer languages and software, the condi\u00ad tions for fulfilling this additional computer expertise requirement is left to the judgment of the faculty subcommittee on computers of the Ph.D. program. Substantive Minor. Students are expected to develop considerable expertise in some substantive field and in the application of models to it. This requires the completion of three courses at the upper\u00ad division or graduate level that do not necessarily entail extensive modeling, and three courses or seminars in which the primary thrust is mathematical modeling. Research Papers and Colloquia. At the end of the second year, a 10-20-page paper reporting original research or a penetrating analysis of some subtopic of Mathematical Behavioral Science (or either Social Networks, or Games, Decisions, and Dynamical Systems with a formal or mathematical component) is expected. An oral presentation will be given to faculty and graduate students. Two faculty members are assigned to read and evaluate the paper and talk. Students are required to take for credit four quarters of the Mathe\u00ad matical Behavioral Sciences Colloquium, Social Science 211A-B\u00ad C, during their first three years. Although not iJ. formal require\u00ad ment, students are expected to attend the Colloquium on a regular basis whenever in residence. Time to Degree. Students must advance to candidacy in their fourth year. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is six years. The maximum time permitted is seven years. Emphasis in Social Networks The requirements for the emphasis in Social Networks are the same as the general requirements noted above, with the following exceptions: Stude~ts may choose to complete the first part of the Quantita\u00ad tive/Mathematical requirement with one course each in discrete mathematics, graph theory, and logic. Social Networks students are required to attend about 75 percent of the Mathematical Behavioral Sciences Colloquia, including all that are designated as Social Networks colloquia, and also must attend occasional colloquia, usually of local faculty and graduate stu\u00ad dents, which are separate from the general Mathematical Behav\u00ad ioral Sciences Colloquia. Emphasis in Games, Decisions, and Dynamical Systems The requirements for the emphasis in Games, Decisions, and Dynamical Systems are the same as the general requirements noted above, with the following exceptions: Students must complete eight graduate courses emphasizing game theory, decision theory, or dynamical systems. Examples of such courses are: Economics 243A (Game Theory); Economics 270A\u00ad B-C (Seminar in Public Choice I, II, III); Social Science 241B (Network Theories of Social Structure); Anthropology 289A (Net\u00ad works and Social Evolution); Technology, and Genes); and Anthropology 289C (Dynamical Processes). These courses will count toward the Substantive Minor requirement.

OUTREACH Outreach efforts coordinated by this office are designed to meet the challenges of California's changing demographics and to contr~bute to the School of Medicine's goal of achieving a broad spectrum of diversity in the student population, and ultimately, in the medical profession. A goal of this office is to build a pipeline of potential candidates for medical school and recruit students from socio-eco\u00ad nomically disadvantaged groups who have a desire to serve in the medically underserved communities in California. To reach this goal, programs are developed and implemented for students in high school, community colleges, and four-year undergraduate institu\u00ad tions. Examples include a Postbaccalaureate Re-applicant Program, a Premedical Postbaccalaureate Enhancement Program, Premedical Conferences, Summer Outreach Programs, a PreEntry Program, and CampMed, which is targeted at high school students interested in a health sciences career. In addition, there is support for student\u00ad initiated projects and outreach efforts emanating from medical stu\u00ad dent organizations. Outreach staff conduct academic advising, develop liaisons with general campus student services and acade\u00ad mic departments, and facilitate workshops. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007514 UCI 2006-07 College of Health Sciences Medical Student Advisor System The School's formal advisor system includes basic science advi\u00ad sors, clinical science advisors, and career specialty advisors. Basic Science Advisors Leslie M. Thompson, Ph.D., Chair (949) 824-6756 There are 12 basic science advisors. Six advisors are assigned on an every other year rotational basis to each incoming class and fol\u00ad low that class through their basic science years. The basic science advisors meet on a monthly basis to review students' academic progress, and to initiate interventive programs for students in acad\u00ad emic difficulty and at academic risk. They also serve as a source of support and guidance for first-and second-year medical students. Clinical Science Advisors Lloyd Rucker, M.D., Chair Associate Dean Curricular Affairs (949) 824-4609 The Clinical Science Advisors (CSA) combine teacher, advisor, and mentor into a single individual. By starting in the teaching role, the CSAs develop mentoring relationships with students that carry over into their role as advisor. When fully involved, each CSA will work with groups of eight-ten students from the second-, third-, and fourth-year classes, roughly 27 students in total. Stu\u00ad dents and CSAs first meet during the second year when the CSA serves as the facilitator for the problem-based learning small groups of the Patient-Doctor course. Toward the end of the second year, CSAs begin to provide scheduling and career advice for their students. In the third year, the faculty meet with students in groups and individual sessions to provide further career advice, to monitor progress in the third year, and to advise students about fourth year schedules. In the fourth year, advisors monitor the students' sched\u00ad ule for progress and review any requested changes. Peer Review and Peer Counseling Program Michael Prislin, M.D., Chair Associate Dean Student Affairs (949) 824-5932 The School of Medicine has an informal peer review process, aimed at early detection and assistance for medical students who are experiencing difficulty such as professional conduct problems, suspected impairment, violation of the honor code, or violation of any University policy, regulation, or rule. The Peer Review Com\u00ad mittee is comprised of two representatives from each class, the stu\u00ad dent body co-presidents, and two advisory faculty members. The committee operates within guidelines set jointly by the School of Medicine administration and the student body. Cases involving serious professional misconduct are referred to the Dean's Office. The Peer Review Committee conducts hearings and may impose sanctions or provide assistance to the student. Medical Scholars Program Geraldine Codd Academic Skills Coordinator (949) 824-3415 The Medical Scholars Program (MSP), a student-driven effort, is an innovative, collegial study support program which was implemented in the fall of 1993. This program benefits all students in the School of Medicine and provides a special sense of community for first-year students. A great deal of the informal knowledge concerning medical school is communicated through the components of MSP. Small groups of first-year students are Jed by second-year co-leaders who develop clinically relevant case-based problems for discussion cov\u00ad ering material learned in first-year basic science courses. Fourth\u00ad year students serve as co-leaders for similar groups of second-year students. First-year discussion groups meet every other week, and groups for second-year students meet once per month. First-and second-year students also receive MSP study packets, which contain test questions and answers from the previous ye!lr, and are distributed prior to each examination. Another component of MSP is designed to meet the needs of stu\u00ad dents as they face the challenges and transitions of their third year. During their various clerkships, third-year students are assisted in four basic areas by fourth-year students: oral examinations, presen\u00ad tation of cases, written examinations, and clinical skills. These fourth-year students not only share their knowledge of the subjects, but also share information about appropriate study material, and what to emphasize in studying for their various test experiences. Both third-and fourth-year students benefit from participating in this program. Medical Scientist Training Program (M.D./Ph.D.) Alan Goldin, M.D., Ph.D., Chair (949) 824-5264 Exceptionally well-qualified students interested in careers in acad\u00ad emic medicine and with demonstrated research accomplishments may be considered for admission to the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). Students in this program pursue a combined cur\u00ad riculum for an M.D. degree from the School of Medicine and a Ph.D. degree from any of the graduate programs at UCI. The pro\u00ad gram requires a minimum of seven years for completion, and stu\u00ad dents holding either degree are not eligible for MSTP. Additional information is available from the MSTP Coordinator's Office, (949) 824-5264; e-mail: mstp@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www.mstp.uci.edu/. Applicants must submit a supplementary application (available from the School of Medicine Office of Admissions) to the Medical Scien\u00ad tist Training Program when they are submitting their secondary application information to the School of Medicine. Students accepted into the program have the option of pursuing graduate study in any of the graduate programs at UCI. Although a specific graduate department need not be chosen at the time of admission, students are expected to have selected a field for their graduate stud\u00ad ies. Financial support in the form of a fellowship, which includes a stipend as well as tuition and fees, is provided. Applicants not accepted into MSTP may be considered separately for admission to the School of Medicine. M.D./M.B.A. Degree Program Maria Chandler, M.D./M.B.A. Faculty Advisor (949) 824-7133 The M.D./M.B.A. program requires five or six years for comple\u00ad tion. It is aimed at individuals who are exceptional in ability and motivation and who seek a career as physicians with major respon\u00ad sibility for administration and management in health care organiza\u00ad tions and institutions. Students in this program pursue a combined curriculum for an M.D. degree from the School of Medicine and an M.B.A, degree from The Paul Merage School of Business. Students must be currently enrolled in the M.D. program in order to apply to the combined M.D./M.B.A. program. During their sec\u00ad ond or third year of medical school, interested students submit an application to The Paul Merage School of Business Admissions Committee, after review by the School of Medicine. Final accep\u00ad tance to the program is granted by The Paul Merage School of Business, and M.B.A. course work begins following completion of the student's third year of medical school. Students should be aware that enrollment in the M.D. program does not guarantee acceptance into the M.B.A. program. The MCAT, along with the completion of three years of medical school training in good standing and passage of USMLE Step 1, currently serve as a Waiver for the GMAT entrance examination usually required for application to the M.B.A. program.

The M.D. Curriculum The UCI medical curriculum continues to meet the changing needs of medical education within all four years of instruction. Indeed, the School of Medicine faculty views curriculum development as a continual process and feels that medical education and teaching innovations must be encouraged and supported. The curriculum is designed to encourage medical students to become participants in their education process, to be active rather than passive learners, to become lifelong learners, and to use cooperative and team-learning principles. UCI is dedicated to the nurturing of humanistic, caring physicians with top-notch clinical expertise and skills. The School strives for this through a curriculum that is not only anchored in the science of medicine but also provides meaningful experiences in the humanistic dimensions of medicine. In this context, the faculty endeavors to provide students with experiences in areas such as communications and empathy, ethics and professionalism; diversity awareness; and cultural sensitivity and medical humanities. The faculty also feels that the curriculum should strive to integrate basic and clinical sciences by bringing substantial clinical material into the early phases of medical education. The School has achieved vertical integration of the curriculum with the development of a series of \"Patient-Doctor\" cours~s. The Patient-Doctor courses are longitudinal multidisciplinary experi\u00ad ences broadly designed to prepare students for their future careers in medicine through the application of experiential and self\u00ad directed learning principles. First-and second-year students begin to prepare for their clerkships through clinical exposures featuring standardized patients and clinical tag-along experiences. These Medicine 515 courses also utilize small group learning sessions to reinforce core concepts of patient-physician interactions and introductory clinical reasoning skill development. During the Advanced Patient-Doctor course (years three and four) students explore many of the crucial issues first presented during the introductory Patient-Doctor course. During this segment greater emphasis is placed on advanced skill acquisition and more mature professional role development. To satisfy the requirement for the M.D. degree, each medical stu\u00ad dent must successfully complete the full curriculum. Students must also pass both Step 1 and Step 2 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and successfully pass a Clinical Practice Examination (CPX) prior to graduation. An ongoing academic monitoring program is coordinated by the Office of Student Affairs, which identifies students early who might be experiencing academic difficulty and provides them with resources to successfully complete their course work. Faculty advi\u00ad sors are assigned to students during their first and second years. Students have advisory sessions with M.D. faculty prior to the scheduling of their third-and fourth-year course work. A Learning Resources Program is available to provide tutorial assistance and study skills training. USMLE reviews are also provided. CURRICULAR POLICIES The curricular policies of the School of Medicine are the responsi\u00ad bility of the faculty committees on Curriculum and Educational Policy and on Promotions and Honors. A listing of these policies, as well as information regarding registration, rules and regulations, grading procedures, and requirements for academic advancement, are contained in the School of Medicine Handbook, which is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.ucihs.uci.edu/ medstudents/studentaffairs/.

Shank: Graduate Program Director; Biochemical mechanisms in toxic tissue injury with emphasis on chemical carcinogenesis; application of tools of molecular biology to study cytotoxicity The Department of Community and Environmental Medicine pro\u00ad vides graduate training in environmental toxicology and offers the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Environmental Toxicology. The program in Environmental Toxicology provides students with the knowledge and skills necessary and appropriate to teach and/or conduct basic and applied research programs in inhalation/pulmonary toxicology, environmental carcinogenesis, biochemical neurotoxicology, chem\u00ad ical pathology, phototoxicity, toxicology of natural products, and toxicokinetics. The program is expanding into several areas of pub\u00ad lic health research. Toxicology involves scientific study of the entry, distribution, bio\u00ad transformation, and mechanism of action of chemical agents harm\u00ad ful to the body. The program interprets environmental toxicology as the study of the effects and mechanisms of action of hazardous chemicals in food, air, water, and soil, in the home, workplace, and community, and considers experimentally and theoretically such diverse research problems as: (1) new scientific approaches to toxi\u00ad cological evaluation of environmental chemicals such as air and water pollutants, food additives, industrial wastes, and agricultural adjuvants; (2) mechanisms of action in chemical carcinogenesis and mutagenesis; (3) the molecular pathology of tissue injury in acute toxicity; and (4) scientific principles involved in extrapolat\u00ad ing from laboratory animal data to expected effects on human health in environmental exposures. Students entering the program have varied backgrounds, including chemistry, biology, and physiology. The curriculum is based on a foundation of basic and health sciences with applications of scien\u00ad tific principles to environmental problems. Formal course work is enriched by a strong commitment to student-professor interaction throughout the program. An important and integral part of the learning process is an early and intensive involvement of the stu\u00ad dent in ongoing original research projects in environmental toxicol\u00ad ogy, especially inhalation/pulmonary toxicology, chemical carcino\u00ad genesis, biochemical toxicology, chemical pathology, and neurotoxicology. In addition to meeting the general admission requirements set by the Office of Graduate Studies, applicants must be admitted by an Admissions Committee composed of faculty members from the Department of Community and Environmental Medicine. Candi\u00ad dates are selected on the basis of a balanced evaluation of the fol\u00ad lowing criteria: (I) prior scholastic performance, including a con\u00ad sideration of grade point average, course load, nature of courses taken, and college attended; (2) recommendations by professors and others; (3) scores on the Graduate Record Examination; the Subject Test in either Biology or Chemistry is strongly recom\u00ad mended; (4) an interview by the Admissions Committee, when fea\u00ad sible; and (5) experience in undergraduate research.

Zaragoza: Genetics of cardiomyopathies in humans and mice The Division of Human Genetics in the School of Medicine's Department of Pediatrics offers a Master of Science degree pro\u00ad gram in Genetic Counseling. Most graduates of the program join academic or hospital-based genetics teams providing clinical services, teaching, and research. Others work for local, state, or federal genetics programs, for commercial genetics laboratories, on genetic research studies, or in education. The graduate program is fully accredited by the American Board of Genetic Counseling. Division faculty and staff are engaged in teaching, research, and patient service. Clinical activities center on diagnostic evaluation, management, and genetic counseling for genetic disorders, birth defects, and developmentally disabling conditions. Faculty research interests include: gene mapping and linkage analysis using molecu\u00ad lar and quantitative methods; characterization and management of malformation and chromosomal syndromes; counseling cancers netic disorders; factors causing congenital malformations; cancer genetics and cytogenetics; psy\u00ad chosocial and cultural issues associated with genetic conditions, birth defects, prenatal diagnosis, and genetic tests; genetic screen\u00ad ing and genetic services delivery; and ethical and public policy issues in genetics. During the six to eight academic quarters of the program, students complete a sequence of core courses covering medical, quantita\u00ad tive, biochemical, molecular, theory; research methods; ethical issues; and community resources. All courses are taught by Division faculty specifically for students in UC IRVINE - 2006-2007I 526 UCI 2006-07 College of Health Sciences the program. Experiential professional training occurs concurrently with formal course work in a variety of clinics at the UCI Medical Center and satellite facilities, in the prenatal diagnosis program, in the cytogenetics and molecular genetics laboratories, and in vari\u00ad ous community agencies. Students participate in these and other divisional and departmental professional and educational activities such as lectures, seminars, journal club, Pediatrics and Obstetrics and Oncology Grand Rounds, cytogenetics conferences, and vari\u00ad ous research, counseling, and patient management conferences throughout the program. While not required, some students choose to arrange optional clinical rotations at other academic, private, or commercial genetics units. Degree requirements include a minimum of 75 quarter units, com\u00ad pletion of a research thesis that should be publishable, and demon\u00ad stration of appropriate professional skills in genetic counseling. The program director serves as faculty advisor to students. Teach\u00ad ing and supervision of professional experiential training are shared by all Division faculty and staff, who frequently review student progress. In the second year, development of professional skills can be individualized according to the trainee's needs and interests. Successful completion of the program fulfills the curricular and clinical training requirements for eligibility to sit for examination by the American Board of Genetic Counseling. Recommended undergraduate preparation includes course work in the biological and behavioral sciences-particularly in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, psychology, and human develop\u00ad ment. Course work in statistics is desirable. Fluency in Spanish or a Southeast Asian language confers a considerable advantage. Extracurricular or employment experiences that provide evidence of the student's maturity, interpersonal skills, and promise as a genetic counselor figure prominently in the admissions decision. References should speak to these qualities as well as to the acade\u00ad mic qualifications of the applicant. The GRE General Test and Writing Assessment are required. Subject Test scores in any area will also be considered if they are available. Since there is no GRE code for the Department of Pediatrics, applicants should use the UCI institution code: R4859. Applications are accepted for the fall quarter only and must be complete by February 1. Because of keen competition for places in the program, a two-stage admissions process is employed. Follow\u00ad ing initial review of applications by the faculty admissions com\u00ad mittee, approximately one-fifth of applicants are invited for inter\u00ad views, which are usually conducted during March and April. If invited, it is greatly to the candidate's advantage to have an on-site interview, although in difficult circumstances it may be possible to arrange an out-of-town interview with a program graduate or a traveling faculty member. Any candidate planning to be in the Southern California area in March or April is encouraged to inquire in advance regarding the likelihood of an interview. Final selection from the interviewed candidates occurs in late April or early May. Five or six students are usually admitted each year.

Regan, Departments of Computer Science and of Civil and Environmental Engineering UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Principles of Community UCI is a multicultural community of people from diverse backgrounds. Our activities, programs, classes, workshops, lectures, and everyday interactions are enriched by our acceptance of one another, and we strive to learn from each other in an atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect. Our legacy for an increasingly multicultural academic community and for a learning climate free from expressions of bigotry is drawn from the United States and California Constitutions, and from the charter of the University of California which protects diversity and reaffirms our commitment to the pro\u00ad tection of lawful free speech. Affirmation of that freedom is an effective way of ensuring that acts of bigotry and abusive behavior will not go unchal\u00ad lenged within the University. Tolerance, civility, and mutual respect for diver\u00ad sity of background, gender, ethnicity, race, and religion are as crucial within our campus community as are tolerance, civility, and mutual respect for diversity of political beliefs, sexual orientation, and physical abilities. Educa\u00ad tion and clear, rational, and vigorous challenges are positive responses to prejudice and acts of bigotry. The University's nondiscrimination policy, in compliance with applicable federal and state law, covers treatment in University programs and activities as well as admission and employment. UCI expects all those affiliated with it to adhere to the letter and the spirit of University nondiscrimination policies and related federal and state laws. Information concerning these policies is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.ucop.edu/. Allegations of physical abuse, threats of violence, or conduct that threatens the health or safety of any person on University property or in connection with official University functions will be investigated promptly and, where found to exist, appropriate actions will be taken in accordance with Univer\u00ad sity policy. All who work, live, study, and teach at UCI are here by choice and, as part of that choice, should be committed to these Principles of Community which are an integral part of the guidelines by which the University community can successfully conduct its affairs. Student Conduct and Discipline Students enrolling in the University are expected to assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the University's function as an educational institution. A handbook is available which sets forth standards of conduct expected of UCI students. University of California Policies Apply\u00ad ing to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students lists rules concerning conduct and related matters, as established by the policies of the Regents and the President of the University and also incorporates campus regulations. Copies are available from the Dean of Students, located in the UCI Student Center; the University Ombudsman, located in 437 Administration Building; and on the World Wide Web at http://www.dos.uci.edu/judicial/uci_policy.htrni. Academic Honesty The UCJ Academic Senate Policies on Academic Honesty were approved by the Irvine Division on June 2, 1988. Revised December 12, 1996; October 12, 2000; November 21, 2002; and January 26, 2006. A. PREAMBLE The University is an institution of learning, research, and scholarship predi\u00ad cated on the existence of an environment of honesty and integrity. As mem\u00ad bers of the academic community, faculty, students, and administrative offi\u00ad cials share responsibility for maintaining this environment. It is essential that all members of the academic community subscribe to the ideal of academic honesty and integrity and accept individual responsibility for their work. Academic dishonesty is unacceptable and will not be tolerated at the Univer\u00ad sity of California, Irvine. Cheating, forgery, dishonest conduct, plagiarism, and collusion in dishonest activities erode the University's educational, research, and social roles. They devalue the learning experience and its legiti\u00ad macy not only for the perpetrators but for the entire community. B. RESPONSIBILITIES All members of the academic community have a responsibility to ensure that scholastic honesty is maintained. Faculty have primary responsibility for: 1. Upholding and enforcing universitywide principles of academic honesty and integrity and explaining clearly these principles including any qualifications which may be operative in the classes they are teaching. Appendix 535 2. Minimizing opportunities for academic misconduct in their courses. 3. Confronting students suspected of academic dishonesty in a way that respects student privacy. 4. Affording students accused of academic misconduct the right to appeal any resulting disputes to disinterested parties for hearing and resolution. 5. Assigning an appropriate grade to a student who engages in academic dishonesty. 6. Reporting all instances of academic dishonesty to appropriate Associate Deans. 7. Protecting the anonymity of any student reporting an incident of academic dishonesty to the extent permitted by due process required for the accused and other legal requirements. Students have responsibility for: 1. Refraining from cheating and plagiarism. 2. Refusing to aid or abet any form of academic dishonesty. 3. Notifying professors and/or appropriate administrative officials about observed incidents of academic misconduct. The anonymity of a student reporting an incident of academic dishonesty will be protected. C. WHAT IS ACADEMIC DISHONESTY? Academic dishonesty applies equally to electronic media and print, and involves text, images, and ideas. It includes but is not limited to the following examples: Cheating I. Copying from others during an examination. 2. Communicating exam answers with other students during an examination. 3. Offering another person's work as one's own. 4. Taking an examination for another student or having someone take an examination for oneself. 5. Sharing answers for a take-home examination or assignment unless specifically authorized by the instructor. 6. Tampering with an examination after it has been corrected, then returning it for more credit. 7. Using unauthorized materials, prepared answers, written notes or information concealed in a blue book or elsewhere during an examination. 8. Allowing others to do the research and writing of an assigned paper (including use of the services of a commercial term-paper company). Dishonest Conduct 1. Stealing or attempting to steal an examination or answer key from the instructor. 2. Changing or attempting to change academic records without proper sanction. 3. Submitting substantial portions of the same work for credit in more than one course without consulting all instructors involved. 4. Forging add/drop/change cards and other enrollment documents, or altering such documents after signatures have been obtained. 5. Intentionally disrupting the educational process in any manner. 6. Allowing another student to copy off of one's own work during a test. Plagiarism Plagiarism is intellectual theft. It means use of the intellectual creations of another without proper attribution. Plagiarism may take two main forms, which are clearly related: 1. To steal or pass off as one's own the ideas or words, images, or other creative works of another. 2. To use a creative production without crediting the source, even if only minimal information is available to identify it for citation. Credit must be given for every direct quotation, for paraphrasing or summa\u00ad rizing a work (in whole, or in part, in one's own words), and for information which is not common knowledge. Collusion Any student who knowingly or intentionally helps another student perform any of the above acts of cheating or plagiarism is subject to discipline for academic dishonesty. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007536 UCI 2006-07 Appendix D. PROCEDURES FOR DEALING WITH INCIDENTS OF ACADEMIC DISHONESTY Many, perhaps most, incidents of academic dishonesty involve accusations which are based on clear evidence and which are not contested by the accused student. In such cases, if the infraction is relatively minor and there is no indication that the accused student has previously been involved in such incidents, it is most appropriate that the matter be resolved between the stu\u00ad dent and the faculty member. When this occurs, it is nevertheless important that a written report of the incident be filed to ensure that penalties assessed are commensurate with the offense and that repeated infractions be detected and dealt with appropriately. More serious incidents and repeat offenses which call for stronger discipli\u00ad nary action, may result in campuswide sanctions, in addition to the actions imposed by a faculty member. In such cases, these sanctions, as described in Section I 05.00 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, will be administered by the Academic Associate Deans or the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Graduate Studies. Finally, whenever an accusation of academic dishonesty or a grade given by a faculty member is contested by an accused student, the student has recourse for mediation of the dispute. Processes for mediation, resolution, and/or an investigation may be requested by the student or the Associate (Undergradu\u00ad ate or Graduate) Dean Of the faculty member's school through the Office of the Ombudsman. In incidents where a campuswide sanction has been imposed, the student can request a hearing with the appropriate Committee on Academic Honesty which will be convened by the Office of either the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies, depend\u00ad ing on the status of the accused student. The procedures outlined here are designed to institute a system that recog\u00ad nizes that many cases of academic misconduct are best resolved between the student and faculty member involved, while it provides for appropriate record keeping and handling of serious and repeated offenses and guarantees a fair hearing to a student who has received a campuswide sanction. Authority of Faculty Members When a faculty member has evidence of student academic dishonesty, the faculty member must present the evidence to the student in a private meeting or communicate with the student by some other means. The faculty member must initiate this communication with the student within 15 calendar days of discovering evidence of academic dishonesty and evaluating the relevant work. The faculty member then may follow up with one or more of only the following actions: I. To issue a reprimand to the student with letter of explanation to the student's file. 2. To require repetition of the questionable work or examination with letter of explanation to the student's file. 3. To reduce the grade to an 'F' or zero, if appropriate, on the questionable work or examination with written notification to the student and a letter of explanation to the student's file. 4. To assign the student a failing grade in the course or otherwise lower the grade in the course with a letter of explanation to the student's file. It is essential that any such action be reported in writing to the student in a letter from the faculty member. Copies of this letter must also be sent to (a) the Associate Dean of the faculty member's school, (b) the Associate Dean of the student's school, who will maintain a file of cases of academic misconduct involving students enrolled in that school, and (c) the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Dean of Graduate Studies, as appro\u00ad priate. The faculty member is strongly encouraged to consult with the Asso\u00ad ciate (Undergraduate or Graduate) Dean of his or her school before the letter is drafted. Reference to (or a copy of) the UCI Academic Senate Policies on Academic Honesty should be included in the letter. If action ( 4) is taken, the faculty member is responsible for making certain that the failure is recorded by the Registrar on the student's permanent academic record. Careful docu\u00ad mentation of the incident must be maintained by the faculty member in the event that his or her actions in the case should later be subject to review. Responsibilities of the Academic Associate Deans I. The Associate (Graduate or Undergraduate) Dean of either the accused student's school or of the faculty member's school may impose campus\u00ad wide sanctions. Sanctions imposed by Associate Deans are final unless the student requests a hearing within 15 calendar days of notification. The 15-day period starts from the time the Associate Dean has notified the student of the discipline or has notified the student of the hearing and appeal process by providing a copy of this policy, whichever comes later. It is recommended that each case be brought to a final resolution within 90 days of instruction. 2. The Associate Dean (or equivalent official) of each school is responsible for maintaining confidential records concerning academic dishonesty of students enrolled in that school. All letters reporting faculty-imposed academic penalties for academic misconduct will be included in these files. 3. The Associate Dean of the accused student's school will be responsible for identifying all incidents which represent repeated offenses by a student and may impose a campus wide sanction because of repeat offenses. 4. Associate Deans are required to notify the student of the hearing and appeal process and provide the student a copy of this policy or explicitly refer the student to it. If an Associate Dean suspects grounds for a grievance involving discrimination, the student should be referred to Part 3 of The Manual of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, \"Student Academic Grievance Procedures\" (which is limited to allegations of discrimination). 5. In those classes where academic dishonesty continues to be a problem and the faculty member or another university official has already been approached by the student(s) from the class, the Associate Dean will consult with the appropriate faculty member to address the problem. 6. Students who have on file recorded acts of academic dishonesty, as defined by the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, may be excluded by the Associate Deans from consideration for academic honors at graduation. Another consequence could be that in admission to a major, for students who wish to change majors, individual majors may take into account the commission of an act of dishonesty. Exclusion from consideration for honors and exclusion from major change is not for the purposes of this policy to be considered a campus wide sanction. Students excluded from such consideration under this policy therefore are not eligible to request a formal hearing. 7. In those situations where a campuswide sanction is imposed and the student requests a hearing, the Associate Dean will forward to the Committee on Academic Honesty the materials which led him or her to impose the sanction. In addition, the Associate Dean will appear before the Committee to discuss the case upon request of the Committee. Student Hearings When any student accused of academic dishonesty wishes to contest an action by a faculty member, the student may, within a 15-day period, request mediation by writing to the Associate Dean of the faculty member or to the Ombudsman. However, it should be understood that all grades are ultimately the responsibility of faculty. The period is 15 calendar days and starts from the time the Associate Dean has notified the student of the discipline or has notified the student of the hearing and appeal process by providing a copy of this policy, whichever comes later. When a campuswide sanction is imposed, the affected student may, within 15 days of notification, request a hearing before the Committee on Academic Honesty. Students considering a hearing in response to campuswide sanctions for alleged academic misconduct are urged to contact the Associate Dean of their academic school and/or the University Ombudsman concerning possible sources of advice and assistance. Students should be advised regarding the grounds for appeal as specified in section 103.11 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students. Role of the Ombudsman The services of the Ombudsman may be requested at any time by the student, the faculty member, or the Associate Dean. The role of the Ombudsman is to assist in conflict resolution, mediate the dispute, perform an informal investi\u00ad gation of the case, and clarify policies and procedures for anyone involved. In those incidents where imposition of a campuswide sanction is a considera\u00ad tion and the student has requested a hearing, the case will be referred to the Office of the Ombudsman by the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies, as appropriate. An investigation may be conducted by the Ombudsman who will then confer with the Associate Dean and the accused student. However, the findings of the Ombudsman will not be for\u00ad warded to the Committee on Academic Honesty. The case may be referred by either the student or the Ombudsman to either the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies, as appropriate, who will be responsible for convening the Committee on Academic Honesty. Students should always be informed by the Associate Dean of their school of their right to secure the assistance of the Ombudsman in understanding and addressing the problem or issue. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Role of the Deans of Undergraduate Education and Graduate Studies Whenever an incident of academic misconduct is referred to the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies by the student or the Ombudsman, a representative of the appropriate offices will meet with the student and, if requested, explain the process and arrange the time and place of a hearing before the appropriate (Undergraduate or Gradu\u00ad ate) Committee on Academic Honesty. The appropriate Dean will maintain a record of all cases of academic dishonesty reported by the respective Associ\u00ad ate Deans. Formal resolution by the appropriate Committee on Academic Honesty may result in the imposition by the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies of one or more of the sanctions described in section I 05.00 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, including suspension or dismissal from the University. E. COMMITTEE ON ACADEMIC HONESTY 1. Jurisdiction of the Committees on Academic Honesty There will be two Committees on Academic Honesty. One Committee will hear cases of campuswide sanctions on undergraduate students while the other will hear graduate student cases. The Committees can reduce, affirm, or increase sanctions. 2. Composition of the Committees on Academic Honesty The Committees on Academic Honesty will be standing administrative com\u00ad mittees composed of two faculty, two students, and a representative of either the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Dean of Graduate Studies, as appro\u00ad priate. Terms of faculty members will be two years. One faculty member will be appointed annually by either the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Graduate Studies, as appropriate for the particular committee. To ensure con\u00ad tinuity, terms will be staggered; during the first year of operation only, one faculty member will be appointed for a one-year term. One additional faculty member will be appointed to serve as an alternate to each of the Committees. The two students shall serve for one year and will be appointed by either ASUCI or AGS as appropriate to the specific committee. One additional student member will be appointed to serve as an alternate to each of the Committees. 3. Role of the Associate Dean The Associate Dean will forward to the committee the evidence which led to his or her decision to impose the campuswide sanction. In addition, the Asso\u00ad ciate Dean will appear before the Committee to comment on the case if the Committee wishes. 4. Hearings a. If the student requests a hearing, the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies shall schedule a hearing of the case before the appropriate Committee. Written notice must be given to the parties involved regarding the date, time, and place of the hearing. b. The chair will be elected by the membership of the committee. The chair will rule on all questions of procedure, the admission or exclusion of evidence, and the need to call witnesses for additional testimony. Hearings shall be held in accordance with generally accepted standards of procedural due process. c. Hearings will be closed unless the parties involved agree to an open hearing. Every effort must be made by all parties to maintain confidentiality during the process. d. Hearings shall be held following the provisions in sections I 03.11. (5, 6, and 8) of the Policy on Student Conduct and Discipline in the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, except that the role of the Dean of Students shall be filled by the Dean of Under\u00ad graduate Education or Graduate Studies, depending on the status of the student. 5. Report of the Committee on Academic Honesty After the hearing the Committee shall arrive at a decision. When a decision is reached, the student and the appropriate Academic Associate Dean will be informed of the judgment. Appendix 537 6. Final Appeal If the campuswide sanction is upheld by the Committee, the report of the Committee and all supporting evidence can be sent for a final level of review at the request of the student. If the accused student is an undergraduate, the case will be reviewed by the Dean of Graduate Studies. If the accused student is a graduate student, the case will be reviewed by the Dean of Undergradu\u00ad ate Education. This final review process can only result in decreasing the sanctions imposed on the student or leaving them unchanged. There are no further appeals or processes. 7. Implementation Once the judgment has been rendered the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Graduate Studies will implement the judgment in the form of a letter to the student as well as initiate any other necessary administrative actions. F. MAINTENANCE OF DISCIPLINARY RECORDS Records relating to academic dishonesty will be maintained by the Associate Deans and the Offices of the Deans of Undergraduate Education and Gradu\u00ad ate Studies to promote consistency of penalties for a given offense and to ensure appropriate action against repeat offenders. Records will normally be destroyed after five years, unless the Associate Dean determines in any par\u00ad ticular case that there is good reason to extend the period of retention. In order to ensure that minor and nonrecurring infractions do not negatively impact a student's career beyond UCI, any student may petition to the Asso\u00ad ciate Dean of his or her academic school to have relevant academic discipli\u00ad nary records expunged after the record is two years old or upon graduation, whichever comes first. The Associate Dean has sole authority to consider and to grant or deny such petitions. The University will release a student's disci\u00ad plinary records to potential employers, governmental agencies, other educa\u00ad tional institutions, or other organizations or individuals only if authorized to do so by the student in question or if compelled by law. Any record expunged by the Associate Dean will also be erased in the Dean of Undergraduate Edu\u00ad cation or Graduate Studies Offices. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION This policy is intended to focus solely on issues related to academic dishon\u00ad esty. Certain details of the implementation of procedures specified here can be found in the UCI publication Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, available free of charge from the Office of the Ombudsman, located in 437 Administration; the Office of the Dean of Stu\u00ad dents, located in the UCI Student Center; and on the World Wide Web at http://www.dos.uci.edu/judicialluci_policy.html. Anti-Hazing Compliance The State of California and the University of California have expressly and repeatedly asserted their opposition to hazing and preinitiation activities which do not contribute to the positive development and welfare of the indi\u00ad viduals involved. In January 1988, the Education Code of the State of Cali\u00ad fornia was modified to reflect changes to the State's anti-hazing statute. In accordance with the revised Education Code, students are advised of the following: Education Code 32050 As used in this article, hazing includes any method of initiation or preinitia\u00ad tion into a student organization or any pastime or amusement engaged in with respect to such an organization which causes, or is likely to cause, bodily danger, physical harm, or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physi\u00ad cal or mental harm, to any student or other person attending any school, com\u00ad munity college, college, university, or other educational institutions in this state; but the term \"hazing\" does not include customary athletic events or other similar contests or competitions. Education Code 32051 No student, or other person in attendance at any public, private, parochial, or military school, community college, college, or other educational institution, shall conspire to engage in hazing, participate in hazing, or commit any act that causes or is likely to cause bodily danger, physical harm, or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm to any fellow student or person attending the institution. The violation of this section is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100), nor more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year, or both. UC IRVINE - 2006-2007538 UCI 2006-07 Appendix Education Code 32052 Any person who participates in the hazing of another, or any corporation or association which knowingly permits hazing to be conducted by its members or by others subject to its direction or control, shall forfeit any entitlement to State funds, scholarships, or awards which are enjoyed by him, by her, or by it, and shall be deprived of any sanction or approval granted by any public educational institution or agency. Copies of Sections 32050 through 32052 as well as UCI's policies regarding hazing are available from the Office of the Dean of Students, UCI Student Center. See Appendix F on the World Wide Web at http://www.dos.uci.edu/ judicial/uci_policy.htrnl. Campus Safety and Security The UCI Police Department (UCIPD) is responsible for the safety and secu\u00ad rity of the UCI campus as well as properties owned, controlled, or occupied by the University. UCIPD and UCI administration make continual efforts to reduce crime on campus and at the Medical Center. The following informa\u00ad tion is excerpted from the Crime Awareness Bulletin, which is published annually in September and distributed to new and continuing students, as well as to faculty and staff, at both the campus and the Medical Center. CRIME PREVENTION The UCI Police Department's Crime Prevention Unit offers ongoing educa\u00ad tional programs and presentations to the campus community. With the assis\u00ad tance of the Community Service Officers and Patrol Division, the Crime Prevention Unit teaches prevention and awareness about drugs and alcohol, domestic violence, sexual assault, identity theft, property and auto theft, workplace violence, and personal safety including the RAD (Rape Aggres\u00ad sion Defense) Program for women and radKIDS (Resisting Aggression Defensively) for children. For more information or to schedule a presenta\u00ad tion, call (949) 824-7181 or visit http://www.police.uci.edu. Monthly crime prevention tips are also available on the Web site. SAFETY TIPS Day and night, no matter where you go, you should be aware of your sur\u00ad roundings, should exercise good common sense, and should use safety pre\u00ad cautions as you would elsewhere. Theft is the most common security prob\u00ad lem. Property theft is preventable if you keep your personal belongings (backpack, laptop computer, cellular phone) in sight, within arm's length, or secured in a locked place. Students living on campus should keep their doors locked at all times. Faculty and staff should keep valuables locked up while they are in their workplace. The last person to leave a laboratory or building should lock the doors. Report the presence of unknown visitors or suspicious persons to the UCI Police Department or UCI Medical Center Security as soon as possible. Use the UCI Safety Escort Service (949-824-SAFE) if you are out at night, don't walk alone-walk in pairs, and learn the location of the Emergency Call Boxes (Blue Light Phones). EMERGENCY CALL BOXES (BLUE LIGHT PHONES) Both the campus and the Medical Center have emergency call boxes (Blue Light Phones). Use them to report emergencies, crimes, suspicious persons or activities, accidents, safety hazards, and to call for a Safety Escort. The campus has 125 Blue Light Phones scattered around the ring mall and in parking structures and lots. (See the campus map for locations.) The blue light on the box easily identifies them, and the boxes detect all sounds within a 15-foot radius. To use the phone, just push the button located on the front of the call box. You are then automatically connected to the UCI Police Department. The Medical Center has 21 emergency call boxes located throughout the complex and in the southeast corner of the Manchester park\u00ad ing lot. These phones are connected to the UCIPD dispatcher. SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICIES UCI is designated a drug-free environment, and only under certain conditions is the consumption of alcohol permitted. The sale, manufacture, distribution, or possession of any controlled substance is illegal under both state and fed\u00ad eral laws. Such laws are strictly enforced by UCIPD. All members of the UCI community-students, faculty, and staff -who violate these laws are sub\u00ad ject to disciplinary action, criminal prosecution, fines, and imprisonment. Sales, consumption, and the furnishing of alcohol on the UCI campus are restricted by UCI's Alcohol Policy and California State law and are con\u00ad trolled by the California Department of Alcohol and Beverage Control (ABC). However, ABC and UCIPD share enforcement of alcohol laws on campus. It is unlawful to sell, furnish, or give alcohol to a person under the age of 21 years (this includes the Anthill Pub & Grille). The possession of alcohol by anyone under 21 in a public place, or in a place open to the pub\u00ad lic, is illegal. It is also a violation of UCI's Alcohol Policy for anyone under the age of 21 to consume or possess alcohol in any public or private housing area on campus. Students and employees found violating alcohol/substance policies or laws could be subject to sanctions by the University. WEAPONS POLICY It is a serious violation of the law to possess a firearm on University property. Section 626.9 of the California Penal Code makes it a felony to bring or to possess a firearm on the grounds, or within buildings (including private resi\u00ad dences) of the University of California, without the written permission of the Chancellor or the Chancellor's designee. Please report to the UCI Police Department anyone who has stated that they have a gun on campus or who has made a threat to use a firearm on campus. You can ask to be anonymous when reporting. TO REPORT AN INCIDENT UCIPD needs your help to build and maintain a safe community. If you become suspicious about unknown visitors or someone's actions appearing unusual for the time and place, call UCIPD. They will assess the situation and take the appropriate action. Please report crimes; you can ask to be anonymous. On campus, dial 9-1-1 or (949) 824-5222 for a police, medical, or fire emer\u00ad gency. For non-emergency police services dial (949) 824-5223. The UCI Police Department's campus office is open 24 hours a day and is located on the ground floor of the Public Services Building, at the corner of East Pelta\u00ad son and Pereira Drives. At the Medical Center, dial9-l-l or (714) 456-5222 for a police emergency, (714) 456-6123 for a fire or medical situation. The Medical Center Security office is located in Building 2 adjacent to the Emergency Department's ambulance ramp. Crimes occurring off campus should be reported immediately to the city/state law enforcement agency where the crime occurred. UCI CRIME STATISTICS Pursuant to the Federal Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act of 1999, the University of California, Irvine annually makes available to all students, faculty, and staff statistics on the reported occurrences of criminal activity on and off campus and at the UCI Medical Center. The University of California, Irvine's annual security report includes statis\u00ad tics for the previous three years concerning reported crime that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings owned and controlled by UCI, at the UCI Medical Center, and on public property within or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus and Medical Center. The report also includes institutional policies concerning alcohol and drug use, crime pre\u00ad vention, the reporting of crimes, sexual assault, and other matters. To obtain a copy of this report go to the UCI Police Department Web site at http://www. police.uci.edu!studentright.html, or visit the Department in person. UCI Police Department 150 ~blic Services Building Irvine, CA 92697-4900 (949) 824-5223 I Crime Prevention Unit: (949) 824-7181 UC IRVINE - 2006-2007Computer- and Network-Use Policy The University of California, Irvine (UCI) provides computing resources and worldwide network access to members of the UCI electronic community for legitimate academic and administrative pursuits to communicate, access knowledge, and retrieve and disseminate information. All members of the UCI community (faculty, staff, students, and authorized guests) sharing these resources also share the rights and responsibilities for their use. Rights and Responsibilities Worldwide, open-access electronic communication is a privilege and contin\u00ad ued access requires that users act responsibly. Users should be able to trust that the products of their intellectual efforts will be safe from violation, destruction, theft, or other abuse. Users sharing computing resources must respect and value the rights and privacy of others, respect the integrity of the systems and related physical resources, and observe all relevant laws, regula\u00ad tions, and contractual obligations. Users are responsible for refraining from acts that waste resources, prevent others from using them, harm resources or information, or abuse other people. To help protect files, users are responsible for setting passwords appropriately and for keeping passwords confidential by not giving them to another person. Most UCI-owned computers are under the control of a system administrator or lab manager. These administrators are expected to respect the privacy of computer system users. However, UCI computer system administrators may access user files or suspend services on the systems they manage without notice as required to protect the integrity of computer systems or to examine accounts that are suspected of unauthorized use, misuse, or have been cor\u00ad rupted or damaged. This includes temporarily locking vulnerable accounts, removing hung jobs, reprioritizing resource intensive jobs, and such. Many UCI departments have their own computing and networking resources and policies. When accessing computing resources, users are responsible for obeying both the policies described here and the policies of other depart\u00ad ments. Student responsibilities are also described in the University of Califor\u00ad nia Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students. In addition, all users are responsible for obeying policies of off-campus network services accessed using UCI resources. Examples of Misuse Examples of misuse include, but are not limited to: Knowingly running or installing on any computer system or network, or giving to another user, a program intended solely for the purpose of damaging or placing excessive load on a computer system or network. This includes, but is not limited to, computer viruses, Trojan horses, worms, bots, flash programs, or password cracking programs. Attempting to circumvent data protection schemes or uncover security loopholes without prior written consent of the system administrator. This includes creating and/or running programs that are designed to identify security loopholes and/or intentionally decrypt secure data. Using computers or electronic mail to act abusively toward others or to provoke a violent reaction, such as stalking, acts of bigotry, threats of violence, or other hostile or intimidating \"fighting words.\" Such words include those terms widely recognized to victimize or stigmatize individuals on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, and other protected characteristics. Posting on electronic bulletin boards or Web pages materials that violate the University's codes of conduct (faculty, student). This includes posting information that is slanderous or defamatory in nature or displaying graphically disturbing or sexually harassing images or text in a public computer facility or location that are in view of other individuals. Attempting to monitor or tamper with another user's electronic communications or reading, copying, changing, or deleting another user's files or software without the explicit agreement of the owner. Violating terms of applicable software licensing agreements or copyright laws. Using campus networks to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access to any computer system. Using a computer account or obtaining a password without appropriate authorization. Appendix 539 Facilitating or allowing use of a computer account and/or password by an unauthorized person. Employing, either directly or by implication, a false identity when using an account or other electronic resources. This includes sending unauthorized mail that appears to come from someone else. Performing an act without authorization that will interfere with the normal operation of computers, terminals, peripherals, networks, or will interfere with others' ability to make use of the resources. Using an account for any activity that is commercial in nature not related to work at UCI, such as consulting services, typing services, developing software for sale, advertising products, and/or other commercial enterprises for personal financial gain. Deliberately wasting computing resources, such as playing games (for example, MUDS or IRC) while someone else is waiting to use the computer for UCI-related work, sending chain letters, spamming, treating printers like copy machines, storing or moving large files that could compromise system integrity or preclude other users' right of access to disk storage, and the like. Consequences of Misuse Misuse of computing, networking, or information is unacceptable, and users will be held accountable for their conduct. Serious infractions can result in temporary or permanent loss of computing and/or network privileges and/or Federal or State legal prosecution. Appropriate corrective action or discipline may be taken in conformance with applicable personnel policies, student policies, collective bargaining agreements, and procedures established by the Academic Senate. California Penal Code, Section 502 makes certain com\u00ad puter abuses a crime, (such as illegal reproduction of software protected by U. S. copyright law) and penalties can include a fine and/or imprisonment. Files may be subject to search under proper authorization. Minor infractions of this policy, such as poorly chosen passwords, overload\u00ad ing systems, excessive disk space consumption, are typically handled inter\u00ad nally to the department in an informal manner. More serious infractions such as abusive behavior, account invasion or destruction, attempting to circum\u00ad vent system security, and the like are handled formally through the Office of the Dean of Students or by other appropriate officials. Contact Information For additional information, contact Network & Academic Computing Ser\u00ad vices (E2130 Engineering Gateway Building) by calling (949) 824-2222, or by sending e-mail to nacs@uci.edu. Student Records The University of California campuses maintain various types of records per\u00ad taining to students; some are maintained for academic purposes; others, such as medical records, are maintained for other specific purposes. Student records -that is, those pertaining to students in their capacity as students-include but are not limited to academic evaluations, transcripts, test scores and other academic records, general counseling and advising records, disciplinary records, and financial aid records. At UCI, an \"applicant\" becomes a \"stu\u00ad dent\" at the time of submission of the Statement of Intent to Register form. The disclosure of information from student records is governed in large mea\u00ad sure by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, by the State of California Education Code, and by University policy and proce\u00ad dures implementing these laws which protect the student's right of privacy, provide safeguards for the confidentiality of student records, and permit stu\u00ad dents access to their own records. Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Infor\u00ad mation from Student Records, students at the University have the following five rights: I. to inspect and review records pertaining to themselves in their capacity as students; 2. to inspect records maintained by the campus of disclosure of personally identifiable information from their student records; 3. to seek correction of their student records through a request to amend the records or a request for a hearing; 4. to file complaints regarding alleged violation of the rights accorded students by the Federal Act with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue S.W., Washington, D.C. 20202-5920; World Wide - 2006-2007540 UCI 2006-07 Appendix 5. to have withheld from disclosure, in the absence of their prior consent for release, personally identifiable information from their student records, with exceptions as noted in the University student records policies. NOTE: There are instances in which information can be disclosed without prior written consent of the student. University officials may require access to student records in the course of the performance of their assigned duties. Further; confidential information can be disclosed without prior written con\u00ad sent of the student (a) in connection with conditions of certain financial aid awards; (b) when the campus is complying with a judicial order or sub\u00ad poena; and (c) when authorized federal or State officials are conducting an audit or evaluation of federally supported educational programs. There are also other situations in which the University is required to disclose informa\u00ad tion. See University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students for a list of exceptions. Normally, the campus will release the following as personally identifiable information which can be made public: Student's name; Photo; Address (e-mail, local, and/or permanent) and telephone numbers; Date and place of birth; Major field of study, dates of attendance, number of course units in which enrolled, degrees and honors received; Grade level; Enrollment status, e.g., undergraduate or graduate, full-time or part-time; Most recent previous educational institution attended; Participation in officially recognized activities, including intercollegiate athletics; Name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate University athletic teams. However, students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of these cate\u00ad gories to be designated public information with respect to themselves. (See the NOTE above.) If a student requests that information from his or her records not be regarded as public information, then the information will not be released to anyone without the written consent of the student. The student should be aware of the important implications of exercising this right. For example, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and degrees and honors received, the campus cannot release for publication information on any hon\u00ad ors received by the student, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, and cannot include the student's name and degree earned in the campus commencement program without the written consent of the student. Similarly, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and dates of attendance, a student's status as a student cannot be verified for potential employers with\u00ad out the written consent of the student. Further, if a student's last instruction to the campus was to withhold from disclosure the degree granted to that stu\u00ad dent and the date on which the degree was conferred, that information cannot be confirmed for a third party in connection with the appointment of that graduate to a new position or in connection with an honor that individual received without the written consent of the student. Students wishing to restrict release of public information should contact the Registrar's Office for instructions on how to do so. Questions regarding the rights of students under the University policies and the federal law should be directed to the University Ombudsman, 437 Administration. It is extremely important for each student to keep the Registrar's Office cur\u00ad rently informed as changes to personal data occur to assure that accurate and complete records are maintained. Students are informed annually of their rights under the University's student records policies and the federal Act. Copies of the Act and University and campus policies are available for review in the Reference Room, Langson Library. In addition, University policies are published in University of Cali\u00ad fornia Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, copies of which are available in the Office of the Dean of Students and on the World Wide Web at http://www.dos.uci.edu/judicial/uci_policy.html.

The University will respond promptly and effectively to reports of sexual harassment, and will take appropriate action to prevent, to correct, and if necessary, to discipline behavior that violates this policy. This policy also prohibits retaliation against a person who reports sexual harassment, assists someone with a report of sexual harassment, or participates in an investigation or resolution of a sexual harassment report. Consensual sexual or romantic relationships between members of the University community are subject to other University poli\u00ad cies, including the Faculty Code of Conduct and the UCI Policy on Conflicts of Interest Created by Consensual Relationships.
