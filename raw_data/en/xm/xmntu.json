Researchers from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Colorado conducted the survey of 2,200 US adults from March 30 to April 10, 2023, in partnership with sampling firm YouGov. They found that a large share of dog owners consider vaccines administered to dogs to be unsafe (37%), ineffective (22%), or unnecessary (30%).

Our pets, vets, and even our friends and family risk coming into contact with vaccine-preventable diseases. Study coauthor Gabriella Motta, VMD, a Pennsylvania veterinarian and Matt's sister, says she encounters an unvaccinated animal or a vaccine-hesitant pet owner every day at her job. \"When a staff member is bitten by an animal, there is always concern for infection or trauma, but the seriousness of the situation escalates if the animal is unvaccinated or overdue for its rabies vaccine,\" she says. \"The risk with the rabies vaccine is quite low\u2014especially when compared to the risk of rabies infection, which "}
