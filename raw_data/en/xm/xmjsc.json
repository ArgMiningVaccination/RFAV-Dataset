Calcutta: Thacker, Spink and Co., 1880 Detailed late 19th century work on Indian cookery designed to establish culinary practice and dining customs amongst a colonial readership. First published in Calcutta in 1869 and fr equently reprinted. The wor k offers advice on pr oducing food y ear-round in I ndia, pr oviding r eaders with information on the availability of foods, both nativ e to I ndia and those more familiar to the E nglish palate, with sugges - tions on ho w to use them. The r ecipes range fr om the quintessentially E nglish \"B ubble S (p.49) mor e ex otic. P articularly inter esting is the dialogue that the wor k por trays betw een E nglish and I ndian cooking, with techniques and ingr edients adapted to make the most appealing use of I ndian in- gredients for E nglish tastes. The author aims to allo w the r eader to set up a successful and w ell-run kitchen, with par ticular emphasis on cleanliness, especially im- portant in a hot climate. A high lev el of engagement from the o wners of the house is encouraged; they must ensure that high standar ds ar e maintained: \"The v ery best r ecipes ... for ensuring a per fectly clean kitchen, well-tinned utensils, and fr esh water , ar e the fr equent visits of the lor d and lady of the mansion to the cook. \" (Introduction) The wor k also pr ovides the necessar y terminology and conv ersion tables to understand Indian measur ements, and for basic communication with staff. The author describes an unsuccessful visit to the mar ket: \"The or der is fr equently misunderstood by the ser vant who pr ocures an ar ticle widely differ ent from that or dered, or he r eturns empty-handed, with the declaration of the tr uth, \"P iah neigh, \" or \"M illah neigh,\" which means \"Could not get, \" or \"Could not find.\" (p .5) As such, the wor k pr ovides a fascinating culinary and wider cultural r ecord of the E nglish pr es- ence in late 19th century India. While it sho ws little concern with pr omoting authen - ticity, and aims to appeal to peculiarly colonial tastes it does, ho wever, often does explain the traditional methods of pr eparation befor e going on to pr ovide an anglicised v ersion of the dish. F or example, in the case of \"kurma or quor ema curr y\" (p .22), the author states that: \"This, without ex ception, is one of the richest of Hidoostanee curries, but it is quite unsuited to E uro- pean taste, if made accor ding to the original r ecipe.\" The author attempts to educate his r eader in the practices of the colonial family and to str engthen this Westernized v ersion of I ndian cultur e. H e describes how: \"Rice is consumed b y most E uropean families at br eakfast, tiffin and dinner .\" (p .9).

London: printed for the P roprietor of the Argyll Rooms, 1858 A light-hearted guide to eating out, and eating well, in Victorian London. First published in 1851 as London at T able and no w revised. London at Dinner provides a guide to finding good quality food in the capital. The pr eface claims that, following the 1851 G reat E xhibition, a need emerged for a guide for both visitors and locals alike to the best eating establishments in London, and to the dining customs and the best r ecipes of fashionable E ngland. The tone of the wor k is frank and wr y. The amus - ing fr ont co ver sho ws a dining club initiation test, in which a pr ospective member of a dining club must pass thr ough one side of a pair of folding doors: \"I f a candidate for this corporate club could make his entrance thr ough the first, he was looked upon as unqualified; but if he stuck in the passage, and could not for ce his way thr ough it, the folding doors w ere immediately thr own open for his r eception, and he was saluted as a br other.\" (p .14). The wor k describes the best public eating establishments, such as the B lue Posts, Cor k S treet: \" You hav e the joints ar tistically carved in the r oom b y the waiter , and not jagged about \"dog's meat fashion \" b y the guests... \" (p .9). R ecom - mendations for clubs, such as Boodles, the Conser tive Club , the G arrick, the R eform and the B eefsteak are also included.

London at Dinner was printed for the pr oprietor of the Argyll R ooms, G reat W indmill S treet, H aymar - ket, today the site of the T rocadero centr e. The Argyll Rooms ar e illustrated on the back co ver sho wing a demure cr owd listening to an or chestra. D espite the sedate illustration, the Argyll r ooms had an extr emely poor r eputation. The Saturday Review of O ctober 16th 1853 describes the R ooms as a useful holding bay for undesirables. H aving been closed in the pr evious year, 1852, \" this y ear w e open them, because, on the whole, it is better that the vicious population should be br ought together than it should be let loose on so- ciety.\" D ue to its notoriety , the Argyll R ooms' licence was not r enewed and they w ere ev entually closed in 1878.

Con- tinued in 1826 as The H ousekeeper's M agazine and Family E conomist. Bound with 4 issues of The Chem - ist, a periodical fr om the same publisher , pr oviding information on chemical experiments and scientific discoveries. In the A ddress of the first issue (M ay 22, 1824) the editors set out their aim to lay do wn r ules for economy , not only concerning \" the inter ests of the pocket, but also those of our mind, fr om which emanate either happiness or miser y.\" The concept of economy tr eated in the wor k extends bey ond the simple ar t of budget - ing to \" the ar t of being comfor table and happy .\" I n order to achiev e this economy , each issue pr ovides a series of ar ticles on car efully-budgeted cooker y, mon- ey-saving ideas, popular wisdom, and liv ely accounts of frauds, or incidents that hav e befallen unfor tunate consumers. O ne par ticular example is the ar ticle \"Cheap D ining\" (pp .61-62), in which \" a person of very r espectable exterior \" is br ought to cour t after a fight at an eating-house. U pon arriving at the eating- house, the gentleman is pr esented with an enormous portion of r oast beef , and informed that the cook will not offer half-por tions. The gentleman attempts to leave, r efusing to pay; the waiter blocks his passage: \"please to pay me for the beef , sir; it was cut b y y our orders, and y ou musn 't go till y ou've paid for it. I t only comes to nine-pence, S ir, w edgibles and all. \" A fight ensues betw een the gentleman and the waiter: \"\" down the stairs they tr undled closely embraced, slap-bang on to a table just-co vered with smoaking hot dishes of roast and boiled (sic)\".

London, Simpkin, Marshall, and Co., 1838 A practical and humorous culinary commonplace book, filled with advice on cooking, serving and dining. This delightful little dining manual consists of a se- lection of \" very nearly 1000 hints \" to guide the 19th century diner . The hints, selected fr om literatur e, pe- riodicals and popular culinar y wor ks, ar e fr equently humorous as well as useful. The material ranges fr om the advice of F rench chef Louis E ustache U de (1769-1846) to v erses on food b y Byron and M ilton. U de's distinction betw een F rench and E nglish soldiers, and F rench and E cook- ery, is par ticularly amusing: \"The E nglish soldier lays his piece, or ration, of beef , at once on the coals, b y which means the one and the better half is lost, and the other burnt to a cinder; wher eas six F rench tr oop- ers fling their messes into the same pot, and extract a delicious soup , ten times mor e nutritious than the simple r \u00f4ti ev er could be. \" (p .12) The wor k also pr o- vides an engaging insight into dining custom during this period, with a shor t section on smoking and snuff (pp.116-118), and on the physical practicalities of the dining r oom in the section \"The D ining T able\" (pp.22-27). This D ining and Supper T ables ar e gradually coming into fashion, so as, in imagination, to r evive the chiv alric glor y of the Round T able.\" Hints for the T able demonstrates the incr easingly r e- fined customs of the E nglish table. W ith the rise in the popularity of the London club , as w ell as the gr owth of r estaurant cultur e, diners of this period w ere faced with an ev er-expanding selection of places to dine. The English diner could affor d both to be discerning in where he chose to eat, and to distinguish his o wn table by offering good food in style. [5] ACCUM (F riedrich Christian [F rederick]).

I n his intr o- duction, B radley mentions that he has encounter ed a number of culinar y disasters on his trav els, wher e meals w ere \" murder'd in the dr essing\". H e claims: \"I could mention many influences as bad as the common story of B acon and E ggs str ewed with B rown S ugar\" (x). B radley seeks to gently corr ect such faults, and to pr ovide suitable suggestions for cooking seasonal foods. B radley also considers in his intr oduction the gendered division of labour , suggesting why women should take car e of household wor k. A ttributing this division to X enophon, B radley claims that such mat- ters hav e alter ed little since the classical period and represent the natural order of things. Bradley accompanies his r ecipes with a liv ely selection of anecdotes, including a par ticularly engaging ac- count of a gentleman cur ed of his av ersion to cheese. (p.86). H e also includes two r ecipes for imitation mango pickles, made fr om cucumbers (p .117) and green M elons (p .162). The mango 's ex oticism defined the fr uit as an eighteenth centur y status symbol. The recipes included in the wor k offer an engaging insight into attempts to emulate the fr uit's flav our and tex- ture. Also offer ed ar e detailed instr uctions on dr ying and pr eserving a cr op of saffr on into a \" cake\" for y ear- round use (p.161) The second par t, The Country Lady's Director, features an eclectic selection of r ecipes, including two formula - tions for snuff (pp .34-35), \" a T urtle or T ortoise-pye\", and a \" gammon of a B adger r oasted\". B radley states that the badger is \"one of the cleanest Creatures, in its Food, of any in the W orld...\" and has a flav our \"like finest por k, ex cept sw eeter.\" F or his badger , B radley recommends a garnish of bacon cutlets and lemon slices. Another unusual suggestion is viper soup , for which w e ar e instr ucted to \" take vipers aliv e, and skin them, and cut off their heads. \" (p .165) B radley also gives ambitious instr uctions for \" an H og barbecued \" - this \" should be done in a Y ard, or G arden, with a Covering like a T ent over it.\" (p.165).

First edition of a complete practical guide to 18th century English cookery by an employee of two well-known London taverns and a coffee house and which was much reprinted in America. Briggs's The English Art of Cookery offers its r eaders an eminently practical appr oach to food pr oduction. He draws on his practical experience at the G lobe Tavern, F leet S treet, the White H art, H olborn and the T emple Coffee H ouse to pr ovide clear instr uction on pr eparing a wide range of dishes. I n his P reface, Briggs claims that to \" waste Language and high T erms on such S ubjects appears to me to r ender the Ar t of Cookery embarrassing \". The wor k co vers all aspects of cooker y, selecting some material fr om J ohn F arley's The London Art of Cookery (1783), as w ell as offering original r ecipes for fish (\" a curious ar ticle in the ar t of Cooker y\", p .63) and v egetables. B riggs also claims to addr ess the lack of existing instr uctions on poultry: giv e par ticular and useful D irections, because no Book of this Kind has contained such, that S ubject having been univ ersally overlooked by them\". The selection of dishes pr ovided b y The English Art of Cookery pr ovides an engaging insight into the dev elop- ment of B ritish cuisine during this period. I nterest - ingly, theatrical dishes inv olving moulding, shaping and elaborate decoration ar e included, despite the fact that such dishes would hav e been consider ed out- moded b y F rench cooks, former masters of this ar t, by the time this wor k was pr oduced. A par ticularly interesting example of this theatricality is pr ovided b y the instr uctions for making \" an egg as big as tw enty\" (p.352). I n or der to cr eate giant egg whites and y olks for slicing into salads, the r eader is instr ucted to sepa- rate tw enty eggs, siev e them and place the y olks and whites into two cleaned bladders, befor e boiling until they ar e har d, then allo wing them to cool. An ex otic method for dr essing a tur tle is also offer ed, with rather gory instr uctions for slaughter: \" Tie it b y its hind fins with a cor d sufficient to hold it, then cut off the head and allo w it to bleed all night... \" (\" To dr ess a T urtle the West-India way\", p.64). Briggs ensur es that the practical details of kitchen wor k are addr essed, with especial emphasis on cleanliness. A t the beginning of each section on meat cooker y, B riggs reminds his r eaders that any trace of dir t or gr ease on the pots and pans will mar the meat 's flav our. I n his \"Proper R ules to be O bserved in Boiling \", B riggs states that \" neatness and cleanliness is r equisite in a kitchen, as well in a cook's person the utensils.\" (p.137) aux G astronomes parisiens.

Contem - porary half calf with marbled boards, Paris: A. autelet et Cie. [I mprimerie de D avid], 1828 A seminal work that establishes a method for dis - cussing food and eating that also provides an in- sight into scientific thought and social custom of early 19th century France and navigates philoso - phy, history, literature and chemistry. Physiologie du Go\u00fbt revolutionised the way that w e think about food. B rillat-Savarin focuses not only on the practical science of cooker y, but also on the science in play as w e appr eciate food, attempting accurate de- scriptions of ho w w e understand flav our, taste and the experience of eating. The scientific content of the wor k is deliv ered alongside personal anecdotes, cultural ob- servations and social histor y, as B rillat-Savarin consid - ers dishes such as pot-au-feu, fondue and gar um. The influence of the wor k on the modern understanding of eating cannot be under estimated: \"N o longer would people be content to eat for nourishment alone - they would no w also expect satisfaction fr om a meal.

Like nearly all household manuals of the day , the work makes use of r ecipes fr om other authors.

Each non-original recipe is attributed to its author: \"I hav e quoted my author, wher e the r eceipt is not original; so that the cook, like the barrister , may kno w upon what author - ity he acts. \" (P reface) Cole goes so far as to claim that: \"if all writers upon Cooker y had ackno wledged fr om whence they took their r eceipts, as I do, they would have acted with mor e candour b y the public.

(Oxford Compan-ion to Food) In her pr eface to The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, H annah G lasse states her aim to \"impr ove the servants, and sav e the ladies a gr eat deal of tr ouble.\" She accomplishes this b y pr oviding straightfor ward recipes written in a lucid style. S he explains: \"I hav e not wr ote in the high polite style, I hope I shall be forgiven; for my intention is to instr uct the lo wer sor t, and ther efore must tr eat them in their o wn way . F or example: when I bid them lar d a fo wl, if I should bid them lar d with large lar doons (sic), they would not know what I meant, but when I say they must lar d with little pieces of bacon, they kno w what I mean. \" The manual offers typically wide-ranging instr uction, including a section on r ecipes suitable for taking on a sea v oyage. I nterestingly, G lasse chooses not to of- fer the medical advice typically included in household manuals of this period. S he explains: \"I shall not take it upon me to meddle in the physical way far ther than two r eceipts, which will be of use to the public in gen- eral...\" H er medical section in fact contains six pieces of advice, offering two ways to cur e the bite of a mad dog, to pr event the plague, to keep the house fr ee fr om bugs and to clean the bedstead of them, and a brief set of instructions for a maid. In keeping with the wor k's dir ect, accessible style, Glasse aims to teach her r eaders to use humble ingr e- dients to cr eate dishes that ar e satisfying and hav e a degree of elegance. G lasse keeps practicality in mind, too, in her chapter of r ecipes for sea v oyages (XI, pp.240-248) the pr oducts of which ar e designed to be successfully stor ed away for months, or ev en y ears. O f particular note ar e her instr uctions \" to make catchup to keep tw enty y ears\" - \" you may carr y it to the I ndies\". (p.240). Ther e is also a set of instr uctions for cr eating a \" sea v enison\" fr om lamb , cooking the v arious cuts in the fashion of v enison, and ensuring that ev ery par t is used. Glasse's wor k mar ks an inter esting point in the his- tory of the household manual but, despite the wor k's appeal, G lasse pr ovides little original material; 263 recipes of the 972 in the wor k ar e taken vir tually wor d for wor d fr om a single earlier sour ce, The Whole Duty of a Woman (OCF). Though D avidson claims that the culinary inno vations of G lasse's wor ks ar e \" mostly illu- sory\", the wor k has a gr eat deal of significance: it dem- onstrates ho w the potential of the household manual had begun to be exploited ev en befor e a mass-mar ket for food had developed.

The essentials of cook- ery ar e pr esented with additional information on raising liv estock and r unning a kitchen gar den. The work's learned, liv ely style, par ticularly evident in the supplementar y section at its close, distinguishes Henderson fr om other kitchen manual writers of this period. Though H enderson makes use of conv entional wisdom on culinar y matters, the manner in which he guides his r eader thr ough the tending of a kitchen gar- den and the keeping of liv estock indicates an unusual degree of literary engagement for a work of this kind. Henderson's selection of r ecipes is wide-ranging. I n his preface, he claims that: \"The r eceipts for each ar ticle are formed on so easy and cheap a P lan, as to be within the P urchase of all ranks of P eople.\" H e does, ho wever, include a tur tle r ecipe, though he admits that \"These animals not only furnish the most delicious r epast to the epicur e, but to all those who can obtain so luxuri - ous a gratification. \" (p .41) I n a similarly extrav agant vein is the r ecipe for ice cr eam, which assumes access to a good supply of ice, pr esumably fr om the countr y home's ice house.

This inter esting wor k pr ovides an insight into the changing style of E nglish cooker y. Amidst a gr owing knowledge of F rench bourgeois cuisine and high cook- ery, E nglish food attempted to assimilate some of the techniques and ingr edients that defined this elegant style (OCF). H oward's wor k was first published in 1703, just a y ear after the first E nglish edition of M as- sialot's Cuisinier Royal et Bourgeois , published as The Court and Country Cook . Alongside the familiar E ng- lish dishes of this period - br east of mutton (p .61), a salamongundy (p .64), gingerbr ead (110) and chicken stew (p .56) - ar e mor e sophisticated r ecipes for pickled lobster (p .32), cour t fritters (p .71), r oast pike (p .31) and a r oyal pastr y spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg and enriched with butter and cr eam (p .25 \"P aste R oy- al\"). H oward is concerned that he addr ess all aspects of the female householder 's existence, pr oviding advice on cosmetic tr eatment \" that they may be enabled to assist themselv es on all necessar y O ccasions, without having r ecourse to idle prating G ossips, or other quack Pretenders; who with M ercurial F ucus's cheat them of their Beauty as well as money\" (To the Reader). Howard secur ed his r eputation as an elegant cook in his r ole as chef to the D uke of O rmonde, and the Earls of S alisbury and W inchester, although as the title page notes he was b y then a \"F ree Cook \", pr esumably with his o wn pr emises. W orking for upper class families was an extr emely successful way for a cook to make his name, and would often r esult in a highly mar ketable cookbook such as this one.

A good copy of a rare early edition of a popular and much-reprinted collection of recipes and medi - cal advice attributed to the former court favourite Elizabeth Grey, the Countess of Kent. Panich calls Grey's work \"the hot copy of...[its] time\". This little wor k is a commonplace book that collects the medical r emedies of E lizabeth G rey (1581-1651), and a selection of r ecipes, perhaps b y her household cook, the w ell-known chef R obert M ay. The medical advice pr ovided in the wor k is notable for its tone; un- like many wor ks of this period, the r eader gets a sense of the personality of its author , who writes in a \" sooth - ing y et authoritativ e v oice\" (P anich). I n the r ecipe for \"Broath for a Consumption \" (pp .19-20), the author advises that the patient take the curativ e mixtur e of veal knuckle br oth with raisins, dates and almonds \"early in the morning, and at thr ee a (sic) clock in the afternoon, and so continue a good while together or else it will doe y ou no good. \" This caring v oice suggests a little of the medical r ole of the woman of the house in the sev enteenth centur y; it was her duty to minister to the sick, since doctors w ere both scar ce and costly . The r emedies pr ovided display the typical idiosyncra - sies of I nterregnum medical car e: \"F or them that can- not hear \", \"P ut into their ears good dried S uet.\" (43) A multi-purpose salv e is also suggested: \" Take the J elly of Frogs in M arch, and still it in a glasse S till, it is a good Medicine to stop bloud, and for the heat and r ednesse of the face, and to cure green W ounds.\" (167) The r ecipes offer ed in the second par t of the wor k, A True Gentleman's Delight , ar e typically E nglish, with simple suggestions for meat cooker y, and a focus on preserving fr uits and hedger ow pr oduce such as br oom buds (p .32) I t may be that these r ecipes w ere pr ovided by w ell-known cook R obert M ay, who had enter ed service with E lizabeth G rey b y the outbr eak of civil war in 1642. F ollowing the R estoration, M ay would publish his o wn wor k, The Accomplisht Cook , which proved extr emely popular , r oasting, boiling, fr ying, br oiling, v egetables, fish, hashes, made dishes, &c. &c.

London, printed for Whittaker , T reacher and Co ., 1829 A spirited household management manual by the epicure and writer William Kitchiner, addressing the diverse problems facing the 19th century house - wife. The work is a wry philosophical consideration of food production, budgeting, and housework. The Housekeeper's Oracle offers wisdom on many as- pects of r unning a successful nineteenth centur y household, including car eful shopping and economi - cal use of ingr edients, managing ser vants, and cleaning the house. Kitchiner 's effusiv e style combines practical advice with humor ous commentar y on the disciplines involved in household management. B eginning with a shor t histor y of cooking pr ovides instr uctions and diagrams on carving, an ar t he describes as \" the philosophy of the banquet\", price lists for meat, poultr y, fish and fr esh produce, and a philosophical discourse on puddings. Intended as a companion piece to the Cook's Oracle of 1817, this edition of The Housekeeper's Oracle was issued two y ears after W illiam Kitchiner 's death fr om a heart attack in1827. Kitchiner , an epicur e and writer , claimed falsely but convincingly that he had attended Eton and r eceived a medical degr ee fr om G lasgow, and was held as an authority on both cooking and medi - cal matters. The journalist W illiam J erdan described him thus: \"H is medical and gastr onomical practices were wonder fully combined, insomuch that his guests could not tell whether what was set befor e them was a meal or a prescription.\" (paraphrase from ODNB).

A good copy in original condition of an early 19th century guide to the art of confiserie that elucidates practical methods of producing sophisticated and elegant sweets, preserves, perfumes, cosmetics and herbal medicines. First published in 1803 and in an \"8th \" of this edi- tion in the UK and OCL C r ecords copies in th USA at California S tate Librar y - F resno, Columbia, H arvard, Indiana, Kansas S tate, N ational Librar y of M edicine and in Canada at the University of W aterloo. In his intr oduction to the Confiseur Moderne , M achet states his aim to r eveal the most useful and effectiv e ways of pr oducing attractiv e sw eets. H e criticises those who diligently hide the methods of numer ous useful processes, those confectioners who ar e guilty of issuing recipe books lacking vital information on ex ecuting the pr ocesses of sw eet making and distillation. H e sug- gests they wish to keep all the pr ofit of their industr y just for themselv es, aiming to completely v eil their methods. I n star k contrast to such instr uctors, M achet provides a clear and compr ehensive guide to cr eating a v ast range of sw eet foods and per fumed pr oducts. Machet himself ackno wledges that he has pr oduced a lengthy wor k, but that \"it is difficult indeed to be laconic.\" (xij) The book acts also as a companion piece to M assialot's 1692 wor k on the same subject, Nouvelle Instruction pour les Confitures , attempting to answ er its deficiencies. M achet makes an oblique r eference to the earlier wor k, claiming that it was composed to be a guide for the officier du bouche rather than for the confectioner. M achet's Confiseur Moderne builds on Massialot's wor k, offering an unriv alled selection of sweet recipes. The Confiseur Moderne use ocesses, ating the text fr om earlier wor ks on the subject which are far mor e factual. F or example, in the author 's fr ont advertisement pr eserving is described as \" the key to the art, or rather , the light which must light the ar tist in all his wor kings. (viij) The book also attempts par ticularly ambitious culinar y pr oductions, and sugar bottles for fill- ing with homemade liqueurs. Also of inter est ar e the instructions for ar tificial sugar flo wers (p .81), and the section on dragees or comfits (p .168-172), using the famous method developed at V erdun. Another distinguishing factor of this wor k is the for- mat of the r ecipes, listed in the modern fashion with ingredients and their quantities at the head of each recipe. Earlier r ecipe collections integrate the ingr edi- ents and their quantities with the body of the recipe. In addition to the r ecipes M achet offers instr uctions for a number of per fumed pr oducts, such as a lip po- made (p .342), soaps (p .348), and sachets (p .353) and scented pastilles for burning (p .357). A number of recipes for herbal tablets tr eating minor ailments such as stomach complaints ar e also included, as w ell as a formula for tablets that M achet ambitiously claims can stave off epilepsy (p.365). We kno w little of M achet's life; ho wever, he writes in the pr eface that he is keen to shar e his tw enty y ears' practical experience of pr oducing confectionar y with his r eaders. M achet's passion for the ar t of making confectionary is evident both fr om the manner in which he describes his ingr edients, and fr om his desir e that his book may ser ve to fur ther the ar t to which he has devoted his career.

M arkham giv es instr uctions for elaborate \"royall\" feasts, alongside advice on ser ving \" a mor e humble feast \" for one 's close friends. A gr eat deal of importance is placed on the manner in which food is served; M arkham claims that if a woman is ignorant of how to pr esent the dishes that she has learned to cook, it \"is like to a fencer leading a band of men in a r out, who kno ws the use of the w eapon, but not ho w to put men in order.\" (p.98) Keen to pr ovide a compr ehensive guide for the house - wife, M arkham also addr esses br ewing and y east cook- ery.

La Cuisini\u00e8re Bourgeoise offers a por trait of F rench bourgeois cooker y. F irst published in 1746 and r egu- larly r eprinted, the wor k pr oved v astly popular and played a par t in transforming the F rench culinar y landscape and establishing a simplified, elegant \" nou- velle cuisine \". M enon appr oaches the bour- geois food assuming no prior kno wledge of this style of cooker y fr om the r eader: \"I f they ar e no vices in this art, they can both learn and practice without pain the precepts that he [the author] has taken car e to lay befor e them, and dismiss that embarrassing superabundance of r efined seasonings and industrious disguises, which demand rather less skill in their cooks, than ostenta - tion in their masters \" (P reface). M enon states that this work is designed for a wider r eadership than his 1739 Nouveau Trait\u00e9 de la Cuisine . The wor k omits compli - cated, expensiv e r ecipes \" which could only hav e been of use in grand houses or amongst the w ealthy\"; no w Menon is writing for \" people of middle standing or of moderate for tune\" (P reface). M enon admits that \" the eye and the tastebuds will r eceive a smaller r eward\" but \"the health and the bank balance will benefit \". This definition of bourgeois cooker y is engaging: the r eci- pes contained in the wor k, though simpler than, say , those of the ar chetypal cour t cook M assialot, r etain a great deal of style and flair . I ndeed, M enon claims that the bourgeois household can be ennobled b y the ar ts of the table, and he includes car ving instr uctions to ensure that householders can serve food in style. As w ell as instr uctions on pr eparing and ser ving food, the wor k offers a glossar y of terms for the equipment commonly used in the bourgeois kitchen. These terms provide us with a par ticularly v aluable insight into the practical methods as w ell as the theor y of cook- ery during this period. Kitchen equipment such as the \" turboti\u00e8re\" is described, a r ound and flat copper fish kettle with a pier ced sheet of copper at the base to allo w the chef to drain a turbot without br eaking the delicate flesh. D espite the claim that the book is designed for households of mor e modest means, the glossary includes a description of a \" fruiterie\" for stor- ing fr uit. M enon explains that this must be a dr y place, neither too cold nor too warm, and kept dar k with good shutters and cur tains. H e suggests that the cook visit the fr uiterie fr om time to time to air the fr uit and thus preserve it in the best possible condition. [33] MENON (-). CLERMONT (B.), translator & editor .

The Imperial and Royal Cook (of which ther e was a 2nd editin in 1819) pr ovides us with an engaging picture of early 19th centur y sophistication. N utt claims that he does not aim for mass appeal; instead, he offers elaborate r ecipes using expensiv e ingr edients for \" opulent families \", who \" wish to giv e handsome occasional enter tainments to their select friends. \" (A d- vertisement). N utt also states that his manual offers a more sophisticated brand of cooker y than other r ecipe collections of the period, fr equently author ed b y cooks with practical experience of cooking in public houses. Nutt's focus on sophisticated cooker y allo ws him to omit the conv entional sections fr om contemporar y household manuals on basic culinar y pr ocesses: \"I do not pr ofess to giv e any hackney ed r eceipts for boiling or r oasting, br oiling or baking, but hav e confined my selection chiefly to the higher depar tments of the ar t, such as made dishes, ragouts, fricassees, soups &c. \" (Advertisement). The r ecipes that N utt offers make extensiv e use of meat, ser ved with elaborate continental-style sauces, or stuffed. The focus of the wor k on \" made dishes \" indicates the time and energy that N utt expects the cook to put into the pr eparation of a successful so- ciety dinner . N utt fr equently makes use of typically French cooking to ev oke an elaborate style, including dishes au gratin, a la D auphine and a la R eine. S weet dishes ar e similarly complex, such as gateau millefleur (p.208). The title ev okes M assialot's seminal 1691 on sophisticated F rench cooker y, Le Nouveau Cuisinier Royal et Bourgeois , demonstrating the influ- ence F rench of the inter ceding centur y; the r eceived ideas of F rench culinar y sophistication presented in the wor k ar e v ery differ ent fr om the actu- ality of French high class cookery during this period.

Perhaps the most famous English historical culi - nary text. The Forme of Cury offers one of the most r ounded insights into M edieval cooker y, and wider cultural practice, av ailable to the modern scholar . Though the recipes initially appear far r emoved fr om those of a modern cook book, both because of their format and their language, their content conv eys a striking im- mediacy. The r ecipes range fr om the curious - \"F ur- mente with P orpoys\" (a kind of almond porridge dressed with sliced porpoise) (p .39) to the curiously familiar - \" Verde S awse\" (p .65), which bears striking resemblance to a salsa v erde. S uch r ecipes raise ques- tions of food av ailability, and of the kinds of cultural exchange occurring in E ngland during this period. Pegge sho ws an inter est in these issues, attempting to define the terms that he has encounter ed in his study of the manuscript: in his pr eface he considers the wor d \"Pynes\", which he has come acr oss fr equently in the manuscript: \"Ther e is some difficulty in enucleating the meaning of this wor d, though it occurs so often \" (xxv) H e suggests that this may r efer to mulberries be- cause of their shape, or could simply r efer to pine nuts. Pegge dates the manuscript to around 1390. The manuscript pr ovides a large selection of r ecipes which suggest not only the kinds of ingr edients that were r eadily av ailable in this period, but also the ways in which the upper classes ate. F or example, two recipes for pies (\"Che wet\") ar e pr esented side-b y-side, one for a \"F lesshe the other for a \"F yssh Day\" (p .83), mar king out Christian eating practices. The first is a por k pie with ginger , the second, a fish pie with turbot, haddock, cod and hake, boiled and finely minced, with raisins. Another inter esting r ecipe is the \"E gurdouce of F ysshe\" (p .63), a pr ecursor to the modern sw eet and sour flav ours that w e think of as typically M editerranean. The author r ecommends that the cook use loach, tench or sole. W e ar e instr ucted to \"smyte hem on pecys \", and dr ess with a syr up made from vinegar , wine and sugar , spiked with whole spic- es, po wdered spices and salt. S uch r ecipes saw a r evival in the 20th centur y. I t is inter esting that P egge should dismiss the dishes in the wor k as unpalatable, since they hav e undergone a number of r evivals in the inter- vening centuries. This dish in par ticular is r eminiscent of G eorge P erry S mith's salmon in pastr y, spiced with ginger, and baked in pastr y with chopped almonds and pastr y. M ore r ecently, the elaborate aesthetic of Medieval cooker y and the combination of sw eet and savoury flav ours - in par ticular, meat and fr uit - has served as an inspiration to Heston Blumenthal. The wor k's dedication to G ustavus B rander (1719/20- 1787) sheds some light on the origins of this edition of the mediev al wor k.

The wor k centr es ar ound the two family seats, W ressle and Leconfield, in the East Riding of Y orkshire. F irst published priv ately in 1770, the wor k was edited b y Thomas P ercy, tutor to the N orthumberland childr en, writer and later B ishop of D romore. As P ercy points out in his intr oduction this household r ecord also offers a gr eat deal of v alu- able historical and social information that can allo w us to gain a better understanding of this period. P ercy claims: \"The minute attention paid to ev ern the most inconsiderable ar ticle of domestic expence (sic), and the formal stated or ders established with r egard to many par ticulars which appear to us extr emely trivial, are v ery r emote fr om our modern ideas and pr esent manners.\" The Regulations and Establishment of the Household of Henry Algernon Percy offers a pictur e of a strictly regulated house, and giv es information on the v arious ranks of the servers, their wages, and their daily lives. Attempting to account for the existence of such a de- tailed household r ecord, Thomas P ercy writes, \"I t may be consider ed...that a nobleman in the dar k ages, when retired to his castle, had neither books, nor ne wspa- pers, nor literar y corr espondence, nor visits, nor car ds to fill up his leisur e,\" and ther efore \" the G overnment of his H oushold would ther efore be likely enough to engage his attention... \" (x) The accounts of day to life in W ressle and Leconfield castles ar e par ticularly v alu- able since the str uctures themselv es no longer r emain in their original state; in the case of Leconfield, the castle was demolished ar ound 1608. (E nglish H erit- age N ational M onuments R ecord). The content of this wor k had a significant effect on the r eputation of Henry Algernon P ercy (1478-1527) at the time it was first published.

An anthology of household and medical advice for the use of women, providing an insight into the tasks that defined their role at the end of the 18th century. Although compiled b y unkno wn editors, for the cook- ery r ecipes they made \" ample use \" of the manuscripts of the late J ohn P erkins, who is described on his por- trait as \" many y ears cook in the F amilies of Earl G ower and Lor d M elbourn (sic)\" but is other wise unkno wn, and the medical advice deriv es fr om the distinguished doctor and author of popular wor ks on medicine W il- liam Buchan. The two v olumes of The Ladies' Library offer a div erse selection of advice on cooker y, cleanliness, and bring - ing up childr en in good health to y oung ladies and \"to ev ery class of F emale ervants house-keeper , the cook, the house-maid, the chamber-maid, and the nursery-maid\". I t attempts to pr omote health thr ough - out the family , emphasising the r ole of the mother in promoting \" content, satisfaction and utility thr ough - out their families \" (P reface). B ringing together culi- nary material fr om \" almost thir ty differ ent authors \", the style of cooker y offer ed in the wor k claims to tend towards \" frugality and elegance \". Also addr essed is the subject of a woman 's personal appearance and the wor k aims to define a suitable midpoint betw een v anity and a complete lack of concern for personal appearance; it condemns the \" pernicious practice \" (p .173) of paint - ing the face with heavy make-up , instead attempting to promote a clear complexion and attractiv e appearance through good health. The Ladies' Library makes an at- tempt at pr oviding female r eaders with a useful general reference point for health pr oblems, noting with con- cern that women can be too embarrassed to ask for medical advice: \"The Ladies, in par ticular, ar e often prevented fr om r eceiving the benefit of medical advice by an unwillingness, the offspring of delicacy , to apply for it. \" (viii) The wor k also includes detailed advice on looking after childr en fr om bir th, with dir ection on diet, exercise, and sleeping conditions. (pp.234-257). Despite its claim to aim for \" frugality\" in the r ecipes that it pr ovides, The Ladies' Library also includes a selec- tion of inter esting and elaborate dishes. These include a selection of \"O rnamental D ishes\" (pp .174-178) such as a fish pond made of flummer y with jelly fish set into it, and \"M oonshine\", a flummer y half-moon and stars surrounded b y lemon cr eam and garnished with flo w- ers. Also offer ed is an entr y on the notorious delicacy ortolans, a small wild bir d popular in F rance. The La- dies' Library suggests that, having impor ted her or to- lans, the lady of the house should feed them \" till they become a lump of fat \", befor e killing them (p .173). This is a v ariation on the traditional F rench method of drowning the bir d in str ong vinegar or Armagnac. The bird is then plucked, r oasted and eaten whole, includ - ing the bones, traditionally in F rance with a napkin over one's head. The medical content of the wor k giv es the impr ession of a par ticularly solid gr ounding in scientific fact.

First published in 1806, The New System of Domestic Cookery instr ucts the house wife in pr oviding for her family. The intr oduction to the wor k tr eats household management as a lost ar t. R undell states: \"Ther e was a time when ladies kne w nothing bey ond their o wn family concerns; but in the pr esent day ther e ar e many who kno w nothing about them \" (ii). T o this end, Rundell pr ovides a large selection of useful r ecipes as well as advice on mar keting, advice for cooking for invalids, for the poor , and instr uctions for ser vants. The r ecipes included in the wor k ar e r elatively simple, though R undell sho ws an awar eness of elegant pr esen- tation and attempts to make the most of her ingr edi- ents.She r ecommends practising car ving to av oid an unsophisticated r esult, warning that an inexperienced carver can cause the dish to leav e the table \" with the appearance of having been gnaw ed b y dogs \" (xxiii). The wor k contains the first kno wn printed r ecipe for bubble and squeak: fr y it [pr esum - ably potato], with a little pepper and salt, and some cabbage; and lay on it slices of under done beef , lightly fried.\" (p.61) . Rundell r egards the household as the ideal envir on- ment for a y oung woman, and its skills the ideal com- plement to the female character . The pr eface claims: \"This little wor k would hav e been a tr easure to herself when she first set out in life, and she ther efore hopes it may prove useful to others.\" Rundell's wor k began as a collection of household ad- vice and r ecipes for her daughters who had been sent to liv e with an aunt and uncle in London.

S almon also states that the entries ar e extr emely accessible: \"The E xpessions (sic) ar e plain, the Language easy , the Directions ob vious, and the M ethod dir ect, for the Instruction of the P ersons to whom it is intended. \" Salmon claims that not only ar e other wor ks inaccu - rate, but ev en the advice of other doctors is unr eliable, to the point of mortal danger. Salmon's culinar y style typifies middle class E nglish cookery during this period.

The wor k contains the conv entional selection of bills of far e for each month, and mar keting advice, alongside its culinar y content. S mith herself admits that the genr e of cooker y writing has become saturated in this period in her pr eface, claiming that ther e is no need for any intr oduction to the univ ersal practices of cooking and eating. Cooker y, \"being so necessar y for the G ratification of the A ppetite, stands in need of no E ncomiums to allur e persons to the practice of it, since ther e ar e but fe w no w-a-days who lo ve not good eating and drinking. \" I nterestingly, she chooses instead to dev ote her intr oduction to a histor y of cooker y, pr o- viding an engaging insight into the understanding of cookery as cultural practice in the 18th centur y.

O riginal blue paper wrappers, the front printed with the title as above. [London: 1785] Apparently unrecorded in any issue. The lots ar e sold b y ship - 4 cargoes of H yson tea in 406 chests and 18 cargoes of Souchong tea in 3254 chests. Priced and named with buy ers in manuscript. The pagination of the sales was presumably continuous for a year so that bound volumes could be completed. 1785 was a year of great importance for the British tea trade. This catalogue describes the East India Com - pany's stocks of hyson and souchong tea offered for sale at the second of four yearly sales. The 1785 sales were the first to follow the Commutation Act of 1784, issued to disincentivise smuggling and to regulate the quality of tea. The tea tax was raised several times during the preceding decade in order to finance the Anglo-American War of Independence. The tax on tea reached 119% at its peak in 1784; such high rates meant that tea smuggling was rife. The trade was also subject to problems with tea quality, ranging from the supply of chests packed with good quality tea leaves at the top but covering a body of inferior leaves beneath, to the supply of composite productions including leaves from other plants. It has been estimated that, during the 1770s, more than 7 million lb of tea were smuggled into England every year, compared with some 5 million 5lb of declared tea. Following Pitt the Younger's election as Prime Minister, in 1784 the tax on tea was reduced from 119% to 12.5%. (Mair and Hoh, p.185) During this period, hyson and souchong were con- sidered the premier green and black teas respectively. (Mui & Hoh-Cheung) The catalogue provides a glos- sary of terms conventionally used for tea description by brokers, who would sample and analyse the tea be- fore its sale. The terms carry symbols which are printed next to each lot, describing their quality. The terms range from \"musty and mouldy\" to \"superfine\", an indication of the significant variation in quality of tea during this period. The catalogue also lists the names of the ships carrying each variety of tea, an important detail, since supercargoes were individually responsi - ble for the tea that they carried, and oversaw the pack- ing of their cargo. Each ship would be held financially responsible for their cargo, and damages would be deducted from the commission of supercargoes unless costs could be reclaimed from their Chinese suppliers.

An important 17th century work by Hannah Wol - ley, \"one of the first English women to make a living as an author.\" The work contains exceptional auto - biographical detail, describing Woolley's medical experience (ODNB). With a pair of unique printed book-labels dated 1694 for a female owner. This inter esting and attractiv ely pr esented wor k offers a r emarkably complete pictur e of 17th centur y food culture fr om kitchen to table, as w ell as content on etiquette. W oolley offers r ecipes, bills of far e for dif- ferent seasons, and advice to cooks and ser vers on ho w to pr esent themselv es. The style of cooker y offer ed b y the wor k is r elatively complex; meats ar e fr equently stuffed and r ecipes often suggest pickling or pr eserv- ing. F or example, W olley offers a r ecipe for stuffed v eal \"to eat like sturgeon \" (p .169), and instr uctions \" to r ost a whole P ig without the skin, with a P udding in his Belly\" (p .281). U nusual r ecipes include a sw eet and sour \"lettuce pie \" using \" cabbage lettuce \", with but- ter, marr ow, raisins, dates, mace, nutmeg, v erjuice and sugar. W olley demonstrates a nuanced understanding of her raw ingr edients, offering separate r ecipes for boiling wild and tame ducks (p.259). This wor k is par ticularly notable for its detailed in- structions on the technicalities of the kitchen, offer- ing advice to cooks and ser vers on pr esentation and comportment. (p .332-338) W olley pr ovides guidance on what makes a good ser ver to \" all ... M en-Servants, or M aid-Servants who commonly attend such tables \". She suggests: \"They must be neat and cleanly in their Habit, and keep their heads clean kembed... \" (p .337) As for cooks, Wolley advises that they ought to be \"obliging to all persons, kind to those under them, and willing to inform them, quiet in their office, nor swearing nor cursing...\" (p.333) This is an unusual in- clusion for household manual from this period. Further remarkable content is provided in the second section of the work, a supplement to \"The Queen-Like Closet\". In this section, Wolley gives a detailed ac- count of her experience in treating medical disorders. She began learning about treating medical conditions at home: \"Take notice that my Mother and my Elder Sisters were very well skilled in Physick and Chiru - rgery\" (p.10). She was then put into the service of a noble woman. Wolley describes how she was sent to a woman who was suffering in a difficult labour and subject to convulsive fits, and managed to effect a safe delivery. She then gives many further examples of her success in medical work. She finally recommends such knowledge to the reader with the claim that: \"It is 50 Berkeley Square London W1J 5BA 020 7493 7160 www.maggs.comaltogether as necessary that you should know how to keep your Bodies in health, to preserve your Eye-Sight and your Limbs, as it is to Feed or Cloath yourself\" This section also provides advice on the correct tone for letters, offering examples of both well and poorly executed letters to a selection of addressees.
