Tennis Elbow, also called lateral epicondylitis, is a pain condition caused by overuse or repetitive movements of the arm and wrist. [Acupuncture and TCM can provide help](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1832-acupuncture-heals-tennis-elbow-stops-pain) with healing the muscles and tendons of the elbow and providing elbow pain relief of tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, or tendonitis, so you can get back to your usual activities. \"Tennis elbow\" gets its name from the fact that many people get this type of repetitive use injury from playing tennis and other sports that involve holding a racquet. But tennis elbow doesn't only occur in athletes; it's also common among people who have to perform repetitive movements that tax the muscles and tendons of the elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand and involve gripping an object, such as: painting, hammering and sawing (construction workers), cutting or chopping (cooks, chefs, butchers), using a wrench (plumbers), or working on an assembly line. [Tennis elbow](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/tennis-elbow-lateral-epicondylitis/) is a kind of tendonitis, or inflammation of the soft tissues of the forearm. Tendonitis occurs when the soft tissues that attach muscles to bones sustain microtears and become inflamed. The major muscle involved in movements where the wrist and hand are gripping an object while the elbow is extending, or straightening, is the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle. The ECRB muscle experiences friction as it moves over the bumpy joining of three bones in the elbow joint. Over time, and with overuse, the tendons that attach the ECRB to the bones can become torn and/or inflamed. [Tennis elbow pain](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tennis-elbow/symptoms-causes/syc-20351987) is usually centered right in the outer side of the elbow, and just below the joint, but it can also radiate further down the arm and into the wrist. There might be a burning sensation in the muscle on the outer forearm. Pain and weakness in the elbow and wrist can make it difficult to perform regular actions like holding a cup or using a computer mouse. [Golfer's elbow](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/medial-epicondylitis-golfers-and-baseball-elbow) is a similar condition in that it is also an overuse injury that causes weakness and pain in the forearm. The difference is that with golfer's elbow, also known as medial epicondylitis, the inflammation and microtearing occur in the muscles and tendons involved in flexing the arm rather than extending it, or bending the wrist inward towards the palm with a lot of force or speed. These are located on the inner part of the elbow and forearm. This type of repetitive use condition can be the result of swinging a golf club, throwing a baseball, hitting a forceful spin serve in tennis, but also such activities as shovelling, using a heavy tool like an axe or chainsaw, or even just carrying a heavy suitcase with your hand and wrist wrapped around the handle. Tennis elbow pain can be resolved with rest, but for many people, complete rest is not a feasible or desirable option. Acupuncture treatment [has been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4710923/) to help provide significant pain relief for tennis elbow. [Acupuncture treatment can help to reduce inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/) and improve blood flow to injured areas to aid and speed healing of various types of tendonitis. Top 5 Symptoms of Tennis Elbow Signs of [tennis elbow](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/lateral-epicondylitis-tennis-elbow) usually develop slowly over time and are not caused by any obvious single injury. - Elbow pain or pain on the outside of the forearm, burning sensation in the outer part of elbow, stiff elbow - Pain that radiates down to the wrist, wrist pain, stiff wrist - Stiffness of the elbow, especially first thing in the morning - Weak grip strength, reduced grip strength - More severe pain when gripping an object, like a mug or racquet Symptoms of golfer's elbow are similar, except that the pain is located on the inner side of the elbow or forearm, as opposed to the outer side. Pain is more likely to radiate to the fourth and fifth fingers (ring finger and pinky finger) than to the wrist. You may feel pain when making a fist. Wrist pain, tingling in the fingers, and weak grip strength can also be signs of [carpal tunnel syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-with-acupuncture-tcm/). Medical Treatment for Tennis Elbow The standard treatment for Tennis Elbow begins with rest, icing, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs like Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen) to reduce pain and swelling. If the pain persists, or perhaps if a person is not able to avoid the activities that are causing the inflammation, doctors may recommend wearing a brace and may administer steroid injections. Surgical treatment for tennis elbow is relatively rare and only recommended in cases where rest and pain management medications are not working. An arthroscopic procedure to remove damaged and scarred tissue can help repair the muscles and tendons, but there is usually a long recovery time after the surgery. A newer form of treatment for chronic tendon pain and inflammation is the F.A.S.T. procedure (Focused Aspiration of Scar Tissue). This is a less invasive procedure that uses ultrasound imaging and ultrasonic technology to remove tiny bits of damaged tissue without any incisions. Recovery time after this procedure is much shorter than with regular tennis elbow surgery. While pharmacological treatment for pain may help to reduce immediate suffering, medications like NSAIDs and steroid injections come with significant side effects, even if they aren't immediately apparent. Using these kinds of medications long-term to alleviate chronic pain can take their toll, sometimes causing gastrointestinal distress, weight gain, sleep problems, and other side effects that have a negative impact on overall health. Acupuncture treatment can act as [an analgesic to relieve pain](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/pain/) without any negative side effects. In fact, the side effects of acupuncture treatment are usually beneficial, including increased circulation, immune function, and stress relief. Can Acupuncture Treat Tennis Elbow? The treatment of chronic pain and inflammation with TCM goes back for many centuries. We use acupuncture and other methods to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation related conditions, including: acupuncture treatment, electro-acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping, Tui Na massage, exercise, and Chinese herbs in formulations for both internal (tea or pills) and external (pain patches) use. This multi-pronged approach can be very effective for reducing pain in the short term, while helping tissues to heal over time. A [controlled study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1329-acupuncture-proven-to-heal-tennis-elbow) in which patients suffering from lateral epicondylitis were divided into three groups and treated with either massage or acupuncture, or a combination of both, showed that patients who received the combination treatment experienced, for the most part, a complete recovery after twenty sessions. [Another controlled study](https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/41/2/205/1788155) that compared people suffering from chronic tennis elbow who were treated with real acupuncture versus sham acupuncture showed that at both the two week mark and the two month mark, people who had received acupuncture reported less pain and improved function of the arm joints. Exercises and Pressure Points for Tennis Elbow Pain Prevention If you are already experiencing tennis elbow pain or signs of golfer's elbow, you may need to take some time off from sports or make accommodations to your work in order to rest the muscles and tendons of the forearm. Resting the arm is important for allowing inflammation to go down. Once you're able to start exercising again, try these home remedies for tennis elbow that will help to prevent tendon problems in the future: - To prevent repetitive stress conditions like tennis elbow and golfer's elbow when playing sports, be sure to always warm up before playing and cool down afterwards. Practice your form, with a trainer if warranted, so that you know your technique is good and not contributing to pain or injury. Check your sports equipment regularly to make sure everything is in good condition and the right size and balance for you. [Pressure points](https://www.modernreflexology.com/acupressure-points-for-tennis-elbow-relief/)for tennis elbow: If you are experiencing pain in the elbow and forearm, you might try using this acupressure point to help tennis elbow pain: LI11 (Large Intestine Meridian 11) - located right in the crevice of the elbow crease, applying pressure to this point can help move Qi and blood through the joint and bring relief from tennis elbow pain. This point is also helpful for clearing heat and cooling you down after exercise, so it's a good one to use right after a game or when you finish work. - Exercises for Tennis Elbow - practicing gentle exercises that strengthen the muscles of the wrist and forearm can help prevent pain and tissue damage. Using light dumbbells or a flex bar can help with grip strength.

It should not stop you from consulting with your physician for your medical conditions. Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science.

Therefore acupuncture and Chinese herbs are often not supported by double-blind, randomized trials, and they are considered alternative medicine therapies in the United States. [ How to Treat Toothaches With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Sharp tooth pain, toothache, or throbbing pain in teeth usually means you need to see the dentist. The pain of dental work often necessitates the use of anesthetics, while post-operative pain from dental surgery is usually treated with over the counter pain medications or opioid painkillers. Acupuncture offers an alternative way of [dealing with dental pain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29231508/) and can also [relieve the dental anxiety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1876382018300544) many people experience when they have to have dental work done. Oral pain makes it hard to eat, hard to talk, hard to even think straight. Mouth pain felt in relation to problems with the teeth, or a hurting tooth, is often nerve pain that may be sharp in one place, or radiate to other parts of your face and head. Acupuncture acts upon the neurotransmitters that carry signals between parts of the body and the brain, helping to block pain sensations and relieving tooth pain. Different types of mouth pain, not necessarily related to dental problems or the teeth, can also be alleviated by acupuncture, including [TMJ jaw pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), clicking or locking of the jaw, tension from grinding teeth, and dry mouth (xerostomia). Myofascial pain, pain in the muscles of the face, and [migraines](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) that cause pain in the neck and side of the head can also be helped with acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture and herbs do not replace the need for regular dental visits or necessary dental procedures. However, [TCM methods](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270142/), used in conjunction with good oral hygiene, can help to promote the development of strong teeth in children, and the maintenance of healthy teeth and gums in adults. TCM treatments help improve immune function, as well, which can help prevent mouth infections. While dentists have a variety of anesthetics they can use to help reduce pain during dental procedures, many people find the injection of anesthetic to be painful and anxiety-inducing in and of itself. There are definitely downsides to the pain relief offered during dental visits, so much so that many people avoid going to the dentist, or at the very least wish there was some alternative form of anesthesia. Recently, there is [growing interest and research](https://www.dentistrytoday.com/news/todays-dental-news/item/1847-acupuncture-explored-as-an-alternative-dental-treatment) to show that acupuncture can be an effective means of [providing pain relief](https://medcraveonline.com/JDHODT/evaluation-of-acupressure-effect-on-reducing-the-need-for-dental-injection-in-fixed-prosthodontics.html) before, during, and after dental procedures. It is estimated that up to 30% of people report feeling dental anxiety, while about 10% of patients experience dental phobia. [Acupuncture has been shown](https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/FullText/2007/02000/Auricular_Acupuncture_for_Dental_Anxiety__A.13.aspx) to help produce a clinically significant decrease in feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/anxiety/) or fear of going to the dentist. Managing Dental Pain It is common to experience pain while you are waiting to get into the dentist for a toothache caused by a broken filling or because a crown has fallen out. Most dental pain is [usually managed](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/dental-anesthesia#side-effects) with non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), also known as OTC pain medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. However, some people cannot tolerate the regular use of these medicines, as they can cause damage to the lining of the stomach. Different types of anesthesia used during dental work include: - local anesthetics (lidocaine, articaine, etc.), which numb the area where a tooth is being worked on - sedation (nitrous oxide gas, Valium, Versed, etc.), which helps relax the patient - general anesthesia, which means a patient is rendered unconscious for the duration of the dental procedure Pain after oral surgery is most often treated with over the counter analgesics like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, but severe dental pain may be treated with [opioid](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/opioids/more-info) painkillers. Dentists in the U.S. are far [more likely](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2734067) to prescribe opioid pain medications than they do in other countries. Dentists are also more likely to prescribe long-acting opioids, and to prescribe opioids for a longer period of time. The growing numbers of people addicted to opioids in America is largely [due to over-prescription](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(19)30527-6/fulltext) of these drugs. [TCM methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/4800704) like acupuncture can relieve a toothache and reduce post-operative pain and bleeding without side effects or risk of dependence. Can Acupuncture Help Tooth Pain? Acupuncture treatment has an analgesic effect, reducing pain and inflammation of all kinds. Acupuncture not only offers natural pain relief for toothache, but can also help [reduce bleeding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29231508/) during dental procedures such as tooth extractions. A [controlled study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/2036-acupuncture-stops-dental-surgery-pain-and-bleeding) that compared two groups of patients have teeth extracted, one group treated with articaine hydrochloride injections and the other groups treated with acupuncture needles, found that pain relief was comparable between the anesthesia and acupuncture groups, while bleeding was less amongst those patients given acupuncture. In addition to helping with pain and bleeding during and after a dental procedure, many people find it helpful to come in and have an acupuncture treatment just prior to their dental appointment in order to help alleviate anxiety. Acupuncture may also help to reduce a person's gag reflex, which can be easily triggered during fittings for orthodontic devices, or impressions. With acupuncture treatment, we can also effectively treat dental [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), allowing for patients to feel more relaxed going into their dental appointment and feel less pain during and after a dental procedure. Top 3 Pressure Points to Help Tooth Pain [Acupressure](https://www.healthline.com/health/pressure-point-for-toothache#the-pressure-points) has been shown to help reduce anxiety, gag reflex, and the [need for dental injections](https://medcraveonline.com/JDHODT/evaluation-of-acupressure-effect-on-reducing-the-need-for-dental-injection-in-fixed-prosthodontics.html) for pain during fittings for prosthetics. Specific [points on the head](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) and face, in particular, can help relieve toothache and swelling. If you are experiencing acute tooth pain, plan to see your dentist as soon as possible. In the meantime, using these [acupressure points](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/pressure-points-for-toothache#best-pressure-points) for toothaches can help you stay calm and alleviate the pain until you can get treatment. - ST6, Stomach Meridian Point 6, is located in the cheek, equidistant between the corner of the mouth and the earlobe. Apply pressure to the jaw muscle here to help relieve toothache and jaw pain. - SI18, Small Intestine Meridian Point 18, is right in the cheek hollow, perpendicular to the corner of the eye and outside of the nose. Apply pressure to this point to help relieve tooth pain and swollen gums. - LI4, Large Intestine Meridian Point 4, is located in the webbing between the thumb and index finger. Squeeze with firm pressure here. Often used to relieve headaches, but this point helps tooth pain, as well. Acupuncture Near Me for Tooth Pain on the Westside of Los Angeles No one likes going to the dentist. However, if you have a hurting tooth but you've been avoiding the dentist out of fear, or if you know you have to have some major work done, and you are dreading it, please consider scheduling an acupuncture appointment before your next dentist appointment. Discover for yourself how acupuncture can help relieve dental anxiety and post-procedural dental pain. You may find you feel much more relaxed about the whole thing, and herbs and acupuncture can help staunch bleeding and speed recovery after dental work. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat UTI With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Why do I feel like I have to pee all the time? A urinary tract infection, usually referred to as UTI, is a bacterial infection that affects the bladder and/or other parts of the urinary system, causing urinary urgency, often accompanied by a burning pain when you go to the bathroom. [Acupuncture and TCM](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=28133) is a good way to get to the root causes of [frequent urination](https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/frequent-urination/basics/causes/sym-20050712), including [recurrent UTIs](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.16315). Urinary frequency, or an unusual urgency to urinate, can be caused by several different health conditions. A common cause of bladder pain, pressure on the bladder, or a burning sensation when peeing is a bacterial infection in the urinary tract, or UTI. But there can be many other reasons for constantly feeling like you have to pee, including [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), interstitial cystitis (IC), pregnancy, prostate problems, [ovarian cysts](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and more. Over half of all adult women have experienced a UTI (also called cystitis) at some point in their lives. Many [women get UTIs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502976/) frequently, making them the most common type of non-hospital-related infection in the U.S. Up to 6% of all doctor visits are related to UTIs. A UTI can occur when bacteria, usually E. coli, gets into the urethra and travels up into the bladder, or further into the urinary tract. This can happen because of hygiene habits, after sex or exercising, or the use of contraceptives or period products. It can also happen when urine sits in the bladder for too long, or because a person has a weakened immune system. While UTI treatment at home remedies such as drinking cranberry juice are popular, most women recognize that once they get that constant urge to pee, they have no choice but to rush to the doctor for antibiotics. Typical [UTI medical treatment](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353453) almost always involves confirming the infection by lab analysis, and a prescribed course of antibiotics, along with analgesic medicine (such as Pyridium) to help the UTI pain in bladder. Unfortunately, many women keep getting UTIs. Infections that are [antibiotic resistant](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/antibiotic-resistant-urinary-tract-infections-are-on-the-rise-2019101417982) are increasingly common, and antibiotics do not get to the root of the problem. [Interstitial cystitis (IC)](https://www.ichelp.org/about-ic/causes-of-ic/), or [painful bladder syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-interstitial-cystitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), is a condition that causes a constant sensation of having to pee, or bladder pressure, even when there is no infection present. Recurrent UTI and IC are a significant source of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) and [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) for women, as they can cause almost constant pain and an inability to leave the house due to the constant urge to urinate. UTI in men is not as common as UTI in women. The more common cause of frequent urination in men is [benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bph-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), in which an enlarged prostate presses on the urinary organs, blocking the flow of urine, and causing backup that can lead to bacterial [urinary tract infection men](https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/urinary-tract-infection-in-men-a-to-z). Sometimes what feels like a UTI might be something else. Growths in the pelvic area, such as ovarian cysts, [uterine fibroids](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-leiomyoma-of-the-uterus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or tumors can cause pressure in the bladder, bladder pain, or urinary frequency at night. Even when there is no infection, there may urinary symptoms such as: - Strong urge to pee frequently (more than 8 times per day) - Difficulty urinating - Urine is different color than usual - Pain during peeing, or burning sensation when peeing - Nocturia, frequent urination at night The conventional medicine answer to UTI is antibiotic treatment, but this is not the only answer for everyone. TCM methods of acupuncture and herbs can help with improving the function of bladder and kidney systems, reducing symptoms from recurrent UTIs, as well as helping to address the deeper problems that cause inflammation and pressure in the bladder. Top 10 Urinary Frequency Causes There are many possible causes of [frequent urination](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15533-urination--frequent-urination). - UTI (urinary tract infection, also called cystitis, or bladder infection) - Kidney infection - when bacteria move further up into the urinary tract, the [kidneys](https://www.kidneyfund.org/kidney-disease/kidney-problems/kidney-infection.html)can become infected. Sometimes people with [nerve damage](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)in the spine cannot feel UTI symptoms (neurogenic bladder), so the infection becomes more widespread. [Bladder stones](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20354339)- when the bladder does not empty completely, urine can crystallize and form hard stones, causing pain during urination. - Interstitial cystitis (painful bladder syndrome) - a syndrome of urinary pain symptoms, the exact cause of which is unknown. Inflammation of the bladder lining may be due to trauma (from surgery or delivery/birth), overdistension, or dysfunction of the pelvic floor muscles. - Prostatitis - inflammation of the prostate accompanied by irritation of the nerves in the area; not necessarily an infection, although a bacterial infection of the prostate can occur. - Urinary incontinence - leakage of urine, occurs when the urethral sphincter that controls the flow and stoppage of urine is weak. More common in women and older people. - Vaginitis - inflammation of the vagina, usually due to infection. [Candida, or yeast infection](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-candida-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), is one type of vaginitis. - Diabetes - can cause a variety of urinary problems, due to the body producing more urine to process blood sugar, and nerve damage that leads to urinary retention and incontinence. Constant thirst is also a sign of diabetic urinary symptoms. - Side effects of [cancer treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/)in pelvic area - [cancer treatments](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/urination-changes)that affect the pelvis, including radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and surgeries to remove pelvic organs, can all cause irritation or damage to the bladder. - Overactive bladder (OAB) - a group of symptoms, including frequent urination, leakage, nocturia (getting up to pee at night), and primarily, a strong urge to urinate often. Considered to be caused by inappropriate signalling of the nerves that communicate between the brain and the urinary tract organs. Causes of frequent urination vary somewhat according to biological sex. Frequent urination in men is often caused by prostate problems, while frequent urination in women may be due to pregnancy or other womens' health conditions related to the ovaries or uterus. Pressure on the bladder because of pregnancy, or from other organs, can also cause urinary frequency and discomfort. This can happen due to an anterior prolapse, when the pelvic floor is weakened, and the uterus, intestine, or bladder drop from their normal position. When a woman is pregnant, the heavy uterus often causes more frequent urination, or, in some cases, urinary retention. Damage or trauma to the pelvic floor can occur during delivery, so many women experience weak pelvic floor muscles, prolapsed uterus or bladder, and ongoing urinary urgency after they have had a baby. In men, an enlarged prostate or [prostatitis](https://www.urologyhealth.org/urology-a-z/p/prostatitis-(infection-of-the-prostate)) (infection and inflammation of the prostate) can put pressure on the bladder and other parts of the urinary system. A frequent need to pee can also be caused by drinking too much coffee or alcohol, or taking diuretics. Can Acupuncture Help Frequent Urination? In Chinese Medicine, urinary problems come under the classification of \"Lin Syndromes.\" Lin disorders generally involve painful, \"dribbling\" urination and are caused by disharmonies in the Bladder and Kidneys, as well as involving other major organs like the Heart, Liver, and Spleen. Dampness and Heat are the primary pathogenic factors, so we use acupuncture treatment and herbal formulations to clear heat and dampness from the body. Top 5 TCM differentiations of UTI: - Damp Heat - characterized by frequent urination, burning sensation when peeing, painful pressure in bladder, dark urine or cloudy urine that smells unusual, feelings of nausea, bitter taste in mouth - Heart Fire - frequency and urgency, thirst, hot, red face and chest, trouble sleeping/insomnia, irritability, anxiety, [heart palpitations](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Liver Fire - excess heat causes painful burning during urination, headaches, [ringing in ears/tinnitus,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/)constipation, feelings of anger and frustration, redness in eyes and face. - Fatigue Lin - covers urinary disorders that involve incomplete emptying of the bladder, due to prostate enlargement or prolapsed pelvic organs. - Stone Lin - obstructions of the urinary system due to buildup of minerals that create stones in the bladder, [kidney stones](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-kidney-stones-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), etc. Patients who have problems with recurring UTIs may be resistant to the antibiotics they've been given. TCM herbs can be used as an additional or alternative remedy from antibiotics and help to strengthen the immune system overall. [One review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6481503/) of studies involving the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for UTIs concluded that the herbs, whether used alone or in conjunction with antibiotics, worked better than antibiotics alone. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447293/) showed that women who were prone to getting UTIs who were treated with acupuncture as preventative care only got a UTI one-third as often as women who didn't receive acupuncture. Acupuncture has also [been shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28326514/) to be highly effective for bladder pain due to interstitial cystitis. Studies have also shown that [TCM treatment](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1823-acupuncture-restores-urine-flow-blocked-by-enlarged-prostate) can relieve the blockage of urine caused by an enlarged prostate (BPH). Top 5 Tips for Preventing UTI What a relief! Now that you've gotten over that urinary tract infection, it's important to take steps to prevent getting another UTI. Here are some natural ways to prevent UTIs: - Drink more water - This may seem counterintuitive, as you don't want to have to pee even more. But you do want to be constantly flushing bacteria out of the urinary tract. Avoid drinks like coffee and soda, which can be irritating to the bladder. - Go when you feel you need to - Some therapies for overactive bladder or IC involve training yourself to hold urine, but for most people, this is not a good idea. Retaining urine for too long contributes to bacterial growth and causes overdistension of the bladder. - Hygiene - be sure to wipe from front to back when you go to the bathroom. Change clothes and underwear often, especially after sweating. During your menstrual period, change your pad and tampon frequently. - After sex - always go to the bathroom and urinate before falling asleep. - Avoid chemical products - Avoid using deodorants, douches, or scented wipes around the genital area. Consider whether contraceptive products like spermicides might also be part of the problem. Acupuncture Near Me for UTI While it is rare for a UTI to become so serious that you have a fever or become nauseated, urinary problems should be taken seriously before they become worse. If your UTIs keep coming back, or you constantly feel like you have to pee, it may be a sign that there is something deeper going on. As people age, urge incontinence, prolapsed organs due to weak pelvic floor muscles, and nerve damage can lead to more serious bladder problems. TCM provides a holistic way to treat urinary tract issues, as well as other, possibly hidden conditions in the pelvic region. Urinary urgency may be a signal of something else, so don't ignore it. Consult with your acupuncturist to find urinary frequency relief. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ The Ultimate Guide to the Acupuncture Point on Head for Headaches ](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) by Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Why does the TCM doctor always put an acupuncture needle in top of head? If you've had acupuncture before, it's likely that your acupuncturist used some acupuncture points on head during your treatments. Using pressure points on the head is something TCM doctors do often, because there are so many useful acupressure points on the head, especially acupuncture points top of head. There are head pressure points for [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), points to relieve [migraines](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), acupressure head points to help anxiety, fatigue, allergies, and many other conditions. Even if you're coming in for acupuncture to help some other condition, whether it's chronic pain, an autoimmune disease, heart problems, or kidney problems, probably at some point your acupuncture practitioner is going to use acupoints on head to help you relax during your treatment. Every single person who comes into our office for acupuncture is suffering from some form of stress, and using [certain points on the top of the head](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2016/4943204/) can help with [stress relief](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) right away. Other common reasons to use pressure points in neck and head include: - to fight [fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - headache and migraine - allergies, [asthma](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-asthma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), problems, [common cold](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-the-common-cold-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - anxiety [nervous disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3833481/) - thyroid disorders - hormone imbalances - more [mental focus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), improved memory and Meniere's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [toothache, dental pain, dental anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Why are pressure points on the head so powerful? To answer this question, let us explain a bit about the meridian system in TCM. TCM Meridian Head Points TCM is based on interdependent systems of organs and [energy channels](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2014/836392/) that run through the body. The channels are known as meridians, and along them flows Qi, the life energy that animates the body and all of its functions. There are 12 major meridians and 8 major vessels; the meridians are close to the surface of the skin, and the vessels, which essentially connect all the meridians, are deeper inside the body. While the way in which we think of the [meridian pathways](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2005290110600143) is more metaphorical than physical in nature, they can be considered roughly analogous to the circulatory system of blood vessels or the network of nerves of the nervous system as we think of them in conventional Western medicine. Along the meridians lie acupoints, specific points that we stimulate with acupuncture needles during acupuncture treatment or with the fingers and thumbs during acupressure massage. The interconnectedness of the organs, meridians, and individual points is the foundation of acupuncture theory. We use specific points on a meridian in order to address issues in a particular organ or organ system that corresponds (energetically) with that meridian. There are several pressure points for head and neck pain, points to help relieve allergies, pressure points for frontal headache, and more. Several of the major meridians originate or end in the head: - Gall Bladder (GB) meridian - points of the gall bladder meridian wrap around the side of the head, the forehead above the eyebrow, the temple, around the ear, and down the back side of the neck-just as the pain of a migraine often does. Then it continues down from the intersection of the neck and shoulder, zig-zagging across the torso, and finally running down the leg and ending in the fourth toe. This meridian is used to treat severe headaches, stress, tension that affects the shoulder and neck, and bile-related problems. - Large Intestine (LI) meridian - begins at the points of the index finger, travels up the arm, through the shoulder and neck, then comes up to the lower corner of the nose. This meridian is involved in \"letting go,\" both from the eliminatory organs of the lower body, and exhalations from the nose. - Stomach (ST) meridian - the ST meridian starts near the eye, swoops up to the side of the top of the head, comes down next to the mouth, and continues down through the neck, chest, center of the body, down the leg, ending at the point of the second toe. [This meridian](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/stomach-meridian)is used to treat Shen (spirit) disorders, like insomnia, anxiety, palpitations, memory problems, and blood deficiency. - Small intestine (SI) meridian - originates in the little finger, runs up the arm into the shoulder and then branches out, some of it going into the major organs of the heart, stomach, and small intestine; then other branches go up into the face, by the cheekbone and right in front of the center of the ear. The SI is used to treat fevers and mental health conditions, among other things. - Bladder (UB) Meridian - begins at the inner canthus of the eyes, goes up and over the top of the head, about an inch away from the midline on either side, and then all the way down the back and leg, ending in the little toe. Used to help with invasion disorders (wind, cold, heat etc.) that affect the eyes, sinus headaches, allergies, [stuffy head](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-the-common-cold-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [neck pain and stiffness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Triple burner meridian, also known as San Jiao (SJ) - begins at the tip of the ring finger, then goes up the arm, through the shoulder and chest, up the side of the neck and comes up around the ear, and into the temple and outer brow bone. The San Jiao head points are used to work on dizziness, headaches, eye twitching, and [dental pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Conception vessel - also known as the Functional Channel, or the Front Channel, or Ren Mai, this vessel originates at the navel, then drops down to the perineal area, and runs back up the center of the front of the body, ending in a point on the chin, in the dip just under the lower lip. This vessel controls the Yin energy of the body and is essential to the health of the reproductive organs and [fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Governing vessel, also known as the Extraordinary vessel, the \"Sea of Yang\" or Du Mai - originates in the lower back near the kidneys, runs up the spine and around and over the top of the head, ending in the middle of the face. This vessel controls the Yang energy of the body, and in particular the kidneys, the back and spine. Top 10 Acupuncture Points on Head Of course, your acupuncturist will not only use acupoints on your head during a treatment session. We choose a variety of points that will work together to alleviate symptoms and help optimize the functioning of the organs. These specific head points may be used as part of a treatment to work on a specific symptom or condition: - Yin Tang, or the \"Hall of Impression\" - this is what is called an \"extraordinary point,\" meaning it doesn't really belong to a meridian; it stands on its own. Right in the third eye, it is used to reduce anxiety, [vertigo (dizziness)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), help promote better sleep, clear wind and congestion, and relieve sinus pain and headache. - DU21 - [Shen Ting](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Points/DU+24+(GV+24)/370), \"Spirit Court\" - Right in the front middle of the top of the head, about an inch above the hairline. This is one of the pressure points for frontal headache, also good for sinusitis, nosebleeds, anxiety, [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and sleep problems. - DU 20 - Baihui, or \"The meeting of the 100s\" - right in the very center of the top of the head, master of endocrine and nervous system, used for [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), fatigue, mental focus, relaxation, hypothyroid, adrenal problems, hormone imbalance, headaches. - Si Shen Chong - \"Four Alert Spirit\" - this is actually a set of four \"extraordinary points,\" which surround DU20. Very helpful for sleep disorders, [memory disorders](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), dizziness, and headaches. - GB20 - Feng Chi, \"Wind Pool,\" low back of the head, where the skull meets the neck muscles, helps headaches, migraine, [blurred vision](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-glaucoma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), fatigue, neck pain and stiffness. We may use this point when a patient has [a cold](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-the-common-cold-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/); this is a point where cold wind can get into the body, and why it is important to wear a scarf to protect your neck when it's cold and windy out. - Taiyang \"Great Sun\" - Right in the depression of the temple, this point can help dizziness, one-sided headaches, migraines, sensitivity to light, and jaw pain, TMJ. - GV26 Shui Gou - in the mustache area, between the nose and mouth, right in the center of the crease, this point helps to calm the mind and restore mental focus. Also used as first aid when a person faints or is in shock. Helps stop hiccups. Helps with serious neurological disorders like [epilepsy, seizures](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seizures-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Also good for low back strain. - LI20 Ying Xiang \"Welcome Fragrance\" - located in the lower corner of the nose, right in the nasolabial groove, used to alleviate congestion, allergy itching in the nose, and to clear the nasal passages. - ST8 - Touwei, about 5 finger widths above the eyebrow, dispels dampness, used for \"splitting headaches,\" frontal headache, migraines, headache with nausea and/or vomiting, vision problems, tearing eyes, eye twitching, dizziness/vertigo, hair loss. Helps with mental health, when a person is \"overthinking\" things, or having repetitive thoughts. - BL2 - Zhanzhu - located at the inner corner of the eyebrow, good for itchy, watery eyes due to allergies, other eyes problems like glaucoma, night blindness, and sinus headache. Facial Acupuncture Points As we have mentioned, some pressure [points on the face](https://www.healthline.com/health/pressure-points-for-face) are used to help relieve sinus congestion, nasal congestion, and other issues related to common colds and flus or allergies. Points on the face may also be used to help the [facial paralysis](http://koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201517058945069.page) of [Bell's Palsy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bells-palsy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or [TMJ jaw pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Naturally, we also use acupuncture points on the face as acupuncture points for the face, that is, when we are striving for facial rejuvenation. This technique is sometimes called an acupuncture facial. Using points on the face can help to stimulate collagen production, help to tighten the skin, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and strengthen the facial muscles. People of all ages and genders can benefit from acupuncture skin care. Cosmetic acupuncture can [treat signs of aging skin](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-aging-skin-with-cosmetic-acupuncture/) like sagging, puffiness under the eyes, and dryness. Self-Care With Acupressure Head Points What is acupressure? Acupressure is a form of massage that goes back thousands of years in Chinese Medicine. Stimulating the same points we needle in acupuncture treatment with your fingers and thumbs can be beneficial for different types of headaches and neck stiffness, to calm anxiety, and bring more mental clarity. Choose a time when your environment is quiet and free of distractions, the same as you would for a meditation practice or home workout. Be sure to breathe deeply and smoothly as you perform self-acupressure. Press firmly, applying deep pressure to a point in a small, gentle circular motion. Giving yourself an acupressure treatment only takes a few minutes, and it is a great way to take care of yourself between acupuncture sessions. Acupuncture Near Me for Headaches and More Every time you come in for acupuncture treatment, your TCM doctor is looking for ways to treat your overall condition, but also focusing on how you are feeling right now, today. Often, people are feeling tired and stressed, beyond and in addition to the health condition that caused them to seek out alternative medicine in the first place. Using points on the head that help fatigue, calm a racing mind, and reduce the physical effects of stress is one way that your acupuncturist is practicing preventative care, while at the same time, making sure you leave your treatment feeling rested and reenergized. The next time you come in for a visit, be sure to let us know how you're feeling, and feel free to ask us, \"What is that point on my head for?\" *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Hip Pain With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hip-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Are you suffering from hip pain symptoms like lower back and hip pain on one side, pain in buttocks shooting down leg, hip pain at night, or hip pain when walking? Several different conditions can cause pain in the hip or pain in the buttocks that radiates down the leg. It could be hip pain due to bursitis or [arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or related to [sciatic nerve pain](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sciatica/symptoms-causes/syc-20377435) or piriformis syndrome. TCM and acupuncture treatment can help relieve pain in the hip, buttocks, and [lower back](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lower-back-pain-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). The hip joint is very complex; it's made up of a ball-and-socket bone structure with almost 30 different muscles and tendons surrounding it. Hip pain is common, especially among older adults, although people of any age can be affected by pain in the hip, buttocks, or lower back. It can be difficult to pinpoint the causes of hip pain, as there are many different possible reasons for hip pain, and the aching sensation can move from place to place, or suddenly become more intense. The hip pain location, the quality of the pain, and when it happens can tell us a lot about what is causing pain in the buttock or hip area, so it is important to pay close attention to the type of hip pain. For example, is it sudden hip pain? Hip pain gets worse at night? Is the hip pain worse after sitting for long periods? What does arthritis in the hip pain feel like? Hip pain that develops slowly over a period of time may be due to osteoarthritis. Other signs of osteoarthritis of the hip include: - Hip pain worse in the morning, feel better after moving around. - Grinding sensation, ache, stiffness, soreness, sometimes, hip feels locked up. - Hip pain that gets worse when start to exercise, but usually gets better once warm up, and worse again after excessive exercise. - Pain that goes from the hip down to the knee or across the back This is the type of arthritic hip pain that comes on with age and many years of use, as the cartilage that cushions the hip joint wears down over time. [Osteoarthritis of the hip](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/osteoarthritis-of-the-hip/) can be more painful when it rains. Left untreated, hip osteoarthritis can cause people to lose mobility and even walk with a limp. Sharp hip pain or tenderness when you lie on your side or sit down may be due to hip bursitis. - Hip pain worse at night - Hip pain stiff when getting up - Difficulty walking, hard to squat or sit - General ache all over the back, groin, hip area Bursitis is inflammation of the small, fluid-filled sacs that provide cushioning around large joints like the hip. The outer part of the hip bone is topped by the [trochanteric bursa](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4964-trochanteric-bursitis); when this bursa becomes inflamed, due to a bump or fall, overuse, or some other injury, it can cause pain on the outside of the hip or buttock area. Gradually worsening hip pain, or feeling stiff and sore in the morning can be a sign of hip flexor tendonitis or [tendinitis of the hip](https://www.beaumont.org/conditions/hip-tendonitis). This is caused by inflammation of the tendons and connective tissues in the hip, usually due to high intensity sports activities. A shooting pain that seems to radiate down from the hip to the leg and even the foot is often a sign of sciatica, a kind of nerve pain. The sciatic nerves extend from the lower spine and branch out into the buttocks and down the legs. When the sciatic nerve is compressed, it can cause numbness, tingling, pins and needles, or radiating pain to shoot from the buttock down one leg. Other [sciatica symptoms](https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/sciatica/sciatica-symptoms) can include: - intermittent pain that comes and goes - weakness in one leg - sharp pain that feels like a jolt - burning pain in buttock, burning pain in one leg - pain that is worse when bending or standing Sciatic pain can happen due to impingement or a pinched nerve from a [herniated disk](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-a-herniated-disc-with-acupuncture-tcm/) in the lower spine (lumbar herniated disk), or other spinal problems like spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spine that compresses nerves) or spondylolisthesis (slipped disc). Radiating pain in the buttock that is similar to sciatic pain can also be caused by problems with the soft tissues of the buttock, especially the piriformis muscle. Inflammation, spasms, or tightness in the piriformis muscle can cause compression of the sciatic nerve, which runs just underneath, or in some cases, through the piriformis. This condition is known as [piriformis syndrome](https://www.spineuniverse.com/conditions/sciatica/how-tell-if-your-sciatica-actually-piriformis-syndrome). Moderate hip pain is usually treated with medications and/or injections to relieve pain and reduce inflammation, along with perhaps a referral to physical therapy (PT) to help strengthen the muscles of the hip. Severe hip pain that persists beyond treatment with PT and medication may lead to surgery as a last resort. In many cases, [TCM methods including](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=32442) acupuncture can help relieve the pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis, sciatica, bursitis, tendonitis, and other causes of hip pain, without the [side effects of medications](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-dependence-on-hydrocodone-and-other-opioid-pain-medication-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or complications of hip surgery. Top 10 Hip Pain Causes Pain in the hip and buttock on one side, pain in the butt, or hip pain can be related to one or more of a variety of conditions affecting the hip joint, the lumbar spine, or the soft tissues of the hip and buttock area. Causes of hip pain can include: - Arthritis hip pain or Osteoarthritis of the hip - arthritis is a general term for joint pain. Pain in the hip joint can occur due to constant wear-and-tear over the course of many years, leading to inflammation in the hip joint and the breakdown of cartilage. - Bursitis outer hip pain - swelling and inflammation of the hip bursae - Sciatica in hip - nerve pain due to compression of the sciatic nerve - Piriformis syndrome - inflamed or tight muscles in the buttocks compress the sciatic nerve, causing pain or numbness in the buttock, hip, and leg - Hip Tendonitis - trauma or use injury to the connective tissues of the hip joint - Sacroiliac joint pain or SI joint pain - the sacroiliac joints connect the hip bones to the lower spine and tailbone. This joint is designed to move subtly; too much or too little movement can cause dysfunction and pain across the low back and hips. It is fairly common for women to experience some SI joint pain (and also sciatica) during pregnancy. - Muscle strain - if one of the large muscles that makes up the hip joint is stretched past its usual range of motion, [hip strain](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/hip-strains/)can cause pain and swelling. This can happen during normal daily activities, but most often happens during sports or exercise, possibly if someone has not warmed up adequately. [Hip dysplasia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hip-dysplasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350209)or Dislocated hip - some people are born with anatomical abnormalities of the hip joint, when the socket part of the joint doesn't fully fit around the ball part. This can lead to instability in the hip, dislocation of the hip, damage to cartilage, pain in the groin and hip, and higher risk of osteoarthritis. - Hip fracture - fractures in the hip are common among older people, women especially. A hairline [hip fracture](https://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/what-happens-when-you-have-a-hip-fracture)or broken hip may cause a vague pain in the lower back, pain in groin, or pain down the leg or knee pain. Hip fractures can lead to other serious problems, like blood clots, infections like UTIs, or pneumonia. - Hip Labral Tear - a labrum is a piece of cartilage that absorbs shock and helps the functioning of the major joints of the body in various ways. You may have heard of a labral tear in the shoulder that causes [shoulder pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shoulder-pain-by-acupuncture-and-tcm/); [hip labral tear](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/bones-joints-and-muscles/hip-labral-tear.html)is similar. This could mean overall degeneration of the cartilage, or the labrum becoming detached from the bone, or the formation of a cyst around the area. Injury to the labrum of the hip can cause pain deep in the groin. How Is Hip Pain Treated? Hip pain is usually treated initially with anti-inflammatory pain relief medications like NSAIDs. Cortisone injections may also be recommended for conditions like bursitis or hip tendonitis. While cortisone shots for hip pain may help relieve pain in the short-term, repeated injections can cause damage to the area. Cortisone can also raise blood sugar levels, which can be dangerous for people who have diabetes or are at risk for diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Arthroscopic surgical techniques allow orthopedic surgeons to operate on the hip joint in a minimally-invasive way. This may be done to repair a torn labrum or remove loose cartilage. More complex surgery may be indicated to repair hip dysplasia or serious degeneration due to osteoarthritis. [Hip replacement surgery](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/treatment/total-hip-replacement/) is becoming more common, with over 450,000 total hip replacements currently being performed each year in the U.S. While many people are able to get relief from chronic hip pain through hip replacement, it is a major decision, and there are significant risks involved, including: infections, fractures that occur during the surgery, nerve damage, etc. The risk of blood clots after a hip replacement necessitates taking blood thinners. Even under the best circumstances, the prosthetics that are implanted during a hip replacement do not last forever, and some people may have to have a second operation to replace the replacement. Acupuncture treatment can help to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain in the hip due to osteoarthritis and other complaints, without the risks of long-term pain medication use. Can Acupuncture Help Hip Pain? According to TCM theory, [arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) of the hip is considered a Bi Syndrome, a condition in which stagnation of blood and Qi (life force energy) causes pain and stiffness in the muscles and joints. Cold, wind, and heat are pathogenic factors that cause the blockage of energy moving freely through parts of the body. Imbalances in the organs, such as the kidneys, gallbladder, spleen, and stomach can also contribute to Bi Syndrome hip pain. Standard approaches that seek to alleviate pain do not help treat the problem at the source. A TCM practitioner can address the root source of the blockage and pain with acupuncture and herbal supplementation. Sciatica nerve pain that affects the buttock, hip, and leg is also considered to be a Bi Syndrome condition, and is due to obstructions in the flow of Qi through the gallbladder and bladder meridians. Acupuncture treatment helps [relieve nerve pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4575738/) by acting as an analgesic, reducing pain signals and increasing the production of endorphins in the body, while reducing inflammation in the surrounding tissues and helping the nerves to heal. [One study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1535-acupuncture-relieves-sciatica-reduces-inflammation) of patients suffering sciatic pain who were treated with TCM found that acupuncture alone had an 81.6% efficacy rate for reducing pain symptoms, while acupuncture combined with herbs was 95% effective. A [follow-up](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1003525719300777) with patients who had been treated with acupuncture for sciatica related to herniated disc showed that people had experienced long-term positive results. Tendonitis of the hip and hip bursitis are inflammatory conditions that can also be helped with acupuncture and herbs. A [review](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1136/acupmed-2016-011332) of acupuncture treatment for pain related to herniated disc concluded that TCM methods worked better than pain medication or traction therapy. An experienced TCM practitioner will also be able to help you with making changes in your diet and exercise programs that will reduce inflammation while strengthening both your Qi and the muscles of your lower back and hip joints. Top 5 Tips for Hip Pain Here are some steps you can take to get rid of hip pain and prevent it from coming back, in addition to getting acupuncture treatment and taking Chinese herbs: - If lower back pain and hip pain is due to sciatic nerve pain, pinched nerves, or disc problems/herniated disk, it is still important to keep moving your body.
