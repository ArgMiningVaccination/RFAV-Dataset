(e -mail: nandkku@yahoo.com ) Status of regulation on traditional medicine formulations and natural products: Whither Ministry of AYUSH, Gover nment of India , New Delhi 110 023 , India The Indian traditional medicine (TM) has a rich her i- tage of science healing humans and animals. While so much attention is being paid to regulation of biomed i- cine (BM) practice and research, the same is desirable for TM too. The ex isting guidelines and regulations related to natural products/herbal formulations should be implemented to integrate BM and TM in a meaningful way for patient -centric treatment, as this would add to the Government's endeavo ur to improve public health. Regi stration of pract itioners, setting up of statutory bodies controlling education , including prescription of standard texts and syllabus, pharm a- copoeia, research, and related guidelines and Acts would serve as standards for evaluating the status of these sys tems in modern times. Keywords: Herbal formulations, human experiment a- tion, natural products, public health, t raditional medicine. Introduction IN the centuries preceding India's independence (1947), the Mughals and the British culturally and socially inf lu- enced the Indian subcontinent. This had also affected the medical systems existing during that period. The Mughals brought in the Unani system of medicine to India, which got indigenized, whereas the British, by the 18th CE, sy s- tematically relegated the Indian traditional medicine (TM), namely Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani to the bac k- ground and promoted their reductionist biomedicine (allopathy) for healthcare deliverance1. Politically, in the post-independence era, attempts were made to restore TM to its r ightful place , but executed at a slow pace. The announcement by the present Government about the cre a- tion of a separate Ministry for AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) on 9 November 2014, with an Act separate from Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 bodes a brighter future for these systems. Registration of practitioners, setting up of stat u- tory bodies controlling education , including prescription of standard texts and syllabus, pharmacopoeia, research and related guidelines and Acts would serve as standards for evaluating the status of these systems in modern times. As biomedicine (BM) is unable to offer desirable relief in certain diseases , there is a growing interest in finding a solution through an integrative approach by tapping the strength of TM and BM. The concept of int e- grated a pproach is gaining importance due to growing focus on the necessity to provide patient -oriented trea t- ment which may involve more than one medical system. This thinking is reflected in changing of the name of the National Centre for Complementary and Alternate Med i- cine (NCCAM), under the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA to (NCCIM ) in December 2014. In India too, for certain diseases of public health importance, there is a need to adopt an in tegrated approach using TM and BM. TM is used as household remedy in many parts of India and therefore considered safe for self -care due to its 'na t- ural' status2. But limited quality control and uncontrolled over the counter (OTC) usage ha ve led to its misuse. For global acceptance, eviden ce is required for claiming saf ety and effectiveness of TM formulations. Therefore, capac ity building is necessary to maintain international quality a s- surance and quality control standards in terms of good labo- ratory practices (GLP) and good manufacturing practices (GMP). Appropriate amendment of legislation and regul a- tory framework for TM should also include Indian position on patent and intellectual property rights. The World Cu s- toms Organization, which is technically co nnected to the World Trade Organiz ation, has assisted the erstwhile D e- partment of AYUSH in reviewing its guidelines and prot o- cols. It is also important to provide appropr iate training to the practitioners of TM to modernize or modify their sy s- tem by applying recent advances according to co ntextual need. In the following sections , develo pment of the above - mentioned standards in TM compared to BM will be hi s- torically traced mainly from the British India p eriod. Registration The British Government's intention to separate BM from Ayurveda could be evidenced in all geographical regions SPECIAL SECTION: INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 111, NO. 2, 25 JULY 2016 294 of India , where it had a major stake in medical education. In 1835, it formally separated teaching of BM from A y- urveda by establishing the second English -medium bi o- medicine institution, namely Calcutta Medical Co llege3, the first one being in Pondicherry. This i ntention was echoed when in 1909, the Bombay Medical Congress d e- clared that it would serve to address Medical Registr ation Act, a Druggist Act and formulation of regulations for qualification of practitioners . This was aimed to stop practice of dual systems - BM and Ayurveda - by pract i- tioners registered under the former system. In 1938, Bombay Practitioner Act led to separate registration for Ayurvedic practitioners. Before this Act, allopath phys i- cians could practice Ayurveda if they had knowledge of that science , but the Act served to discourage integrated therapy. This step perhaps resulted in creating two streams of training in medicine, one based on Western or BM, and the other based on Indian (native) me dicine. Medical registration, which gave legitimacy to medical practitioners for recognition, was denied under the Madras Medical Registration Act, 1914, to Indian medi- cine practitioners who served about 80% of the popul a- tion. Their registration as Licen tiate of Indian Medicine (Licentiate Medical Practitioners) by Government Indian Medical School became sort of 'B' class , as those with no instit utional training were also included in this class. This Act clearly reflected the then imperialistic cultural t hink- ing of the British3. Although the Hakims protested against this step, they suggested measures to cure certain diseases affecting public health, namely m alaria, plague and snake bite to the sanitary commission and Indian Medical Services (British organi zation). U nfortunately, this made the British categorize them as businessmen with 'some medical training' and not as community - based practitioners4. Education Although the British tried to separate BM from TM, there were British officers who believed in in tegration of the systems. Pardie Leucas, Director of Medical Services in British India, was one such person who was responsible for setting up the Government School of Indian Medicine in 1925, because he believed in integration of BM and Ayurveda to addres s public health issues5. In 1925, Madan Mohan Malaviya established an Ayurveda Co l- lege in Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi, for integrated education. K. N. Udupa, an Ayurveda graduate with postgraduate degree in BM, further strengthened this conce pt at BHU, which is continuing to this day. The other reputed institution, Gujarat Ayurved University has also been toeing this progressive line of teaching and research. In the post -independence India, Leucas' concept of integration secularized teaching of TM with integr a- tion of subjects from BM. However, there needs to be i n-tegration at some level between BM and TM curric ula to enable integrated therapy for patient -oriented trea tment. This model is followed in countries like China and Vie t- nam, where both streams of medical education are int e- grated at all levels6. At present nothing about TM is included in BM curriculum due to its non -acceptance by the Indian Medical Council, the statutory body for BM education. When foreign institutions and researchers ar e interested in learning about TM even in a capsulated or condensed form, it is unfortunate that such a move is not allowed in BM at undergraduate or postgraduate level. Neither is cross -practice of TM drugs allowed even if the physician may believe in its therapeutic value, on account of lack of training in that discipline. But, cross practice by TM practitioners is legally allowed in some states like Maharastra in the country on the plea that there is a lack of BM physicians in areas where health needs of the pu b- lic have to be catered to. There have been continuous protests by BM physicians in these states on this issue. In some other states this extension of services of BM is denied to TM physicians on the grounds that they are not trained in that strea m. The graduates and registered practitioners in TM far outnumber those from BM. Instead of running the two systems as parallel entities, complementary collabor a- tions in health deliverance could work better for impro v- ing health of the population. The Central Council for Indian Med icine (CCIM) set up in 1970 through Indian Medicine Central Council Act controls TM education to which the Sowa Rigpa system of medicine (traditional Tibetan medicine) was added in 2012. If research is to be addressed in the same man ner as for BM, CCIM should take initiative to add appropriate subjects in the curric u- lum of TM with extensive training in methodologies by the reputed national institutions of TM. Similarly, BM should be strengthened by creating awareness of TM sc i- ence at appropriate level s of education. This will be r e- quired to make both systems work in a complementary manner. Pharmacopoeia A 'formulary' is a document which compiles the list of drugs/treatment s for a particular condition or disease and information regardin g the authentic formulations as d e- scribed in the authoritative texts of Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani medicine mentioned in the First Schedule of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. A ' pharmacopeia' di f- fers from this, as it describes standards for a particular formulation/drug regarding its identity, purity and strength. Probably, the first compilation of drugs in India was in 1563, by Garcia da Orta, a Portuguese. In 1833, the East India Company's Dispensary recommended pu blication of the first pharmacopoeia in India. Eleven years later Bengal Pharmacopoeia and General Conspectus of SPECIAL SECTION: INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL . 111, NO. 2, 25 JULY 2016 295 Medicinal Plants (1844) was published7. The first Phar- macopoeia of India by Edward John Waring8 in 1868 covered both British pharmacopeia (BP) and a few i n- digenous drugs. A supplem ent in 1869 included vernac u- lar names of the latter. In 1885, BP was made official in India, which included indigenous medicinal plants but not formulations of Indian medicine. A Drug Enquiry Co m- mittee appointed in 1927 by the Government with Col. R. N. Ch opra as the chairperson, recommended the public a- tion of a National Pharmacopoeia. The first publication was an Indian pharmacopeial list in 1946, which described standards for BM drugs and indigenous m e- dicinal plants in use. The first Indian pharmacopoeia was released in 1955 under the chairmanship of B. N. Ghosh. Attention on quality control of formulations of Indian medicine for uniform manufacturing standards gained ground with the setting up of Ayurveda Pharmacop oeia Committee by the Government in 1962 . This work was later shifted to the Central Council for Research in A y- urveda and Siddha in 2006 (now renamed as the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences). Similarly , Siddha Pharmacop oeia Committee and Unani Pharmac o- poeia Committee were set u p to document standards for their formulations. These along with respective formula r- ies have been added to the First Schedule of Drugs & Cosmetics Act (DCA) , listing the authoritative books (54 of Ayurveda , including formulary and pharmacop oeia, 29 of Sidd ha with form and 12 of Unani with formulary and pharmacop oeia) of these systems. Guidelines for research When the British set up the Indian Research Fund Ass o- ciation (IRFA) in 1911, there were no guidelines issued for conducting biomedical research. E ven at that early stage Col. Chopra, the ' father of Indian pharm acology', received funding from IRFA for research on i ndigenous drugs9. In 1949, IRFA became the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). After the release of the Bel- mont Report (1979) on et hical principles pertaining to human research, ICMR set a similar tone by issuing the first ethical guidelines, namely ' policy statement on ethi- cal considerations involved in research on human sub- jects'10 in 1980. Recognizing the need for research in TM, a short paragraph was included on it directing that '...clinical evaluation of plants being utilized for ther a- peutic purpo ses, assessment of treatments being used in the traditional systems of medicine the protocols for such clinical research should again b e approved by ethical committee of the institute'. There is no need for clearance to be obtained from the Drugs Controller of India for such trials of products already in widespread use in the traditional system of medicine today in the country10. This gui dance for research was stated at a time when there were very few existing in the world. While BM demanded evidence to prove efficacy of a therapy, the Indian systems did not advocate it due to firm belief in their time -tested therapies. Therefore, the dif ferent med i- cal systems continued to work as separate streams wit h- out any inclination to collaborate till the 1960s. Presently, senior Ayurveda and BM physicians are of the opinion that contemporary Ayurveda could gain if research is done to study its 'syst ems biology' using some reductio n- ist p arameters from contemporary science to validate its fundamental concepts11. However, clinical trials would continue to be initiated for validating claims of TM fo r- mulations or their innovative mixtures as remedy for diseases, which do not have a satisfactory treatment in BM. This would also help create a body of literature for Western researchers to explore the possibility of research on fundamental or therapeutic aspects of TM. Very few systematic reviews are possible because of lack of publ i- cation of research in peer -reviewed journals. The revised ICMR guidelines expanded guidance for research on TM/medicinal plants or herbo -mineral prep a- rations in 2000 (ref. 12) and subsequently in 2006 (ref. 13) in consultation wit h the Research Councils of A y- urveda, Siddha, Unani, and Yoga and Naturopathy under the then Depar tment of ISM (Indian Systems of Medicine set up in 1995, which later became Department of AYUSH in 2003). Four sets of issues concern research using TM formul a- tions/natural products, namely chemical -manufacturing - control (CMC), non -clinical, clinical and ethical issues depending on the type of formulation to be used - traditional or innovative. From the point of TM investig a- tors and regulatory authorities, the approach to study the safety and efficacy of complex mixtures, some of them including minerals/metallic ingredients, should be diffe r- ent from that for BM drugs due to their prior -human use. In ICMR's ethical guidelines of 2000, TM formul ations were divided into three groups for guidance from regul a- tory position. Based on this, WHO accepted the principle of not doing phase I for formulations with substantial evidence of their prior human use. This was clea rly stated in its guidance document of 2005 (ref. 14) . ICMR's r e- vised version of ethical guidelines of 2006 i ncorporated some of the relevant features from this doc ument in the section on 'Clinical evaluation of traditional Ayurveda , Siddha , Unani (ASU) remedies and medicinal plants'. Taking note of both doc uments, the following sections provide feasible base positions for a uniform a pproach to research on TM /herbal or herbo -mineral form ulations. Chemical -manufacturing -control The guidelines or regulations for CMC of TM formul a- tions are not possible in the sa me way as for BM drugs. This is mainly because of the complex nature of plant s or plant product s. If an active pharmaceutical ingred ient/ SPECIAL SECTION: INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 111, NO. 2, 25 JULY 2016 296 principle were to be developed as a single , pure , isolated , plant -based drug or phytopharmaceutical drug, it would have to be treated as a standard synthetic/semi -synthetic drug. This would then fall out of the domain of TM, for example, reserpine for hypertension, artemisinin for malaria, etc. The other important aspect to be considered is that a plant substance or pro duct has at least partially unchara c- terized constituents, which may provide therapeutic advantage by acting synergistically with the known active constituent. The b est example for this is the Indian di s- covery of reserpine from Sarpagandha (Rauwolfia se r- pentina ), the Indian snakeroot, which emerged as an effective anti -hypertensive but it became unpopular because of its m ajor side effect of depression. However, if the extract ha ving the other constituents also is used, this side effect is not seen ; it is used in Ayurveda even today11. Various active principles present in a plant have an inherent balancing mechanism, which is lost when just one active ingredient is purified and isolated to form a new drug. Chemical fingerprinting gives a picture of total in gre- dients - active and inactive or characterized and non - characterized. Some constituents would have a sizable percentage, which serve as useful markers along with chemical fingerprint s as surrogates to analy se unknown constituents contributing to efficacy and help in studying batch -to-batch variation. Procurement and preparation of formulations for clinical trials: The source and identification of plants used in traditional /herbal /herbo -mineral formulations should be documented and collected at the appropriate time as described in the classical texts. The genus and species of the plant should be identified, authent icated and voucher specimens mai ntained. The source of collection should also be recorded. It should be devoid of adulterants, pe s- ticides, herbicides, synthetic drug adulterants, microbials, fungus, heavy metals, toxins and other contaminations. The plant ingredient should be subjected to pharma - cognosy and other relevant analysis in phytochemistry. ICMR guidelines13 provide information on the requir e- ments for herbal substance and herbal product, which are mostly based on WHO's 'Operational guidance: inform a- tion needed to support clinical trials of herbal products document'14. For phase-III trials, it is important to co m- ply with the GMP norms vigorously as the products have the potential to get marketed. Therefore, it should be ensured that the plants are cultivated according to good agricultural practices and harvested according to good wildcrafting practices. Standardization and quality co n- trol of TM formulations to be used for clinical tr ials are a must. It would be ideal to conduct trials using formulations for which raw materials can be obtained easily without depleting the flora. There is no point in validating claims for classical compound formulations of which one or two ingredients are extinct or en dangered species, rare or difficult to access, because if a formulation prepared with such ingredients is found to be successful for a condition , then it will be difficult to maintain the supply chain to meet the market demand. Formulation to be used for clinical trial should be prepared in bulk for utilization during the entire period of trial and if another batch of preparation is required , the batch -to-batch variation should be studied using chemical fingerprinting techniques or other modern tec hnolog ies in order to avoid confounding or ambiguous results. To ju s- tify the beneficial effects during storage, stability and shelf -life studies are required to provide information on the label of marketed product as for BM drugs. Non-clinical issues Plant -based drugs or active principles would be treated as new chemical entities (phytopharmaceuticals) and would first have to undergo in vitro and in vivo animal exper i- ments and then be tried for safety and efficacy in human participants , in that order , before the Drugs Controller General of India approves them for marketing. But when traditional herbal /herbo -mineral formulations are to be tested for validation of their safety and efficacy, the approach has to be modified. This is not to convince the TM practitione rs who already know the action , but to improve the market acceptability. If ASU formulations are to be administered for more than three months , or if toxicity is reported in the litera- ture or a large multicentric phase-III trial is to be co n- ducted, limit ed toxicity studies in two species of animals have been advised in the ICMR guidelines. However, to be on the safe side and for international acceptance, researches prefer to follow Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines for toxicity studies on a nimals. It is important that the formulation to be tested should be according to the classical form made for clinical use or based on SOPs prepared for it. Pharmacokinetics is diff i- cult because of many active ingredients in the formul a- tion. Moreover, human dose w ill depend more on traditional knowledge. Clinical trial issues Traditional use of these systems was acknowledged in the 1980 policy statement of ICMR, which allowed human trials once approval from the ethics committee was obtained. In the revised ICMR gu idelines of 2006 , TM (ASU) formulations have been categorized into three types. Phase -II trials can be conducted for formulations falling under category -I. In such cases, phase-I trials may be required only for exploration of maximum tolerated SPECIAL SECTION: INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL . 111, NO. 2, 25 JULY 2016 297 dose (MTD) t o avoid larger studies if significant adverse reactions were expected to occur , or for dose finding for phase-II trials. Formulations falling under category -II would fall under ' patent & proprietary' (P&P) drugs requiring animal studies before human trial s. These safety requirements were mandated by the Department of AYUSH in 2010 for issuing license to the manufacturers according to Rule 158 -B in the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules, 1945. Formulations falling under cate- gory-III would require animal studies before human tr ials. The guidance document on herbal medicines by WHO has adopted the concept of human trials at phase-II level for traditional formulations for indicated use and also states that regulatory oversight will be required only for category-III formulations for clinical trials14. This reve r- sal of approach, i.e. human trials first for a formul ations in use for a number of years or described in the classical texts for a particular indication was stated in ICMR's first revised guidelines, b ut only in the second revision was this approach specifically mentioned as ' reverse pharm a- cology'. It may , however , be noted that traditional pract i- tioners strengthened their knowledge by first observing human response to their experimental therapy. The Euro- pean physicians too adopted this approach for three cent u- ries since Renaissance by learning from folklore practice15. Under the guidance of G. V. Satyavati, from 1985 o n- wards, reverse pharmacology approach was fo llowed by ICMR while conducting clinical t rials using trad itional remedies in six thrust areas in its disease -oriented pr o- gram me. This program me was supported by ICMR's Ce n- tre of Advance Research at the Regional Research Labora tories (now known as the Indian Institute of Int e- grated Medicine ), Jam mu for standardiz ation and quality control of natural products being used for clinical trials ; Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, for pharm a- cological research (including toxicology) in selected tradi- tional remedies; T. N. Medical College, Mumbai for clinical pharmacology for traditional medicine research ; Seth G. S. Medical College, Mumbai, for studying mech a- nism of a ction, and clinical trial sites across India. Although this pr ogram me led to some positive outcomes, it was phase d out due to crunch of human and financial r esources . Indian good clinical practices (GCP) guidelines, 2001 were issued as standards to be followed when conducting clinical trials using BM drugs. However, in an attempt to bring regulations for TM at par with those relevant to BM, a new document entitled 'Goo d clinical practice guidelines for clinical trials in Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani medicine' was released in 2013 for conduction of clinical trials pertaining to ASU drugs. Ethical issues All the general ethical principles and other applicable principles de scribed in the ICMR guidelines are applic a-ble to all Indian researchers. The first step in the prote c- tion of human participant s is to see the scientific rationale of the r esearch proposal on TM. Designing a trial protocol for evaluating TM formul a- tions is quite complex due to multiple active principles, unique dosing regimens and customized patient -centric nature of therapy. It is also being insisted now by CCRAS that the protocol should include the fundame n- tals of Ayurveda , also have similar spec ificities, which further complicate designing of a clinical trial using available statistical tools, which may not be able to project the biological complexities in an appropr iate manner. However, difficulty in assessing the objective parameters in such trials should not unde r- score the value of the TM formulations /drugs , if these can at least i mprove the overall quality o f life. Any research proposal on TM to be conducted by BM investigators should involve TM investigator too (ICMR guidelines). On account of the complexity of outcome r e- sponses when using TM, it may not be possible to have double -blind randomized control trial (RCT) in all instances, in which case meticulously designed and eth i- cally conducted pilot studies /observational studies are equally credible and informative. Caution has to be exe r- cised regarding selection of dose, toxicity studies, sta n- dardized prod uct procurement with quality control, herb - drug interaction, selection of participants and outcome measures. If a medicine has originated from a community's knowledge, it should be informed of the result and if any commercial value ensues , it should be part of that benefit - sharing. The classical example is the intellectual contr i- bution of Kani tribe of Kerala in the development of Jee- vani, an immune -modulator, o- ricus ) by scientists at the Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute in Kerala. A Trust Fund was created for the welf are of the tribals out of the share due to them - first example in the world of substantial (50%) benefit -sharing16. Ethics committee review of proposals on TM /natural products /herbals is equally applicable as for trials using BM drugs. Care should be taken to have an expert opi n- ion on the proposal from the concerned subject expert. Regulations In 1940, the 'Drugs Bill' became the 'Drugs Act' follo w- ing recommendations of the Chopra Committee17. Rules under this Act were made in 1945 and enforced in 1947. In 1962, this Act was renamed as the 'Drugs and Cosme t- ics Act' (DCA) when cosmetics were brought u nder the purview of the Drugs Act, which came into effect only in 1964 for regulating import, manufacture, distrib ution and SPECIAL SECTION: INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 111, NO. 2, 25 JULY 2016 298 sale of drugs and cosmetics. At this point , defin ition for Ayurveda (including Siddha) and Unani drugs and First Schedule listing authoritative books of ASU as reference were also included in the Act. Further amendments to DCA in 1982 included definition for P&P drugs. From 1983 onwards , ASU formularies and pharmacopeias have been added to the First Schedule from time to time. The class ical ASU drugs cove red under section 3(a) are manufa ctured, named and prescribed in accordance with the formul ations described in the authoritative texts listed in the First Schedule of the DCA and Rules there under, whereas P&P drugs covered under clause 3(h) differ from the classical medicines by being novel combinations based on innovation or experience and involve use of ingredients referred to in the formulations included in the authoritative texts. For such formulations a specific license would be required and a retai l sale license alone does not suffice. Based on 2013 report18, approximately 9000 licensed manufacturing units of ASU exist in the country out of which only 10% units account for 85% of the total sale. Several of these are sold as over -the- counter formulat ions. Implementation of safety and qual ity norms on such a large scale is compromised due to weak enforcement mecha nism. While Chapter IV of the DCA, 1940 deals with BM drugs, section 33B to 33 -O of the Chapter IV A pe rtains to ASU drugs. Potentially pois onous ingredients used in ASU formulations are listed in Schedule E -I of the DCA, 1940. Rule 158 (B) incorporated in the DCA Rules in August 2010 pertains to guidelines for issue of license for manufacture of ASU drugs , including classical and P&P drugs. R ule 161 (B) of Drugs and Cosmetics Rules pe r- tains to label ling requirements addressing the she lf- life/date of expiry of ASU formulations. Rule 168 (B) of DCA Rules pertains to regulation of standards for man u- facture, distribution and sale of ASU formulatio ns to ensure their safety for human consumption. The ASU Drugs Technical Board was reconstituted in April 2015 to advise the Central Government and State Gover nments on technical matters pertaining to ASU drugs. Schedule M of the DCA covers specification s for manufacture of BM drugs, cosmetics, devices and Homoeopathic drugs , whe reas Schedule T covers similar speci fications in context of ASU drugs. Small and m e- dium e ntrepreneurs will not be able to carry out such processes and will need assistance to do so. Care should be taken that the TM formulation for use in a trial should be stric tly prepared according to the standards and quality control r equirements. The other relevant Acts for TM are the Drugs & Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisement) Act (1954), Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Act (1955), Indian Patent and Design Act (1970), Environment Protection Act (1986) , and the Biological Diversity Act (2002). It is increasingly being felt that leads from research on medicinal plants should be translated into botanical drug and such entities should be termed phyto -pharmaceutical s. In August 2008, a committee was set up for this purpose. Draft rule pert aining to phyto -pharmaceuticals was issued as GSR 702 on 24 October 2013 inviting comments. The Department of AYUSH o bjected to this , as powder form of raw herbs or their co mbinations and extracts would fall under this category because the definition inclu ded unprocessed form and that would be encroaching on its domain. A joint meeting was held in 2014 to determine the domains of the Department of AYUSH and Pharm a- copeial Commission regarding the definition, as it was feared that this might lead to back -door entry of drugs in the BM system. Although, over the years, the Department of AYUSH has taken several initiatives to streamline regulations r e- garding label ling, packaging, improving quality of form u- lations through maintenance of GMP requirements, settin g up testing facilities, inspections, etc. we need to go a long way to ensure the availability of quality -assured drugs for consumption or trial. When a publication in JAMA19 raised an alarm about toxic content of some herbo -mineral preparations sold in the US markets, the Department of AYUSH took serious note of it. Administrative orders were issued prescribing the limits of content of some of the minerals /metals and directing State Governments and manufacturers to test each batch of ASU formulations inte nded to be exported for metal content in it. Several studies were conducted on this aspect. It is not the quantity of metal which should be of concern but its nature, which after calcination process should change to powder form having requisite properties (bhasma) as described in authoritative books. The whole process of conversion of metal to powder as nanoparticles is akin to nanotechnology in Ayurveda and Siddha20. In this context the Department of Science and Technology , New Delhi formed a steering comm ittee and CCRAS funded the project to create standard operating proce- dures for selected bhasmas. In the 12th Five Year Plan of the Go vernment (2012 -17) setting up of pharmaco - technology development platform for standardization of processes and products , including bhasmas was reco m- mended. In year 2013 , the then Department of AYUSH pu b- lished the ' good clinical practice guidelines for clinical trials in Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani medicine' to be fo l- lowed by researchers, sponsors and drug manufactu rers while c onducting clinical trials for ASU interventions. The Ministry of AYUSH is in the process of bringing out guidelines for approval to conduct clinical trials of ASU drugs. With the adoption of these guidelines, applic ations seeking regulatory permission of t he Central Go vernment will be received in the standard format along with nece s- sary documents to facilitate objective examin ation by the technical committee and for making reco mmendations for granting permission of the Government. Initially, these guidelin es would be meant for voluntary use and SPECIAL SECTION: INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL . 111, NO. 2, 25 JULY 2016 299 submission of applications for seeking approval to co n- duct cli nical trials on ASU drugs. The Ministry of AYUSH is also in the process of developing a Schedule Z for ASU drugs on the lines of Schedule Y of DCA for BM drugs. This endeavo ur would create statutory prov i- sions for clinical trials related to ASU drugs. Henceforth phytopharmaceut icals will no longer be confused as ASU drugs , as they have been defined as a new drug under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act according t o the Gazette notif i- cation GSR 918(E) dated 30 November 2015 (ref. 21) . Integrative medicine needs Education BM curriculum should have some hours devoted to the study of principles of traditional systems of med icine for better understanding, which would fa cilitate integrative measures. Practice Cross -practice can lead to malpractice. Although health is a State issue, the Central Government should take a un i- form stand to prevent this misuse by making it applicable to the states as well. This would control he alth services delivery addressing public health issues. Research Since many people believe in TM, especially in rural areas where BM practitioners are less in number, the policy makers need to pay attention to facilitate research on IM where public healt h issues need to be tackled , but if this is not controlled it could lead to misuse. The west- ern countries are moving more in the direction of IM to provide patient -centric care. This is strongly evidenced in the National Institutes of Health, USA renaming NCCAM to NCCI M. It is high time that India joins rank with such countries, especially the most populated one like China where IM is a success. Earlier attempts by eminent inst i- tutions should set an example for making progress in this direction. In 1964, through the Ministry of Health, ICMR co n- ceived perhaps the first large -scale inter -agency collab o- ration, ' composite drug research scheme' (CDRS), with the then Central Council for R esearch in Ayurveda and the Council for Scientific and Industrial research ( CSIR) to evaluate biological activity of medicinal plants22. This was led by C. Dwarkanath , who was an Ayurveda phys i- cian trained in modern science research in Germany. This scheme involving pharmacognosy, phytochemistry, pharmacology and clinicians from T M and BM, had a network of institutions as 'nine circuits' across the cou n- try, with each circuit having four units. In 1970, when the Government set up the Central Council of Research in Indian Medicine, this scheme was handed over to it. Nevertheless, IC MR continued to have inter -agency co l- laboration in TM research. As global interest in TM started growing, ICMR co n- tinued to take the lead in collaborative partnership between BM and TM to study the role of traditional remedies in the management of diseases which were refractory in nature or where allopathic medicin es played a limited role. This disease -oriented approach followed the same pri nciple of integrated approach used for CDRS and the clinical trials initiated in 1985 established the requirement to have multidisciplinary experts from mo d- ern science, BM and T M systems for designing the prot o- col to maximize therapeutic advantage. This was later reflected in the rheumatoid arthritis study (ICMR in co l- laboration with Arya Vaidya Pharmacy Research Found a- tion) and Golden Triangle Partnership Scheme i nvolving ICMR, Department of AYUSH and CSIR for selected diseases , where Ayurvedic experts were to identify the promising drugs /formulations for a particular disease condition , CSIR was to carry out standardization and quality control of the selected drugs /formulations , and ICMR was to prepare the clinical trial protocols, identify the appropriate clinical trial sites /investigators, impart training to the identified investigators in GCP /research ethics and conduct clinical -trials. Five clinical -trial pr o- tocols on the basi s of CONSORT guidelines were pr e- pared in consultation with experts from Ayurveda as well as conventional medicine with clinical research profo r- mas for both BM and Ayurveda physician s using separate evaluation parameters from their respective sciences ; clinical trial sites as well as invest igators were identified, training in GCP and research ethics was imparted , but the scheme never reached the stage of initiation of clinical trials. Later, similar inter -institutional collaborations were initiated under CSI R's New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI) to develop plant -based drugs, which also resulted in limited ou t- come. The TM Research Councils have been following int e- grated approach by collaborating with biomedical or sc i- entific insti tutions to generate data for diseases where their medicine is considered to be more effective and to study the mechanism of action. Not many individual research groups have adopted such integrated approach , but it is to be appreciated that one research gr oup in North Kerala has been able to prove its success in redu c- ing morbidity of lymphatic filariasis and some other skin disorders23. This was also possible with funds from the Government. Another such notable study is on rheumat oid arthritis using integra tive medicine24. Such instances a d- dressing public health issues through integr ation should encourage the Government to promote similar attempts. SPECIAL SECTION: INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 111, NO. 2, 25 JULY 2016 300 Clinical Trial Registry of India As a mandatory requirement for regulatory clinical trials using BM drugs, appr oval has to be obtained from the Drugs Controller, and effective from 15 June 2009 , they have to be registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) . At present, trials on TM are only required to be re gistered in CTRI on voluntary basis. Present regulatory scenario Following a Public Interest Litigation filed in Supreme Court , it gave directions to the Ministry of Health for re c- tifying or creating systems to enable protection of human research participants. As a result, from 2013 onwards, the Gove rnment through the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has made several amendments to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules 1945 namely compens a- tion in case of injury or death during clinical trial (vide GSR 53 (E) dated 30 January 2013 ) (wherein R ule 122 DAB and a new Appendix -XII in Schedule -Y has been inserted); permission to conduct a clinical trial (vide GSR 63 (E) dated 1 February 2013 ) (wherein Rule 122 DAC in part X -A of the DCA Rules has been inserted); registr a- tion of ethics committee (vid e GSR 72 (E) dated 8 Febr u- ary 2013 ) (wherein Rule 122 DD in the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules has been inserted) , and audio-visual recording of the informed consent process (vide GSR 364 (E) dated 7 June 2013)25. Under these amendments, the definition of new drug covers new chemical entities, devices and vaccines but not natural products /herbal fo r- mulations. The manufacture of TM herbal or herbo - mineral formulations is yet to catch the attention that is being paid to regulation of new drugs in BM for use of consu mers or for clinical trials. The Ministry of AYUSH is in the process of revamping the regulatory status of TM drugs to handle the issues of standardization, quality assurance and efficacy of drugs to be used for clinical tr i- als as well as for human co nsumption. There are promi s- ing formul ations available , but they need to be subjected to the same rigorous manufacturing norms for use in clinical trials to provide evidence for global acceptance , while at the same time protect the research participants as is insisted upon for clinical trials using new drugs in BM. If more attention is paid to recast the regulatory prov i- sions according to the need of the hour and implementing the existing guidelines /regulations related to traditional formulations /natural pro ducts, it would add to the Gov- ernment's endeavo ur to improve public health. The se t- ting up of a new Ministry of AYUSH, appointment of a separate Drug Controller for AYUSH formulations, and a separate Act for governing these traditional systems could resto re the glory and strength of these systems for public good. Conclusion The British promoted BM at the expense of TM, which resulted in the creation of two parallel systems not wil l- ing to collaborate. However, in the post-independence era Government agencie s came together to work in collabor a- tive research program mes. Due to growing interest in TM world over, it became necessary to regulate the co nduct of physicians, education, research and related guid elines and regulations pertaining to TM. A lot of effect has gone into this . Examples of success of integrated approach exist in India , but more needs to be done for integrating the two systems by focusing on patient -oriented trea t- ment. Allowing them to grow only as parallel systems will be at the expense of pa tient care as more research is required to find answers for tackling major diseases affecting ma nkind. 1.
