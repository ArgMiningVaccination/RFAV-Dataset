It must be obtained from an embassy or consulate in your country of residence or citizenship BEFORE your trip. In most countries, you'll need to apply for your visa through an outside agency that has been contracted by the Indian embassy to manage consular services. Your passport must be more than 6 months from expiration and have at least one blank page. It is critical that you work closely with our office throughout the process. A recent problem is that applications are not being processed as the requested type (for example research versus employment). Be sure that you receive the correct visa or you will likely need to return to your home country to restart this process, causing a 1-3 month delay. Our office will assist you in obtaining the correct visa type: tourist, student, research, employment or family members. Be sure to communicate regularly with us about the progress of this vital process. Expect 2 weeks-6 months for processing. Health Considerations Immunizations Consult a travel health care specialist at least two months prior to departure. You may require a series of vaccinations well in advance of leaving for India. Ensure that you are up-to-date on common vaccines such as tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis/whooping cough, measles, mumps and rubella. Additional suggestions are hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and typhoid. India was declared polio-free in 2013. Mosquito-borne illnesses The most prominent diseases are malaria and dengue fever; neither are very common. Japanese encephalitis is not in Bengaluru, only in the northern parts of India. The best prevention is to avoid bites and use repellents and netting, whether or not you choose to take antimalarials. The most popular insect repellent in India is marketed under the brand name of Odomos and available at pharmacies/chemists. Alternatively, bring your preferred brand from home. Ceiling fans and air conditioners also help keep mosquitoes at bay, and you may want to sleep under a mosquito net. Medications Carry all prescription medicines (along with a list of their generic names) in your hand luggage. Pharmacies, also called chemists, are everywhere. In our area, pharmacists usually understand English. Antibiotics are available without prescription. Travel to Bangalore Be sure to carry your passport, pen for filling out arrival forms (immigration & customs), medications, NCBS reception phone number (+91 80 2366 6001) and immunization records. Arrival at Kempegowda International Airport Bengaluru/Bangalore (BLR) Immigration and customs forms might be passed out on the planes. You may have slept through this, so ask. Otherwise, they will be passed out when entering the terminal. Pause at a desk to fill out the forms and then join the line. Clear Immigration At passport control, an agent will take your immigration form. He/she will leave the Customs form in the passport at the page stamped. Leave it right there. Hold your passport in your hand when you are done. After passport control, you show your passport to a checker who must inspect the stamp you just received. Now you can put the passport away, but keep the Customs card accessible for later. Proceed to the line to have your bags x-rayed and go through a metal detector. This is nothing like TSA in the US; they are looking for weapons/contraband. Everyone sets off the metal detector but they don't seem to care. DO NOT take off your shoes, belt, etc. DO NOT take out your laptop and liquids. Clear Customs An escalator goes downstairs to baggage claim. Carts are free. Then go through the green (nothing to declare) line and give the bottom part of the card to the officer. At this point, you may be required to x-ray your bags again, but this rarely happens. Then go through the almost-empty hall and outside, ignoring the few people who will ask if you need a ride. If you experience any problems, contact the NCBS Reception Desk: -from an Indian mobile phone 080 phone +91 landline, drop the first 0: 80-2366-6001 Walk out through the security doors and look for your driver holding a paper with NCBS. Usually your name is included. Confirm with your driver where you will be dropped. If you have trouble with language have the driver call reception and they will translate. Housing upon arrival : Confirm with the ISSS or your host where you will be staying. The driver will bring you to the housing office and you will be escorted to your room and provided a short orientation. There should be bottled water in your room; if not, ask. For hot water, flip the switch that will light up red to warm the water in the geyser (water heater). It takes about takes 10-20 minutes to heat the water. Breakfast is served at the Canteen 8:15-9:30 am. Coffee and tea are available after 7:30. Tell the cashier that you have just arrived and will repay once you have rupees. Eggs/omelets are prepared to order. First go through the mess line and when you come to the cashier inform him how many eggs you plan to order and if you will have tea or coffee. You may also purchase bottled water and juices. The cashier will direct you to the egg and drinks counters. There is an ATM just outside the main entrance gate. Your First Days Please come to the ISSS office. We are located in the admin block on the 3rd floor. Please understand that the majority of your time for the first couple of weeks will be consumed with these requirements. We can begin by getting you a campus ID card. Passport photos: Reception will arrange a vehicle to get this done; 20 photos is a good beginning. The Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) (photo required) If you are on a long-term visa such as employment/research/student, or you plan to stay in India longer than 180 days on any visa, you must register. Expect this process to take an entire day. After some processing at the FRRO, you will need to get a demand draft (US translation: cashier's check) from a bank so carry the necessary cash to purchase one. Our office will work closely with you to insure the highest probability of success. Be sure to double-check the check-list the day before your appointment. We suggest that you make and carry a copy of your application. http://boi.gov.in/sites/default/files/SupportingDoc-Reg-12.pdf PAN card (photo required) The permanent account number (PAN) is the identifier of Indian income tax payers. It serves as proof of identification in many situations. This number is almost mandatory for completing most financial transactions, such as opening a bank account and receiving taxable salary. Bank Account (photo required) Expats will need the registration from FRRO, passport, visa and proof of address (ISSS will provide or use a bill with your address). Debit cards are routinely issued along with bank accounts. NCBS has an association with the State Bank of India. Other possibilities include HDFC Bank, Barclays, Citibank, Deutshce Bank, ICICI Bank, and Royal Bank of Scotland. ATMs are located just outside our gate. Currency is the Indian Rupee (INR), with 1, 2 and 5 rupee coins and 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 rupee notes.

Copies and originals of passport, FRRO registration and original passport photos are required.

When dialing from a campus phone and calling off-campus, dial 0 to get out of the campus phone system. The campus has two redundant phone providers, so all extensions can be reached by either dialing 2366 or 6717 before the 4 digit extension when you are calling from off campus. For example, Reception from an off-campus landline: 80 2366 6001 or 80 080 6717 6001 Reception on campus: 6001 Most campus phones extensions begin with 6XXX; however, some begin 5XXX. For 5XXX extensions, use prefix 6718 or 2308, when dialing from landlines in Bangalore. From abroad, dial +91 (India country code) then 80(Bangalore city code) Campus Directory Link \"NCBS\" is used generically as well as specifically for all institutes at the BioCluster: NCBS, inStem, C-CAMP Reception: is the centre of the campus.
