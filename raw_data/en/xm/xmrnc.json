The best herbs and spices are organic and obtained straight from a reliable source.

You can also toss these plant medicines into food. Here are nine herbs and spices that are highly prized in Ayurveda and a little teaser on the benefits and applications of each: Advertisement Gymnema sylvestre Gymnema leaf, or Gymnema sylvestre, is a shrub that originates from the forests of India, Africa, and Australia. In Ayurveda, we use its medicinal leaves to help reduce sugar cravings, lower blood sugar levels, aid in weight loss, and reduce inflammation. Clinical trials are now looking into using [Gymnema sylvestre as a diabetes medication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27834124) [1](#citations) due to its hypoglycemic properties. Advertisement How to use it: You can find Gymnema sylvestre in supplement capsule form or consume its dried leaves in a tea. Boil the leaves for 5 minutes, and then let it sit for 10 to 15 before sipping. Potential side effects: Side effects such as headache, nausea, lightheadedness, shakiness, and dizziness can occur if you mix Gymnema sylvestre with other herbs or medicines aimed at lowering blood sugar levels, as it can cause your blood sugar to drop too much.

Cinnamon [Cinnamon](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/cinnamon-uses-health-benefits-and-side-effects) is native to Ancient Egypt, created from cutting the stems of the cinnamon tree and extracting the inner bark.

Its spicy kick can even help prevent bad breath, hence why some toothpastes feature it as a star ingredient. Advertisement How to use it: This easily accessible ingredient can be found at virtually any supermarket and consumed in various ways. I like adding it to warm beverages and sprinkling it on fruit. Potential side effects: Side effects can occur if you consume too much cinnamon. Cassia cinnamon, in particular, which contains the [compound coumarin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20024932) [4](#citations), could potentially contribute to liver damage, mouth sores, and breathing problems. For this reason, it's wise to cap your cinnamon intake to 1 teaspoon a day. Advertisement Who shouldn't use it: You should avoid [taking cinnamon](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2014/642942/) [5](#citations) with medications for diabetes, heart disease, and liver disease as it can enhance their side effects.

Who shouldn't use it: Due to its potential side effects, those who have high blood pressure, kidney disease, or heart disease will want to steer clear of licorice root. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should also avoid it. Cumin Cumin is a spice made by crushing the seeds of the Cuminum Cyminum plant, and it's used to flavor many dishes, mainly in its native regions of the Mediterranean and Southwest Asia. Research has found that cumin can [support healthy digestion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3210012/) [18](#citations) and helps improve [blood sugar control and cholesterol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4039583/) [19](#citations). How to use it: If you intend on taking cumin regularly for your general improved health and well-being, it is best to just use small amounts to season your food. Potential side effects: Although side effects rarely occur, [taking high doses of cumin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cbdv.201400305) could lead to fertility difficulties in men and could induce pregnancy loss in women. Who shouldn't use it: Those on medications for diabetes should not take cumin, as it might cause blood sugar levels to dip too low. Cardamom Cardamom is a widely used spice with a slightly sweet taste. The seeds, oils, and extracts of cardamom have long been prized in Ayurveda due to their ability to help [lower blood pressure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20361714/) [20](#citations), [protect against inflammation and oxidative and relieve digestive issues.
