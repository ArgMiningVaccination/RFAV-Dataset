About this week's feature article In this rich article on an ancient problem, Skeptic contributor Phil Mole discusses the problem of free will. The problem is this: how can we hold people accountable for their actions if we live in a determined universe? A variety of solutions to the problems are reviewed from the ancient Greeks to modern scientists, philosophers, and even science fiction writers such as Philip K. Dick in his classic novel [Minority Report](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375421874?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0375421874). Mole finds compelling new arguments from complexity theory and cognitive neuroscience that reveal the intricate network of causes and effects at work in our conscious minds.

Zeno's Paradox and the Problem of Free Will by Phil Mol\u00e9 John Anderton, the protagonist played by Tom Cruise in Steven Spielberg's science fiction film [Minority Report](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035WTJFW?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0035WTJFW), finds himself in a nightmarishly paradoxical situation. As a policeman for the futuristic Pre-Crime office, Anderton relies on an elaborate information arrangement system to see crimes before they happen, and arrest the would-be perpetrators. [1](#note01) The accuracy of Pre-Crime's predictions seems infallible, until it forecasts that Anderton himself will soon become a murderer. Anderton does not even recognize the future murder victim, so how could he possibly kill the man? How can he prove his innocence, especially since the system seems to have perfect predictive accuracy? Is it possible that the system is right, and Anderton will become a murderer for reasons beyond his own knowledge or understanding? If Anderton is to avoid his apparent destiny as a convicted murderer, he must hope that the astonishing predictive accuracy of Pre-Crime leaves some room for personal freedom. He must hope that deterministic laws do not preclude the possibility of free will. Minority Report, based on a Philip K. Dick story, grapples with the classic philosophical problems of free will. Do human beings have free will, or do physical laws determine our destinies? How can the novelty of free choice truly exist in a universe organized with such clock-like regularity? These questions have intrigued and annoyed contemplative folks for millennia, and have provided the raw material for weighty philosophical treatises and science fiction movies alike. Yet, after centuries of debate, the definitive answers to the free will dilemma have yet to be discovered. Is this problem, as some philosophers have maintained, ultimately beyond human understanding? Perhaps we need to take a new, closer look at the problem and its history. We may be able to identify conceptual flaws in the logic of many free-will arguments. More important, we may be able to find fruitful parallels between the apparent puzzles at the center of the free will debate and other difficult philosophical puzzles, such as the motion paradoxes of Zeno. Such an inquiry may yield insights relevant to the historical problem of free will and its possible solution. The Problem: A Brief History To the ancient Greeks, human destiny was subject to forces beyond our control, and tragedy resulted from the heroic but useless struggle against the dictates of destiny. After the beginning of the Christian era, theologians developed new concerns. They worshipped an all-powerful and all knowing God, but soon found that the existence of this God would have rather negative implications for human freedom. If God really knew everything, he would have to know the course of all history. But if this were true, we humans seemed to be simply going through the motions like characters in a novel. We are like the protagonists of Tom Stoppard's brilliant play [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802132758?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0802132758), who do not fully comprehend their status as minor [Hamlet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074347712X?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=074347712X) characters lacking true personal freedom. [2](#note02) Just as the audience attending a performance of a widely read play knows the fates of every character, God knows the future details of every human being alive, because he himself authored our destinies. A deterministic universe also seemed to pose serious threats to morality and accountability. If we do not freely choose our actions, how can we be responsible for good or evil deeds we happen to perform? What sense could it even make to punish a criminal for breaking the law if he could not have done otherwise? Even theological doctrines, such as the rebellion of Satan and the crucifixion of Jesus, seem to become uncomfortably troublesome upon further reflection. For if Satan's fall and Christ's acceptance of the cross were ordained to happen exactly as they did, how could we justifiably despise the Prince of Lies or love Jesus? Sin could not truly exist, since the existence of sin depends on the existence of choice. Adam and Eve might have eaten of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, but they could not have violated God's will if God is omnipotent. The fall of man seems, in this light, to have been something thrust upon us by necessity, not by choice. Even worse, it becomes difficult to morally justify God's actions in history, since He must know that some of his actions will place his most beloved creation in horrible pain and misery. [3](#note03) Theologians eventually devised various compromise solutions to the free will dilemma. Religious thinkers modified their definitions of omnipotence to include the possibility that human actions could be free and simultaneously known in advance by a supreme being. Foremost among these theologians was Thomas Aquinas, who worried that too much disparagement of free will might lead people to doubt the reality of sin, and abdicate responsibility for their actions. [4](#note04) These new thinkers stressed that God's vast knowledge of reality did not imply that human actions were not free. Just as an observer in a 15th story apartment window can see that two automobiles are unwittingly driving on a collision course, God's vantage point allows him to see the consequences of our actions, even when they are hidden from our own senses. We choose our actions based on our best available information, but simply do not know enough to accurately foresee the outcomes of our actions. Adam and Eve were responsible for their choice after all. [5](#note05) Yet another, more philosophical objection to free will states that its existence is entirely dependent on the possibility of \"uncaused causes.\" That is, if we are honestly to consider ourselves free, then we ourselves must be the only cause of our actions. We must be able to demonstrate that we do not act the way we do because prior events compelled us. But this is not reasonable, say the objectors, because every action in the material world can be traced to prior causes, and these causes themselves originate from prior causes. All causes are part of a chain of events stretching back to the very beginning of the universe. All right, but we are people, not material objects. An inanimate clump of minerals cannot choose what it is going to do, but we can, because of our human consciousness. The materialist is not satisfied with this rebuttal. He will state that human beings are made of matter that follows the same physical laws governing everything else in the universe. We are made of atoms, and the behavior of these atoms follows known laws and results from physical causes. When we trace the histories of all the bits of matter comprising our physical bodies, we see that the movement of this matter followed inexorably from a long series of perfectly material determinants. The thing we call our mind is merely the sum of myriad interactions of material particles following immutable natural laws. With a sufficiently intimate understanding of our minds at the material level, we could no longer imagine we are acting freely. To determinists, our perception of personal freedom is a side effect of consciousness that, ironically, developed from a combination of natural laws and prior constraints in the pathway of human evolution. This consciousness gives each of us a sense of personal identity that allows us to perceive that we are somehow separate and independent from the rest of the world. We seem to be free agents, exempt from external constraints. But as Leo Tolstoy observed in [War and Peace](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400079985?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1400079985), we cannot easily consider ourselves free when we recall prior sequences of events that limited our choices and compelled us toward certain courses of action. [6](#note06) The military generals in Tolstoy's epic imagine they are controlling the fates of entire armies and even nations, but countless historical contingencies they are unable or unwilling to consider rigidly determine their every action. What it all comes down to, as philosophers from Friedrich Nietzsche to Galen Strawson have argued, is that we cannot be a causa sui, or the ultimate cause of ourselves. We had no say in the forces that produced us, and so we cannot be free in any ultimate sense of the word. [7](#note07) Free will is simply an illusion conjured by our ignorance of the causes affecting our behavior. This is what Baruch Spinoza meant when he quipped that if a rock possessed consciousness, it would believe that it fell of its own free will. [8](#note08) The deeper we look at the various determinants bearing upon our actions, the more free will seems to be an abstraction without meaning in the real world. This seems to be true even if, as philosopher P. F. Strawson argued in a celebrated paper, belief in free will is a deeply ingrained component of human ethical reflection \u2014 we believe in free will because denying freedom undercuts the health of our social relationships. [9](#note09) Someone who could know the myriad effects impacting our behavior would see that our every action is completely determined and predictable. As the mathematician Laplace famously argued, An intellect which at any given moment knew all the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that comprise it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit its data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest atom: for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain, and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes. [10] The Search for Solutions Undeterred, champions of free will continue to defend their theory from the clutch of determinism. One common approach is to cite the importance of non-material factors on human behavior, such as culture. We are more than mere collections of atoms or genes. We are also social creatures capable of adapting to a wide range of cultural habitats. Hasn't anthropology taught us that human nature is remarkably malleable? Determinists object that culture has no relevance to the question of free will. They argue, quite correctly, that all choices ultimately stem from cognitive activity in the brain, which remains a material entity subject to material laws. Furthermore, it wouldn't even matter if culture allowed us to bypass our material structures altogether. If our behavior results from cultural factors, it is still determined by external factors, and we still do not freely choose our actions. Modern opponents of determinism invoke quantum mechanics as proof that chance events have their place in nature. In quantum mechanics, we can only cite probabilities for finding particles in a particular place, and cannot determine the position of a particle in advance. Might quantum mechanics provide a means of escape from a determined existence? According to physicist Roger Penrose, in his popular book [The Emperor's New Mind](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192861980?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0192861980), [11](#note11) quantum mechanics enables us to escape from a completely knowable and determined existence by injecting randomness into the very nature of consciousness. Determinists respond that not every scientist thinks that quantum mechanics is a truly nondeterministic theory. Some physicists maintain that quantum mechanics equations contain hidden variables that cause determinism to prevail, despite the seeming randomness in experimental results. And even if quantum mechanics is random, how does that help the case for free will? To most people, freedom involves more than performing random actions or responding randomly to stimuli. We want to be able to choose our actions, not simply behave haphazardly. A life completely subject to the whims of quantum chance is just as unattractive as a life governed by predictability. Free Will and Zeno's Paradox The arguments for and against free will have circulated through the intellectual world for millennia, with minor variations. We may sympathize with Andr\u00e9 Gide, who once mused that all the arguments about free will have already been made, but we must continue repeating them because nobody listens. [12](#note12) Indeed, although some of the terms used in the debate may vary, the basic arguments continue to center on the likelihood of uncaused causes and the possibility of autonomy from natural laws. Whether the movements of atoms or the influence of genes and cultural conditioning control us, we are not the ultimate cause of our actions, and cannot truly be free. The existence of free will seems to depend on a logically impossible reconciliation of incompatible concepts. As Martin Gardner quips, \"A free will act cannot be fully predetermined. Nor can it be the outcome of pure chance. Somehow it is both. Somehow it is neither... My own view, which is Kant's, is that there is no way to go between the thorns. The best we can do (we who are not gods) is, Kant wrote, comprehend its incomprehensibility.\" [13](#note13) But are we really looking at the problem correctly? Perhaps we need to escape from the cycle of rehashed arguments and take a new look at our approaches to the problem. One way to do this may be to look for analogous dilemmas encountered during the long history of philosophy, and see if we can gain insights relevant to discussions of free will. To my mind, some important aspects of the free will debate invite comparison to another celebrated philosophical puzzle \u2014 the motion paradoxes of the Greek philosopher Zeno. Living in the fifth century BCE, Zeno was a disciple of the great thinker Parmenides, who famously argued that change in the physical world is impossible. We cannot speak of what is not, Parmenides said, since that would involve the contradiction of speaking of things that don't exist. [14](#note14) Change is therefore impossible because it involves something becoming what it is not, which plainly involves an impassable contradiction. Zeno defended the rather paradoxical conclusions of his mentor by developing a number of paradoxes of his own. In one of his most famous examples, Zeno describes a race between the swift runner Achilles and a tortoise. [15](#note15) Since Achilles runs much faster than the tortoise, we give the tortoise a fair head start. Everyone knows Achilles will outrun the slow, heavy tortoise, right? Don't be so sure, Zeno answers. Suppose the tortoise has a ten-meter head start. Achilles catches up that distance, but in that time, the tortoise has moved a small distance ahead. Achilles must now catch up the new distance, but meanwhile the tortoise has made further small progress. It turns out that Achilles can never overtake his slower opponent, because each time he moves the tortoise has trudged another tiny increment ahead. This paradox also implies that Achilles not only fails to outrun the tortoise, but neither Achilles nor anything else can truly move at all. Before I can move from one side of the room to the opposite side, I first have to travel half the total distance. But before I can reach the center of the room, I have to travel half of that distance, or one-quarter of the total. We can still divide the quarter distance by two again, and continue this operation until we have added an infinite number of small distances to our journey. This same argument applies if, instead of wishing to cross the room, we merely want to move a tiny fraction of an inch forward. Any potential distance, no matter how great or small, is divisible into an infinite number of smaller distances. We can never move anywhere, because we would have to travel across an infinitely large number of distances just to move a vanishingly small distance. Zeno's paradox is one of those philosophical arguments that is obviously wrong, but resists attempts to find the error. His argument baffled generations of philosophers who struggled unsuccessfully to locate the fallacies in his thinking. We needed new developments in mathematics to clearly understand where Zeno's reasoning goes astray. The mathematical concept of series convergence allows us to see that an infinite series of small increments can comprise a finite sum. An infinite number of increments does not necessarily produce an infinite number, but may converge on a finite number. [17](#note17) This can be expressed mathematically as For instance, suppose we sum an infinite series beginning with ___, and each new term is exactly ___ of the previous term. We are adding an infinite number of terms, but do not obtain an infinite sum, because our series converges to one: Thus, the mathematics of convergence shows that an infinite series does not necessarily imply an infinite sum. The seeming paradox in Zeno's argument arises because of our mistaken tendency to see the concepts of \"infinite\" and \"finite\" as mutually exclusive. Zeno's rigid rationalism convinces us that an infinite series of small increments prevents a finite increase in distance, but the narrow focus and hidden assumptions in Zeno's argument have tricked us into believing a fallacy. We can cross the room after all, and Achilles really does outrun the tortoise. Paradox Lost: Rethinking Free Will Arguments I would like to hypothesize that free will arguments contain common misunderstandings of the concepts of \"cause\" and \"will,\" and these misunderstandings are analogous to Zeno's erroneous assumptions about the concepts of \"infinite\" and \"finite.\" Just as Zeno agonized about infinite numbers of small distances and convinced himself that all movement was impossible, most participants in the free will debate devote so much attention to the causes affecting us that they feel compelled to deny free will. Indeed, many philosophers believe the case against free will to be rock solid. Every effect has a cause, and humans cannot be the causes of their own consciousness, so we may as well just admit that free will is illusory. A few of these philosophers even smugly claim that anyone can see the logical impossibility of free will by reflecting on the relevant arguments from the comfort of his own couch. [18](#note18) However, Zeno also thought he used flawless logic in his demonstration of the impossibility of motion. Just as modern determinists intimidate us by speaking of infinite chains of causes precluding our freedom, Zeno intimidated his audience by showing how infinite numbers of small increments rendered motion impossible. What if, just as in Zeno's paradox, there is nothing truly paradoxical going on in the realm of free will after all? What if our actions could remain genuine acts of will and outcomes of a complex chain of causality, just as we could have an infinite series of small increments converge on a finite sum? These possibilities are similar in many ways to other counterintuitive conclusions rendered understandable through careful mathematical reasoning. For instance, we tend to think that the concepts of \"randomness\" and \"symmetry\" are at odds with each other. A symmetrical pattern seems to be the very antithesis of randomness. But as physicist Taner Edis shows in his remarkable book [The Ghost in the Universe](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1573929778?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1573929778), order and chance are closely linked. A long series of fair coin tosses likely results in random sequences of heads and tails, but the resulting randomness follows directly from the symmetry in the probabilities of obtaining two possible outcomes for each coin flip. Similarly, we observe magnets to be rotationally symmetric at high temperatures, meaning that they align themselves in every possible direction. The overall magnetization of this system is zero, because the magnets do not favor any particular direction and cancel each other out. Ironically, if the equations describing magnetism were not symmetrical, the directions of these magnets could not be random, because non-symmetrical equations would result in a non-zero net magnetization of the system, dictating that the magnets align themselves along a single direction. [19](#note19) Symmetry and randomness are not antagonists. They are inseparable elements of a universe in which mathematically elegant laws create opportunities for contingencies. Free will certainly poses vexing philosophical problems, but many of these problems appear to result from conceptual confusions. When we talk about free will and determinism, we immediately confront a series of conflicts between seemingly contradictory terms. When we ask if a deterministic universe implies the absence of freedom, we seem to encounter a conflict between the concepts of cause and choice. We stumble upon another impasse when we ask if quantum indeterminacy somehow enables us to have free will, because we see randomness and rational choice as complete antagonists. But we've fooled ourselves as much by our framing of our questions as Zeno fooled himself, and many others, by the framing of his paradoxes. We do not have to choose between complete determinacy and complete chance, or believe that free choice necessitates complete isolation from the world of causes and effects. [20](#note20) Instead, we can explore the ways that chance and order combine in physical laws to allow free will to exist. The first thing we need to do is clarify what \"free will\" really means. It clearly cannot imply total freedom to do whatever we want, because few people worry about their inability to suddenly become lighter than air. Most people willingly accept that the nature of our human bodies imposes limits on our actions. To claim we have free will, then, is merely to claim that we have some range of possible choices. The mere presence of limits on our choice does not negate our freedom as long as real choices still exist. To see why, consider an example provided by philosopher Daniel Dennett in his interesting book [Elbow Room](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262540428?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262540428). If we see an animal at the zoo in a tiny cage restricting even the smallest movement, we deplore the poor beast's condition, because he seems to lack freedom to do anything at all. But now imagine seeing the same animal in a spacious zoo habitat. The animal still faces limits on his freedom, but he can roam around in his quarters and \"choose\" to be in one place rather than another. [21](#note21) This is the kind of freedom we would probably consider sufficient. We are mostly comfortable with the idea of limits on our choices, as long as we truly have a variety of options. If the tradeoff between freedom and limitations is not all or nothing, neither is the tradeoff between freedom and deterministic predictability. Recall that traditional determinists argue that an omniscient being seeing all of the causes affecting us would be able to perfectly predict our actions. This hypothetical being would be able to see that we do not actually act freely, but act under the compulsion of countless causes undetected by our limited mortal senses. This is a nice argument, but it suffers from the serious deficiencies that no one knows if such a being exists, and no one certainly knows how such a being would perceive reality. It may very well be the case that a being capable of seeing all of the causes acting on us would have more difficulty predicting our behavior. After all, the simpler of two competing scientific models often allows us to make the most accurate predictions. Predictive accuracy often decreases, not increases, with the number of parameters we include in our model! [22](#note22) An all-knowing being may very well wind up with all-powerful headaches. One reason that determinism does not imply an absence of alternatives is the role of emergent phenomena in complex systems. An emergent phenomenon is neither a property of any individual component of a system, nor simply the result of summing the properties of all components. Emergent phenomena are novel, and unpredicted by our knowledge of the system. [23](#note23) There are many examples of emergent phenomena at all levels. For instance, the atomic properties of hydrogen and oxygen do not convey all possible information about the properties of water, which is simply a molecule made from the combination of the two elements. Water has distinct properties, such as its surface tension and heating capacity, that belong neither to hydrogen nor oxygen and do not arise from simply combining the known properties of each. Some evolutionary biologists think that stable reproductive species in evolutionary history are emergent phenomena, which changed the whole course of natural selection. [24](#note24) This illustrates another important feature of emergent phenomena \u2014 their tendency to affect other parts of the system that produced them. Genes control the inheritable traits of species, but species take the evolutionary game to a completely new level, and affect the distribution of genes themselves in complex ways. This is a feature of complex systems often overlooked by strict determinist deniers of free will. Emergent phenomenon themselves are not merely affected by their surroundings, but interact dynamically with other parts of the system. By almost anyone's definition, the human mind is a complex system. Consciousness is an emergent phenomenon of the billions of neuron interactions in our brains, and seems to be able to influence the behavior of these neurons in novel ways. Some of this novelty may also be linked to quantum level uncertainty in the states of the neurons involved. [25](#note25) Determinist opponents of free will, hearing this, may reiterate their objection that quantum uncertainty cannot provide a foundation for the kind of rationally considered choices we associate with free will. But as we have already seen, this objection is unwarranted, because randomness and order are not incompatible concepts. As Taner Edis' magnetic field example showed, randomness is an inherent characteristic of deterministic laws. Quantum mechanics may supply more variety for these laws to act upon, and the neurons of our brain may be close enough to the quantum size level for this variability to be considerable. How, then, does free will work? We do not completely understand, but we have clues. And just as we needed the mathematical development of calculus to clearly resolve Zeno's paradox, we may find that the burgeoning mathematics of complexity theory will finally help us dispel our conceptual confusions about free will. Currently, it seems probable that complexity theory, together with our growing understanding of cognitive neuroscience, will throw much light on the process of making willed decisions. We will better understand how the complex arrangement of neurons in our brains leads to emergent states of conscious awareness, and the conscious mind feeds back on its neural networks to place itself in alternate conscious states. With time, we will also better comprehend how the brain converts sensory stimuli and knowledge of our environment into neural impulses and becomes part of the intricate network of causes and effects at work in our conscious minds. Finally, we will realize the conceptual confusions that cause us to see determinism and rational choice as incompatible, and will renounce our error. We will live in a deterministic world without fear, for we will no longer see determinism as a threat to the free will we cherish. References - \"Minority Report\" screenplay. Dick, Philip K. 2002.

Beginning at the moment of creation with the Big Bang, Flannery explores the evolution of Earth from a galactic cloud of dust and gas to a planet with a metallic core and early signs of life within a billion years of being created. He describes the formation of the Earth's crust and atmosphere, as well as the transformation of the planet's oceans from toxic brews of metals to life-sustaining bodies covering 70 percent of the planet's surface. Life first appeared in these oceans in the form of microscopic plants and bacteria, and these metals served as catalysts for the earliest biological processes known to exist. From this starting point, Flannery tells the fascinating story of the evolution of our own species.

We will reveal the answer to this week's Mystery Photo Comments Off on Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us about Morality WHAT IS MORALITY AND WHERE DOES IT COME FROM? Neurophilosopher Patricia Churchland argues that morality originates in the biology of the brain: Moral values are rooted in family values displayed by all mammals \u2014 the caring for offspring. The evolved structure, processes, and chemistry of the brain incline humans to strive not only for self-preservation but for the well-being of allied selves \u2014 first offspring, then mates, kin, and so on, in wider and wider \"caring\" circles. Separation and exclusion cause pain, and the company of loved ones causes pleasure; responding to feelings of social pain and pleasure, brains adjust their circuitry to local customs. A key part of the story is oxytocin, an ancient body-and-brain molecule that allows humans to develop the trust in one another necessary for the development of close-knit ties, social institutions, and morality.

Stranger Than We Can Imagine by Justin Trottier To invoke a quote often attributed to the astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington, \"Not only is the universe stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine.\" Many areas of scientific exploration have led to surprising discoveries never envisioned, and the hunt for new exoplanets\u2014worlds beyond our solar system\u2014is a splendid example. In [Strange New Worlds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691142548/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=0691142548), the University of Toronto astronomer Ray Jayawardhana offers a glimpse into the real and often messy way science is done, along with the exhilarating surprises thrown at pioneering scientists. No one thought the first exoplanet would be discovered around the unlikely location of a pulsar, or that gas giants would be found so far from where they are in our own solar system. Some exoplanets are so close to their parent star that they orbit in a matter of days, whereas one exoplanet that is eight Jupiters in mass, was found more than 10 times the distance of Neptune to our sun. Jayawardhana's own studies of infant planetary systems offers one clear surprise. Early solar systems are far more complicated, chaotic and dangerous than we thought. This discovery may have tremendous impact on our understanding of our own birthing process. Consider for example the finding that gas giant planets often migrate. Now researchers think our solar system's own so-called \"late heavy bombardment\" period that occurred 600 million years after initial planetary formation, as evidenced by lunar craters, may be explained by the migration of our own planets. While cosmology explores the earliest moments of the cosmos and abiogenesis seeks to understand the origin of life, Jayawardhana and his planet hunters are filling in a crucial middle of the story origin account. It is a narrative description of how those materials generated by the universe can find an appropriate environment\u2014a home\u2014where life may emerge. It is also a story of challenge that shows how lucky we are on our own planet. We see how easily worlds can be destroyed, with migrating giants and interacting young stars ejecting Earth-size objects into the void of space, or sending them spiraling into the star. It's also a tale of triumph. Accumulated data is starting to show how common solar systems and even smaller worlds tend to be in our galaxy. An award-winning science writer whose popular articles have been published in publications such as Scientific American and The Economist, Jayawardhana artfully blends interviews and profiles of leading researchers within his scientific narrative. Both aspects are fascinating and full of adventurous twists and turns. If planetary systems are increasingly seen as chaotic and dangerous, such qualities might describe the enterprise of planet hunting itself. Chaotic because the nature of making observations at the limit of our equipment's detection ability, or in which assumptions about planetary or stellar science are required, mean that there were a lot of early false starts, with lots of initial planetary candidates shown eventually not to exist. Planet hunting was a pioneering field but also a dangerous game for those with uncertain career futures. In its early days in the 1980s there was great skepticism about whether the project was even a part of astronomy. Jaywardhana tells the story of Gordon Walker, now retired from the University of British Columbia, who watched as a senior astronomer left during a lecture he was giving on the topic. Walker's postdoc teammate, Bruce Campbell, was compelled to leave the field for something more reliable, becoming a tax consultant. Even in the early 1990s, research groups were routinely turned down for funds, with granting agencies seeing little chance of detection improvement. Yet, here we can see how quickly progress can be achieved in a scientific discipline. With seven planets discovered in the turning point year of 1996, everything changed. Within a mere decade planet hunters Michael Mayor and Geoff Marcy shared a major triumph, winning the prestigious million dollar Shaw Prize for astronomy in 2005, a sure sign that the field had come of age. As Jayawardhana describes the scientific figures involved, such as Marcy and others, we see portraits of characters who are each unique and colorful, not unlike the worlds they've discovered. Some were portrayed with an arrogance, such as the very early character Thomas Jefferson Jackson See, who brazenly declared back in 1899 that he had found conclusive proof of a third body orbiting the binary star system 70 Ophiuchi. When a paper showed that such a system would be unstable, See rebuked the journal, which went so far as to ban him from future publication. See suffered a breakdown three years later. The failure to relent by many researchers is nicely contrasted with the humility of Andrew Lyne, who almost achieved credit for discovering the first exoplanet in 1992. Less than a week before his scheduled talk at the American Astronomical Society, and with Nature already declaring the significance of the discovery, Lyne found an error in his data that made the planet disappear. While Jayawardhana's depiction of this episode can show how desires might affect data analysis, this was a proud moment for science. Lyne immediately reported his error in front of a huge audience and was honored for his forthrightness. In Strange New Worlds we come to understand that these exoplanets also demonstrate the difficulty of doing science in areas such as planet hunting that are at the limit of our equipment's ability to discern signal from noise, and especially where human desires to see things can affect our observations. This may be exacerbated by the emotional side of searching for worlds in the hope of eventually finding other habitable homes, not unlike the well known drama of Percival Lowell and his false readings of long straight lines on Mars as evidence of artificially constructed canals and thus Martian civilization. But considering these equipment limits, Jayawardhana shows us that it really is remarkable what we can learn about far off worlds. We can determine not just their mass, volume, and density, but sometimes we can glean details of their atmospheric constituents, with a tantalizing possibility for seeing biosignatures. We are now at the stage of detecting planets merely a few Earth masses, so-called super-Earths. As we zero in on Earth-type planets in Earth-type orbits around sun-like stars, we are led to the tantalizing hunt for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Unfortunately, Jayawardhana's book is rather short, and we're left wishing he had commented further on the second element of its subtitle, namely the search for life. Although planet hunting is only now reaching the point of giving us information directly relevant to this area of exploration, he might have shared his own speculations on how far next generation planet exploration missions could go in providing signs of life data, or on how such missions might actually integrate elements of SETI. We're left eager for such comments after being shown actual pictures of other worlds. The first images of exoplanets not only serve as a symbolic vindication of the search, they have the immediate emotional appeal of seeing an object that's really there. Jayawardhana's closing chapters leave the reader understanding that we're only getting started and certainly just entering the most exciting part of planet hunting. Just this February, the Kepler team announced 1,235 planetary candidates. They require confirmation, which could take up to three years, but such data, accumulated over a mere five months, could triple the number of planets already discovered. Within this batch, 68 are Earth-like in size and 54 are within their star's habitable zone. The estimate is that six percent of stars contain Earth-size planets. This not only gives us a general understanding that there's a lot of real estate out there, but actually provides increasingly accurate quantities for two factors in the famous Drake equation for estimating the number of signaling ETs in the galaxy, namely fp (the fraction of stars that have planets) and ne (the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star with planets). Jayawardhana's book offers a great and cohesive synopsis of how far the field has come and leaves the reader excited about the prospect of following along as future discoveries are made. One need not be a passive observer either. Amateur astronomers such as Jennie McCormick from New Zealand are playing a role helping to confirm exoplanets discovered by gravitational lensing. The search for exoplanets has concreteness and an emotional appeal that other astronomical fields such as cosmology or the study of galaxies or black holes may lack, and even laypeople can join in through internet-based computing projects similar to seti@home. One of these, [www.zooniverse.org](http://www.zooniverse.org/), has users identify transiting planets from real Kepler mission data. The idea that any member of our species with internet access could assist in the discovery of a new planet, eventually perhaps one that is habitable, is sure to keep the search for exoplanets popular and bring increased attention to the role of science in exploring the big questions of our place in the cosmos.

This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with award-winning science journalist Gary Taubes about his most recent book, \"Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It\" which looks critically at the science of adiposity (hundreds of years of scientific research and data about the best ways to avoid obesity and obesity-related illness). Taubes also debunks the myth that losing weight is all about the calories.

About this week's feature article In a soon-to-be-published controversial paper entitled \"Feeling the Future: Experimental Evidence for Anomalous Retroactive Influences on Cognition and Affect,\" Daryl Bem claims to have found significant statistical data in support of precognition in various situations through a series of nine experiments. Nicolas Gauvrit presents several analyses critiquing the methodology and statistical data presented in Bem's study. [SUBSCRIBE to Skeptic magazine](https://www.skeptic.com/subscribe) for more great articles like this one. Precognition or Pathological Science? An Analysis of Daryl Bem's Controversial \"Feeling the Paper by Nicolas Gauvrit Renowned experimental psychologist Daryl Bem is about to publish an astonishing article in the prestigious Journal of Personality and Social Psychology ( [an online version](http://dbem.ws/FeelingFuture.pdf) is available now) entitled \"Feeling the Future: Experimental Evidence for Anomalous Retroactive Influences on Cognition and Affect.\" [1](#note01) In this paper, Bem claims to prove precognition in various situations through a series of nine experiments. Well before its publication, this article is already being discussed, criticized, or acclaimed in the media (e.g., New York Times, January 10, 2011), and was even featured on The Colbert Report. In most of these experiments, subjects were seated in front of a computer. The screen first showed a picture of two curtains side by side. Subjects were then asked to guess behind which curtain a picture was \"hidden\". The target pictures to be found were either positive (e.g. smiling people), negative (e.g. car accident), neutral (e.g. a building), or \"erotic\" (e.g. man and woman having sexual intercourse). In fact, no picture was hidden, and the computer actually used a random method to determine, after subjects had spotted one side of the screen, on which side to display the picture. Bem claims that the subjects knew in advance which side would be randomly chosen, but since this happened after they made their selection it is an example of precognition or backwards time causality. The basic idea behind Bem's experiments is to produce reversed forms of classical psychological effects. For instance, a subliminal (or non-subliminal) presentation of a stimulus is known to facilitate the recognition of a subsequent related stimulus, an effect called \"priming\": subjects are told to indicate as quickly as possible whether a series of letters (called a \"target\") displayed on a screen is an English word or not. For instance, TABLE may appear, and subjects would say it is a word. Unbeknownst to the subjects, a prior subliminal presentation of a word, either \"CHAIR\" or \"APPLE\", is briefly displayed on screen. The response time (delay in responding) is significantly shorter when subjects are exposed to \"CHAIR\"\u2014an item related to the target\u2014than when they are exposed to \"APPLE\". In experiments 3 and 4, Bem conducted a retroactive version of an affective priming experiment: a target picture is first displayed, for which subjects have to say if the picture is \"pleasant\" or \"unpleasant\". A random priming word (either pleasant or unpleasant) appears afterwards on the screen. Overall, four psychological effects (priming, facilitation of recognition, habituation, approach-avoidance) are reversed in time in Bem's nine experiments. Except for retroactive induction of boredom (experiment 7), Bem claims that he found significant statistical data in support of precognition. However, criticisms have already been made concerning Bem's paper, based on both methodological and statistical viewpoints. James Alcock's Methodological Critique In an article in the March/April 2011 issue of Skeptical Inquirer, James Alcock highlights the extreme fuzziness of Bem's methodology. [2](#note02) Bem describes in detail a random generator based on physical processes, known to be more reliable than any pseudo-random software. He is indeed being cautious using such a generator. However, for some unexplained reason, not all his experiments are carried out using it. Experiment 1 (detection of erotic stimuli) begins with each subject viewing a series of 12 erotic, 12 positive, and 12 negative pictures...but only for the first 40 participants. The last 60 subjects were exposed to 18 erotic pictures and 18 non-erotic but positive pictures. Alcock identifies two methodological irregularities among a long series. These non-conventional methodological techniques are puzzling. For example, Bem needs to know for classification purposes if pictures shown on the screen are positive or negative, and emotionally strong or not. The best way to achieve this goal is to select images from a reliable database, such as the International Affective Picture System. [3](#note03) This Bem did...for \"most of the pictures\". We do not have any indication of the proportion of pictures not taken from the databank, nor do we have details of the procedure used to classify these images as being \"positive\", \"neutral\", or \"negative\". The question naturally arises from this weird methodology: do we even know for sure that the classification was made before the experiment? If that is not the case, then of course data would be ad hoc. As well, Bem claims that his prior hypothesis in experiment 1 (where subjects have to find on which side of the screen a picture will appear) was that people would find the picture in more than 50% of the cases for erotic pictures. If this was really his hypothesis, why would he need to classify non-erotic pictures as either positive, negative, neutral, and non-erotic positive? The methodology strongly suggests that what is presented as an a priori hypothesis is in fact an a posteriori hypothesis, based on the results of the experiment. This is not acceptable in research using statistics to prove a general hypothesis, for a reason linked with \"risk\". Each statistical test (i.e. a method allowing, if it does, to \"prove\" a general hypothesis) indeed has a risk\u2014usually 0.05, or 5%. This 5% risk means that (in Bem's case) if there is no such thing as precognition, then the result of statistical tests will let us believe the contrary one in 20 times. Since we can imagine at least hundreds of tests, choosing the test afterward may induce misleading results... Wagenmakers et al.'s Critique This is, more or less, what Eric-Jan Wagenmakers and his colleagues claim in their paper that appears in the same journal as Bem's article. [4](#note04) Wagenmakers et al. argue that what is presented as a confirmatory analysis of some previous psi hypothesis is in a fact an exploratory analysis. This may seem meaningless at first glance, but the statistics involved in Bem's paper are fundamentally confirmatory, and cannot be used that way. Indeed, in an exploratory analysis, one does not know exactly which hypothesis to test. For instance, Bem may have had a feeling that, in some circumstances, people will show precognition. If he does not know before the experiment if this will be for erotic, negative or positive pictures, then he may proceed to a series of tests to accredit whatever situation will appear as the \"good\" one for psi phenomenon to show up. But if he does so (and so did he), since he uses several tests, the above argument shows that the results obtained cannot be taken as proving precognition. The usual way to deal with such a situation is to consider any result coming out from this kind of study as \"exploratory\", i.e. preliminary studies. The right conclusion would then not be \"there is precognition with erotic pictures,\" but more likely \"if there is precognition, it is more likely to appear with erotic pictures. Now, one has to build up an experiment to test precognition with erotic pictures....\" Wagenmakers et al. go even further, arguing that when psi or any other improbable effect is involved, one should take into account the multitude of experimental failures to prove it. This cannot be achieved through classical statistical testing (except through meta-analysis). For that reason, Wagenmakers et al. advocate for the use of a method based on totally different basis. Their arguments are certainly well-advised. But such a change of paradigm is not necessary to deny the link that Bem sees between his data and conclusions. Actually, as we will see, a classical statistical approach suffices to show that the very data exhibited by Bem does not support the final claim of precognition. Multiple Testing Classical statistical testing is based on a simple idea. It aims at refuting a so-called \"null hypothesis.\" In Bem's case, the null-hypothesis is that there is no such thing as precognition, something Bem wishes to prove false. As in any scientific experiment, we begin by assuming that the null hypothesis is true, and reject it only if the data show statistically significant differences between conditions and we can safely rule out chance as an explanation. That is, the observed experimental result has a probability (the so-called \"p-value\") of less than 5%. This means that if the null hypothesis is true that the effect is nonexistent, there is still a 5% probability that it will be observed anyway, by chance. This classical testing method is bound to fail (if, again, the null hypothesis is actually true) once in every 20 attempts. For this reason, statistical handbooks for researchers recommend (1) use only one test for each hypothesis and (2) choose the test before the experiment begins. This is not what Bem did. For instance, he cites using as many as 10 tests for testing precognition in experiment 1, and 8 in experiment 2. Correction procedures for multiple testing do exist. Social scientists are normally taught to use such procedures whenever they have to use several tests for the same hypothesis\u2014a situation that should rarely occur. One way of achieving multiple-testing correction is to divide the maximum admissible risk of each test by the number of tests being considered. For instance, considering experiment 1 from Bem's article, this would imply concluding that there is proof of precognition only if at least one particular test (but possibly all of them) shows a p-value of less than 0.5% (5/10=0.5). No test meets that criterion in Bem's first experiment. However severe this might seem, it is still not enough. The correct number to use is not the number of tests actually mentioned in the article, but the number of tests from which the author would have derived the conclusion. In the case of the Bem's first experiment, this is far more than the number of 10 tests acknowledged by the psychologist. First of all, every test in the paper is made unilaterally (see below). In experiment 5, for example, Bem conducts a retroactive habituation task: subjects are asked to indicate which of two pictures they prefer, and are afterward exposed to a random picture chosen among the two prior stimuli (for instance, a car accident and a broken leg). In a traditional habituation task, the target is presented first several times and leads either to an increased preference of that same target (simple exposure effect) or to a decreased preference (boredom effect), depending on many factors including the number of repetitions. Here, Bem says that he is testing for a simple retrograde exposure effect. Doing a unilateral test means that had the subjects chosen the target with a probability significantly less than 50%, Bem would not have concluded that this was proof of precognition. But this would, of course, be either an example of negative psi or an example of a boredom effect...thus a proof of precognition in both cases. We therefore have good reasons to believe that such a result would have actually led the psychologist to conclude he has proof of precognition via a retrograde boredom effect, or negative psi. Conducting a unilateral test chosen a posteriori is equivalent to doing two unilateral tests. Since Bem did not have a good reason to believe that a probability significantly less then 50% would not be a proof of precognition, we must think that he actually chose the \"right\" test after the experiment had been finished. This amounts to doing two tests: one to check if the observed percentage is significantly more than 50%, one to check if it is significantly less. In experiment 1, Bem tests for negative, neutral, positive, romantic but non-erotic, and erotic pictures. This would make 5 tests. But Bem did 2 tests in each case (a so-called t-test, and a binomial test), leading to 10 tests. Table 1 shows for each experiment the number of tests involved, the least risk for which at least one test mentioned leads to a \"proof of precognition,\" and the maximum p-value after correction for multiple-testing, considering the number of tests Bem would probably have accepted, based on the number of tests actually mentioned. |Experiment |2||48 | 3 types of pictures, 4 tests) |.10||.9| |3||16 | (2 types of pictures, 4 tests) |.31||.7| |4||8 | (2 cutoffs, 2 transformations) |.62||1.4| |5||24 | (2 genders, 3 types of pictures, 2 tests) |.21||1.4| |6||32 | (2 genders, 4 types of pictures, 2 tests) |.16||3.7| |7||16 | (4 tests, 2 types of pictures) |.31||9.6| |8||6 | (3 groups) |.82||2.9| |9||6 | (3 groups) |.82||.2*| |ALL||176||.03||.2| Bem claims to have produced 8 proofs of precognition through 9 experiments (he only recognizes a lack of conclusive results for experiment 7). After a correction procedure for multiple-testing, only 1 of the nine experiments still shows what looks like a significant result. Is there, then, one proof of precognition? This is far from sure. Before coming to such a conclusion, one must indeed consider (as Bem himself admits) that experiments 8 and 9 test the same hypothesis of retroactive facilitation of recall: should we then not separate them, and look at experiments 8 and 9 together? Even more, shouldn't we consider that all nine experiments together test the same precognition-hypothesis? Doing so, we face 176 tests attempting to prove precognition, as displayed in the last line of Table 1. The maximum admissible p-value is then .03%, far less than the best value Bem reports (.2%). From this we may reasonably conclude that there is no statistical proof of precognition in Bem's study! Wagenmakers et al. wisely advise distinguishing between exploratory studies and confirmatory studies. A work such as Bem's is the consequence of not following that piece of advice. Being generous, we may say that Bem's research is an investigation of what might be true in various precognition conditions. Since only one situation leads to suggestive results, it is now time to test it, following the golden rule of statisticians \"One hypothesis, one test\u2014chosen prior to the experiment.\" We must admit that the statistical flaw in Bem's article often show up in social science. Psychologists often publish many tests around the same hypothesis. But there is, however, a big difference between psychological science and parapsychology. When a psychologist claims to have a proof of an unexpected strange phenomenon, many other psychologists attempt to replicate the experiment. So do parapsychologists. But when psychologists fail to reproduce a conclusion, they abandon their previous hypothesis (such as the \"Mozart effect\"), whereas parapsychologists show a tendency to explain the failure by other factors than their previous error. They may, for instance, invoke the presence of a skeptic's mind around the laboratory (James Randi has been so accused). Social scientists and parapsychologists share some bad statistical habits, but social scientists have efficient correction-methods that parapsychologists do not.

Synthesizing thirty years of research, Michael Shermer upends traditional thinking about how humans form beliefs about the world. Simply put, beliefs come first, and explanations for beliefs follow. The brain, Shermer argues, is a belief engine. Using sensory data that flow in through the senses, the brain naturally looks for and finds patterns\u2014and then infuses those patterns with meaning, forming beliefs. Once beliefs are formed, our brains subconsciously seek out confirmatory evidence in support of those beliefs, accelerating the process of reinforcing them\u2014and round and round the process goes in a positive feedback loop. Shermer provides countless real-world examples of how this process operates, from politics, economics, and religion to conspiracy theories, the supernatural, and the paranormal. And ultimately, he demonstrates why science is the best tool ever devised to determine whether or not our beliefs match reality.

The 9.0 magnitude Thoku earthquake and tsunami which devastated Japan on March 11th, 2011 is being reported as one of the five most powerful earthquakes since seismological records began being kept in 1900. The awesome destructive power of our constantly changing world is highlighted by these kinds of disasters on a fairly regular basis, but does the understanding of when and how these events may happen change the way humans are choosing to live on dangerous planet Earth? This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with Dr. Donald R. Prothero, professor of geology at Occidental College in Los Angeles and a lecturer in geobiology at Caltech about his new book Catastrophes! Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Tornadoes, and other Earth-Shattering Disasters which discusses not only the dangers we face from geographical challenges but also those that affect us all: overpopulation, and global climate change. About this week's feature article For decades, controversy has surrounded the so-called \"Mars Effect.\" On one side, believers claim proof that astrological signs predict specific human outcomes (e.g. the success of sports stars). On the other side, skeptics claim that no such evidence has been demonstrated in controlled experiments and data analysis. We ran an article by Alexander Panchin (The Saturn-Mars Effect) in [volume 16, number 1](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol16n01.html) of Skeptic magazine offering an explanation for the effect as a statistical artifact. In this week's eSkeptic, we present Australian skeptic Geoffrey Dean's critical analysis of Panchin's article followed by Panchin's response. [SUBSCRIBE to Skeptic magazine](https://www.skeptic.com/subscribe) for more great debates like these. The Mars Effect & True Disbelievers by Geoffrey Dean According to Alexander Panchin in Vol. 16, No. 1, if you take 535 people in any profession and count the frequency of any planet (out of 10) in any two sectors (out of 12) at their birth, and randomize everything a million times, the highest mean total is nonsignificantly different from the observed total for Mars in sectors 1 and 4 for 535 eminent sports champions. So the Mars effect is \"a statistical anomaly and nothing more.\" Such an explanation has been touted by skeptics again and again (Panchin is decades away from being the first), but it cannot possibly apply. Why? Because right from the start it was known that planetary effects (not just Mars effects) replicate\u2014a point stressed in three of the references Panchin cites. Replication requires profession, planet and sectors to be specified in advance, so counting any planet in any two sectors for any profession is not relevant, especially when you assume that planets move independently (they don't), that expectancies in each sector are equal (they aren't), and that demography doesn't matter (it does). Incidentally Gauquelin did not use 535 champions (the Comit\u00e9 Para did), and 535 does not appear anywhere in the reference that Panchin cites for it. Nor were eminent sports champions the start of it all (it was eminent doctors). Michel Gauquelin (1928-1991) was a Sorbonne graduate in psychology and statistics, and was fully aware of everything Panchin implies he was ignorant of. So his first priority after observing planetary effects was to see if they replicated. And they did. Again and again. Not just in France but also in Holland, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and America for a total of nearly thirty thousand eminent births. This work was done in the 1950s through the 1980s. In 1987 the statistician I.J.Good \"tried to dwindle the Mars effect, partly by allowing for 'special selection' of planet and attributes, and managed to get the Bayes factor down to about 60, but faced with the Saturn, Jupiter, and Moon effects, this approach will clearly not undermine Gauquelin's results\" (Journal of the American Statistical Association 98, 697-698, 1987). Nor did tests by skeptics. Two decisive tests are shown in my figure. The results support a Mars effect. Underlying both tests were True Disbelievers behaving badly towards (for them) inconvenient results. The Comit\u00e9 Para claimed that errors existed despite their own clear evidence to the contrary, which for eight years they failed to disclose. CSICOP spent five years dodging and weaving and casting personal slurs. Dr Richard Kammann (a CSICOP Fellow and co-author of The Psychology of the Psychic) spent seven months sifting the published papers and unpublished background papers and letters. He concluded that the CSICOP skeptics \"have persisted in offering to the public a set of demonstrably false statistical arguments against the Mars effect in spite of four years of continuous and steadily mounting criticism of their illogic. ... When the whole record is examined over five years, there is almost no instance in which merit wins out over self-serving bias\" (Zetetic Scholar 10, 50-65, 1982; see 66-73 for articles on the Comit\u00e9 Para test). Today there are eight independent studies and nearly thirty of Gauquelin's replication studies. Meta-analysis confirms that planetary effect sizes are tiny (mean r = 0.044) but significant, see my chapter 13 in Brian Farha's Paranormal Claims: A Critical Analysis (2007). The problem of course is one of explaining how planets (not all of them, just some of them) could have an effect on people (just eminent people, not the 99.994% on Gauquelin's figures who are not eminent), albeit with tiny effect sizes that could not be explained by artifacts of astronomy, demography, bias, data selection, or fraud (all favourite ploys of desperate skeptics). But there's more. Why no link with physical variables such as size and distance? Why no link with the Sun? Why is eminence important? Why is the effect larger for less-precise birth times? (This is like saying the more we tune our radio the worse the reception\u2014it is definitely not what we expect.) And so on. It is these puzzles, not just planetary effects, that are the real challenge of Gauquelin's work. In fact the misreporting of birth data by a mere 3% of parents to suit pop astrological ideas current at the time seems enough to explain all the puzzles, see my article in Skeptical Inquirer for May/June 2002 available online. Most of the relevant births are from the 19th and early 20th centuries when planetary positions were publicly available and misreporting was easy. Its success at explaining all the puzzles (and the total failure of other artifacts) should dispel any doubts about its relevance. Furthermore, misreporting (when possible) is almost universal. Eminent Americans and Congressmen misreport their birth date to make it coincide with a significant day, thus allowing \"image enhancement through unit associations between oneself and positively evaluated stimuli\" (Social Psychology Quarterly 51(4), 365-370, 1988), at a level notably more than for Gauquelin's eminent professionals. Modern Asians control things at even higher levels to achieve birth years deemed auspicious by Chinese astrology (Population and Development Review 17, 663-686, 1991). But misreporting will not explain planetary effects unless the effects disappear when births are reported by doctors instead of by parents, as was increasingly true in Europe after the second world war. As yet nobody knows if they do or not. But it could be argued that Gauquelin's failure to observe a consistent Mars effect for sports champions born after 1950 has already put this point to the test. All that heat under the True Disbelievers' collar seems to have been premature. Sadly the existence of misreporting in birth data did not emerge until after Gauquelin's death. He was ever the perfect scientist, always philosophical, confiding with a grin that he might or might not be right, and never sure he would live to see the puzzles solved. Today it seems clear that he was right and the True Disbelievers were wrong. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Geoffrey Dean is a technical editor in Perth, Western Australia, and a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. He and his associates have been contributing critiques of astrology to Skeptical Inquirer since 1985. Response from Alexander Panchin To falsify the claim that the observed Mars Effect is an artifact induced by multiple-comparisons a single reference is sufficient. It must be a well-designed peer-reviewed study that would replicate the Mars Effect at a decent significance level involving a non-biased selection of eminent athletes (eminence being defined before the data is analyzed) and performed in a way that insures the complete independence of the athlete sample from the sample available at the time the Mars Effect was first described as eminent athletes being born more often under planet Mars in sectors 1 and 4. Such evidence is surely not so difficult to obtain in the era of digital technology. An example of how the replication of an association study is properly performed and described in non-fringe scientific fields such as molecular biology can be found online (Flachsbart et. al, PNAS February 24, 2009 vol. 106 no. 8 2700-2705) To my current knowledge, available studies allegedly replicating the Mars Effect fail to match some or all of the mentioned requirements. For example Geoffrey Dean states that the Mars Effect is supported by the 303 sports-champions CSICOP test. But these 303 sports-champions were a subsample randomly chosen from Gauquelin's sample. One may call this is an independent study, but it is not a study performed on an independent sample. Such studies cannot be used to exclude errors introduced by multiple-comparisons. If the Mars Effect is indeed an artifact introduced by multiple-comparisons, then the sample used by Gauquelin does contain a lot of eminent athletes born under planet Mars in sectors 1 and 4 and it is not unlikely that a random subsample of this sample will inherit this overrepresentation. While Geoffrey Dean claims that the Mars Effect can be replicated he mentions that Gauquelin failed to \"observe a consistent Mars effect for sports champions born after 1950\" - which seems to be an argument against the previous statement. However, this is in agreement with certain studies, such as the U.S. study performed by Paul Kurtz and colleagues (Kurtz et. al 1979) that failed to replicate the Mars Effect. This is also in agreement with the idea that the Mars Effect initially observed by Gauquelin was a result of multiple-comparisons. In fact, Gauquelin was unlikely to not observe any false-positives (at a very good uncorrected significance level) considering the fact that he did study different professions and introduced even more multiple comparisons by analyzing subsamples of samples (such as eminent non-basketball players). Geoffrey Dean states that the explanation of the Mars Effect due to the multiple-comparison error \"has been touted by skeptics again and again\". I don't see how this matters in relation to my argument, but I would like to note that no reference to an article in which this particular error is addressed is provided. I have found no discussion of multiple-comparisons in the works of Gauquelin or his successors. I believe that if I am merely ignorant on this subject it would be very easy for Geoffrey Dean to point that out with a single referenced quote. The argument that Michel Gauquelin was a graduate in statistics and was aware of the multiple-comparison error is an \"appeal to accomplishment\" fallacy. Other examples of \"appeal to accomplishment\" include mentioning the long periods of time certain astrological studies took to conduct, as if this would reflect their quality. Constantly referring to fellow skeptics as \"True Disbelievers\" is just judgmental language and not suitable for a public conversation on a scientific topic, even if it is actually fringe science we are talking about. I also believe that this subject hardly deserves any more attention than it currently has. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Alexander Y.

In this week's eSkeptic, professor of geology and author of the new book [Catastrophes: Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Tornadoes, and other Earth-Shattering Disasters](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801896924/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0801896924), Dr. Donald R. Prothero shines a scientific light on some of this misinformation and discusses the difficult nature of earthquake prediction. Read [Donald Prothero's detailed bio](#Prothero) below. Quacks & Quakes by Donald Prothero The great Sendai earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, generated not only huge coverage in all the media, but also brought all the crazies out of the woodwork (as any major earthquake or natural disaster does). I've discussed the geophysical and geological details [in a separate post](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/03/quakes-and-fake.html), but the storm of misinformation and myths flying around the media and internet was overwhelming. My email box was filled with questions about these events, because I've been doing publicity for my new book [Catastrophes: Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Tornadoes, and other Earth-Shattering Disasters](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801896924/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0801896924) (Johns Hopkins University Press). There were not only the usual myths about earthquakes, but also an additional layer of apocalyptic speculation and \"end of the world\" prophecies, plus the crazies who believe the 2012 myth. Among those that got their 15 minutes of fame during the post-quake media blitz was a well-known crank, Jim Berkland, who got a [full interview promoting his ideas](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/81380209/) on Fox News on March 17 (but on no other network). First, the reporter put up a map of the \"Ring of Fire\" of volcanoes and earthquakes around the Pacific Rim, pointed at Chile, then New Zealand, then Japan, and implied that this circle of quakes might end in California. Apparently, he never consulted a geologist, who would have pointed out that each of those regions is an entirely different type of plate boundary and they have no [tectonic plates in common](http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2011/03/28/17784716.html). Then Fox gave Berkland a full five minutes to spout his ideas, with the same credulous reporter tossing him softball questions, and no rebuttal from any other geologist or seismologist. Berkland rambled on about animal behavior and fish die-offs in California (which have been [explained by unusual water conditions](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-08/us/california.dead.fish_1_dead-fish-sardine-school-massive-fish?_s=PM:US)), never mentioning that such die-offs are common and not statistically associated with earthquakes (nor is there any plausible mechanism that might link them). He blathered on about how animals sense unusual magnetic fields before the quake, an argument that has been thoroughly debunked. Berkland mentions several other quakes he claims to have \"predicted,\" with no fact-checking or examination of his overall record of \"prediction.\" He also demonstrated the classic persecution complex of all cranks and fringe scientists, dismissing real scientists and their \"black boxes\" when he uses methods with no rigor or peer review. He then used his airtime to boldly predict that a great California quake would happen on March 19, the perigee of the \"supermoon,\" with a prediction window running to March 26. Well, those dates have come and gone, and we don't see Fox News interviewing him again to explain what went wrong. If Fox had bothered to do minimal research about him, they would never have wasted the airtime and panicked people unnecessarily. First of all, Berkland is not a seismologist but a geologist with only a B.A. and some graduate training, who served in several different government positions before retiring in 1994. Berkland is touted as having predicted the Loma Prieta earthquake, something that he uses as his main publicity hook and was promoted on the Fox broadcast. However, there are questions about this prediction. That region had already been targeted a year earlier as a \"seismic gap\" or one of the most likely areas for the next big quake. According to the [University of Washington Pacific Northwest Seismic Network](http://www.ess.washington.edu/SEIS/PNSN/INFO_GENERAL/eq_prediction.html) site, \"The segment of the San Andreas fault that broke in the 1989 M 7.1 Loma Prieta or \"World Series\" earthquake had been identified by the USGS as one of the more likely segments of the San Andreas to rupture. Magnitude 5+ earthquakes 2 and 15 months before the damaging earthquake were treated as possible foreshocks, and the USGS issued 5-day Public Advisories through the California Office of Emergency Services.\" So it was no great shakes to follow this prediction and pick a date. Berkland just got lucky and happened to mention it to a reporter for a local paper in Gilroy, California, so it was actually recorded in the public record. Once his complete record of quake prediction is examined more closely, its \"success rate\" falls apart. It's a classic case of cherry-picking the favorable data, and also confirmation bias, used by fortune-tellers and faith healers and swindlers of every kind for centuries: people remember the hits and forget the misses. Berkland got one lucky \"hit\" and most people never bother to check his overall track record. Seismologist Roger Hunter did a careful statistical study, published in the Skeptical Inquirer, and found that his \"predictions\" were no better than chance. [1](#note01) Berkland's claim is that when the tidal forces of the alignment of the moon and sun are at a maximum (a syzygy, as he calls it), they can exert a pull on the earth's crust and trigger earthquakes. This idea goes back to at least 1897, and has some plausibility, since the tidal attraction does exert some force on the earth's crust. However, when geophysicists at the UCLA Institute for Geophysics and Planetary Physics conducted a rigorous study, they found no statistical relationship between the two. [2](#note02) Several other studies have also tested the connections between tides and earthquakes, and found no statistically significant correlations. [3](#note03) The only possible correlation might occur when tidal forces pull on shallow thrust faults but the faults in Berkland's March 19 prediction for California are all deep vertical strike-slip faults, none with the type of motion that fit the shallow thrust-fault model. The fault that caused the Sendai quake is a deep subduction zone, not a shallow thrust. The only other possible place where tides might affect quakes is in the rift valleys of mid-ocean ridges, miles under the middle of the ocean, [4](#note04) and far from the areas that Berkland has focused his predictions. In addition to Berkland's questionable methods and lack of consistent success in prediction based on tides, he also uses animal behavior as a guide to predicting earthquakes. His \"highly rigorous\" method is to survey the newspaper for an unusual number of lost dog and cat reports in the classified ads section. The idea that animals can predict earthquakes has been [carefully analyzed](http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/rockdef/lectures/animal%20behaviour%20california%20geology.pdf) and has failed the test again and again. Animals may be more sensitive than humans to the P-waves, which are the fastest seismic waves and arrive several seconds before the destructive S-waves in regions far from the epicenter\u2014but this gives warnings of only a few seconds in any place that is likely to experience strong shaking. If animals are sensitive to other disturbances in the earth's crust that happen more than a few seconds before the quake itself, it has never been reliably corroborated. In addition, this method runs into the same problem that most short-term earthquake prediction methods have encountered: no two earthquakes are alike. Some have precursors, and others don't. Thus, if animals did act strangely before a particular quake occurred (just as some geophysical precursors have been observed on some quakes), there is no evidence that they reliably predict most quakes (just as many quakes don't have precursors). This leads to the bigger issue: the best geophysicists in the world have been working hard on short-term earthquake prediction for decades, but most would concede that we are not much closer than we were fifty years ago. We are very successful at giving long-term warnings of months to years in advance for regions that are overdue for a big quake (\"seismic gaps\") and these predictions have worked reliably. But short-term prediction has always foundered on the maddening problem that no two faults behave in the same way. Back in the 1970s, dilatancy theory about ground deformation found a series of precursors, and led to the successful prediction of the Feb. 4, 1975, Haicheng quake in China. But just 17 months later, there were no precursors for the July 28, 1976, Tangshan earthquake, and about half a million people died. Since this failure, seismologists have become much more cautious about short-term earthquake prediction. Most will candidly admit that there will probably never be a reliable method of short-term prediction. This leaves room for quacks like Jim Berkland to step in, brag about his questionable Loma Prieta \"prediction,\" and get free media attention. Then he can rely on the fact that reporters these days do no research into his background, nor do they confront him after each failed prediction to ask him what went wrong. As Charles Richter himself said, \"Only fools, liars, and charlatans predict earthquakes.\" You can be the judge of which category best fits Berkland.

The solution to last week's Mystery Photo The solution to the [ Mystery Photo from March 23](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/11-03-23/#MysteryPhoto): a device called \"Frank's Box,\" (a.k.a. the \"telephone to the dead,\") rumored to have been first invented by Thomas Edison, and is today constructed by a Colorado man named Frank Sumption. It is used for talking to the dead. I saw it at a paranormal conference Univ-Con in Pennsylvania, organized by Ryan Buell, the telegenic host of A&E's television unreality series Paranormal State. I was invited to provide some scientific sensibility. \"Frank's Box,\" according to its inventor, \"consists of a random voltage generator, which is used to tune an AM receiver module rapidly. The audio from the tuner (raw audio) is amplified and fed to an echo chamber, where the spirits manipulate it to form their voices.\" Apparently this is difficult, so the user I saw, Christopher Moon (the pony-tailed senior editor of Haunted Times magazine), employs the help of \"Tyler,\" a spirit \"technician\" who he calls upon to corral wayward spirits to within earshot of the receiver. What it sounds like is the rapid twirling of a radio dial so that only noises and word fragments are audible. It is a perfect example of what I call \"patternicity,\" the tendency to find meaningful patterns in meaningless noise, and the next day I put it to the test when Moon gave me a personal demo. With the Telephone to the Dead squawking away I tried to connect to my deceased father and mother, asking for any \"validation\" of a connection\u2014name, cause of death...anything. I coaxed and cajoled. Nothing. Moon asked Tyler to intervene. Nothing. Moon said he heard something, but when I pressed him he came up with nothing. I willingly suspended my disbelief in hopes of talking to my parents whom I miss dearly. Nothing. I searched for any pattern I might find. Nothing. And that, I'm afraid, is my assessment of the paranormal. Nothing.

How can political candidates use social media to their advantage, and what makes the game \"Angry Birds\" so addicting? This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with Charles L.

About this week's feature article In this week's eSkeptic, we reprint an essay in which Michael Shermer conjectures about the many paradoxes that arise from theories of time travel. Shermer reviews some of the problems which scientists have determined will relegate time travel to the realm of science fiction. This article is copyright \u00a9 2002 by Scientific American, Inc. All rights reserved. It also appeared in [Skeptic magazine volume 10, number 1](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol10n01.html) (2003). The Chronology Projector Conjecture The mind is still the safest way to time travel by Michael Shermer In an episode of the original [Star Trek](https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/star-trek-original-series/id218818763?at=10l6ex) series, Dr. McCoy falls through a time portal in a city \"on the edge of forever\" and changes the past in a way that erases the Enterprise and her crew, with the exception of a landing party, Captain Kirk, and Mr. Spock, who must return to the past to fix what McCoy has undone. Time travel is a well-worn staple of science fiction writers, but not only does it violate numerous physical laws, there are fundamental problems of consistency and causality. The most prominent is the \"matricide paradox\" in which you travel back in time and kill your mother before she gave birth to you, which means you could not have been born to then travel back in time to kill your mother. In [Back to the Future](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/back-to-the-future/id380239015?at=10l6ex), Marty McFly faces a related but opposite dilemma in which he must arrange for his mother to date his father in order to ensure his conception. One way around such paradoxes can be found in extremely sophisticated virtual reality machines (think of a holodeck), programmed to replicate a past time and place in such detail that it is indistinguishable from a real past (which one can never know in full in any case). Another option involves a multiple universes model of cosmology in which you travel back in time to a different but closely parallel universe to our own, as portrayed in Michael Crichton's novel [Timeline](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345417623/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0345417623), where the characters journey to another universe's Medieval Europe without any concern of mucking up our own chronology. The fundamental shortcoming for both of these time travel scenarios is that it isn't really your past. A virtual reality time machine is simply a museum writ large, and transporting to some other universe's past would be like going back and meeting someone like your mother, who marries someone like your father, producing someone like, but not you\u2014surely a less appealing trip than one in your own time-line. To make that trip you need the time machine of Caltech's Kip Thorne, who had his interest piqued in time travel when he received a phone call one day from Carl Sagan, who was looking for a way to get the heroine of his novel [Contact](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671004107/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0671004107)\u2014Eleanor Arroway (played by Jody Foster in the film version)\u2014to the star Vega, 26 light years away. The problem Sagan faced, as all science fiction writers do in such situations, is that at the speed of, say, the Voyager spacecraft, it would take about 490,000 years to get to Vega. That's a long time to sit, even if you are in first class with your seat back and tray table down. Thorne's solution, adopted by Sagan, was to send Ellie through a wormhole\u2014a hypothetical space warp similar to a black hole in which you enter the mouth, fall through a short tube of infinitely curved spacetime that leads to an exit hole somewhere else in the universe (think of a tube running through the middle of a basketball\u2014 instead of going all the way around the surface of the ball to get to the other side, you tunnel through the middle). Since, as Einstein showed, space and time are intimately entangled, Thorne theorized that by warping space one might also be warping time, and that by falling through a wormhole in one direction it might be possible to travel backward in time. Thorne's initial calculations showed that it was theoretically possible for Ellie to travel just one kilometer down the wormhole tunnel and emerge near Vega moments later\u2014not even time for a bag of peanuts. After publishing his theory in a technical physics journal in 1988, Kip was branded by the media as \"The Man Who Invented Time Travel.\" Not one to encourage such sensationalism, Thorne continued his research and by the early 1990s began growing skeptical of his own thesis. Whether it is possible to actually travel through a wormhole without being crushed out of existence, Thorne reasoned, depends on the laws of quantum gravity, which are not fully understood at this point. What he and his colleagues ultimately discovered is that, as Kip told me, \"all time machines are likely to self destruct the moment they are activated.\" Thorne's colleague Stephen Hawking agreed, only half sardonically calling this conclusion the \"chronology protection conjecture,\" in which \"the laws of physics do not allow time machines,\" thus keeping \"the world safe for historians.\" Besides, Hawking wondered, if time travel were possible, where are all the time tourists from the future? It's a good question and, in conjunction with the paradoxes and physical law constraints, makes me skeptical as well. Until much more is known about quantum gravity and wormholes, virtual reality machines and multiple universes, I'll do my time traveling through the chronology projector of the mind.

In the year 2000 startling claims of a body cast of a Bigfoot emerged from the deep woods of Washington State.

About this week's feature article In this week's eSkeptic, in a spin on David Letterman's \"Stupid Pet Tricks,\" psychologist Bryan Farha examines the very real world of stupid pet psychic tricks\u2014people who think their pets have psychic power. Farha not only debunks the claims of psychic pet owners but reveals how the tricks are done through a series of techniques based on natural (not supernatural) powers. (From Skeptic magazine [volume 10, number 1](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol10n01.html), 2003.) Bryan Farha is a professor and director of Applied Behavioural Studies at Oklahoma City University and a licensed professional Counselor and editor of [Paranormal Claims: A Critical Analysis](tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0761837728). Stupid \"Pet Psychic\" Tricks Crossing Over with Fifi and Fido on the Animal Planet Network by Bryan Farha If David Letterman wants to expand his \"Stupid Pet Tricks\" segment on the Late Show to include stupid pet psychic tricks, I believe we have a winner. Move over James Van Praagh and John Edward, there's a new television show in town. The Animal Planet cable network has launched Pet Psychic, which is hosted by England-born Sonya Fitzpatrick. During Sonya's introductory bio on each telecast, she claims to be able to \"hear the thoughts\" of all animals in her vicinity. On the show, Sonya \"reads\" the thoughts of a variety of animals, asking the pets questions, and claiming to get answers from the critters. She then communicates the answer to the pet owner, who feels comforted after the alleged telepathic communication. Sometimes questions are requested by animal owners, who are often interested in finding out reasons for peculiar pet behaviors. And she's multi-talented, also \"crossing over\" to communicate with pets that have died. Further, Sonya also professes ability to function as a pet psychic detective. For example, there is a $4,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the person or persons who abused a cat named \"TLC.\" The abused cat \"told\" Sonya that the guilty person was a thin male with dark hair who didn't like cats. One member of the veterinary staff who treated TLC said of Sonya's psychic detective work that the staff was \"shocked\" at her accuracy and that \"any kind of skepticism fades away.\" Excuse me, but this is where skepticism enters. Let's look at some \"Stupid Pet Psychic Tricks\" used by Sonya Fitzpatrick to make her appear psychic. All are taken from a single program, which aired on July 1, 2002. Prediction Based on Prior Knowledge \"Tony\" the Llama. Sonya made a house call to a ranch outside her current residence of Houston for this alleged telepathic experience. She accurately pointed out that Tony had some behavioral issues and that he was a problem llama. The fact that the owner confirmed this made the statements seem very impressive. Stupid Pet Psychic Trick: Immediately before her psychic vision of the llama's behavioral problems, Tony jerked and flailed noticeably while being observed by Sonya and the owner. After seeing this unruly behavior, just how psychic was it to predict that the llama had disciplinary problems? Anyone could have had the same psychic vision after observing a child who misbehaved like this, even before being told of such a problem. Yet the owner seemed impressed, and probably many in the television audience as well. Percy and Bogie. It was never established which one was which, but referring to one of the dogs, this dialog took place between Sonya and the pet's owner: Sonya: When did he have some medication? Owner: He's had an ear infection. Sonya: Yah \u2014 he [dog] says that was bad. He says he's had that on and off. Stupid Pet Psychic Trick: Notice Sonya only makes this last comment after already hearing the owner say the dog had an ear infection. If Sonya can communicate with animals, why didn't she just ask the dog initially what the medication was for and report the answer to us before the owner did? But she asked a general question about medication and got a specific answer from the pet's owner, and wants us to believe that the dog told her the experience was bad? \"Bonnie\" the Dog. This dog kept growling and snarling before Sonya said anything. Therefore, Sonya's first comment about the dog's behavior was, \"she's a talker.\" Stupid Pet Psychic Trick: How hard is it to convince an owner of this given the free prior knowledge of snarling and growling? Making the Obvious Seem Telepathic Two Cats: Sonya asked the owner if one of the cats crawls under things. The amazed owner confirmed this and said they both go under the covers with her. Stupid Pet Psychic Trick: What's amazing about this? What cat doesn't crawl under things? And it didn't have to be the covers. Don't most cats crawl under desks, tables, sofas, beds, and any other available space? The owner was impressed enough to believe one of the cats told Sonya she'd prefer it if the owner would buy a second litter box \u2014 one for each cat. \"Bonnie\" Again: Sonya states, \"she's [Bonnie] asking me why is it that you [owner] don't want her on you sometimes?\" Stupid Pet Psychic Trick: The owner's answer is the same that most of us would give \u2014 because sometimes we've got other things we need to do like cook, work on the computer, etc. Maybe this category should have been labeled, \"Duh.\" Crossing Over Willie: Willie was a diseased Golden Retriever. His owner had arranged to have him euthanatized by a veterinarian. Sonya had a vision \u2014 which the owner confirmed \u2014 that Willie used to scratch behind his ears. Really? A dog scratching behind his ears? Shocking. Making it Fit \"Joy\" Who Crossed Over. Joy is a cat who ran away without apparent cause and supposedly died. In an effort to find out why Joy ran away, this dialog ensued: Sonya: When did you [owner] change a floor in your house? [no response]. Or a carpet? Owner: We just cleaned our carpet. Sonya goes on to say that Joy ran away because they cleaned the carpet. But if Sonya can communicate with dead animals, why didn't she just ask the departed cat the question and provide the answer before asking the owner about changing the floor? More important, wasn't Sonya's question really implying that a different floor was installed? When people are asked if they've changed a floor, aren't they assuming a new floor was installed? Yet the owner had no problem adjusting what Sonya had said. People who want to believe are going to make any statement fit. Comforting Themes Recall the old rule of fortune telling \u2014 \"tell 'em what they want to hear.\" Pet owners want to hear things that will make them feel good about their animals. It's especially important for grieving owners to feel comfort when the pet has \"crossed over.\" Sonya made the following comments, all during a single July 1, 2002 show about various pets that had died and were \"telepathically\" communicating their thoughts to her: \"He loves you;\" \"He's with you all the time;\" all the time.\" Sonya told Felicia, the pet owner who was feeling guilty about putting her dog Willie to sleep, that the departed Willie reassured her, \"I was ready to go...you did the right thing.\" Concluding Remarks Obviously, Sonya is using old rehashed fortune telling and psychic \"tricks\" that only appear new when done under the guise of communicating with animals. It's difficult enough for skeptics to verify human psychic claims because of the vagueness of the readings. Since animals don't speak our tongue (sorry, Sonya), verifiability would be even more difficult with pet psychics. But some of her claims do lend themselves to controlled testing \u2014 Sonya needs to ask the animals direct and specific questions and then let the owners verify the answers. I would like to challenge Sonya to take the Million Dollar Psychic Challenge from the James Randi Educational Foundation. If she's not interested in the money, she can donate the earnings to her favorite animal charity. Television is about money, too, and surely this type of programming sells. It just doesn't seem as if it belongs on the Animal Planet \u2014 an otherwise good network. If Sonya won't contact James Randi, maybe she'll contact David Letterman.

James N. Gardner is an Oregon attorney and the author, most recently, of [The Intelligent Universe: AI, ET, and the Emerging Mind of the Cosmos](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1564149196?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1564149196). The Ultimate Multiverse a book review by James N. Gardner Best-selling science author Brian Greene is a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and is highly regarded in the scientific community for a number of conceptual breakthroughs in superstring theory. (Superstring theory proposes that subatomic particles such as quarks, electrons and neutrinos are really just different modes of vibration of tiny one-dimensional filaments of energy, oscillating furiously in hidden fragments of 11-dimensional spacetime.) Greene's first two books\u2014 [The Elegant Universe](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375708111?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0375708111) and [The Fabric of the Cosmos](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375727205?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0375727205)\u2014covered the history and essential features of superstring theory. In [The Hidden Reality](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307265633?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307265633) Greene shifts his focus from the infinitesimally small\u2014strings are thought to measure only about 10-33 centimeters in length\u2014to the inconceivably vast: the theoretical ensemble of all possible universes that cosmologists have dubbed the multiverse. In the good old days of classical physics that culminated in Einstein's general theory of relativity, it was assumed that there was only one universe. The dictionary definition of \"universe\"\u2014the totality of all things that exist\u2014was thought to coincide with the physical reality of the cosmos. Then came the stunning discovery that what we regard as the universe was born in a stupendous burst of energy known as the Big Bang about 13.7 billion years ago. That discovery sparked a series of revolutionary developments, including the mind-boggling idea that multiple Big Bangs are detonating constantly in a process called eternal inflation, birthing new baby universes that will be forever inaccessible from our corner of the multiverse. This is the exotic cosmic terrain through which Greene provides expert guidance. We learn, for instance, that in an infinite multiverse there will necessarily exist more-or-less exact duplicates of earthlings, living out their lives on a spooky mirror version of our planet: If space extends infinitely far\u2014a proposition that is consistent with all observations and that is part of the cosmological model favored by many physicists and astronomers\u2014then there must be realms out there (likely way out there) where copies of you and me and everything else are enjoying alternate versions of the reality we experience here. Greene's speculations on the possible existence of a vast thicket of parallel universes concludes with two fanciful possibilities\u2014first, that a super-advanced civilization might actually be able to fabricate a new baby universe artificially, and second, that such a civilization could conceivably decide to forego the messy chore of launching a process of artificial cosmic inflation and instead simply develop a software simulation of a new cosmos so sophisticated that it would be indistinguishable from the real thing. If that were possible, Greene asks provocatively, how would we know that we are not, right now, hooked into a cosmically extended version of SimCity? But even this is not the final word on the outlandish possibilities inherent in the idea of parallel universes. That honor is reserved for what Greene calls the Ultimate Multiverse, which is a mega-conglomerate that consists of all possible universes. In one corner of the Ultimate Multiverse is the strangest universe of all\u2014a universe that consists of absolutely nothing. No space. No time. No matter. No energy. This is a notion, Greene notes, that answers 17th Century mathematician Gottfried Leibniz's famous question\u2014\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\"\u2014in a precise and novel way: \"In the Ultimate Multiverse, a universe consisting of nothing does exist.\" NEW ON SKEPTICBLOG.ORG From the Junior Skeptic Vault: An Interview with Dr. Steve O'Shea Daniel Loxton shares a [Junior Skeptic](https:/www.skeptic.com/junior_skeptic/) interview he did with renowned New Zealand-based teuthologist Steve O'Shea who studies some of the world's largest, strangest, and least-known predators of the sea.

Not Just About Religion [Peter A. Corning](https://www.skeptic.com/author/skeptic/)| [Comments (1)](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/unmasking-darwins-cathedral/#comments) A review of David Sloan Wilson's [ Darwin's Cathedral: Evolution, Religion, and the Nature of Society](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226901351?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0226901351) (2003, University Of Chicago Press). FROM THE MARK OF ZORRO TO SPIDERMAN, literature, film and comic books have exploited the storyline of a super-hero disguised as a milquetoast: a self-indulgent fop, a mild-mannered newspaperman, or a terminal geek. Biologist David Sloan Wilson could hardly be likened to a milquetoast and neither could his acclaimed book [Darwin's Cathedral](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226901351?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0226901351). In fact it is a major contribution to a highly visible and sometimes bitterly controversial debate. Wilson advances the thesis that organized religion, for the most part, is not an irrational phenomenon, much less a non-functional cultural \"spandrel.\" In many ways Wilson contradicts the many skeptics of religion. Religious organizations, he says, perform an important adaptive role in human societies. They represent culturally-evolved \"workarounds\" that often provide unifying, coordinating, and supportive functions for large-scale human groups. In other words, moral systems may contribute significantly to our biological survival and reproduction. Other evolutionary theorists have made similar arguments over the years (Sir Arthur Keith, Edward O. Wilson, and Richard Alexander come to mind), but none (to my knowledge) has proposed it as a testable scientific hypothesis or marshaled an array of concrete evidence in support of it. Wilson's thesis, however, unwittingly masks an accomplishment that is much more far-reaching and, I would argue, ultimately more important. In effect, Wilson has completed the theoretical scaffolding for [CONTINUE READING a Hypocrite: ](https://www.skeptic.com/lectures/evolution-and-the-modular-mind/) Evolution and the Modular Mind Evolution and the Modular Mind [Skeptic](https://www.skeptic.com/author/skeptic/)| Comments Off on Why Everyone Else is a Hypocrite: Evolution and the Modular Mind WE'RE ALL HYPOCRITES. Why? Evolutionary psychologist Robert Kurzban shows us that the key to understanding our behavioral inconsistencies lies in understanding the mind's design. The human mind consists of many specialized units designed by natural selection. While these modules sometimes work together seamlessly, they don't always, resulting in impossibly contradictory beliefs, vacillations between patience and impulsiveness, violations of our supposed moral principles, and overinflated views of ourselves. This modular view of the mind undermines deeply held intuitions about ourselves. Modularity suggests that there is no \"I.\" Instead, each of us is a contentious \"we\" \u2014 a collection of discrete but interacting systems whose constant conflicts shape our interactions with one another and our experience of the world.

While these modules sometimes work together seamlessly, they don't always, resulting in impossibly contradictory beliefs, vacillations between patience and impulsiveness, violations of our supposed moral principles, and overinflated views of ourselves. This modular view of the mind undermines deeply held intuitions about ourselves. Modularity suggests that there is no \"I.\" Instead, each of us is a contentious \"we\" \u2014 a collection of discrete but interacting systems whose constant conflicts shape our interactions with one another and our experience of the world.

Tracking the Chupacabra This week MonsterTalk co-host Benjamin Radford becomes the interviewee! Radford discusses his newest book, [Tracking the Chupacabra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0826350151?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0826350151). The culmination of a five-year investigation, this book may provide an actual solution to these mysterious humanoid sightings. The solution to [the Mystery Photo from Feb. 9th](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/11-02-09/#MysteryPhoto) is the telescope at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, through which Clyde Tombaugh discovered the planet Pluto by capturing its motion on large photographic plates that were slipped into the rectangular box on the business end of the telescope. Tombaugh imaged the sky two weeks apart and then used a blink comparator to look for anything that moved. On February 18, 1930, after a year of searching, Tombaugh made his discovery. And ever since, the little planet that would has struggled to join the club even after it was voted off the planetary island recently. We will reveal the answer to this week's Mystery Photo in next week's eSkeptic. About this week's feature article In this week's eSkeptic, Jason Colavito reviews Scott Sigler's book [Ancestor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307406334?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307406334) and follows up by interviewing the author. Jason Colavito holds a degree in both anthropology and journalism and specializes in alternative archaeology, fringe science and revisionist history. He is proudly listed as \"notable practitioner\" of skeptical xenoarchaeology on the Space Archaeology Wiki. He is also the author of a number of books, including [The Cult of Alien Gods: H. P. Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591023521?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1591023521). A Review & Interview with Scott Sigler by Jason Colavito Scott Sigler writes books with an eclectic mix of elements drawn from science fiction, horror, and thrillers with a heavy emphasis on real life science. Skeptics can take heart in knowing this science is (within reason) true to life, and without the supernatural and metaphysical aspects that color so much genre fiction. Sometimes this alchemy produces exciting results, like Sigler's well-received [Infected](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030740630X?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=030740630X), and sometimes, like the medieval hunt for the philosopher's stone, the outcome is just a little bit short of expected. Sigler's current release, Ancestor, is something akin to the results of an alchemical experiment\u2014interesting, but not exactly what was intended. Ancestor begins as the story of a genetic research laboratory clandestinely attempting to perfect the transplant of organs from genetically modified animals into humans. They call the artificial creatures they make by sequencing DNA \"ancestors\" because their genetic code is based on their best guess about the DNA of the earliest mammalian ancestors. These creatures can be manipulated to avoid crippling immune responses in the humans into whom their organs will be transplanted. After a series of setbacks, the team ends up on a remote island in Lake Superior where the ancestors are born, but turn out to be something a bit different than the placid herbivores the company had expected. Sigler's use of science in the story is clever, and much of the novel recalls Michael Crichton's many books on the same theme, including [Jurassic Park](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345370775?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0345370775), [The Lost World](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/034540288X?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=034540288X), and [Next](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017TZKRG?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0017TZKRG). Unfortunately, the comparison is sometimes too apt, and while the novel's set pieces about genetic science and rampaging monsters are quite good (the first appearance of the creatures is especially terrifying), they are also very similar to scenes in Crichton's novels without contributing anything new to a very familiar story. Ancestor also suffers from having far too little of the title creatures, who don't show up until about two-thirds of the way through the book, and don't really start rampaging in earnest until the final pages. By this point, the novel's real plot has already been revealed: It's actually a thriller about a psychopath trying to kill off the island's residents to cover up the lab's illegal genetic research. This plot strand is not as strong as the part devoted to the monsters, and at times the novel's rapid-fire pacing works against the story, leaving too little time to fully develop the book's characters. Overall, Ancestor is a fast-paced read that uses real-life science facts to weave an interesting web of science fiction-infused horror. Though Crown is releasing Ancestor with a copyright of 2010, a version of the book was first published by a smaller firm in 2007 and had been a podcast before that. It is one of the author's earlier works, and the rawness shows. The novel's rough but serviceable language (not for the easily offended) and fast pacing must have worked especially well in audio form in weekly installments, rather than consumed all at once from cover to cover. Still, skeptics can enjoy the fact that there is at least one horror/thriller author who takes his science as seriously as he does his storytelling. An Interview with the Author Jason Colavito: You've described yourself as a skeptic and Skepticality list](https://www.skeptic.com/searchresults.html?cx=014755677047532667668%3Aunkowbetm3s&cof=FORID%3A10&ie=UTF-8&q=scott+sigler+skepticality&sa=search+skeptic.com&siteurl=www.skeptic.com%2F) of Skepticality episodes Scott Sigler was on). What got you interested in skepticism? How is this reflected in your work? Scott Sigler: Quite frankly, Skepticality was what got me interested in Skepticism. I had just discovered podcasting and was researching the top podcasts. Skepticality was one, so I started listening to explore what went into a podcast that could hold a large audience. The content largely blindsided me\u2014I hadn't even known skepticism existed in a larger sense. Finding a whole community of like-minded people felt like coming home. Finding an unexpected world of rationality made me more confident to use these traits in the characters I create. JC: The promotional materials for your books call your style a \"trademark blend of thrills and cutting edge science.\" How do you employ real life science in your novels? SS: My primary goal is telling captivating stories. I find that science roots the story in a rule-set that many people already know. By using actual science, the story feels more real, more possible, and creates situations where the reader may think, \"I know this is fiction, but the way it is laid out, I can see it really happening.\" This makes my creations plausible, which lets the readers give themselves permission to dive further into the illusion. JC: How does your work differ from traditional science fiction in its application of science? SS: The majority of what's sold as science fiction is actually fantasy, where the \"magic\" is explained away as some future technology that we modern-day people couldn't possibly understand. While I use that same technique when necessary for purposes of telling a great story, I strive to use real science as much as possible. Three other things set me apart from most science fiction, namely setting, biology and \"peer review.\" I put my stories in modern-day settings. Most science fiction deals with the near future, the far future, or the ever-popular \"dystopian future.\" I also focus on real biology and achievable bio-hacking for the story's \"big idea,\" where many scifi stories focus on physics, sociology, or \"exploring the human condition.\" The final difference is I subject my stories to what I call \"peer review,\" which is giving the full manuscript to three biology-related Ph.D.s who make sure everything reflects accurate science, or is at the very least plausible based on what we know. Submitting the manuscript to them creates enormous amounts of re-writing, and often wipes out large swaths of my planned plot. However, in the end the extra effort is worth it. When people who actually do science for a living email me and say \"thank you for doing your homework, I loved it,\" that makes it all worthwhile. JC: Ancestor is about xenotransplantation. How much of the science in the novel has already occurred? How likely is it that someone will attempt what your characters try? SS: Most of the xenotransplantation listed in Ancestor has already happened. We've been using the hearts of primates since 1964.The digitization and reverse-sequencing of the mammalian genome was done by David Haussler at the University of California Santa Cruz. Oligo machines and protein synthesis are real, and conceptually allow one to create a full, computer-engineered genome. Craig Venter has created an artificial bacterium\u2014an actual living organism created from scratch. AgResearch in New Zealand is actively inserting human genes into sheep to see if the animals will produce human proteins in their milk. Imutran (a division of Novartis) has invested heavily in research to put human proteins into pig genomes, trying to create permanent replacement organs. Every last element in Ancestor is real, is happening right now\u2014for the purposes of telling a kick-ass story, I just take all of this real science and bump it up a couple of notches. Although no one is going to try the combination of technologies that are listed in Ancestor, gene modification and cloning are already here, and xenotransplantation is a multi-billion-dollar market if companies can overcome the immune reaction response. JC: The plot of Ancestor recalls the overreaching genetic scientists in Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park and Next. To what extent were stories like these an inspiration for your own? What sets your novel apart? SS: I've never read Next, but Jurrasic Park is a classic biological scifi thriller that takes established scientific concepts and extrapolates them to make a fascinating and fun fiction story. That novel, along with [Relic](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812543262?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0812543262), by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, really helped shape my subject matter. I've always been mesmerized by biology and by the storytelling of Stephen King, so the word of Crichton, Preston and Child showed me that I could combine the two. JC: Many skeptics have a negative opinion of horror, a genre associated with the supernatural. Why do you think a skeptic would enjoy Ancestor? SS: You are right that most horror stories involve the supernatural, which is why many skeptics brush off the genre. When you seek a world of rationality, random shapeshifting, unexplained undead and a general total whitewashing of the laws of nature and physics just smack of woo-woo and lazy storytelling. My work, on the other hand, is firmly rooted in actual science and doesn't use woo-woo cop-outs or insult anyone's intelligence. Ancestor is fiction, a thriller, but the real-world setting makes it a very acceptable form of escapism for skeptics.

They are about 35% higher than before the industrial revolution, and this increase is caused by human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, as are methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, and a host of other trace gases. They occur naturally in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases act like a blanket for infrared radiation, retaining radiative energy near the surface that would otherwise escape directly to space. An increase in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and of other greenhouse gases augments the natural greenhouse effect; it increases the radiative energy available to Earth's surface and to the lower atmosphere. Unless compensated for by other processes, the increase in radiative energy available to the surface and the lower atmosphere leads to warming. This we know. How do we know it? How do we know carbon dioxide concentrations have increased? The concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in atmospheric samples have been measured continuously since the late 1950s. Since then, carbon dioxide concentrations have [CONTINUE READING of Belief](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/a-climate-of-belief/) [Patrick Frank](https://www.skeptic.com/author/skeptic/)| Comments Off on A Climate of Belief The following is Patrick Frank's controversial article challenging data and climate models on global warming.

The current level of atmospheric CO2 is about 390 parts per million by volume (ppmv), or 0.039% by volume of the atmosphere, and in 1900 was about 295 ppmv.
