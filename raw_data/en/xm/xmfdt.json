At Santa Barbara Integrative Medicine Dr. Salcido uses standard medical testing as well as specialized tests that go beyond what standard medical care offers.

Dr. Salcido limits the number of patients she sees and makes sure to give ample time to each patient to ensure the best care. Dr. Salcido offers extended appointments if you need extra time because your health matters.

Dr. Jennifer Salcido, ND HAPPY CLIENTS Dr. Salcido is the best doctor I have ever had! She is friendly, kind and takes the time to really listen to me whenever I come in. I used to dread going to a doctor's appointment, but she has changed that with her sweet, caring personality, her thoroughness, and her informed answers to so many of my ongoing issues. I love that she recommends and uses natural therapies but can also prescribe Western medications if necessary. I met her when I was so sick I had been laying in bed for over two weeks, missing work and feeling miserable. She created a specialized protocol for me that has given me my life back. I feel like a human again! Food has more satisfaction and flavor, I have reached a healthy weight with more energy, less pain and I feel like smiling again. I'm even looking forward to doing a triathlon this coming year! If you have the chance to see her, count yourself blessed! Thank you so much for everything Dr. Salcido! Alysha K. I'd like to praise Dr. Salcido for her treatment of my Lyme Disease. In 2-3 months, I've gone from feeling lots of stiffness, numbness, and headaches to where I can almost forget I have Lyme. Whereas before treatment I was sluggish and always tired, now I'm exercising every day, am joining a zumba class. I've lost 7 pounds in 3 months. (I try to stick to Dr. Salcido's recommended diet too!) In fact even my skin is fresher looking and glowing. I feel like I'm back to my old hard working, energetic self. Last week a friend told me that she doesn't know what I've been doing recently but I look great! My Lyme symptoms are a shadow of what they used to be. I have not had this kind of result with either a holistic MD or a homeopath who treated my Lyme. Dr. Salcido has always been friendly and supportive in our consultations and I'm just glad that I fell upon finding her! B.A. I visited 7 board certified physicians over 34 years regarding my intense stomach pain. Each doctor was confused and recommended numerous tests which proved nothing. I was referred to Dr. Salcido by a doctor friend who told me I needed more than a general practitioner. After only a few weeks and a few tests Dr. Salcido determined the cause of my pain. I was surprised when she told me that the cause of my issues was something doctors were not taught about in medical school. I didn't believe her so I did my own research and found she was exactly correct. So if you have stomach issues you can waste 34 years like I did, but instead I highly recommend going directly to Dr. Salcido. Even though my treatment is still in progress and very challenging I am feeling a lot better. Kevin H.
