Independent Consultant Baltimore, MD x What Is a TIP? Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs) are developed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). TIPs are best practice guidelines for the treatment of substance use disorders. TIPs draw on the experience and knowledge of clinical, research, and administrative experts to evaluate the quality and appropriateness of various forms of treatment. TIPs are distributed to facilities and individuals across the country. Publ ished TIPs can be accessed via the Internet at http://store.samhsa.gov . Although each TIP strives to include an evidence base for the practices it recommends, SAMHSA recognizes that the field of substance abuse treatment is continually evolving, and research frequently lags behind the innovations pioneered in the field. A major goal of each TIP is to convey front -line information quickly but responsibly. If research supports a particular approach, citations are provided. xi Foreword The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that leads public health efforts to advance the behavioral health of the nation. SAMHSA 's mission is to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on America 's communities. The Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) series fulfills SAMHSA 's mission to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on America 's communities by providing e vidence - based and best practice guidance to clinicians, program administrators, and payers. TIPs are the result of careful consideration of all relevant clinical and health services research findin gs, demonstration experience, and implementation requirements. A panel of non -federal clinical researchers, clinicians, program administrators, and patient advocates debates and discusses their particular area of expertise until they reach a consensus on best practices. This panel 's work is then reviewed and critiqued by field reviewers. The talent, dedication, and hard work that TIPs panelists and reviewers bring to this highly participatory process have helped bridge the gap between the promise of research and the needs of practicing clinicians and administrators to serve, in the most scientifically sound and effective ways, people in need of behavioral health services. We are grateful to all who have joined with us to contribute to advances in the behav ioral health field. Pamela S. Hyde, J.D. Administrator Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration H. Westley Clark, M.D., J.D., M.P .H., CAS, FASAM Director Center for Substance Abuse Treatment Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration xiii Executive Summary The development of culturally responsive clinical skills is vital to the effectiveness of behavioral health services . According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), cultural competence \"refers to the ability to honor and respect the beliefs, languages, interpersonal styles, and behaviors of individuals and families receiving services, as well as staff members who are providing such services. Cultural competence is a dynamic, ongoing developmental process that requires a long-term commitment and is achieved over time\" (HHS 2003a , p. 12). It ha s also been called \"a set of behaviors, attitudes, and policies that . . . enable a system, agency, or group of professionals to work effectively in cross - cultural situations\" (Cross et al. 1989, p. 13). This Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) uses Sue 's (2001) multidimensional model for developing cultural competenc e. Adapted to address cultural competence across behavioral health settings, this model serves as a frame-work for targeting three organizational levels of treatment: individual counselor and staff, clinical and programmatic, and organizational and administrative. The chapters target specif-ic racial, ethnic, and cultural considerations along with the core elements of cultural com-petence highlighted in the model. These core elements include cultural awareness, general cultural knowledge, cultural knowledge of behavioral health, and cultural skill develop-ment. The primary objective of this TIP is to assist readers in understanding the role of culture in the delivery of behavioral health services (both generally and with reference to specific cultural groups) . This TIP is organized into six chapters and begins with an introduc-tion to cultural competence. The following subheadings provide a summary of each chap-ter and an overview of this publication. Introduction to Cultural Competence Why is the development of cultural compe- tence and culturally responsive services important in the behavioral health field? Culturally responsive skills can improve client engagement in services, therapeutic relation- ships between clients and providers, and treatment retention and outcome s. Cultural competence is an essential ingredient in de-creasing disparities in behavioral health. The development of cultural competence can have far -reaching effects not only for clients, but also for providers and communities. Cul-tural competence improves an organization 's sustainability by reinforcing the value of diver- sity, flexibility, and responsiveness in address-ing the current and changing needs of clients, communities, and the healthcare environment. Culturally responsive organizational strategies and clinical services can help mitigate organi-zational risk and provide cost -effective treat- ment, in part by matching services to client xv Improving Cultural Competence needs more appropriately from the outset. S o too, culturally responsive organizational poli- cies and procedures support staff engagement in culturally responsive care by establishing access to training, supervision, and congruent policies and procedures that enable staff to respond in a culturally a ppropriate manner to clients' psychological, linguistic, and physical needs. What is the process of becoming culturally competent as a counselor or culturally responsive as an organization? Cultural competence is not acquired in a limited timeframe or by learning a set of facts about specific populations; cultures are diverse and continuously evolving. Developing cultural competence is an ongoing process that begins with cultural awareness and a commitment to understanding the role that culture plays in behavioral health services. For counselors, the first step is to understand their own cultures as a basis for understanding others. Next, they must cultivate the willingness and ability to acquire knowledge of their clients' cultures. This involves learning about and respecting client worldviews, beliefs, values, and attitudes toward mental health, help -seeking behavior, substance use, and behavioral health services. Behavioral health counselors should incorpo-rate culturally appropriate knowledge, under- standi ng, and attitudes into their actions (e.g., communication style, verbal messages, treat-ment policies, services offered) , thereby con- veying their cultural competence and their organizations ' cultural responsiveness during assessment, treatment planning, and the treatment process. What is culture? Culture is the conceptual system developed by a community or society to structure the way people view the world. It involves a particular set of beliefs, norms, and values that influence ideas about relationships, how people live their lives, and the way people organize their world. Culture is not a definable entity to which people belong or do not be-long. Within a nation, race, or community, people belong to multiple cultural groups and negotiate multiple cultural expectations on a daily basis. These expectations, or cultural norms, are the spoken or unspoken rules or standards for a given group that indicate whether a certain social event or behavior is appropriate or inappropriate. The word \"cul- ture\" is sometimes applied to groups formed on the basis of age, socioeconomic status, disability, sexual orientation, recovery status, common interest, or proximity. Counselors and administrators should understan d that each client embraces his or her culture(s) in a unique w ay and that there is considerable diversity within and across races, ethni cities, and culture heritages. Other cultures and subcultures often exist within larger cultures. What are race and ethnicity? Race is often referred to as a biological category based on genetic traits like skin color (HHS 2001), but there are no reliable means of identifying race through biological criteria. Despite its limita-tions, the concept of race is important to discussions of cultural competence. Race \u2014 when defined as a social construct to describe people with shared physical characteristics \u2014 can have tremendous social significance. The term ethnicity is often used interchangeably with race, although by definition, ethnicity \u2014 unlike race \u2014implies a certain sense of belong- ing. I t is generally based on shared values, beliefs, and origins rather than shared physical characteristics. With the exception of its final chapter, which examines drug cultures, this TIP focuses on the major racial and ethnic groups identified by the U. S. Census Bureau within the United States: African and Black Americans, Asian Americans (including Na-tive Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders), Hispanics and Latinos, Native Americans, and White Americans. xvi Executive Summary What constitutes cultural identity? Cultural identit y, in the simplest terms, involves an affiliation or identification with a particular group or groups. An individual 's cultural identity reflects the values, norms, and worldview of the larger culture, but it is de-fined by more than these factors. Cultural identity includes individual traits and attrib-utes shaped by race, ethnicity, language, life experiences, historical events, acculturation, geographic and other environmenta l influ- ences, and other forces. T hus, no two individ- uals will possess exactly the same cultural identity even if they identify with the same cultural group(s). Cultural identities are not static; they develop, evolve, and change across the life cycle. This TIP explores cultural identity and its influence on assessment, treatment planni ng, and therapeutic and healing practices. The introduction it provides to the cross -cutting factors of race, ethnicity, and culture will help counselors gain knowledge a bout the many forces that shape cultures, communities, and the lives of clients, inclu ding, but not limited to, families and kinships, gender roles, socioec-onomic status, religion, education, immigra-tion, and migration. What core assumptions serve as the foun- dation of this TIP? The consensus panel developed several core assumptions upon which to structure the content of this TIP: An understanding of race, ethnicity, and culture (including one 's own) is necessary to appreciate the d iversity of human dy- namics and to treat clients effectively. Incorporating cultural competence into treatment im proves therapeutic deci- sionmakin g and offers alternative ways to define and plan a treatment program firm-ly directed toward progress and recovery. Organizational commitment to support ing culturally responsive treatment services, including adequate allocati on of resources, reinforce s the importance of sustain ing cultural competence in counselor s and other clinical staff. Advocating culturally responsive practices increases trust within the communi ty, agency , and staff. Achieving cultural competence r equires the participation of racially and e thnically diverse groups and underserved popula-tions in the development and implementa-tion of treatment approaches and training activities. Consideration of culture is important at all levels of operation and in all stage s of treatment and recovery. Core Competencies for Counselors and Other Clinical Staff Cultural competence has come to mean more than a discrete skill set or knowledge base; cultural competence also requires self - evaluation on the part of the practitioner. Culturally competent counselors are aware of their own culture and values, and they acknowledge their own assumptions and biases about other cultures. Moreover, cultur-ally competent counselors strive to understand how these assumptions affect their abilit y to provide culturally responsive services to clients from similar or diverse cultures. Counselors should begin the process of be- coming culturally competent by identifying and exploring their cultural heritage and worldview along with their clinical worl dview, uncovering how these views shape their per- ceptions of and during the counseling process. In addition to understanding themselves and how their culture and values can affect the therapeutic process, culturally competent counselors possess a general understanding of xvii Improving Cultural Competence the cultures of t he specific clients with whom they work. Counselors should also understand how individual cultural differences affect substance abuse, health beliefs, help-seeking behavior, and perceptions of behavioral health services. Culturally competent counselors: Frame issues in culturally relevant ways. Allow for complexity of issues based on cultural context. Make allowances for variations in the use of personal space. Are respectful of culturally specific mean- ings of touch (e.g., hugging). Explore culturally based experiences of power and powerlessness. Adjust communication styles to the cli- ent's culture. Interpret emotional expressions in light of the client 's culture. Expand roles and practices as needed. Chapter 2 addresses counselors' core cultural competencies and presents clinical activities, including clinical supervision tools. The key areas explored include cultural awareness and cultural identity development, the cultural lens of counseling, key components of cultural knowledge for behavioral health c ounselors, and specific counseling skills that support culturally responsive services. Culturally Respon sive Evaluation and Treatment Planning The role of culture should be considered during initial intakes and interviews, in screening and assessment processes, and in the development of treatment planning. Culturally responsive treatment can only occur when the making of clinical and programmatic decisions includes culturally relevant information and practices and is endorsed and supported by clinical staf f, clinical supervisors, and the organization as a whole. Chapter 3 presents culturally responsive evaluation and treatment planning as a series of nine steps. Step 1: Engage client s. Because the in take meeting is often the first encounter clients have with the behavioral health system, it is vital that they leave the meeting feeli ng un- derstood and hopeful. Counselor s should tr y to establish rapport with client s before launch- ing into a series of questions. Step 2: Familiarize client s and family members with the evaluation and treatment process. Often, clients and family members are not familiar with treatment jargon, the treatment program, the facility, or the expecta-tions of treatment; furthermore, not all clients will have had an opportunity to express their own expectations or apprehension. C linical and other treatment staff must not assume that clients already understand the treatment process. Instead, they need to take sufficient time to talk with client s (and their families , as appropriate) about how treatment works and what to expect from treatment provider s. Step 3: Endorse a collaborative approach in facilitating interviews, conducting assess-ments, and planning treatment. Counselors should educate client s about their role in interview, ass essment, and treatment planning processes . From first contact, they should encourage client s and the ir famil ies to partici- pate actively by asking questions, voicing specific treatment needs, and being involved in treatment plan ning. Counselors should allow client s and famil y member s to give feedback on the cultural relevance of the treatment plan. Step 4: Obtain and integrate culturally relevant information and themes. By explor- ing culturally relevant themes, counselors will better understand each client a nd will be better equipped to develop a culturally in-formed evaluation and treatment plan. Areas xviii Executive Summary to explore include immigration and migration history, cultural identity, acculturation status, health beliefs, healing practices, and other information culturally relevant to the client. Step 5: Gather culturally relevant collateral information. Such information is a powerful tool in assessing clients' presenting problems, understanding the influence of cultural factors on client s, and gat hering resources to support treatment endeavors. By involving others in the early phases of treatment, providers will likely obtai n more external support for each client 's engagement in treatment services. Counselors can o btain sup plemental information (wi th client permission) from family members, medi-cal and court records, probation and parole officers, community members, and so on. Step 6: Select culturally appropriate screen- ing and assessment tools. In selecting eval- uation tools, counselors should note the availability of normative data for the popula-tions to which the ir client s belong , the inci- dence of test item bias, the role of acculturation in understanding test items, and the adaptation of testing materials to each client 's culture and language. Step 7: Determine readiness and motiva- tion for change. Although few studies focus on the use of motivational interviewing with specific cultural groups, its theories and strate-gies may be more culturally appropriate for most clien ts than other approaches. Thr ough reflective listening , motivational interviewing focuses on helping client s explore ambivalence toward change, decisions, and subsequent treatment. It is a nonconfrontational, client - centered approach that reinforces clients as the experts on what will work and supports the key idea that change is a process. Step 8: Provide culturally responsive case management. Many core competencies for counselors are also relevant to case managers. Like counselors, case managers should possess cultural self -knowledg e and a basic knowledge of other cultures. They should possess traits conducive to working well with diverse groups and the ability to apply cultural competence in practical ways. Case management includes the use, as necessary, of interpreter s who can comm unicate well in the specific dialect s spoken by each client and who are familiar with behavioral health vocabulary relevant to the specific behavioral health setting in which service provision will occur. Case managers should acquire cultural and community knowledge to assist with the coordination of social, health, and other essential services and to secure culturally relevant services in and outside the treatment facility. Case managers should also keep a list of culturally appropriate referral resource s to help meet client needs. Step 9: Integrate cultural factors into treatment planning. Counselors should be flexible in designing a treatment plan to meet the cultural needs of clients and should inte-grate traditional healing practices into treat-ment plans when appropriate, using resources available in the clients ' cultural communities. Treatment goals and objectives need to be culturally relevant , and the treatment envi- ronment must be conducive to client partici- pation in tr eatment planning and to the gathering of client feedback on the cultural relevance of the treatment being provided. Pursuing Organizational Cultural Competence Organizational cultural competence is a dy- namic, ongoing process that begins with awareness and commitment and evolves into culturally responsive organizational policies and procedures. A commitment to improving cultural competence must include resources to help support ongoing fidelity to these policies and procedures along with an ongoing process xix Improving Cultural Competence of reassessment and adaptation as client and community needs evolve. Chapter 4 presents 20 organizational task s that support counse- lors' develop ment of cultural competence and improve organization al development of cultur- ally responsive treatment services. Beginning with the organization 's vision and mission statement , administrators and govern- ing boards need to d evelop, implement, and support a strategic planning process that demonstrates commitment to cultural compe- tence . Key staff members assigned to oversee the development of culturally responsive services act as liaisons and facilitators in estab-lishing a cultural competence committee and conducting an organizational self -assessment of cultural competence. With the involvement of community members, staff, clients and their families, board members, and other invested individuals, the cultural competence commit-tee supports and oversees organizational self - assessment, using it to identify strengths and specific areas for improvement in cultural responsiveness. Based on the results of the self-assessment, the committee develops and implements a cultural competence plan. An organizational self -assessment helps the committee prioritize the steps needed to improve culturally responsive services. The plan should address strategies for recruiting, hiring, retaining, and promoting qualified, diverse staff members; the use of interpreters or bilingual staff members; staff training, professional development, and education; fostering community involvement; facilities design and operation; development of cultur-ally appropriate program materials; how to incorporate culturally relevant treatment approaches ; and development and implemen- tation of supporting policies and procedures, including reassessment processes. An organi-zation 's commitment to and support of cultur- ally responsive services, including congruent policies and procedures, will enable counselors to respond more consistently to clients in a culturally competent manner. Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups Knowledge of a culture 's attitudes toward mental illness, substance use, healing , and help-seeking patterns, practices, and beliefs is essential in understanding clients' presenting problems, developing culturally competent counseling skills, and formulating culturally relevant agency policies and procedures. Treatment providers need to learn and under-stand how identification with one or more cultural groups influences each client 's worldview , beliefs, and traditions surrounding initiation of use, healing, and treatment. Chapter 5 provides a review of the literature as it pertains to specific racial and ethnic groups identified by the U.S. Census Bureau. After a brief introduction, the chapte r explores each major racial and ethnic group 's specific pat- terns of substance use and substance use dis- orders , help-seeking patterns, beliefs about and traditions involving substance use , beliefs and attitudes about treatment , assessment and treatment con siderations (including co - occurring disorders and culturally specific disorders ), and theoretical approach es and treatment interventions ( including evidence - based and best practices as well as traditional healing practices ). Chapter 5 also offers assistan ce in providing treatment to African and Black Americans, Asian Americans (including Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders ), Latinos, Native Americans, and White Americans. Counse-lors, clinical supervisors, and administrators are encouraged to use th e information in this chapter as a starting point for learning about xx Executive Summary the major cultural groups of their clients. Nonetheless, many forces shape how an indi- vidual identifies with, is influenced by, or portrays his/her culture, and numerous subcul-tures can exist within any culture; thus, gener- alizations about various population groups should be avoided. Drug Cultures and the Culture of Recovery This TIP emphasizes the concept that many subcultures exist within and across diverse ethnic and racial populations and cultures. Drug cultures are a formidable example \u2014they can influence the presentation of mental, substance use, and co -occurring disorders while also affecting prevention and treatment strategies and outcomes. Drug cultures differ from the types of cultures discussed in the rest of this TIP , but they do share some common features. For instance, there is not a single drug culture in the United States today, but rather, a number of distinct (although some-times related) drug cultures that differ accord-ing to substances used, geographic location, socioeconomic status, and other factors. Drug cultures focusing on illicit substances may be of greater importance in the lives of people who use substances, but people who use legal substances, such as alcohol, can also partici- pate in a drug culture. For example, people who drink heavily at a bar or fraterni-ty/sorority house can develop their own drug culture that works to encourage new people to use, supports high levels of continued use or binge use, and reinforces denial. Understanding the role that drug cultures play in clients ' lives is particularly important be- cause these cultures, more than any other cultural connections, influence clients' sub- stance use or abuse and the behaviors in which they engage to manage mental disorders. Through drug cultures, people new to using learn to experience \"getting high \" as a pleasur- able activity; they also learn the skills needed to procure and use drugs effectively and to avoid the pitfalls of the drug -using lifesty le (e.g., getting arrested, running out of money to buy drugs). Perhaps most importantly, the person who uses gains acceptance from a group of peers even as mainstream society increasingly discriminates against him or her because of his or her substance use or mental illness. Prejudice from mainstream society may make ties with the drug culture even stronger; he or she may feel as if there is no other place to turn for social and cultural support. Within a treatment program, an understand-ing of drug cultures will help providers engage new clients and recognize the social and cul-tural bonds that might lead them back to substance use or other high -risk behaviors that are contraindicated for individuals who are being treated for psychological symptoms and/or me ntal illness. However, unlike other types of cultural affiliations, the treatment provider 's relationship to the drug culture does not just involve understanding; the provider must actively work to weaken that connection and replace it with other experienc es that meet the client 's social and cultural needs. In many cases, this involves helping the client connect with a \"culture of recovery \" to meet those needs over the long course of recovery. In sum, this TIP was written to help counse- lors and organizations provide culturally re-sponsive services. Practices and procedures that improve one 's cultural competence will likely result in better outcomes for clients in treatment for mental and substance use disor-ders. Culturally competent counseling can improve counselor credibility, client satisfac-tion, and client self -disclosure while increasing clients' willingness to continue in treatment. xxi IN THIS CHAPTER Purpose and Objectives of the TIP Core Assumptions What Is Cultural Competence? Why Is Cultural Competence Important? How Is Cultural Competence Achieved? What Is Culture? What Is Race? What Is Ethnicity? What Is Cultural Identity? What Are the Cross- Cutting Factors in Race, Ethnicity, and Culture? As You Proceed Hoshi was born and grew up in Japan. He has been living in th e United States for nearly 20 years, going to graduate school and working as a systems analyst, while his family has remained in Japan. Hoshi entered a residential treatment center for alcohol dependence where the treatment program expected every client to notify his or her family members about being in treatment. This had proven to be a positive step for many other clients and their families in this treatment program , where the belief was that con- tact with family helped clients become honest about their sub-stance abuse, reconnect with possibly estranged relatives, and take responsibility for the decision to seek treatment. He was reluctant, but staff members persuaded Hoshi to comply with program expectations. He wrote to his family, describing his current life and explaining his need for treatment. It was not until weeks later, after he had been discharged from residential treat-ment and was participating in the program 's continuing care pro- gram, that he received a reply. Staff members were shocked to learn that Hoshi 's parents had disowned him because he had \"shamed \" the family by disclosing the details of his life to the program staff, publicly admitting that he had a drinking problem. As Hoshi 's story demonstrates, a well -meaning but culturally inap- propri ate intervention can be counterproductive to recovery. The program applied a \"one size fits all \" model without being sensitive to the possibility that such an approach might harm the client. Fortunately, Hoshi eventually reconciled with his family, and the program administration and staff began to develop initiatives to improve their cultural awareness and competence. Counselors and other behavioral health service providers who are equipped with a general understanding of how culture affects their 1 Introduction to Cultural Competenc e 1 Improving Cultural Competence own worldviews as well as those of their cli- ents will be able to work more effectively with clients who have substance use and mental disorders. Even when culture is not a con-scious consideration in providing interventions and services, it is a dynamic force that often influence s client responses to trea tment and subsequent outcomes. Although outcome research is limited, culturally responsive be-havioral health counseling results in greater counselor credibility, better client satisfaction, more client self -disclosure, and greater will- ingness among clients to continue with coun- seling (Good e et al. 2006; Lie et al. 2011; Ponterotto et al. 20 00). This Treatment Improve ment Protocol (TIP) examine s the significance of culture in substance abuse patterns, mental health, treatment -seeking behaviors, assessment and counseling process-es, program development, and organizational practices in behavioral health services. Purpose and Objectives of the TIP This TIP is intended to help counselors and behavioral health organizations make progress toward cultural competence. Gaining cultural competence, like any important counseling skill, is an ongoing process that is never com-pleted; such skills cannot be taught in any single book or training session. Nevertheless, this TIP provides a framework to help practi-tioners and adm inistrators integrate cultural factors into their evaluation and treatment of clients with behavioral health disorders. It also seeks to motivate professionals and organiza-tions t o examine and broaden their cultural awareness, embrace diversity, and develo p a heightened respect for people of all cultural groups. This TIP places significant im-portance on the role of program management and organizational commitment in the devel-opmen t of cultural competence. O rganizational support allows counselors, case managers, and admin istrators to begin to integrate culturally congruent and responsive services more con-sistently across the continuum of care\u2014including outreach and early intervention, assessment, treatment planning and interven-tion, and recovery services. The key objectives of this TIP are helping readers understand : Why it is important for behavioral health organizations and counselors who provide prevention and treatment services to con- sider culture. The role culture plays in the treatment process, both generally and with reference to specific cultural groups. Intended Audience The primary audience s for this TIP are pre- vention professionals, substance abuse counse-lors, mental health clinicians, and other behavioral health service providers and admin- istrators. Those who work with culturally diverse populations will find it particularly useful, though all behavioral health w orker s\u2014 regardless of their client populations \u2014can benefit from an awareness of the importance of culture in shaping their own perceptions as well as those of their clients. Secondary audi-ences include educators, researchers, policy-makers for treatment and related services, consumers, and other healthcare and social service professionals who work with clients who ha ve behavioral health disorders. Structure of the TIP This TIP focuses on the essential ingredients for developing cultural competence as a coun-selor and for providing culturally responsive services in clinical settings as an organization. Chapter 1 defines cultural competence, pre- sents a rationale for pursuing it, and describes the process of becoming culturally competent and responsive to client needs. The chapter 2 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence highlights the consensus panel's core assump- tions. It introduces a framework, adapting Sue's (2001) multidimensional model of cul- tural competence as the guiding model across chapters. The initial chapter ends with a broad overview of the concepts integral to an under-standing of race, ethnicity, and culture. Chapter 2 addresses the development of c ul- tural awareness and describes core competen- cies for counselors and other clinical staff, beginning with self -knowledge and ending with skill development. I t covers behaviors and skills for cultivating cultural competence as well as attitudes conducive to working effec- tively with diverse client populations. Chapter 3 provides guidelines for culturally responsive clinical services, including inter-viewing skills, assessment practices, and treat-ment planning. Chapter 4 provides organizational strategies to promote the development and implementation of culturally responsive practices from the top down, beginning with organizational self - assessment of current serv ices and continuing through implementation and oversight of an organizational plan targeting initiat ives to improve culturally responsive services. Chapter 5 provides a general introduction for each major racial and ethnic group, providing specific cultural knowledge related to sub-stance use patterns, beliefs and attitudes to-ward help -seeking behavior an d treatment, and an overview of research - and practice - based treatment approaches and interventions. Chapter 6 closes the TIP with an exploration of the concept of \"drug culture \"\u2014the relation- ship between the drug culture and mainstream culture, the values and rituals of drug cultures, how people \"benefit \" from participation in drug cultures, and the role of the drug culture in substance abuse treatment. Terminology Throughout the TIP , the term substance abuse is used to refer to both substance abuse and substance dependence. This term was chosen partly because substance abuse treatment professionals commonly use the term sub- stance abuse to describe any excessive use of addictive su bstances. In this TIP , the term refers to use of alcohol as well as other sub- stances of abuse. Readers should attend to the context in which the term occurs to determine what possible range of meanings it covers; in most cases, however, the term will refer to all varieties of substance use disorders described by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition ( DSM -5; Americ an Psychiatric Association, 2013) . Throughout the TIP, the term behavioral health refers to a state of mental/emotional being and/or choices and actions that affect wellness. Behavioral health problems include substance abuse or misuse, alco hol and drug addiction, psychological distress, suicide, and mental and substance use disorders. This includes a range of prob lems, from unhealthy stress to diagnosable and treatable diseases like serious mental illness and substance use disor-ders, which are often chronic in nature but from which people can and do recover. The term is also used in this TIP to describe the service systems encompassing the promotion of emotional health, the prevention of mental and substance use disorders, substance use and related problems, treatments and services for mental and substance use disorders, and re-covery support. Behavioral health condi tions, taken together, are the leading causes of disa-bility burden in North America ; efforts to improve their prevention and treatment will benefit society as a whole. Efforts to reduce the impact of mental and substance use disor-ders on communities in the United States, such as those described in this TIP, will help achieve nationwide improvements in health. 3 Improving Cultural Competence Core Assumptions The consensus panel developed assumptions that serve as the fundamental platform of this TIP . Assumptions were derived from clinical and administrative experiences, available empirical evidence, conceptual writings, and program and treatment service models. Assumption 1: The focus of cultural compe- tence, in practice, has historically been on individual providers. However, counselors will not be able to sustain culturally responsive treatment without the organization 's commit- ment to support and allocate resources to promot e these practices. Organizations that value diversity and reflect cultural competence through congruent policies and procedures are more likely to be successful in the ever - changing landscape of communities, treatment services, and individual client needs. Assumption 2: An understanding of race, ethnicity, and culture (including one 's own) is necessary to appreciate the diversity of human dynamics and to treat all clients effectively. Before counselors begin to probe the cultures , races, and ethnicit ies of their clients and use this information to improve client treatment, the consensus panel recommends first that counselors examine and understand their own cultural histories, racial and ethnic heritages, and cultural values and beliefs. This applies to all practitioners regardless of race, ethnicity, or cultural identity. Beyond that, clinicians should clearly identify the influences of their own cultural experiences on the counseling relationship. In other words, each counselor must understand, embrace, and, if warranted, reexamine and adjust his or her own world - view to practice in a culturally competent manner. So too, all support staff, clinicians, administrators, and policymakers \u2014including those not from the mainstream culture \u2014 must become educated and convinced of the importance of cultural competence in the delivery of effective behavioral health services. Assumption 3: Incorporating cultural compe- tence into treatment improves therapeutic decision -making and offers alternate ways to define and pla n a treatment program that is firmly directed toward progress and recov-ery\u2014as defined by both the counselor and client. Using culturally responsive practices is essential and provides many benefits for or-ganizations, staff, communities, and clients. Assump tion 4: Consideration of culture is important at all levels of operation \u2014 individual, programmatic, and organization-al\u2014across behavioral health treatment set- tings. It is also important in all activities and at every treatment phase: outreach, initial contac t, screening, assessment, placement, treatment, continuing care and recovery ser-vices, research, and education. Because organi-zations and systems have their own internal cultures, it is vital that treatment facilities, training and educational programs on substance -related and mental disorders and treatment processes, and licensing agencies and accrediting bodies incorporate culturally responsive practices into their curricula, stand-ards, criteria, and requirements. Assumption 5: Achieving cultural compe- tence in an organization requires the partici- pation of racially and ethnically diverse groups and underserved populations in the develop-ment and implementation of culturally re-sponsive practices, program structure and design, treatment strategies and approach es, and staff professional development. Culturally congruent interventions cannot be successfully applied when generated outside a communi ty or without community participation. Clients, potential clients, their families, and their com-munities should be inv ited to participate in the development of a cultural competence plan (an 4 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence organization 's plan to improve cultural compe- tence and to provide culturally responsive services) and, subsequently, the design of culturally relevant treatment services and organizat ional policies and procedures. Assumption 6 : Public advocacy of culturally responsive practices can increase trust among the community, agency, and staff. The com-munity is thus empowered with a voice in organizational operations. Advocacy can further function as a secondary form of public education and awareness as well as outreach. High collective participation allows treatment to be viewed as of and for the community. What Is Cultural Competence? In 1989, Cross et al. provided one of the more universally accepted definitions of cultural competence in clinical practice: \"A set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that come together in a system, agency, or among professionals and enable the system, agency, or professionals to work effectively in cross -cultural situations\" (p. 13). Since then, others have interpreted this defini-tion in terms of a particular field or attempted to refine, expand, or elaborate on earlier con-ceptions of cultural competence. At the root of this concept is the idea that cultural compe-tence is demonstrated through practical means\u2014that is, the ability to provi de effective services. Bazron and Scallet (1998) defined culturally responsive services as those that are \"responsive to the unique cultural needs of bicultural/biling ual and culturally distinct populations \" (p. 2). The Office of Minority Health ( OMH 2000) merged several existing definitions to conclude that: Cultural and linguistic competence is a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that come together i n a system, agency, or among professionals that enables effective work in cross -cultural situations. 'Culture ' re- fers to integrated patterns of human behavior that include the language, thoughts, communi-cations, actions, customs, beliefs, values, and institutions of racial, ethnic, religious, or social groups. 'Competence ' implies having the ca- pacity to function effectively as an individual and an organization within the context of the cultural beliefs, behaviors, and needs presented by consumers and their communities . (p. 28) Numerous evolving definitions and models of cultural competence reflect an increasingly complex and multidimensional view of how race, ethnicity, and culture shape individu-als\u2014their beliefs, values, behavior s, and ways of being (see Bh ui et al. 2007 for a systemic review of cultural competence models in mental health). In this TIP, Sue 's (2001) multidimensional model of cultural compe- tence guides its overall organization and the specific content of each chapter. The model was adapted to fit the unique topic areas addressed by this TIP (Exhibit 1-1) and to target essential elements of cultural compe-tence in providing behavioral health services across three main dimensions, as shown in the cube. (Note: Each subsequent chapter displays a version of this cube shaded to emphasize the focus of that chapter.) Dimension 1: Racially and Culturally Specific Attributes Exhibit 1 -1 and this TIP focus on main popu- lation groups as identified by the U.S. Census Bureau (Humes et al. 2011), but this dimen-sion is inclusive of other multiracial and cul-turally diverse groups and can also include sexual orientation, gender orientation , socioec- onomic status, and geographic location. There are often many cultural groups within a given population or ethnic heritage. For simplicity, these groups are not represented on the actual model, and it is assumed that the reader acknowledges the vast inter - and intragroup variations that exist in all population, ethnic, 5 Improving Cultural Competence and cultural groups. Refer to Chapters 5 and 6 to gain further clinical knowledge about spe-cific racial, ethnic, and cultural groups. Dimension 2: Core Elements of Cultural Competence This dimension includes cultural awareness, cultural knowledge, and cultural skill devel- opment. To provide culturally responsive treatment services, counselors, other clinical staff, and organizations need to become aware of their own attitudes, beliefs, biases, and assumptions about others. Providers need to invest in gaining cultural knowledge of the populations that they serve and obtain ing specific cultural knowledge as it relates to help-seeking, treatment, and recovery. This dimension also involves competence in clinical skills that ensure delivery of culturally appro-priate treatment interventions. Several chap-ters capture the ingredients of this dimension . Chapter 1 provides an overview of cultural competence and concepts , Chapter 2 provides an indepth look at the role and effect s of the counselor 's cultural awareness and identity within the counseling process, Chapter 3 provides an overview of cultural considerations and essential clinical skills in the assessment and treatment planning process, and Chapter 5 specifically addresses the role of culture across specific treatment interventions. Dimension 3: Foci of Culturally Responsive Services This dimension targets key levels of trea tment services: the individual staff member level, the Exhibit 1 -1: Multidimensional Model for Developing Cultural Competence 6 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence clinical and program matic level, and the or- ganizational and administrative level. Inter- ventions need to occur at each of these levels to endorse and provide culturally responsive treatment services, and such interventions are addressed in the following chapters. Chapter 2 focuses on core counselor competencies; Chapter 3 centers on clinical/program attrib-utes in interviewing, assessment, and treat-ment planning that promote culturally responsive interventions; and Chapter 4 ad-dresses the elements necessary to improve culturally responsive services within treatment programs and behavioral health organizations. What Are Health Disparities? A health disparity is a particular type of health difference closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage. Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systemat-ically experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group; religion; socioec- onomic disability; sexual or gender orientation; geographic location; or other characteristics historically tied to discrimination or exc lusion. Source: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS) 2011a . Why Is Cultural Competence Important? Foremost, cultural competence provides c lients with more opportunities to access services that reflect a cultural perspective on and alternative , culturally congruent approaches to their pre- senting problems. Culturally responsive ser-vices will likely provide a greater sense of safety from the client 's perspectiv e, supporting the belief that culture is essential to healing. Even though not all clients identify with or desire to connect with their cultures, culturally responsive services offer clients a chance to explore the impact of culture (including his-torical and generational events), acculturation, discrimination, and bias, and such services also allow them to examine how these impacts relate to or affect their mental and physical health. Culturally responsive practice recog-nizes the fundamental importance of language and the right to la nguage accessibility, includ-ing translation and interpreter services. For clients, culturally responsive services honor the belief s that culture is embedded in the clients' language and their implicit and explicit com-munication styles and that language - accommodating services can have a positive effect on client s' response s to treatment and subsequent engagement in recovery services. The Affordable Care Act , along with g rowing recognition of racial and ethnic health dispari-ties and implementation of national initiatives to reduce them (HHS 2011 b), necessitates enhance d culturally responsive services and cultural competence among providers. Most behavioral health studies have found dispari-ties in access, utilization, and quality i n behav- ioral health services among diverse ethnic and racial groups in the United States ( Alegria et al. 2008b ; Alegria et al. 2011; HHS 2011b ; Le Cook and Alegria 2011; Satre et al. 2010). The lack of cultural knowledge among provid-ers, culturally responsive environments, and diversity in the workfo rce contribute to dis- parities in healthcare. Even limited cultural competence is a significant barrier that can translate to ineffective provi der-consumer communication, delays in appropriate treat-ment and level of care, misdiagnosis, lower rates of consumer compliance with treatment, and poorer outcome (Barr 2008; Carpenter - Song et al. 2011; Dixon et al. 2011). Increas- ing the cultural competenc e of the healthcare workforce and across healthcare settings is crucial to increasing behavioral health equity. Additionally , adopting and integrating cultur- ally responsive policies and practices into 7 Improving Cultural Competence behavioral health services provides many benefits not only for the client, but also for the organization and its staff. Foremost, it increas- es the likelihood of sustainability. Cultural competence supports the viability of services by bringing to the forefront the value of diver- sity, flexibility, and responsiveness in organiza-tions and among practitioners. Beyond the necessity of adopting culturally resp onsive practices to meet funding, s tate licensing, and/or national accreditation requirement s, cultural competence essential in organizational risk management (the process of making and implementing decisions that will optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects upon client s and, ultimately, the organ- ization). For instance, implementing c ulturally responsive services is likely to increase access to care and improve assessment, treatment planning, and placement. So too, it is likely to enhance effective communication between client s and treatment provider s, thus decreas- ing risks associated with misunderstanding the clients' presenting problems or the needs of clients with regard to appropriate referrals for evaluation or treatment. Organizational investment in improving cultural competence and increasing culturally responsive services will likely increase use and cost effectiveness because services are more appropriately matched to clients from the beginning. A key principle in culturally re-sponsive practices is engagement of the com- munity, clients, and staff. As organizations establish community involvement in the ongo-ing implementation of culturally responsive services, the community will be more aware of available treatment services and thus will become more likely to use them as its in-volvement with and trust for the organization grows. Likewise, clients and staff are more apt to be empowered and invested if they are involved in the ongoing development and delivery of culturally responsive services. Cli-ent and staff satisfaction can increase if organ-izations provide culturally congruent treatment services and clinical supervision. An organization also benefits from culturally responsive practices through planning for, attracting, and retaining a diverse workforce that reflects the multiracial and multiethnic heritages and cultural groups of its client base and community. Developing culturally respon-sive organizational policies includes hiring and promotional practices that support staff diver-sity at all levels of the organization, including board appointments. Increasing diversity does not guarantee culturally responsive practices, but it is more likely that doing so will lead t o broader, varied treatment services t o meet client and community needs. Organizations are less able to ignore the roles of race, ethnici-ty, and culture in the delivery of behavioral health services if staff composition at each level of the organization re flects this diversity. Culturally responsive practice reinforces the counselor 's need for self -exploration of cultur- al identity and awareness and the importance of acquiring knowledge and skills to meet clients' specific cultural needs. C ultural com- petence requires an understanding of the client 's worldview and the interactions be- tween that worldview and the cultural identi- ties of the counselor and the client in the therapeutic process. Culturally responsive practice reminds counselors that a client 's world view shapes his or her p erspectives, The Enhanced National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (OMH 2013) are meant to reduce and eliminate disparities, improve quality of care, and promote health equality by establishing a blueprint for health and the organization of health care (see Appendix C or visit http:// www.thinkculturalhealth.hhs.gov ). 8 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence beliefs, and behaviors surrounding substance use and dependence, illness and health, seek-ing help, treatment engagement, counseling expectations, communication, and so on. Cultural competence includes addressing the client individually rather than applying gen- eral treatment approaches based on assump-tions and biases. It also can counteract a potentially omnipotent stance on the part of counselor s that they know what clients need more than the clients themselves do. Cultural competence highlights the need for counselors to take time to build a relationship with each of their clients, to understand the ir client s, and to assess for and access services that will meet each client 's individual needs. The importance and benefit of cultural com-petence does not end with changes in organi-zational policies and pro cedures, increases in program accessibility and tailored treatment services, or enhancement of staff training. In programs that prioritize and endorse cultural competence at all levels of service, clients, too, will have more exposure to psychoeducational and clinical experiences that explore the roles of race, ethnicity, culture, and diversity in the treatment process. Treatment will help clients address their ow n biases, wh ich can affect their perspectives and subsequent relationships with other clients, staff members, and individ- uals outside of the program, including other people in recovery. Culturally responsive services prepare clients not only to embrace their own cultural groups and life experiences, but to acknowledge and respect the experienc-es, perspectives, and diversity of others. How Is Cultural Competence Achieved? Cultural groups are diverse and continuously evolving, defying precise definition s. Cultural competence is not acquired merely by learning a given set of facts about specific populations, changing an organization 's mission statement, or attending a training on cultural compe- tence. Becoming culturally competent is a develop mental process th at begin s with awareness and commitment and evolves into skill building and culturally responsive behav-ior within organization s and among providers. Cultural competence is the ability to recognize the importance of race, ethnicity, and culture in the provision of behavioral health services. Specifically, it is awareness and acknowledg-ment that people from other cultural groups do not necessarily share the same beliefs and practices or perceive, interpret, or encounter similar experiences in the same way. Thus, cultural competence is more than speaking another language or being able to recognize the basic features of a cultural group. Cultural competence means recognizing that each of us, by virtue of our culture, has at least some ethnocentric views that are provide d by that culture and shaped by our individual interpre-tation of it . Cultural competence is rooted in respect, validation, and openness toward someone whose social and cultural back-ground is different from one 's own (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT] 1999b ). Nonetheless, cultural competence literature highlights how difficult it is to appreciate cultural differences and to address these dif-ferences effectively, because many people tend to see things solely from their own culture-bound perspectives. For counselors, specific cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors character-ize the path to culturally competent counsel-ing and culturally responsive services. Exhibit 1-2 depicts the continuum of thoughts and behaviors that lead to cultural competence in the provision of treatment. The \"stages\" are not necessarily linear, and not all people begin with a negative impression of other cultural groups \u2014they may simply fail to recognize differences and diverse ways of being. For 9 Improving Cultural Competence Exhibit 1- 2: The Continuum of Cultural Competence Stage 1: Cul tural Destructiveness Organizational Level: At best, the behavioral health organization negates the relevance of culture in the delivery of behavioral health services. Agencies expect individuals from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds to fit into the existing treatment program rather than ada pting the program to each client to provide culturally congruent services. Driving this expectation is the attitude that mainstream culture and current services are superior and that other approaches (e.g., Native American traditional healing practices) need not be considered. Organizations can also take a more adversarial role at this level\u2014failing to provide basic services, creating an uncomfortable environment to covertly discourage the use of services, or expecting the individual to leave culture at the door. Individual Level: Counselors can also operate from this stance, holding a myopic view of \"effective\" treatment. However, it would likely be difficult to operate at this level as a counselor without organiza- tional endorsement. Counselors can project superiority by stating with authority and conviction in sessions that their approach is the best and expressing directly to clients that they should be grateful to receive these services. At the same time, these counselors filter interactions through a bia sed lens without engaging in self- reflection or examination of the impact of their prejudice. Stage 2: Cultural Incapacity Organizational Level: Due to lack of organizational responsiveness, services and organizational culture may be biased, and clients may view them as oppressive. An agency functioning at cultural incapacity expects clients from diverse backgrounds to conform to services rather t han the agency being flexible and adapting services to meet client needs. Treatment of diverse individuals is often paternalistic, limiting their active participation in treatment planning or minimizing the need for culturally congruent treatment services. Individual Level: Counselors ignore the relevance of culture while using the dominant client popula- tion and/or culture as the norm for assessment, treatment planning, and determination of services. At this level, counselors can be aware of the need to approach treatment differently but likely believe that they are powerless over circumstances or the organizational system. Stage 3: Cultural Blindness Organizational Level: The core belief that perpetuates cultural blindness is the assumption that all cultural groups are alike and have similar experiences. Taking the position that individuals across cultural groups are more alike than different, organizations can rationalize that \"good\" treatment services will suffice for all clients regardless of ethnicity, race, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, or class. Consequently, organizations that operate at this level will continue developing and implementing policies and procedures that propagate discrimination. Individual Level: At this stage, counselo rs uphold the belief that there are no essential differences among individuals across cultural groups \u2014that everyone experiences discrimination and is subject to the biases of others. Counselors rationalize that approaching all clients as individuals negate s the need to focus specifically on cultural competence. For example, some counselors may believe that there is (Continued on the next page.) 10 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence most people, the process of becoming cultural- ly competent is complex, with movement back and forth along the continuum and with feelings and thoughts from more than one stage sometimes existing concurrently . What Is Culture? Culture is defined by a community or society. It structures the way people view the world. It involves the particular set of beliefs, norms, and values concerning the nature of relation-ships, the way people live their lives, a nd the way people organize their environment s. Culture is a complex and rich concept. Under-standing it requires a willingness to examine and grasp its many elements and to compre-hend how they come together. Castro (1998) identified the elements generally agreed to constit ute a culture as : A common heritage and history that is passed from one generation to the next. Exhibit 1 -2: The Continuum of Cultural Competence (continued) too much focus on cultural competence and that training in this area has become the \"pop culture\" in the counseling field, or they may feel that too much time is spent on cultural issues when a good assessment addressing individual issues and needs would suffice. Stage 4: Cultural Precompetence Organizational Level: Organizations at this stage begin to develop a basic understanding of and appreciation for the importance of sociocultural factors in the delivery of care. Similar to the prepara-tion stage identified in the stages of change model (Proch aska et al. 1992; Miller and Rollnick 2013), this level involves recognition of the need for more culturally responsive services, further exploration of steps toward creating more appropriate services for culturally diverse populations, and a general commi tment characterized by small organizational changes. Despite having incomplete knowledge, agencies at this stage can evolve toward organizational cultural competence with support, planning, and commitment from the governing and advisory boards, community, and administrators. Individual Level: Counselors acknowledge a need for more training specific to the populations they serve at this level of development. They acknowledge the need to attend more to ethnicity, race, and culture in the provision of services , but they probably lack the information and skills necessary to translate their recognition into behavioral change. Even so, they are open to training, recognize the importance of developing cultural competence, and have taken small steps to improve their clinical knowledge. Stage 5: Cultural Competence and Proficiency Organizational Level: Organizations are aware of the importance of integrating services that are congruent with diverse populations. Organizations understand that a commitment to cultural co mpe- tence begins with strategic planning to conduct an organizational self- assessment and adopt a cultural competence plan. There is a willingness to be more transparent in evaluating current services and practices and in developing policies and practices that meet the diverse needs of the treatment popu- lation and the community at large. Proficiency on an organizational level is characterized by an ongo- ing commitment to workforce development, training, and evaluation; development of culturally specific and congruent services; and continual performance evaluation and improvement. Individual Level: Recognition of the vital need to adopt culturally responsive practices is present. Counselors acknowledge significant differences across and within races, ethnicitie s, and cultural groups, and they know that these differences need to be integrated into assessment, treatment plan-ning, and services. At this stage, counselors are committed to an ongoing process of becoming cultur- ally competent.

Similar relationship and socialization patterns. A common pattern or style of communica- tion or language. Geographic location of residence ( e.g., country; community; urban, suburban, or rural location). Patterns of dress and diet. Although these criteria cannot be strictly applied to every cultural group, they do suffi-ciently define cultures so that groups are distinguishable to their members and to others (Castro 1998). Note that these criteria apply more or less equally well to cultural groups based on nationality, ethnicity, region (e.g., Southern, Midwestern), profession, and social interests (Exhibit 1 -3 reviews common char- acteristics of culture). However, culture is not a definable entity to which people belong or do not belong. Within a nation, race, or community, people belong to multiple cultural groups, each with its own set of cultural norms (i.e., spoken or unspoken rules or standards that indicate whether a certain behavior, attitude, or belief is appropri-ate or inappropriate). The word \"culture \" can be applied to describe the ways of life of groups formed on the bases Exhibit 1-3 : Common Characteristics of Culture The following list provides exampl es of common elements that distinguish one culture from another. Not every cultural group will define or endorse every item on this list, but most cultural groups will uphold the most common characteristics, which include: Identity development (multiple identities and self- concept). Rites of passage (rituals and rites that mark specific developmental milestones). Broad role of sex and sexuality. Images, symbols, and myths. Religion and spirituality. View, use, and sources of power and authority. Role and use of language (direct or implied). Ceremonies, celebrations, and traditions. Learning modalities, acquisition of knowledge and skills. Patterns of interpersonal interaction (culturally idiosyncratic behaviors). Assumptions, prejudices, stereotypes, and expectations of others. Reward or status systems (meaning of success, role models, or heroes). Migration patterns and geographic location. Concepts of sanction and punishment. Social groupings (support networks, external relationships, and organizational s tructures). Perspectives on the role and status of children and families. Patterns and perspectives on gender roles and relationships. Means of establishing trust, credibility, and legitimacy (appropriate protocols). Coping behaviors and strategies for med iating conflict or solving problems. Sources for acquiring and validating information, attitudes, and beliefs. View of the past and future, and the group 's or individual' s sense of place in society and the world. History and other past circumstances that have contributed to a group 's current economic, social, and political status within the broader culture as well as the experiences associated with developing certain beliefs, norms, and values.

In this TIP , with the exception of the drug culture, the focus is on cultural groups that are shaped by a dynamic interplay among specific factors that shape a person 's identity, including race, ethnicity, religion, socioeco- nomic status, and others. What Is Race? Race is of ten thought to be based on ge netic traits (e.g., skin color), but there is no reliable means of identifying race based on genetic information (HHS 2001). Indeed, 85 perce nt of human genetic diversity is found withi n any \"racial \" group (Barbujani et al. 1997). Thus, what we perceive as diverse races (based largely on selective physical characteristics, such as skin color) are much more genetically similar than they are different. Moreover, physical characteristics ascribed to a particular racial group can also appear in people who are not in that group. Asians, for example, often have an epicanthic eye fold, but this characteristic is also shared by the Kung San bushmen, an African nomadic Tribe (HHS 2001). Although i t lacks a genetic basis, the concept of race is important in discussing cultural competence. Race is a social construct that describes people with shared physical charac-teristics. It can have tremendous social signifi-cance in terms of behavioral health services, social opportunities, status, wealth, and so on. The perception that people who share physical characteristics also share beliefs, v alues, atti- tudes, and ways of being can have a profound impact on people 's lives regardless of whether they identify with the race to which they are ascribed by themselves or others. The major racial groupings designated by the U.S. Census Bureau \u2014African A merican or Black, White American or Caucasian, Asian American, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian /Pacific Islander\u2014are limiting in that they are categories developed to describe identifiable populations that exist currently within the Unite d States. The U.S. Census defines Hispanics/Latinos as an ethnic group rather than a racial group (see the \"What I s Ethnicity? \" section later in this chapter) . Racial labels do not always have clear meaning in other parts of the world; how one 's race is defined can change according to one 's current environme nt or society. A person viewed as Black in the United States can possibly be viewed as W hite in Africa. Racial categories also do not easily account for the complexity of multiracial identities. An estimated 3 per-cent of United States residents (9 million individuals) indicated in the 2010 Census that they are of more than one race (Humes et al. 2011). The percentage of the total United States population who identify as being of mixed race is expected to grow significantly in coming years, and some estimate that it will rise as high as one in five individuals by 2050 (Lee and Bean 2004). White Americans constitute the largest racial group in the United States. In the 2010 Census, 72 percent of the United States popu-lation consisted of non-Hispanic Whites, a classification that has been used by the Census Bureau and others to refer to non -Hispanic people of European, Nort h African, or Middle Eastern descent (Humes et al. 2011). The U.S. Census Bureau predict s, however, that White Americans will be outnumbered by persons of color sometime between the years 2030 and 2050. The primary reasons for the decreasing proportion of White Americans are immigra- tion patterns and lower birth rates among Whites relative to Americans of other racial backgrounds (Sue and Sue 2003 b). Whites are often referred to collectively as Caucasians, although technically, the term 13 Improving Cultural Competence refers to a subgroup of White people from the Caucasus region of Eastern Europe and West Asia. To complicate matters, some Caucasian people \u2014notably some Asian Indians \u2014are typically counted as Asian (U.S. Census Bureau 2001a ). Many subgroups of White Americans (of European, Middle Eastern, or North African descent) have had very differ-ent experiences when immigrating to the United States. African Americans , or Blacks, are the second largest racial group in the United States, ma k- ing up about 13 percent of the United States population in 2010 (Humes et al. 2011). Although most African Americans trace their roots to Africans brought to the Americas as slaves centuries ago, an increasing number are new immigrants from Africa and the Caribbe- an. The terms African American and Black are used synonymously at times in literature and research, but some recent immigrants do not consider themselves to be African American s, assuming that the designation only applies to people of African descent born in the Unit ed States. The racial designation Black, however, encompasses a multitude of cultural and ethnic variations and identities (e.g., African Caribbean, African Bermudian, West African, etc.). The history and experi-ence of African Americans has varied consid-erably in different parts of the United States, and the experience of Black people in this country varies even more when the culture and history of more recent immigrants is consid-ered. Today, African American culture embod-ies elements of Caribbean, Latin Am erican, European, and African cultural groups. Not-ing this diversity, Brisbane (1998) observed that \"these cultures are so unique that practices of some African Americans may not be un- derstood by other African Americans...there is no one c ulture to which all African Americans ...belong \" (p. 2). The racial category of Asian is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau (20 01a) as people \"having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian sub-continent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam \" (p. A -3). In the 2010 census, Asian Americans accounted for 4.8 percent of the total United States population, or 5.6 percent when biracial or multiracial Asians were included (Hoeffel et al. 2012). For those who identified with only one Asian group, 23 percent of Asian Americans were Chinese; 19 percent , Asian Indian; 17 percent 10 percent , Korean; and 5 per- cent, Japanese. Asian Americans compris ed about 43 ethnic subgroups, speaking more than 100 languages and dialects (HHS 2001). The tremendous cultural differences among these groups make generalizations difficult. Until recently, Asian Americans were often grouped with Pacific Islanders (collectively called Asians and Pacific Islanders, or APIs) for data collection and analysis. Beginning with the 2000 C ensus, however, the Federal Gove rnment recognized Pacific Islanders as a distinct racial group. As a result, this TIP does not combine Asians with Pacific Islanders. Nonetheless, remnants of the old classification system are evident in research based on the API grouping. Where possible, the TIP uses data solely for Asians; however, in some cases, the only research available is for the combined API grouping. Native American is a term that describes both American Indians and Alaska Natives. Racially, Native Americans are related to Asian peoples (notably, those from Siberia in Russia), but they are considered a distinct racial category by the U.S. Census Bureau, which further stipulates that people categorized in this fashion have to have a \"Tribal affiliation 14 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence or community attachment \" (U.S. Census Bu- reau 2001a , p. A -3). There are 566 federally recognized American Indian or Alaska Native Tribal entities ( U.S. Department of the Interior , Indian Affairs 2013a ), but there are numerous other Tribes recognized only by States and still others that go unrecognized by any govern- ment agency . These Tribes, despite sharing a racial background, represent a widely diverse group of cultures with diverse languag es, religions, histories, beliefs, and practices. What Is Ethnicity? The term ethnicity is sometimes used inter-changeably with \"race,\" although it is im- portant to draw distinctions between the two. According to Yang (2000), e thnicity refers to the social identity and mutual sense of belong- ing that defines a group of people through common historical or family origins, beliefs, and standards of behavior (i.e., culture ). In some cases, ethnicity also refers to identifica-tion wit h a clan or group whose identity can be based on race as well as culture. Some Latinos, for example, self -identify in terms of both their ethnicity (e.g., their Cuban herit-age) and their race (e.g., whether they are dark or light skinned). Because Latinos can belong to a number of races, the Census Bureau defines them as an ethnic group rather than a race. In 2010, Latinos comprised 16 percent of the United States population (Ennis et al. 2011). They are the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States; between 2000 and 2010, the number of Latinos in the country increased 43 percent, a rate nearly four times higher than that for the total population (Ennis et al. 2011). By 2050, Latinos are expected to make up 29 percent o f the total population (Passel and Cohn 2008). Nearly 60 percent of Latino Americans were born in the United States, but La tinos also account for more than half of the nation 's foreign -born population (Larsen 2004; Ramirez and de la Cruz 2003). Foreign -born Latinos include legal immigrants, some of whom have succeeded in becoming natural-ized American citizens, as well as un docu- mented or illegal immigrants to the United States. Approximately three -quarters (7 4 percent) of the N ation 's unauthorized immi- grant population are Hispanics, mostly from Mexico (Passel and Cohn 2008). The terms \"Hispanic \" and \"Latino \" refer to people whose cultural origins are in Spain or Portugal or the countries of the Western Hemisphere whose culture is significantly influenced by Spanish or Portuguese coloniza-tion. Regional and political differen ces exist among various groups as to whether they prefer one term over the other. The literature currently uses both terms interchangeably, as both terms are widely used and refer generally to the same Latin -heritage population of the United S tates. That said, a distinction can techn ically be drawn between Hispanic (liter- ally meaning people from Spain or its former colonies) and Latino (which refers to persons whose origins lie in countries ranging from Mexico to Central and South America and the Caribbean, which were colonized by Spain, and including Portugal and its former colonies as well). For that reason, this TIP uses the more inclusive term Latino, except when research specifically indicates the other. The term Latinas is used to refer specifically to women who are a part of this cultural group. Ethnicity differs from race in that groups of people can share a common racial ancestry yet have very different ethnic identities. Thus, by definition, ethnicity \u2014unlike race \u2014 is an explicitly cultural phenomenon. It is based on a shared cultural or family herit- age as well as shared values and beliefs rather than shared physical characteristics. 15 Improving Cultural Competence Within a racial group (e.g., Asian, White, Black, Native American), there are many diverse ethnicities, and these diverse ethnici-ties often reflect vast differences in cultural histories. The Whit e Anglo -Saxon Protestant peoples of England and Northern Europe have, for example, many differing cultural attributes and a very different history in the United States than the Mediterranean peoples of Sout hern Europe (e.g., Italians, Greeks). What Is Cultural Identity? Cultural identity describes an individual 's affiliation or identification with a particular group or groups. Cultural identity arises through the interactio n of individuals and culture(s) over the life cycle. Cultural id entities are not static; they develop and change across stages of the life cycle. People reevaluate their cultural identities and sometimes resist, rebel, or reformulate them over time. All people, regardless of race or ethnicity, develop a cul-tural identity (Helms 1995). Cult ural identity is not consistent even among peopl e who identify with the same culture. Two Korean immigrants could both identify strongly with Korean culture but embrace or reject different elements of that culture based on their par- ticular life experiences (e.g., being raised in an urban or rural community, belonging to a lower - or upper -class family). Cultural groups may also place different levels of importance on various aspects of cultural identities. In addition, individuals can hold two or more cultur al identities simultaneously. Some of the factors that are likely to vary among members of the same culture include socioeconomic status, geographic location, gender, education level, occupational status, sexuality, and political and religious affiliation. For individuals whose families are highly acculturated, some of these characteristics (e.g., geogr aphic location, occupation, religion ) can be more important than ethnic culture in defining their sense of identity. The section that follows provides more d etailed infor- mation on the most important cross -cutting factors involved in the creation of a person 's cultural identity. What Are the Cross - Cuttin g Factors in Race, Ethnicity, and Culture? Language and Communication Language is a key element of culture, but speaking the same language does not neces-sarily mean that people share the same cultural beliefs. For example, English is spoken in Australia, Canada, Jamaica, India, Belize, and Nigeria, among other countries. Even within the United States, people from different re-gions can have diverse cultural identities even though they speak the same language. Con-versely , those who share an ethnicity do not automatically share a language. Families who immigrated to this country several generations earlier may ident ify with their culture of origin but no longer be able to speak its language. English is the most common language in the United States, but 18 percent of the total population report speaking a language other than English at home (Shin and Bruno 2003). Styles of communication and nonverbal meth- ods of communication are also important aspects of cultural groups. Issues such as the use of direct versus indirect communication , appropriate personal space , social parameters for and displays of physical contact , use of silence, preferred ways of moving , meaning of gestures, degree to which arguments and verbal confrontations are acceptable, degree of formality expected in communication, and amount of eye contact expected are all cultur-ally defined and reflect very basic ethnic and cultural differences (Comas -Diaz 2012; 16 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence Franks 2000; Sue 2001). More specifically, the relative importance of nonverbal messages varies greatly from culture to culture; high - context cultural groups place greater im- portance on nonverbal cues and the context of verbal messages than do low -context cultural groups (Hall 1976). For example, most Asian Americans come from high -context cultural groups in which sensitive messages are encod-ed carefully to avoid giving offense. A behavioral health service provider who lis- tens only to the liter al meaning of words can miss clients' actual messages . What is left un- said, or the way in which something is said , can be more important than the words used to convey the message. African Americans have a relatively high -context cultur e compared with White Americans but a somewhat lower -context culture compared with Asian Americans (Franks 2000). Thus, African America ns typically rely to a greater degree than White Americans on nonverbal cues in communicating. Conversely, White American culture is low context (as are some European cultural groups, such as German and British); communication is expected to be explicit, a nd formal information is conveyed primarily through the literal content of spoken or writ-ten messages. Geographic Location Cultural groups form within communities and among people who interact meaningfully with each other. Although one can speak of a na-tional culture, the fact is that any culture is subject to local adaptations. Local norms or community rules c an significantly affect a culture. Thus, it is important for providers to be familiar with the local cultural groups they Advice to Counselor s: Cultural Differences in Communication The following examples provide broad descriptions that do not necessarily fit all cultural groups from a specific racial or ethnic group. Counselors should avoid assuming that a client has a particular expectation or expression of nonverbal and verbal communication based solely on race, ethnicity, or cultural heritage. For example, a counselor could make an assumption during an interview that a Native American client prefers a nondirective counseling style coupled with long periods of silence, whereas the client ex pects a more direct, active, goal-oriented approach. Counselors should be knowl edgeable and remain open to differences in communication patterns that can be present when counseling others from diverse backgrounds. The following are some examples of general differ-ences among cultural groups: Individuals from many White/European cultural groups can be uncomfortable with extended silences and can believe them to indicate that nothing is being accomplished (Franks et al. 2000), whereas Native Americans, who often place great emphasis on the value of listening, can find extended silences appropriate for gathering thoughts or showing that they are open to another 's words (Coyhis 2000). Latinos often value personali smo (i.e., warm, genuine communication) in interpersonal relations and value personal rapport in business dealings; they prefer personal relationships to formal ones (Bar\u00f3n 2000; Castro et al. 1999 a). Many Latinos also initially engage in pl\u00e1tica (small talk) to evaluate the relationship and often use pl\u00e1tica prior to disclosing more personal information or addressing serious issues (Comas- Diaz 2012). On the other hand, Asian Americans can be put off by a communication style that is too personal or emotional, and some may lack confidence in a professional whose communication style is too personal (Lee and Mock 2005 a). Some cultural groups are more comfortable with a high degree of verbal confrontation and argument; others stress balance and h armony in relationships and shun confrontation. For some, forceful , direct communication can seem rude or disrespectful. I n many Native American and Latino cultural groups, cooperation and agreeableness (simpat\u00eda) is valued. Members often avoid disagreement, contrad iction, and disharmony within the group (Sue and Sue 2013a ). 17 Improving Cultural Competence encounter \u2014to not think , for example, in terms of a homogeneous Mexican culture so much as the Mexican culture of Los Angeles, CA, or the Mexican culture of El Paso , TX. Geographical factors can also have a signifi- cant effect on a client 's culture. For example, clients coming from a rural area \u2014even if they come from different ethnicities \u2014can have a great deal in common, whereas individuals from the same ethnicity who were raised in different geographic locales can have very different experiences and, consequently, atti-tudes. For example, although the vast majority of Asian Americans live in urban areas (95 percent in 2002; Reeves and Bennett 2003), a partic ular Asian American client may have been born in a rural community or come from a culture (e.g., the Hmong) that developed in remote areas; the client may retain cultural values and interests that reflect those origins. Other clients who currently live in cities may still consider a rural locale as their home and regularly return to it. Many Native Americans who live in urban areas or in communities adjacent to reservations, for example, travel regularly back to their home reservations (Cornell and Kalt 2010; Lobo 2003). In addition to its potential influence upon culture, geography can strongly affect sub-stance use and abuse, mental health and well - being, and acces s to and use of health services (Baicker et al. 2005). In the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 's (SAMHSA 's) 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) , past -month illicit drug use rates among individuals ages 12 and older were 9.9 percent in large metropolitan areas, 8.3 percent in nonmetropolitan urban- ized areas, 5.9 percent in less urbanized non- metropolitan areas, and 4.8 percent in rural areas (SAMHSA 201 3d). In very rural or remote areas, illicit drug use is likely to be even less common than in rural areas (Schoeneberger et al. 2006). Even among members of the same culture, less substance use is observed in those who live in more rural regions. For example, O 'Connell and associ- ates (2005) found that alcohol consumption was lower for American Indians living on reservations than for those who were geo-graphically dispersed (and typically living in urban areas). Likewise, individuals born or living in urban areas may be at greater risk for serious mental illness. In one systematic study, higher distribution rates of schizophrenia were found in urban areas, particularly among people who were born in metropolitan areas (McGrath et al. 2004). Worldview, Value s, and Traditions There are many ways of conceptualizing how culture influences an individual. Culture can be seen as a frame through which one looks at the world, as a repertoire of beliefs and prac-tices that can be used as needed, as a narrative or story explaining who people are and why they do what they do, as a set of institutions defining different aspects of values and tradi-tions, as a series of boundaries that use values and traditions to delineate one group of people from another , and so on. According to Lamont and Small (2008), such schemata recognize that culture shapes what people believe (i.e., their values and worldviews) and what they do to demonstrate their beliefs (i.e., their tradi- tions and practices). Cultural groups define the values, worldvi ews, and traditions of their members \u2014from food preferences to appropri- ate leisure activities \u2014including use of alc ohol and/or drugs (Bhugra and Becker 2005). Thus, it is impossible to review and summarize the variety of cultural values, traditions, and worldviews found in the United States in this publication. Providers are encouraged to speak with their clients to le arn about their worldviews, values, and traditions and to seek training and consul tation to gain specific 18 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence knowledge about clients' cultural beliefs and practices. Family and Kinship Although families are important in all cultural groups, concepts of and at titudes toward family are culturally defined and can vary in a number of ways, including the relative im-portance of particular family ties, the family 's inclusiveness, how hierarchical the family is, and how family roles and behaviors are de-fined (McGoldri ck et al. 2005). In some cul- tural groups (e.g., White American s of Western European descent, such as German, English ), family is limited to the nuclear family, where-as in other group s (e.g., African American s; Asian American s; Native American s; White American s of Southern European descent, such as Italian, Greek ), the idea of family typically includes many other blood or marital relations (Almeida 2005; Hines and Boyd -Franklin 2005; Marinangeli 2001; McGill and Pearce 2005; McGoldrick et al. 2005). Som e cultural groups clearly define roles for different family members and carefully prescribe methods of behaving toward one another based on specific relationships. For example, in Korean culture, wives are expected to defer to their in -laws about many deci sions (Kim and Ryu 2005). Even in cultural groups with carefully defined roles and rules f or family members, family dynamics may change as the result of internal or external forces. The process of accultura-tion, for instance, can significantly affect famil y roles and dynamics among immigrant families , causing the dissolution of longstand- ing cultural hierarchies and traditions within the family and resulting in conflict between spouses or different generations of the family (Hernandez 2005; Juang et al. 2012; Lee and Mock 2005a ). Information on family therapy with major ethnic/racial groups is pro vided in Chapter 5 of this TIP . Details of the role of family in treatment and the provision of family therapy appear in TIP 39, Substance Abuse Treatment and Family Therapy (CSAT 2004b ). Gender Roles Gender roles are largely cultural constructs; diverse cultural groups have different under-standings of the proper roles, attitudes, and behaviors for men and women. Even within modern American society, there are variatio ns in how cultural groups respond to gender norms. For example, after controlling for income and education, African American women are less accepting than White American women of traditional American gender stereotypes regarding public behavior but more ac cepting of traditional domestic gender roles (Dugger 1991; Haynes 2000). Culturally defined gender roles also appear to have a strong effect on substance use and abuse. This can perhaps be seen most clearly in international research indicating that, in societies with more egalitarian relationships between men and women, women typically consume more alcohol and have drinking pattern s more closely resembling those of men in the society (Bloomfield et al. 2006). A similar effect can be seen in research conduct-ed in the United States with Latino men and women with varying levels of acculturation to mainstream American society (Markides et al. 2012; Zemore 2005). The terms for and definitions of gender roles can also vary. For example, in Latino cultural groups, importance is placed on machismo (the belief that men must be strong and protect their families), caballerism o (men 's emotional connectedness), and marianismo (the idea that women should be self -sacrificing, endure suffering for the sake of their families, and defer to their husbands) (Arciniega et al. 2008; Torres et al. 2002). These strong gender roles have benefits in Latino culture, such as simpli-fying and clarifying roles and responsibilities, 19 Improving Cultural Competence but they are also sources of potential problems, such as li miting help -seeking behavior or the identification of difficulties. For example, because of the need to appear in control, a Latino man can have difficulty admitting that his substance use is out of control or that he i s experiencing psychological distress (Castro et al. 1999a ). For Latinas, the difficulties of negotiating traditional gender roles while encountering new values through accultura-tion can lead to increased substance use/abuse and mental distress (Gil and Vazquez 1996; Gloria and Peregoy 1996; Mora 2002). Negotiating gender roles in a treatment set-ting is often difficult ; providers should not assume that a client 's traditional culture -based gender roles are best for him or her or that mainstream American ideas about gender are most appropriate. The client 's degree of accul- turation and adherence to traditional values must be taken into consideration and respect-ed. Two TIPs explore the relationship of gender to substance abuse and substance abuse treatment: TIP 51, Substance Abuse Treatment: Addressing the Specific Needs of Women (CSAT 2009c ), and TIP 56, Addressing the Specific Behavioral Health Needs of Men (SAMHSA 2013 a). TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co -Occurring Disorders , addresses the relationship s among gender, mental illness, and substance use disorders (CSAT 2005d ). Socioeconomic Status and Education Sociologists often discuss social class a s an important aspect in defining an individual 's cultural background. In this TIP , socioeco-nomic status (SES) is used as a category simi- lar to class \u2014the difference being that socioeconomic status is a more flexible and less hierarchically defined concept. SES in the United States is related to many factors , in- cluding occupational prestige and education, yet it is primar ily associated with income level. Thus , SES affects culture in several ways, namely through a person 's ability to accumu- late material wea lth, access opportunities, and What Causes Health Disparities? The National Institutes of Health (NIH; 2012, Overview, p. 1) define health disparities as \"differences in the incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and burden of diseases and other adverse health conditions that exist among specific population groups.\" Numerous studies have found longstanding health disparities among racial/ethnic groups in the United States (Smedly et al. 2003), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) issues yearly reports that provide updates on this topic (AHRQ 2012). An Institute of Medicine report on disparities (Smedly et al. 2003) found multiple causes for these disparities, including historical inequalities that have influenced the healthcare system, persistent racial and ethnic discrimination, and distrust of the healthcare system among certain ethnic and racial groups. However, the most persistent and prominent cause appears to be disparities in SES, which affect insurance coverage and access to quality care (Russell 2011). These economic disparities account for signi ficantly higher death rates, particularly among African Americans compared with non- Hispanic Whites (Arias 2010), as well as greater lack of insurance coverage or worse coverage for people of color (Smedly et al. 2003). Evidence- based interventions to reduce health disparities are limited (Beach et al. 2006; Carpenter - Song et al. 2011). Current strategies generally focus on reducing risk factors that affect groups who experience a greater burden from poor health (Murray et al. 2006). The Federal Government has recognized the need to address health disparities and has made this issue a priority for agencies that deal with health care (HHS 2011b). As part of this effort, it has created the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (see http://ncmhd.nih.gov/ ). More specific information on mental health and substance abuse treatment disparities is provided in Chapter 5 of this TIP. 20 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence use resources. Discrimination and historical racism have led to lasting inequalities i n SES (Weller et al. 2012; Williams and Williams - Morris 2000). SES affects mental health and substance use. From 2005 to 2010, adults 45 through 64 years of age were five times more likely to have depression if they were poor (National Center for Health Statistics 2012). Serious mental illness among adults living in poverty has a prevalence rate of 9.1 percent (SAMHSA 2010). Some research d emon- strates higher risk for schizophrenia from lower socioeconomic levels, but other studies draw no definite conclusion (Murali and Oyebode 2010). Most literature suggests that poverty and its consequences, including lim- ited access to resources, increase stress and vulnerability among individuals who may already be predisposed to mental illness. Of-ten, theoretical discussions explaining a signif- icant relationship between mental illness and SES suggest a bidirectional relationship in which s tress from poverty leads to mental illness vulnerability and/or mental illness leads to difficulty in maintaining employment and sufficient income. Studies have had conflicting results as to whether people with high or low SES are more likely to abuse substances (Jones -Webb et al. 1995). In international studies, increases in wealth on a societal level have been associ-ated with increases in alcohol consumption (Bergmark and Kuendig 2008; Kuntsche et al. 2006; Room et al. 2003). However, other factors , such as the availability of social sup- port systems and education, as well as the individual 's acculturation level, can also play a role. Karriker -Jaffe and Zemore (2009) found that, in immigrants, a greater level of accul- turation was associated with increased heavy drinking for those with above -average SES but not for those with lower SES. Besides lower socioeconomic status, neighborhood poverty (defined as having a high [20 per-cent] proportion of residents living in poverty) was associated with binge drinking and higher rates of substance -related problems, pa rticu- larly for men (McKinney et al. 2012). Education is also an important factor related to SES (Exhibit 1 -4). H igher levels of educa- tion are associated with increased income, although the degree to which education in-creases income varies among diverse ra-cial/ethnic groups (Crissey 2009). Research in the United States has found that problems with alcohol are often associated with lower SES and lower levels of education (Crum 2003; Mulia et al. 2008). However, other studies have shown that greater frequency of drinking and number of drinks consumed are generally associated with higher levels of education and higher SES (Casswell et al. 2003; van Oers et al. 1999). For example, the 2012 NSDUH showe d that adult rates of past-month alcohol use increased with in- creasing levels of education; a mong those with Social Determinants of Health Per Healthy People 2020 ( http://www.healthypeople.gov ), a federal prevention agenda involving a multiagency effort to identify preventable threats to health and set goals for reducing them, \"social determinants of health are conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality -of-life outcomes and risks.\" Social determinants include access to educational, economic, and vocational training; job oppor-tunities; transportation; he althcare services; emerging healthcare technologies; availability of communi- ty-based resources, basic resources to meet daily living needs, language services, and social support; exposure to crime; social disorder; community and concentrated poverty; and residential segregation.

(SAMHSA 201 3d). Education can also affect substance use independently of S ES. For example, lower education levels seem to relate to heavy drinking independently of socioeco-nomic status (Kuntsche et al. 2006). The desperation associated with poverty and a lack of opportunity \u2014as well as the increased exposure to illicit drugs that comes from living in a more impoverished environment \u2014can also increase drug use (Bourgois 2003). Lower SES and the concurrent lack of either money or insurance to pay for treatment are associat-ed with less access to substance abuse treat-ment and mental health services (Chow et al. 2003). For example, compared with Medicare coverage, private in surance coverage increases the odds twofold that someone who has a substance use disorder will enter treatment (Schmidt and Weisner 2005). Thus, lower SES can have a dramatic effect on recovery. Immigration and Migration With the exception of American Indians, Alaska Na tives, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders, the United States is a coun-try of immigrants. Recent immigrants, even when they come from diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds, typically share certain ex perienc- es and expectations in common. Often, they encounter a difficult process of acculturation (as discussed throughout this chapter ). They can also share concerns surrounding the re-newal of visas, obtainment of citizenship, or fears of possible deportat ion depending on their legal status. I mmigration itself is stressful for immigrants , though the reasons for mi- grating and the legal status of the immigrant affect the degree of stress. For documented residents, the process of adaptation tends to be smoothe r than for those who are undocu- mented. Undocumented persons may be wary of deportation, are less likely to seek social services, and frequently encounter hostility (Padilla and Salgado de Snyder 1992). Nonetheless, there are numerous variables that contri bute to or influence well -being, quality of life, cultural adaptation, an d the develop- ment of resilience (e.g., the c apacity to mobi- lize social supports and bicultural integration; Castro and Murray 2010). Research suggests that immigrants may not experience higher rates of mental illness than non immigrants (Alegri a et al. 2006), ye t immigration nearly always includes separation from one 's family and culture and can involve a grieving process Exhibit 1 -4: Education and Cult ure Culture has an effect on an individual 's attitudes toward education; for instance, a lack of cultural understanding on the part of educational institutions affects student goals and achievements (Sue 2001). A number of factors besides culture also appear to affect educational attainment, including immigration status and longstanding systemic biases. For example, 88 percent of the native- born United States population ages 25 and older had at least a high school degree in 2007, but only 68 percent who were foreign -born were high school graduates (Crissey 2009). Research also highlights large within -group differences in educational attainment. For example, among Asian Americans, who overall have high levels of education, some groups had very low rates \u2014only 16 percent of Vietnamese Americans and 5 percent of other Southeast Asian Americans had a college degree in 2000 (Reeves and Bennett 2003). Immigration status does not always affect education status in the same way. For non- Latino Whites and Blacks, being born outside the United States is associated with a greater likelihood of obtaining at least a bachelor 's degree. African immigrants have the highest level of education of any immigrant group, higher than White or Asian immigrants (African Immigrant 2000) . 22 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence as a result of these losses as well as other changes, inc luding changes in socioeconomic status, physical environment, social support, and cultural practices. Immigrants who are refugees from war, fam-ine, oppression, and other dangerous environ-ments are more vulnerable to psychological distress (APA 2010). They are likely to have left behind painful and often life -threatening situations in their countries of ori gin and can still bear the scars of these experiences. Some refugees come to the United States with high expectations for improved living conditions, only to find significant barriers to their full participation in American society (e.g., lan-guage barriers, discrimination, poverty). Expe-riencing such traumatic conditions can also increase substance use/abuse among some groups of immigrants (see TIP 57, Trauma - Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services [SAMHSA 2014 ]). Behavioral health services must assess the needs of refugee populations, as the clinical issues for these populations may be considerably different than for immigrant groups (Kaczorowski et al. 2011). For immigrant families, disruption of roles and norms often occurs upon arrival in the United States (for review, see Falicov 2012). Generally, youth adopt American customs, values, and behaviors much more easily and at higher rates than their parents or older mem-bers of the extended family. P arental frustra- tion may occur if traditional standards o f behavior conflict with mainstream norms acquired by their children. The differences in parent s' values and expectations and adoles- cents ' behavior can lead to distress in close - knit immigrant families. This disruption, known as the acculturation gap, can result in increased parent -child conflicts (APA 2012; Falicov 2012; Telzer 2010). For some youth, it may contribute to experimentation with alco-hol and/or illicit drugs \u2014increased accultura- tion is typically associated with increased substance use and substance use disorders. Overall, \"old country \" or traditional behavioral norms and expectations for appropriate behav-ior become increasingly devalued in American majority culture for members of various immi-grant groups (Padilla and Salgado de Snyder 1992; Sand hu and Malik 2001). Research shows that family cohesion and adaptability decrease with time spent in the United States, regardless of the amount of involvement in mainstream culture. This suggests that other factors may confound the relationship between family conflict and increased exposure to American culture (Smokowski et al. 2008). Advice to Counselors and Clinical Supervisors: Initial Interview and Assessment Questions When working with clients who are recent immigrants or have immigrated to United States during their lifetime, the APA (1990) recom-mends exploring: Number of generations in the United States. Number of years in the United States. Fluency in English (or literacy). Extent (or lack) of family support. Community resources. Level of education. Change in social status due to immigration. Extent of personal relationships with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. Stress due to migration and acculturation.The Cultural Orientation Resource Center The Cultural Orientation Resource Center, funded by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, is a useful resource for clinicians to gain infor-mation about topics including culture, reset-tlement experiences, and historical and refugee background information. This site is also quite useful for refugees. It provides refugee orienta-tion materials and guidance in establishing housing, language, transportation, education, and community services, among other pressing refugee concern s. 23 Improving Cultural Competence Exhibit 1 -5: Cultural Identification and Cultural Change Terminology Acculturation is the process whereby an individual from one cultural group learns and adopts elements of another cultural group, integrating them into his or her original culture. Although it can refer to any process of cultural integration, it is typically used to describe the ways in which an immigrant or nonmajority individual or group adopts cultural elements from the majority or mainstream culture, as the incentive is typically greater for accul-turation to occur in this direction (see Lopez -Class et al. 2011 for a historical review of acculturation concepts). Assimilation is one outcome of acculturation. It involves the complete adoption of the ways of life of the new cultural group, resulting in the assimilated group losing nearly all of its original or native culture. Segmented assimila tion describes a more complicated process of assimilation whereby an immigrant group does not assimilate entirely with mainstream culture but adopts aspects of other diverse cultural groups that are themselves outside mainstream culture (e.g., involvement in the drug culture; see Chapter 6 of this TIP and Portes et al. 2005). Biculturalism occurs when an individual acquires the knowledge, skills, and identity of both his or her culture of origin and the mainstream/majority culture and is equally (or nearly equally) capable of social and cultural interaction in both societies. Enculturation can denote a process whereby an individual adopts the culture that surrounds him or her (similar to acculturation), but the term has more recently been used to describe th e pro- cess by which individuals come to value their native cultures and begin to learn about and adopt their native cultural lifeways. Sources: LaFromboise et al. 2008; Stone et al. 2006 . Clients who are migrants (e.g., seasonal work- ers) pose a particular set of challenges for treatment providers because of the difficulties involved in connecting clients to t reatment programs and recovery communities. In the United States, migrant workers are considered one of most marginalized and underserved populations (Bail et al. 2012). Migrants face many logistical obstacles to treatment -seeking, such as lack of childcare, insurance, access to regular health care, and transportation (Hovey 2001; Rosenbaum and Shin 2005). Current data are limited but suggest high rates of alcohol use, alcohol use disor-ders, and binge drinking, often occurring as a response to stress or boredom associated with the migrant lifestyle (Hovey 2001; Worby and Organista 2007). In addition, limited data o n migrant men- tal health reflect mixed find- ings regarding increased risk for mental illness or psycho-logical distress (Alderete et al. 2000). One factor associated with mental health status is the set of circumstances lead- ing up to the migrant worker 's decision to migrate for em-ployment (Grzywacz et al. 2006). Acculturation and Cultural Identification Many factors contribute to an individual 's cultural identity, and that identity is not a static attribute. There are many forces at work that pressure a person to alter his or her cultural identity to conform to the mainstream culture 's concept of a \"proper \" identity. As a result, people may feel conflicted about their identities \u2014wanting to fit in with the mainstream culture while also wanting to retain the values of their culture of origin. For clients, sorting through these conflicting cultural expectations and forging a comforta-ble identit y can be an important part of the recovery process. Some of the more commonly used terms related to cultural identity are defined in Exhibit 1 -5. All immigrants underg o some acculturation over time, but the rate of change varies from group to group, among individuals, and across 24 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence different periods of history. Earlier theories suggested that immigrants generally assimilat-ed within three generations from the time of immigration and that assimilation was associ-ated with socioeconomic gains. M ore recent scholarship suggests that this is changing among some cultural groups who may lack the financial or human capital necessary to suc-ceed in mainstream society or who may find that continued involvement in their native or traditional culture has benefits that outweigh those associated with acculturation (Portes et al. 2005; Portes and Rumbaut 2005). Acculturation typically occurs at varying speeds for different generations, e ven within the same family. Acculturation c an thus be a source of conflict within famil ies, especially when parents and children have different levels of accultura-tion (Exhibit 1 -6) (Castro and Murray 2010; Farv er et al. 2002; Hernandez 2005). Others have suggested that acculturation can negative-ly affect mental health because it ero des tradi- tional family networks and/or because it results in the loss of traditional culture, which o ther- wise would have a protective function (Escobar and Vega 2000; Sandhu and Malik 2001). Many studies have found that increased acc ul- turation or factors related to acculturation are associated with increased alcohol and drug use and with higher rates of substance use disor-ders among Whit e, Asian, and Latino immi- grants (Alegria et al. 2006; Grant et al. 2004a ; Grant et al. 2004b ; Vega et al. 2004). Place of birth is most strongly associated with higher rates of substance use and disorders thereof . For exam ple, research suggests a rate of sub- stance use disorders about three times higher for Mexican Americans born in the United States than for those born in Mexico (Alegria et al. 2008a ; Escobar and Vega 2000). Asian adolescents born in the United States present a higher rate of past -month alcohol use than Asian adolescents not born in the United States (8.7 v ersus 4.7 percent); however, the rate of nonmedical use of prescription drugs is higher among Asian adolescents not born in the United States than among those born in the United States (2.7 v ersus 1.4 percent; SAMHSA, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 201 2). Acculturation can increase substance use/abuse, in part because the process of accul- turation is itself stressful (Berry 1998; Vega et al. 2004). Mora (2002) asserts that the stress associated with acculturation has a significant effect on increasing substance use and abuse among Latinas ; this can be observed most clearly in the increases in substance use associ-ated with being a second - or third -generation Exhibit 1 -6: Five Levels of Acculturation Numerous models have been developed to explain the process of acculturation. Choney et al. (1995) proposed a model, applicable to a number of different contexts, that features five levels: 1. A traditional orientation: The individual is entirely oriented towa rd his or her native cul ture. 2. A transitional orientation: The individual is more oriented toward traditional culture but has some familiarity with mainstream culture. 3. A bicultural orientation: The individual is equally comfortable with and knowledgeable of both traditional and mainstream culture. 4. An assimilated orientation: The individual is mostly oriented toward mainstream culture but has some familiarity with the traditional/native culture. 5. A marginal orientation: The individual is not comfortable with either culture. Note: This is not a stage model in which a person naturally moves from one orientation to the next, nor does this model place greater value on one level versus another. The authors emphasize that each level of acculturation has strengths. 25 Improving Cultural Competence Latina from an immigrant family. The stress associated with acculturation could also con-tribute to rates of mental disorders and co - occurring disorders (COD s), which are higher among more acculturated groups of immi-grants (Cherpitel et al. 2007; Escobar and Vega 2000; Grant et al. 2004a ; Organista et al. 2003; Vega et al. 2009; Ward 2008). In fact, American -born Latinos who have used sub- stances are three times more likely to have COD s than foreign -born Latinos who have used substances (V ega et al . 2009). R esearch also suggests that acculturation could interact with factors such as culture or stress in in-creasing mental disorders. Rates of substance use/abuse in the United States are among the highest in the world (United Nations, Office o n Drugs and Crime 2008, 2012), so for many immigrants, adopt-ing mainstream American cultural values and lifestyles can also entail changing attitudes toward substance use. As an example, Marin (1998) found that , compared with Whites, Mexican Americans expected significantly more negative consequences and fewer posi-tive ones from drinking , but Marin also found that the more acculturated the Mexican American participants were, the more closely their expectations resembled those of Whites. Other factors that c an contribute to increased substance use among more acculturated clients include changes in traditional gender roles, exposure to social ly and physical ly challenging inner -city environments (Amaro and Aguiar 1995), and employment outside the home (often a role -transforming change that can contribute to incr eased risk of alcohol depend- ence). Although much of the research has focused on the relationship of acculturation to male substance use/abuse patterns, women can be even more affected by acculturation. Multi-ple studies using international samples have found that the greater the amount of gender equality in a society, the more similar alcohol consumption patterns are for men and women (Bloomfield et al. 2006). Many immigrants to the United States (where gender equality is relatively strong) come from societies with less gender equality and thus with greater prohibi- tions against alcohol use for women. Karriker -Jaffe and Zemore (2009) found that higher levels of acculturation are associated with increased alc ohol consumption only when combined with above- average SES (and not with lower SES), suggesting that income is another factor to consider when evaluating the effect of acculturation on alcohol use. There are exceptions to the idea that accul- turation incre ases substance use/abuse. Most notably, immigrants coming from countries with unusually high levels of drinking do not necessarily experience a change in their use, and they may even consume less alcohol and fewer drugs that they did in their native coun-tries. Even among those born in the United States, however, data suggest that greater identification with one 's traditional culture has a protective function. For example, in the National Latino and Asian American Study, the largest national survey specifically target-ing these population groups to date, great er ethnic identification was associated with significantly lower rates of alcohol use disor-ders among Asian Americans (Chae et al. 2008), and the use of Spanish with one 's family was linked with significantly lower rates of alcohol use disorders in Latino s (Canin o et al. 2008). Less research is available on the relationship of accultura tion to substance use and substance use disorders among nonimmigrants, but some data suggest that a lower level of identification with one 's native culture is linked with heavier, lengthier substance use among American Indians living on reservations (Herman -Stahl et al. 2003). For some American Indians, more 26 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence involvement in Tribal culture and traditional spiritual activities is associated w ith better posttreatment outcomes for alcohol use disor- ders (Stone et al. 2006). American Indians who drink heavily but live a traditional life- style have better recovery outcomes than those who do not live a traditional lifestyle (Kunitz et al. 1994). Likewise, African Americans may have greater motivation for treatment if they recognize that they have a drug problem and also have a strong Afrocen tric identity (Longshore et al. 1998b ). Strong cultural or racial/ethnic ide ntity can have protective features, whereas acculturation can lead to a loss of cultural identity that increase s sub- stance abuse and contribute s to poorer recov- ery outcomes for both Native Americans and African Ameri cans. Overall, acculturation and cultural identifica-tion have tremendous implicatio ns for behav- ioral health services. Research has shown an association be tween low levels of acculturation and low usage rates of mainstream healthcare services. Individuals can feel conflicted about their identities \u2014wanting to both fit in with the mainstream culture and retain the tradi-tions and beliefs of their cultures of or igin. For such clients, sorting through these conflicting cultural expectations and forging a comforta-ble identity can be an important part of the recovery process. Familiarity with cultural identity formation models and theories of acculturation (includin g acculturation meas- urement methods; see can help behavi oral health workers prov ide services with greater flexibility and sensitivity ( see Appendix B for instruments that measure aspects of cultural identity and acculturation). Heritage and Hi story A culture 's history and heritage explain the culture 's development through the actions of members of that culture and also through the actions of others toward the specific culture. Providers should be knowledgeable about the many positive aspects of each culture 's history and heritage and resourceful in learning how to integrate these into clinical practice. Nearly all immigrant groups have experienced some degree of trauma in leaving behind Exhibit 1 -7: Measuring Acculturation Acculturation is a construct that includes factors relating to behavior, knowledge, values, self- identification, and language use (Zea et al. 2003). One of the biggest problems in analyzing the effects of acculturation is determining how to define and evaluate it. In research literature, accultura-tion is inconsistently defined and measured. In some large- scale surveys, it is not defined at all, but only implied in other factors, such as length of stay in the United States, English language use, or place of birth. Overall, instruments that assess acculturation do not ask the same questions or ad-dress the same factors, thus making it unclear whether acculturation is truly being evaluated (Zane and Mak 2003). More research is warranted on how to conceptualize a nd evaluate acculturation and cultural identity. Many acculturation tools focus on specific racial or ethnic groups (for example, see Wallace et al. 2010). Acculturation and cultural identity instruments typically ask questions about language use and preference (e.g., whether English is used at home), media preferences (e.g., preference for foreign language programming), social interactions (e.g., friendships with persons from other ethnici-ties/cultural groups), cultural knowledge (e.g., knowledge of beliefs, traditions, and ceremonies specific to a cultural or ethnic group), and cultural values (Zea et al. 2003). Others evaluate accultura-tion simply by asking which culture a person identifies with most. Organista et al. (2003) and Zane and Mak (2003) reviewed measures designed to evaluate acculturation and cultural identity. Appendix B provides a sample of acculturation and cultural identity instruments. 27 Improving Cultural Competence family members, friends, and/or familiar places. Their eag erness to assimilate or remain separate depends greatly on the circumstances of their immigration (Castro and Murray 2010). Additionally, some immigrants are refugees from war, famine, natural disasters, and/or persecution. The depths of suffering that som e clients have endured can result in multiple or confusing symptoms. For example, a traumatized Congolese woman could speak of hearing voices, and it could be unclear whether these voices suggest an issue requiring spiritual healing within a cultural frame work, a traumatic stress reaction, or a mental disor-der involving the onset of auditory hallucina-tions. Those who have watched close family members die violently can have \"survivor guilt \" as well as agonizing memories. Amodeo et al. (1997) report that \"somatic complaints, in- cluding trouble sleeping, loss of appetite, stomach pains, other bodily pains, headaches, fatigue or lack of energy, memory problems, mood swings and social withdrawal have been reported to be among the refugees' most fre- quent presenting problems\" (p. 70). For an overview of the impact of trauma, see TIP 57, Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services (SAMHSA 2014). Abueg and Chun (1998) caution, however, that \"traumatic experience is not homogenous\" (p. 292). Experiences before, during, and after migration and/or encampment vary depending on the country of origin as well as the time and motivation for migration. Within the United States, cultural groups such as African Americans and Native Americans have lon g histories of traumatic events, which have had lasting effects on the descendants of those who experienced the original trauma. Conse- quently, past as well as present discrimination and racism are related to a number of negative consequences across diverse populations, in- cluding lower SES, health disparities, and fewer employment and educational opportunities (see review in Williams and Wil liams -Morris 2000). According to theories of historical trauma, the traumas of the past continue to affect later genera tions of a group of people. This concept was first developed to explain how the trauma of the Holocaust continued to affect the de-scendants of survivors (Duran et al. 1998; Sotero 2006). In the United States, it has perhaps been best explored in relation t o the traumas endur ed by Native American peoples during the colonization and expansion of the United States. One can extend this concept to other groups (e.g., African Americans, Cambodians, Rwandans) who suffered trau- matic events like slavery or genocide. Among Native Americans in treatment for substance use and/or mental disorders, histori-cal trauma is an important clinical issue (Brave Heart et al. 2011; Duran et al. 1998; Evans - Campbell 2008). S ome research indicates that thinking about historical loss or displaying symptoms associated with historical trauma plays into increases in alcohol use disorders, other substance use, and lower family cohesion (Whitbeck et al. 2004 ; Wiechelt et al. 2012). Brave Heart (1999) theorizes that historical traumas perpetuate their effects among Native Americans by harming parenting skills and increasing abuse of children, which creates a cyclical pattern \u2014greater levels of mental and substance use disorders in the next generation along with continued poor parenting skills. Specifically, Libby et al. (2008) found that substance use was involved in the intergenera-tional transmission of trauma. Additional research highlights a relationship between elevated chronic trauma exposure and preva-lence of both mental and substance use disor- ders among large samples of American Indian adults living on reservations (Beals et al. 2005; Manson et al. 2005). 28 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence Sotero (2006) reviews research on historical trauma across diverse populations and propos-es a similar explanation of how deliberately perpetrated, large -scale traumatic events co n- tinue affecting communities years after they occur . She argues that the generation that directly experiences the trauma suffers material (e.g., displacement), psychological (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder), economic (e.g., loss of sources of income/sustenance), and cultural (e.g., lost knowledge of traditions and beliefs) effects. These lasting sequelae of trauma then affect the next generation, who can suffer in many similar ways, resulting in poorer coping skills or in attempts to self -medicate distress through substance abuse. Sexuality Attitudes toward sexuality in general and toward sexual identity or orientation are cul- turally defined. Each culture determines how to conceptualize specific sexual behaviors, the degree to which they accept same -sex relation- ships, and the types of sexual behaviors con-sidered acceptable or not (Ahmad and Bhugra 2010). I n any cultural group , diverse views and attitudes about appropriate gender norms and behavior can exist. For example, in some Latino cultural groups, homosexual behavior, espe-cially among men, is not seen as an identity but as a curable illness or immoral behavior (Kusnir 2005). In some Latino cultural groups, self - identifying as other than heterosexual may provoke a more negative response than engag-ing in some homosexual behaviors (de Korin and Petry 2005; Greene 1997; Kusnir 2005). For individuals from various ethnic/racial groups in Un ited States, having a sexual iden- tity different from the norm can result in increased substance use/abuse, in part because of increased stress. Additionally, alcohol and drug use can be more acceptable within some segments of gay/lesbian/bisexual cultures (Balsam et al. 2004; CSAT 2001; Mays et al. 2002). As a result of a lack of acceptance within both mainstream and diverse eth-nic/racial communities, various gay cultures have developed in the United States. For some individuals, gay culture provides an alt ernative to their culture of origin, but unfortunately, cultural pressures can make the individual feel like he or she has to select which identity is most important (Greene 1997). However, a person can be , for example, both gay and Latino without experien cing any conflicts about claiming both identities at the same time. For more information on substance abuse treatment for persons who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, refer to the CSAT (2001) publication, A Provider 's Introduction to Substance Abuse Treatment for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Individuals. Heterosexual behaviors are carefully prescribed by a culture. Typically, these prescriptions are determined based on gender; behaviors con-sidered acceptable for men can be considered unacce ptable for women and vice versa. In addition, cultures define the role of alcohol or other substances in courtship, sexual behaviors, and relationships (Room 1996). Other factors that can vary across cultural groups include the appropriate age for sexual a ctivity, the rituals and actions surrounding sexual activity, the use of birth control, the level of secrecy or open-ness related to sexual acts, the role of sex workers, attitudes toward sexual dysfunction, and the level of sexual freedom in choosing partn ers. Perspectives on Health, Illness, and Healing Beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors related to health, i llness, and healing vary across racial, ethnic, and cultural groups. Many cultural groups hold views that differ significantly from those of Western med ical practice and thus can affect treatment (Sussman 2004). The field of medical anthropology was developed, 29 Improving Cultural Competence in part, to analyze these differences, and much has been written about the range of cultural beliefs concerning health and healing. In general, cultural groups differ in how they define and determine health and illness; who is able to diagnosis and treat an illness; their beliefs about the causes of illness; and their remedies (including the use of Western medi- cines), treatments, and healing practice s for illness (Bhugra and Gupta 2010; Comas -Diaz 2012). In addition, there are complex rules about which members of a community or family can make decisions about health care across cultural groups (Sussman 2004). In mainstream American society, healthcare professionals are typically viewed as the only ones who have real expertise about health and illness. However, other societies have different views. For instance, among the Subanun peo-ple of the Philippines, all members of the community learn about healin g and diagnosis; when an individual is sick, the diagnosis of his or her problem is an activity that involves the whole community (Frake 1961). Cultural groups also differ in their understanding of the causes of illness, and many cultural groups recognize a spiritual element in physical ill- ness. The Hmong, for example, believe that illness has a spiritu al cause and that healing may require shamans who communicate with spirits to diagnose and treat an illness (Fadiman 1997; Gensheimer 2006). With respect to mental health, providers should be aware that any mental disorder or symptom is only considered a disorder or problem by comparison with a socially defined norm. For instance, in some societies, someone who hears voices can be considered to have greater access to the spirit world and to be blessed in some way. Furthermore , there are mental disorders that only present in a specific cultural group or locality; these are called cultural concepts of distress. Appendix E describes cultural concep ts of distress recog- nized by the DSM -5. Other specific examples of cultural differences relating to the use of health care and alternative approaches to medical diagnosis and treatment are also presented in Chapter 5. Religion and Spirituality Religious traditions or spiritual beliefs are often very important factors for defining an individual 's cultural background. In turn, attention to religion and spirituality during the course of treatment is one facet of cultur-ally competent services (Whitley 2012). Christians, Muslims, Jews, and Buddhists (among others) can be members of any racial or ethnic group; in the same vein, people of the same ethnicity who belong to different religions sometimes have less in common than people of the same religion but differen t ethnicities. In some cases, religious affiliation is an especially important factor in defining a person 's culture. For instance, the American Religious Identification Survey reported that 47 percent of the respondents who identified culturally as Jewish were not practicing Jews (Kosmin et al. 2001). According to the American Religious Identifi-cation Survey (Kosmin and Keysar 2009), only 15 percent of Americans identified as not having a religion; of those, less than 2 percent identified as atheist or agn ostic. In another survey from the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life (2008), 1.6 percent of respondents stated that they were atheist ; 2.4 percent , agnostic; and 6.3 percent , secular and unaffili- ated with a religion. Many religions are prac-ticed in the United States today. T his TIP cannot cover them all i n detail in . However, this TIP does briefly describe the four most common (by size of self -identified member- ship) religious traditions. 30 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence Christianity Christianity, in its various forms, remains the predominant religion in the United States today. According to Kosmin and Keysar (2009), 76 percent of the population in 2008 identified as Christian, with the largest denom-ination being Catholics (25.1 percent), fol- lowed by Baptists (15.8 percent). Christi anity encompa sses a variety of denominations with different beliefs and attitudes toward issues such as alcohol and/or other substance use. Most mainstream Christian religions support behavioral health treatment, and many church-es serve as sites for self -help groups or for Christian recovery programs. Some Christian sects, however, are not as amenable to sub-stance abuse and mental health treatment as others. Judaism Judaism is the second most common religion in the United States (1.2 percent of the popu-lation as of 2008; Kosmin and Keysar 2009). Most Jews believe that they shar e a common ancient background. H owever, the population has dispersed over time and now exists in various geographic regions. The majority of Jews in the United States would be considered White, but Ethiopian Jews (the Beta Israel) and members of other African -Jewish com- munities would likely be seen as African Americans; the Jewish community from India (Bene Israel), as Asian Americans; and Jews who immigrated to the United States from Latin America, as Latinos. In 2001, approxi- mately 5 percent of people who identified as adherents to Judaism (the religion, as opposed to people who identify as culturally Jewish) were Latinos, and approximately 1 percent were African Americans (Kosmin et al. 2001). Regarding beliefs about and practices sur- rounding substance use, there are no prohibi- tions against alcohol use (or other substance use) in Judaism, but rates of alcohol abuse and dependence are significantly lower for Jews than for other populations (Bainwol and Gressard 1985; Straussner 2001). This could be partially attributable to genetics, yet there is also a definite cultural component (Hasin et al. 2002). Conversely, rates of use and abuse of Advice to Counselors: Spirituality, Religion, Substance Abuse, and Mental Illness For people in treatment and recovery, it can be especially important to distinguish between spirituali- ty and religion. For example, some clients are willing to think of themselves as spiritual but not necessarily religious. Religion is organized, with each religion having its own set of beliefs and prac-tices designed to organize and further its members' spirituality. Spirituality, on the other hand, is typically conceived of as a personal matter involving an individual's search for meaning; it does not require an affiliation with any religious group (Cook 2004). People can have spiritual experiences or develop their own spirituality outside of the context of an organized religion. Spirituality often plays an important role in recovery from mental illness and substance abuse, and higher ratings of spirituality (using a variety of scales) have been associated with increased rates of abstinence (Laudet et al. 2006; Zemore and Kaskutas 2004). If substance abuse represents a lack of personal control, discipline, and order, then spirituality and religion can help counter this by provid- ing a sense of purpose, order, self- discipline, humility, serenity, and acceptance. In addition, spiritual- ity can help a person with mental illness gain a sense of meaning or purpose, develop inner strength, and learn acceptance and tolerance. Chappel (1998) maintains that the development of spirituality requires a concerted and consistent effort through such activities as prayer, meditation, discussion with others, reading, and participation in other spiritual activities. Counselors, he says, have an obli-gation to understand the role that spirituality can play in promoting and supporting recovery. The first step in this process is for counselors to learn about and respect clients' beliefs; understand ing the roles of religion and spirituality is one form of cultural competence (Whitley 2012). 31 Improving Cultural Competence other substances are about the same or slightly higher for Jews in the United States compared with other populations (Straussner 2001). Because some Jewish people will feel uncom-fortable in 12 -Step groups that meet in churches and are largely Christian in composi-tion, mutual- help groups designed specifically for Jewish people have been developed. The largest of the se is Jewish Alcoholics, Chemi- cally Dependent Persons and Significant Others (see http://www.jbfcs.org/programs -community- services -2/j acs/ for more inf ormation). Oth er Jewish people in recovery may prefer participating in secular self-help programs (Straussner 2001). Most Jewish people support behavioral health treatment. Islam In 2008, roughly 1.3 million people identified as Muslims in the United States, making it the third most common religion (Kosmin and Keysar 2009). Many Americans assume that all Arabs are Muslim, but the majority of Arab Americans are Christian; Muslims can come from any ethnic background (Abudabbeh and Hamid 2001). Islam is the most ethnically diverse religion in America, with a member-ship that is 15 percent White, 27 percent Black, 34 percent Asian, and 10 percent Latino (Kosmin et al. 2001). Attitudes of Muslims toward mental illness and seeking formal mental health services are likely to be affected by cultural and religious beliefs about mental health problems , knowledge and familiarity with formal ser-vices, perceived societal prejudice, and the use of informal indigenous resources (Aloud 2004). Attitudes toward substance use, abuse, and treatment will likely be shaped by Islam 's prohibition of the use of alcohol and other intoxicants. Many Muslim countries have harsh penalties for the use of alcohol and other drugs. For these reasons, Muslims appear to have low rates of substance use disorders. Despite there being no current data regarding levels of alcohol and other substance use among Muslim immigrants in the United States , Cochrane and Bal (1990) found that, in a comparison of Sikh, Hindu, Muslim, and White (probably Christia n) men in a British community, Muslims by far drank the least , yet those Muslims who consumed the most alco-hol experienced a greater number of alcohol - related problems on average. High levels of alcohol consumption among Muslims who do drink could be related to feelings of guilt and shame about their behavior, thus potentially leading to further abuse and avoidance of seeking substance abuse treatment when problems arise (Abudabbeh and Hamid 2001). Buddhism In 2008, about 1.2 million Buddhists were living in the United States (Kosmin and Keysar 2009). I n 2001, according to Kosmin et al (2001), t he majority of Buddhists were Asian Americans (61 percent), but a signifi- cant number of White Americans have em-braced the religion (they make up 32 percent of Buddhi sts in the United States), as have African Americans (4 percent) and Latinos (2 percent). In China and Japan, Buddhism is often combined with other religious tradi-tions , such as Taoism or Shintoism, and some immigrants from those countries combine the beliefs and practices of those religions with Buddhism. Buddhists believe that the choices made in each life create karma that influences the next life and can affect behavior (McLaughlin and Braun 1998). The Fifth Precept of Buddhism is not to use intoxicatin g substances, and thus, the expectation for devout believers is that they will not use alcohol or other substances of abuse (Assanangkornchai et al. 2002). In the United States, no specific substance abuse treatment programs specialize in treating 32 Chapter 1 \u2014Introduction to Cultural Competence Buddhist clients. Buddhist substance abuse and mental health treatment programs do exist in other countries (e.g., Thailand) and report high outcome rates (70 percent) using culturally specific practices (e.g., herbal sau-nas) and religious practices (Barrett 1997). As You Proceed This chapter has established the foundation and rationale of this TIP; reviewed the core concepts, models, and terminology of cultural competence; and provided an overview of factors that are common among diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural groups. As you proceed, be aware that d iversity occurs not only across racially and ethnically diverse groups, but within each group as well \u2014there are cultures within cultures. Clinicians and organizations need to develop skills to create an environ-ment that is responsive to the unique attrib- utes and experiences of each client , as outlined earlier in this chapter in the \"What Are the Cross -Cutting Factors in Race, Ethnicity , and Culture? \" section. As you read this TIP , re- member that many cross -cutting fa ctors influ- ence the counselor -client relationship, the client 's presentation and identification of problems, the selection and interpretation of screening and assessment tools, the client 's responsiveness to specific clinical services, and the effectiveness of program delivery and organizational structure and planning. 33 IN THIS CHAPTER Core Counselor Competencies Self-Assessment for Individual Cultural Competence Gil, a 40 -year-old Mexican American man, lives in an upper mid- dle class neighborhood. He has been married for more than 15 years to his high school sweetheart, a White American woman, and they have two children. Gil owns a fleet of street -sweeping trucks \u2014a busine ss started by his father -in-law th at Gil has ex- panded considerably. Of late, Gil has been spending more time at work. He has also been drinking more than usual and dabbling in illicit drugs. As his drinking has increased, tensions between Gil and his wife have escalated. From Gil 's perspec tive and that of some family members and friends, Gil is just a hard -working guy who deserves to have a beer as a reward for a hard day 's work. Many people in his Mexican American community do not consid-er Gil 's low- level daily drinking a problem, especially because he drinks primarily at home. Recently, Gil had an accident while working on one of his trucks. The treating physician identified alcohol abuse as one of several health problems and referred him to a substance abuse treatment center. Gil attended, but argued all the while that he was not a borracho (drunkard) and did not need treatment. He distrusted the counselors, stating that seeking help from professionals for a men-tal disorder was something that only gabachos (Whites ) did. Gil was proud of his capacity to \"hold his liquor \" and felt anger and hostili- ty toward those who encouraged him to reduce his drinking. Gil 's feelings and attitudes were valid; they stemmed from and were in-fluenced by the Mexican American culture and community in which he h ad been raised from infancy. Gil dropped out of treat- ment. When his wife threatened to divorce him if he did not take immediate action to deal with his drinking problem, he reluctantly 2 Core Competencies for Counselors and Other Clinical Staff 35 Improving Cultural Competence enrolled in an outpatient treatment program. Gil, like all people , is a product of his envi- ronment \u2014an environment that has provided him with a rich cultural and spiritual back-ground, a strong male identity, a deep attach- ment to family and community, a strong work ethic, and a sense of pride in being able to support his family. In many Mexican American cultural groups, illness disrupts family life, work, and the ability to earn a living . Illness has psychological costs as well, including threats to a man 's self -identity and sense of manhood (Sobralske 2006 ). Given this back- ground, Gil would understandably be reluctant to enter treatment, to accept the fact that his drinking was a problem or an illness, and to jeopardize his ability to care for his family and his company. A culturally competent counselor would recognize, legitimize, and validate Gil 's reluctance to enter and continue in treatment. In an ideal situation, the treatment counselor would have experience working with people with similar backgrounds and beliefs, and the treatment program would be structured to change Gil 's behavior and attitudes in a man- ner that was in keeping with his culture and community. H is initial treatment might have succeeded if the counselor had been culturally competent and the treatment program had been culturally responsive. Like Gil, all clients enter treatment carrying beliefs, attitudes, conflicts, and problems shaped by their cultural roots as well as their present -day realities. As with Gil, many clients enter treatment with some reluctance and denial. Research shows that if clients such as Gil are greeted by a culturally competent counselor, they are more likely to respond positively to treatment (Damashek et al. 2012; Griner and Smith 2006; Kopelowicz et al. 2012; Whaley and Davis 2007). The presence of counselors of any race or gender who are culturally competent in responding to the needs and issues of their clients can greatly assist client recovery. Gaining regard, respect, and trust from clients is crucial for successful counseling outcomes (Ackerman and Hilsen-roth 2003; Sue and Sue 2003a ). Effective therapy is an ongoing process of building relational bridges that engender trust and confidence. Sensitivity to the client 's cultural and personal perspectives, genuine empathy, warmth, humility, respect, and ac-ceptance are the tenets of all sound therapy. This chapter expands on these concepts and provides a general overview of the core com-petencies needed so that counselors may provide effective treatment to diverse racial and ethnic groups. Using Sue 's (2001) multi- dimensional model for developing cultural competence, the content focuses on the coun-selor 's need to engage in and develop cultural awareness; cultural knowledge in general; and culturally specific skills and knowledge of wellness, mental illness, substance use, treat-ments, and skill development . Core Counselor Competencies Since Sue et al. introduced the phrase \"multi- cultural counseling competencies\" in 1992, researchers and academics have elaborated on the core skill sets that enable counselors to work with diverse populations (American Psychological Association [APA] 2002; Council of National Psychological Associations for the Advancement of Ethnic Minority Interests 2009; Pack -Brown and Williams 2003; Tseng and Streltzer 200 4). Cultural competence has evolved into more than a discrete skill set or knowledge base; it also requires ongoing self -evaluation on the part of the practitioner. Culturally competent counselors are aware of their own cultural group s and of their values, assumptions, and biases regarding other cultural groups. Moreo- ver, culturally competent counselors strive to 36 Chapter 2 \u2014Core Competencies for Counselors and Other Clinical Staff understand how these factors affect their ability to provide culturally effective services to clien ts. Given the complex definition of culture and the fact that racially and ethnically diverse clients represent a growing portion of the client population, the need to update and expand guid elines for cultural competence is increasing . The consensus panel thus adapted existing guidelines from the Association of Multicultural Counseling for culturally re-sponsive behavioral health services; some of their key suggestions for counselors and other clinical staff are outlined in this chapter. Multidimensional Model for Developing Cultural Competence: Individual Staff Level Self-Knowledge Counselors with a strong belief in evidence - based treatment methods can find it hard to relate to clients who prefer traditional healing methods. Conversely, counselors with strong trust in traditional healers and culturally ac-cepted methods can fail to understand clients who seek scientific explanations of, and solu-tions to, their substance abuse and mental health problems. To become culturally compe-tent, counselors should begin by exploring their own cultural heritage and identifying how it shapes their perceptions of normality, abnormality, and the counseling process. 37 Improving Cultural Competence Counselors who understand themselves and their own cultural groups and perceptions are better equipped to respect clients with diverse belief systems. In gaining an awareness of their culture s, attitudes, beliefs, and assumptions through self -examination, training, and clini- cal supervision, counselors should consider the factors described in the following sections . Cultural awareness Counselors who are aware of their own cultural backgrounds are more likely to acknowledge and explore how culture affects their client - counselor relationships. Without cultural awareness, counselors may provide couns eling that ignores or does not address obvious issues that specifically relate to race, ethnic heritage, and culture. Lack of awareness can discount the importance of how counselors' cultural backgrounds \u2014including beliefs, values, and attitudes \u2014influence t heir initial and diagnos- tic impressions of clients. Without cultural awareness, counselors can unwittingly use their own cultural experiences as a template to prejudge and assess client experiences and clinical presentations. They may struggle to see the cultural uniqueness of each client, assuming that they understand the client 's life experiences and background better than they really do. With cultural awareness, counselors examine how their own beliefs, experiences, and biases affect their definitions of normal and abnormal behavior. By valuing this aware- ness, counselors are more likely to take the time to understand the client 's cultural groups and their role in the therapeutic process, the client 's relationships, and his or her substance - related and other presenting clinical problems. Cultural awareness is the first step toward becoming a culturally competent counselor. Racial, ethnic, and cultural identities A key step in attaining cultural competence is for counselors to become aware of their own racial, ethnic, and cultural identities. Although the constructs of these identities are complex and difficult to define briefly, what follows is an overview. Racial identity \"refers to a sense of group or collective identity based on one 's perception that he or she shares a common heritage with a particular racial group \" (Helms 1990, p. 3). Ethnic and cultural identity is \"often the frame in which individuals identify consciously or unconsciously with those with whom they feel a common bond because of similar traditions, behaviors, values, and be- liefs\" (Chavez and Guido -DiBrito 1999, p. 41). Culture includes, but is not limited to, spirituality and religion, rituals and rites of passage, language, dietary habits ( e.g., attitudes toward food/ food preparation, sy mbolism of food, religious taboos of food), and leisure activities (Bhugra and Becker 2005). Aspects of racial, ethnic, and cultural identities are not always apparent and do not always factor into conscious processes for the counse- lor or client, but thes e factors still play a role in the therapeutic relationship. I dentity devel- opment and formation help people make sense of themselves and the world around them. If Models of Racial Identity Models of racial identity, often structured in stages, highlight the process that individuals undertake in becoming aware of their sense of self in relation to race and ethnicity within the context of their families, communities, socie- ties, and cultural histories . Influenced by the Civil Rights Movement, earlier racial identity models in the United States focused on White and Black racial identity development (C ross 1995; Helms 1990; Helms and Carter 1991). Since then, models have been created to incorporate other races, ethnicities, and cultures. Although this chapter highlights two formative racial identity models (see next page), addi-tional resources highlight racial identity models that incorporate other diverse groups, includ-ing those individuals who identify as multiracial (e.g., see Wijeyesinghe and Jackson 2012). 38 Chapter 2 \u2014Core Competencies for Counselors and Other Clinical Staff positive racial, ethnic, and cultural messages are not available or supported in behavioral health services, counselors and clients can lack affirmative view s of their own identities and may internalize negative messages or feel disconnected from their racial and cultural heritage s. Counselors from mainstream society are less likely to be actively aware of their own ethnic and cultural identities; in particular , White Americans are not naturally drawn into examining their cultural identities, as they typically experience no dissonance when engaging in cultural activities. In working to attain cultural competence, counselor s must explore their own racial and cultural heritage s and identities to gain a deeper understanding of personal develop-ment. Many models and theories of racial, ethnic, and cultural development are available; two common proce sses are presented below. Exhibit 2 -1 highlights the racial/cultural identity development (R/CID) model (Sue and Sue 1999b ) and the White racial identity development (WRID) model (Sue 2001). Although earlier work focused on a linear developmental process using stages, current thought centers on a more flexible process whereby identification status can loop back to an earlier process or move to a later phase. Using either model, counselors can explore relational and clinical challenges associated with a given phase. Without an understanding of th e cultural identity development process, counselors \u2014regardless of race or ethnicity \u2014 can unwittingly minimize the importance of racial and ethnic experiences . They may fail to identify cultural needs and secure approp riate treatment services, unconsciously operate from a superior perspective (e. g., judging a specific behavior as ineffectual, a sign of resistance, or a symptom of pathology) , internalize a client 's reaction (e.g., an African American counselor feeling b etrayed or inadequate when a client of the same race requests a White American counselor for therapy during an initial inter-view) , or view a client 's behavior through a veil of societal biases or stereotypes. By acknowl-edging and endorsing the active proce ss of racial and cultural identity development, coun-selors from diverse groups can normalize their own development processes and increase their awareness of clients' parallel processes of identity development. In counseling, racial, ethnic, and cultural id entities can be pivotal to the treatment process in the relationships not only between the counselor and client, but among everyone involved in the delivery of the client 's behavioral health and primary care services (e.g., referral sources, family members, medical personnel, administrators). The case study on page 41 uses stages from the two models in Exhibit 2 -1 to show the interactive process of racial and cultural identity devel-opment in the treatment context. Cultural and racial identities are not static factors that simply mediate individual identity; they are dynamic, interactive developmental processes that influence one's willingness to acknowledge the effects of race, ethnicity, and culture and to act against racism and disparity across relationships, situations, and environ-ments (for a review of racial and cultural identity development, see Sue and Sue 2013c ). For counselors and clinical supervisors, it is essential to understand the dynamic nature of cultural identity in all exchanges. Starting wi th a personal appraisal, clinical staff members can begin to reflect \u2014without judgment \u2014on how their own racial and cultural identities influ-ence their decisions , treatment planning, case presentation, supervision, and interactions with other staff members . Clinicians can map the interactive influences of cultural identity development among clients, the clients' fami- lies, staff members, the organization, other agencies, and any other entities involved in the client 's treatment. Using mapping (see the 39 Improving Cultural Competence Exhibit 2 -1: Stages of Racial and Cultural Identity Development R/CID Model WRID Model Conformity: Has a positive attitude toward and preference for dominant cultural values; places considerable value on characteristics that represent dominant cultural groups; may devalue or hold negative view s of own race or other racial/ethnic groups. Dissonance and Appreciating: Begins to question identity; recognizes conflicting mes- sages and observations that challenge be- liefs/stereotypes of own cultural groups and value of mainstream cultural groups; develops growing sense of one' s own cultural heritage and the existence of racism; moves away from seeing dominant cultural groups as all good. Resistance and Immersion: Embraces and holds a positive attitude toward an d prefer- ence for his or her own race and cultural heritage; rejects dominant values of society and culture; focuses on eliminating oppression within own racial/cultural group; likely to possess considerable feelings \u2014including distrust and anger \u2014toward domi nant cultural groups and anything that may represent them; places considerable value on characteristics that represent one' s own cultur al groups without question; develops a growing appre- ciation for others from racially and culturally diverse groups. Introspection: Begins to question the psycho- logical cost of projecting strong feelings toward dominant cultural groups; desires to refocus more energy on personal identity while respecting own cultural groups; realigns perspective to note that not all aspects of dominant cultural groups \u2014one 's own ra- cial/cultural group or other diverse groups \u2014 are good or bad; may struggle with and expe- rience conflicts of loyalty as perspective broadens. Integrative Awareness: Has developed a secure, confident sense of racial/cultural identity; becomes multicultural; maintains pride in racial identity and cultural heritage; commits to supporting and appreciating all oppressed and diverse groups; tends to recognize racism as a societal illness by which all can be victimized. Naive t\u00e9: Had an early childhood developmental phase of curiosity or minimal awareness of race; may or may not receive overt or covert messages about other racial/cultural groups ; possesses an ethnocentric view of culture. Conformity: Has minimal awareness of self as a racial person; believes strongly in the universality of values and norms; perceives White American cultural groups as more highly developed; may justify disparity of treatment; may be unaware of beliefs that reflect this. Dissonance: Experiences a n opportunity to examine own prejudices and biases; moves toward the realization that dominant society oppresses racially and culturally diverse groups; may feel shame, anger, and depression about the perpetuation of racism by White American cultural group s; and may begin to question previously held beliefs or refortify prior views. Resistance and Immersion: Increases awareness of one' s own racism and how racism is projected in society (e.g., media and language); likely feels angry about messages concerning other racial and cultural groups and guilty for being part of an oppressive system; may counteract feelings by assuming a paternalistic role (knowing what is best for clients without their involvement) or overidenti fying with ano ther racial/ cultural group. Introspection : Begins to redefine what it means to be a White American and to be a ra cial and cultural being; recognizes the inability to fully understand the experience of others from di- verse racial and cultural backgrounds; may feel disconnected from the White American group. Integrative Awareness: Appreciates racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity; is aware of and understands self as a racial and cultural being; is aware of sociopolitical influences of racism; internalizes a nonracist identity. Commitment to Antiracist Action: Commits to social action to eliminate oppression and disparity (e.g., voicing objection to racist jokes, taking steps to eradicate racism in institutions and public policies); likely to be pressured to s uppress efforts and conform rather than build alliances with people of color.

Worldview: The cultural lens of counseling The term \"worldview\" refers to a set of assumptions that guide how one sees, thinks about , experiences, and interprets the w orld (Koltko -Rivera 2004). Starting in early child- hood, worldview development is facilitated by significant relationships (particularly with parents and family members) and is shaped by the individual 's environment and life experi- ences, influencing values, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. In more simplistic terms, each person 's worldview is like a pair of glasses with colored lenses \u2014the person takes in all of life 's experiences through his or her own uniquely Case Study for Counselors: Racial and Cultural Identity The client is a 20 -year- old Latino man. His father immigrated to the United States from Mexico as a child, and his mother (of Latino/Middle Eastern descent) grew up near Albuquerque, New Mexico. Throughout the initial phase of mental health treatment, the client present ed feelings, attitudes, and behavior consistent with the resistance and immersion stage of the R/CID model. During group counseling in a partial hospitalization program, the client said that he did not think treatment was going to work. He believed that no one in treatment, except other Latino men, really understood him or his life experiences. He thought that his low mood was due, in part, to his recent job loss. The client' s current concerns, symptoms, and diagnosis (bipolar I) were presented and discussed during the treatment team meeting. The client 's counselor (a White American man in the dissonance stage of the WRID model) was concerned that the client might leave treatment against medical advice and also stated that this would not be the first time a Latino client had done so. The team recognized that a Latino counselor would likely be useful in this situation (depending on the counse- lor's cultural competence). However, no Latino counselor was available, so the team decided that the client's current counselor should try to gain support from the client 's parents to encourage the client to stay in treatment. Because the client had signed an appropriate release of information, his counselor was able to contact the parents and arrange a family session. Duri ng the family session, the counselor brought up the client 's need for a Latino counselor. His parents disagreed, expressing their belief that it was important for their son to learn to relate to the counselor. They said that this was just an excuse their son was using to leave treatment, which had happened before. The parents ' reaction exempli fied a conformity response , although other information would need to have been gathered to determine their current stage more accurately. The counselor, client, parents, and organization were operating from different stages of racial and cultural identity development. Considering the lack of a proactive plan to provide appropriate resources \u2014including the hiring of Latino staff or the development of other culturally app ropriate resources (e.g., a peer counselor program) \u2014the organization was most likely in the conformity phase of the WRID model. The counselor ha d some awareness of the client 's racial and cultural needs and of the organization' s failure to meet them, but he alienate d the client despite his good intentions and reinforced mistrust by engaging the client 's parents before working directly with the client. Had the counselor taken the time to understand the client 's concerns and needs, he would likely have created an opportunity to challenge his own beliefs, learn more about the client 's racial and cultural experiences and values, advocate for more appropriate resources for the client within the organization, be more flexible with treatment solutions, and enable the client to have an experi- ence that exceeded his expectations of the treatment provider. 41 Improving Cultural Competence tinted view.

The diagram can be used as a training tool to teach racial and cultural identity devel- opment, to help clinicians and organizations recognize their own development, to explore clinical issues and dialogs that occur when diverse parties are at similar or different developmental stages , and to develop tools and resources to address issues that arise from this developmental process. Using case studies, this diagram can serve as an interactive educational exercise to help counselors, clinical supervisors, and agencies gain awareness of the effects of race, ethnicity, and cultural groups. Materials needed: Paper and pencils; handouts on the R/CID and WRID models. Instructions: Identify all relevant parties, including client, counselor, family, supervisor, referral source, other staff members, and staff from other agencies (e.g., probation/parole, medical center/office, child and youth services). Include yourself. Place the names at each intersection of the hexagon. List the common statements and behaviors (including lack of verbal responses) that you witness regarding the cultural needs of the client and/or the general statements made by each party re- garding race, ethnicity, and culture. Write these as one -line abbreviated phrases that represent each person/agency's stance under the appropriate entry on the diagram . Using current information, choose the cultural identity development stage that best fits the statements or behaviors (knowing that you may be inaccurate ); write it under each name. 42 Chapter 2 \u2014Core Competencies for Counselors and Other Clinical Staff spiritual beliefs; ideas about success; and so on (Exhibit 2-2). However, counselors also contend with anoth- er worldview that is often invisible but still powerful \u2014the clinic al worldview (Bhugra and Gupta 2010; Tilburt and Geller 2007; Tseng and Streltzer 2004). Influenced by education, clinical training, and wo rk experiences, coun- selors are in troduced into a culture that re- flects specific counseling theories, techniques, treatment modalities, and general office prac-tices. This worldview, coupled with their personal cultural worldview, significantly shapes the co unselor 's beliefs pertaining to the nature of wellness, illness, and healing; inter-viewing skills and behavior; diagnostic impres-sions; and prognosis. Moreover, it influences the definition of normal versus abnormal or disordered behavior, the determinatio n of treatment priorities, the means of intervention, and the definition s of successful outcomes and treatment failures. Foremost, counselors need to remember that worldviews are often unspoken and inconspic-uous; therefore, considerable ref lection and self-exploration are needed to identify how their own cultural worldviews influence their interactions both inside and outside of coun-seling. Clinical staff members need to question how their perspectives are perpetuated in and shape client -counselor interactions, treatment decisions, planning, and selected counseling approach es. In sum, culturally responsive practice involves an understanding of multiple perspectiv es and how these worldviews inter- act throughout the treatment process \u2014 including the views of the counselor, client, family, other clients and staff members, treat- ment program, organization, and other agen-cies, as well as the community. Stereotypes, prejudices, and history Cultural competence involves counselors' willingness to explore their own histories of prejudice, cultural stereotyping, and discrimi-nation. Counselors need to be aware of how their own perceptions of self and others have evolved through early childhood influences and other life experiences. For example, how were stereotypes of their own races and ethnic heritage s perpetuated in their upbringing? What myths and stereotypes were projected onto other groups? What historical events shaped experiences, opportunities, and percep-tions of self and others? Regardless of their race, cultural group, or ethnic heritage, counselors need to examine how they have directly or indirectly been affected by individual, organizational, and societal stereotyp es, prejudice, and discrimina- tion. How have certain attitudes, beliefs, and behav iors functioned as deterrent s to obtain- ing eq uitable opportunities? In what ways have discrimination and societal biases provid-ed benefits to them as individuals and as counselors? Even though these questions can be uncomfortable, difficult, or painful to ex-plore, awareness is essential regarding how these issues affect one 's role as a counselor, status in the organization, and comfort level in exploring clients' life experiences and percep- tions during the treatment process. If counse- lors avoid or minimize the relevance of bias and discrimination in self -exploration, they will likely do the same in the assessment and counseling process. Clinical Worldview Individual Cultural Worldview Exhibit 2 -2: Counselor Worldview 43 Improving Cultural Competence Clients can have behavioral health issues and healthcare concerns associated with discrimi-nation. If counselors are blind to these issues, they can miss vital information that influences client responses to treatment and willingness to follow through with continuing care and ancillary services. For example, a counselor may refer a client to a treatment program without noting the client 's history or percep- tions of the recommended program or type of program. The client may initially agree to attend the program but not follow through because of past negative experiences and/or the perception within his or her racial/ethnic community that the service does not provide adequate treatment for clients of color. All counselors should examine their stereotypes, prejudices, and emotional reactions toward others, including individuals from their own races or cultural backgrounds and individuals from other groups. They should examine ho w these attitudes and biases may be detrimental to clients in treatment for substance- related and mental disorders. Advice to Counselors and Clinical Supervisors: Using the RESPECT Mnemonic To Reinforce Culturally Responsive Attitudes and Behaviors Respect\u2014 Understand how respect is shown within given cultural groups. Counselors demon- strate this attitude through verbal and nonverbal communications. Explanatory model \u2014Devote time in treatment to understanding how clients perceive their pre- senting problems. What are their views about their own substance abuse or mental symptoms? How do they explain the origin of current problems? How similar or different is the counselor 's perspective? Sociocultural context \u2014Recognize how class, race, ethnicity, gender, education, socioeconomic status, sexual and gender orientation, immigrant status, community, family, gender roles, and so forth affect care. Power \u2014Acknowledge the power differential between clients and counselors. Empathy \u2014Express, verbally and nonverbally , the significance of each client 's concerns so that h e or she feels understood by the counselor. Concerns and fears \u2014Elicit clients ' concerns and apprehensions regarding help -seeking behavior and initiation of treatment. Therapeutic alliance/ Trust\u2014Commit to behaviors that enhance the therapeutic relationship; recognize that trust is not inherent but must be earned by counselors. Sources: Bigby and American College of Physicians 2003; Campinha -Bacote et al. 2005.Trust and power Counselors need to understand the impact of their role and status within the client - counselor relationship. Client percep tions of counselors' influence, power, and control vary in diverse cultural contexts. In some contexts, counsel ors can be seen as all -knowing profes- sional s, but in others, they can be viewed as representatives of an unjust system. Counse- lors need to explore how these dynamics affect the counseling process with clients from diverse backgrounds. Do client perceptions inhibit or facilitate the process? How do they affect the level of trust in the client -counselor relationship? These issues should be identified and addressed early in the counseling process. Clients should have opportunities to talk about and process their perceptions, past experiences, and current needs. Practicing within limits A key element of ethical care is practicing within the limits of one 's competence. Coun- selors must engage in self -exploration, critical thinking, and clinical supervision to under-stand their clinical abilities and limitations 44 Chapter 2 \u2014Core Competencies for Counselors and Other Clinical Staff regarding the services that they are able to provide, the populations that they can serve, and the treatment issues that they ha ve suffi- cient training to ad dress. Cultural competence requires an ability to assess accurately one 's clinical and cultural limitations, skills, and expertise. Counselors risk providing services beyond their expertise if they lack awareness and knowledge o f the i nfluence of cultural groups on client -counselor relationship s, clinical presentation, and the treatment pro- cess or if they minimize, ignore, or avoid viewing treatment in a cultural context. Some counselors may assume that they have cultural compet ence based on having similar experiences as clients, being from the same race as clients, identifying as a member of the same ethnic heritage or cultural group as clients, or attending training on cultural com- petence. Other counselors may assume compe- tence based on their current or prior relationships with others from the same race or cultural background as their clien ts. These experiences can be helpful and filled with many potential learning opportunities, but they do not make an individual eligible or competent to provide multicultural counseling. Likewise, the assumption that a person from the same cultural group, race, or ethnic herit-age will intrinsically understand a client from a similar background is operating out of two common myths: the \"myth of s ameness\" (i.e., that people from the same cultural group, race, or ethnicity are alike) and the myth that \"fa- miliarity equals competence \" (Srivastava 2007). The Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development adopted a set of counselor competencies that was endorsed by the American Counseling Association (ACA) for counselors who work with a mul- ticultural clientele (Exhibit 2- 3). Competen- cies address the attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, and skills associated with the counselor 's need for self-knowledge. \"Become familiar with the community in which the client lives and the general cultural norms of the individual client. This can be accomplished by visiting with people who know the community well, attending important community celebrations and other events, asking open -ended questions about community concerns and quality of life, and identifying community capacities that affect wellness in the community .\" (Perez and Luquis 2008, p. 177) Knowledge of Other Cultural Groups In addition to an understanding of themselves and how their cultural groups and values can affect the therapeutic process, culturally com-petent counselors work to acquire cultural knowledge and understan ding of clients and staff with whom they work. From the outset, counselors need general knowledge and awareness when working with other cultural groups in counseling. For example, they should acknowledge that culture influences commu- nication patterns , values, gender roles and socialization , clinical presentations of distress, counseling expectations, and behavioral norms and expectations in and outside the counseling session (e.g. , touching, greetings, gift -giving, accompaniment in sessions, level of forma lity between counselor and client). Counselors should filter and interpret client presen tation from a broad cultural perspective instead of using only their own cultural group s or previ- ous client experiences as reference point s. Counselors also need to invest the time to know clients and their cultures . Culturally responsive practice involves a commitment to obtaining specific cultural knowledge, not only through ongoing client interactions, but also through the use of outside resources, cultural training seminars and programs, cultural events, professional consulta tions, 45 Improving Cultural Competence cultural guides, and clinical supervision. Counselors need to be mindful that they will not know everything about a specific popula-tion or initially comprehend how an individual client endorses or engages in specific cultural practices, beliefs, and values. For instance, some clients may not identify with the same cultural beliefs, practices, or experiences as other clients from the same cultural groups. Nevertheless, counselors need to be as knowl-edgeable as possible and attend to these cul-tural attributes\u2014beginning with the intake and assessment process and continuing throughout the counseling and treatment relationship. For a review of content areas essential in knowing other cultural groups, refer to the \"What Are the Cross -Cutting Factors in Race, Ethnicity, and Culture \" sec- tion in Chapter 1. These cultural knowledge content areas include: Language and communication . Geographic location . Worldview, values, and traditions . Family and kinship . Gender roles. Socioeconomic status and education . Exhibit 2 -3: ACA Counselor Competencies: Counselor s' Awareness of Their Own Cultural Values and Biases Attitudes and beliefs: Culturally skilled counselors have moved from being culturally unaware to being aware and sensitive to their own cultural heritages and to valuing and respecting differences. Culturally skilled counselors are aware of how their own cultural backgrounds, experiences, attitudes, values, and biases influence psychological processes. Culturally sk illed counselors recognize the limits of their multicultural competence and expertise. Culturally skilled counselors are comfortable with differences that exist between themselves and their clients in terms of race, ethnicity, culture, and beliefs. Knowle dge: Culturally skilled counselors have specific knowledge about their own racial and cultural heritage and how it personally and professionally affects their definitions of normality, abnormality, and the process of counseling. Culturally skilled counse lors possess knowledge and understanding of how oppression, racism, discrimination, and stereotyping affect them personally and in their work. This allows them to acknowledge their own racist attitudes, beliefs, and feelings. Although this standard applies to all groups, for White American counselors, it can mean that they understand how they may have directly or indirectly benefited from individual, institutional, and cultural racism. Culturally skilled counselors possess knowledge about their social impa ct on others. They are knowledgeable about communication styl e differences and how their style may clash with or fos- ter the counseling process with minority clients. They anticipate the impact their style may have on others. Skills: Culturally skilled cou nselors seek out educational, consultative, and training experiences to improve their understanding and effectiveness in working with culturally diverse populations. Be-ing able to recognize the limits of their competencies, they seek consultation, seek further train-ing or education, refer out to more qualified individuals or resources, or engage in a combination of these. Culturally skilled counselors are constantly seeking to understand themselves as racial and cultural beings and are actively seeking a nonracist identity.

Heritage and history . Sexuality . Religion and spirituality . Health, illness, and healing . Counselors should not make assumptions about clients' race, ethnic heritage, or culture based on appearance, accents, behavior, or language. Instead, counselors need to explore with clients their cultural identity, which can involve multiple identities (Lynch and Hanson 2011). Counselors should discuss what cultural identity means to clients and how it influences treatment. For example, a young adult two - spirited (gay) American Indian man may be more concerned with having access to tradi-tional healing practices than to specialized services for gay men. C ounselors and clients should collaboratively examine presenting treatment issues and obstacles to engaging in behavioral health treatment and maintaining recovery, and they should discuss how cultural group s and cultural identities can serve as guidepost s in treatment planning. Exhibit 2 -4 lists ACA -endorsed counselor competencies for knowledge of the worldviews of clients from diverse cultural groups. Exhibit 2 -4: ACA Counselor Co mpetenc ies: Awareness of Client s' Worldviews Attitudes and beliefs: Culturally skilled counselors are aware of their negative and positive emotional reactions toward other racial and ethnic groups and recognize that these reactions may prove detrimental to the counseling relationship. They are willing to contrast their own beliefs and attitudes with those of clients from diverse cultures in a nonjudgmental fashion. Culturally skilled counselors are aware of the stereotypes and preconceived notions they may hold toward other racial and ethnic minority groups. Knowledge: Culturally skilled counselors possess specific knowledge and information about the particular group(s) with whom they are working. They are aware of the life experiences, cultural heritages, and historical backgrounds of clients from cultures other than their own. This competence is strongly linked to the minority identity development models available in the literature. Culturally skilled counselors understand how race, cultural group, ethnicity, a nd other factors can affect personality formation, vocational choices, manifestation of mental disorders, help -seeking behavior, and the appropriateness or inappropriateness of various counseling approaches. Culturally skilled counselors understand and have knowledge of sociopolitical influences upon the lives of racial and ethnic minorities. They understand that factors such as immigration issues, poverty, racism, stereotyping, and powerlessness can affect self -esteem and self -concept in the counseling pr ocess. Skills: Culturally skilled counselors familiarize themselves with relevant research and the latest findings regarding mental health and mental disorders that affect various ethnic and racial groups. They actively seek out educational experiences that enrich their knowledge, understanding, and cross - cultural skills for more effective counseling behavior. Culturally skilled counselors are actively involved with minority individuals outside of the counsel-ing setting (community events, social and political functions, celebrations, friendships, neighbor- hood groups, etc.); their perspective of minorities is more than an academic/helping exercise.

They can access litera- ture and training that address cultural context s and meaning s of substance use, behavioral and emotional reactions, help -seeking behavior, and treatment. Chapter 5 gives information on culturally responsive behavioral health services for major ethnic and racial groups . The how - to box below lists ways to improve one 's cul- tural knowledge of health issues by acquiring knowledge in key areas to work successfully with diverse clients: Patterns of substance use and treatment - seeking behavior specific to people of diverse racial and cultural background s. Beliefs and traditions surrounding sub- stance use, including cultural norms co n- cerning the use of alcohol and drugs. Beliefs about treatment, including expecta- tions and attitudes toward health care and counseling. Community perceptions of behavioral health treatment. Obstacles encountered by specific popula- tions that make it difficu lt to access treat- ment, such as geographic distance from treatment services. Patterns of co -occurring disorders and conditions specific to people from diverse racial and cultural background s (e.g., cul- turally specific syndromes, earlier onset of How To Improve Cultural Knowledge of Health, Illness, and Healing To promote culturally responsive services, counselors need to acquire cultural knowledge regarding concepts of health, illness, and healing. The following questions highlight many of the cultur ally related issues that are prevalent in and pertinent to assessment, treatment planning, and case management. This list of considerations can help facilitate discussions in counseling and clinical supervision contexts : Does the cultural group in questio n consider psychological, physical, and spiritual health or well- being as separate entities or as unified aspects of the whole person? How are illnesses and healing practices defined and conceptualized? What are acceptable behaviors for managing stress? How do people who belong to the culture in question typically express emotions and emotion al distress? What behaviors, practices, or customs do members of this culture consider to be preventive? What words do people from this cultural group use to descr ibe a particular problem? How do members of the group explain the origins or causes of a particular condition? Are there culturally specific conditions or cultural concepts of distress? Are there specific biological and physiological variations among members of this population? What are the common symptoms that lead to misdiagnosis within this population? Where do people from this cultural group typically seek help? What traditional healing practices and treatments are endorsed by members of this group? Are there biomedical treatments or procedures that would typically be unacceptable? Are there specific counseling approaches more congruent with the beliefs of most m embers? What are common health inequities, including social determinants of health, for this population? What are acceptable caregiving practices? Do members of this group attach honor to caring for family members with specific diseases? Are individuals with specific conditions shunned from the community? What are the roles of family members in providing health care and in making decisions? Is discussing consequences of and prognosis for behavior s, condition s, or disease s acceptable? Is it customary fo r family members to withhold prognosis from the client? 48 Chapter 2 \u2014Core Competencies for Counselors and Other Clinical Staff diabetes, higher prevalence of depression and substance dependence).

Continuing care and relapse prevention, including att ention to clients' cultural en- vironment s, treatment needs, and accessi- bility of care within their communities . Treatment engagement/ retention patterns. Skill Development Becoming culturally competent is an ongoing process \u2014one that requires introspection, awareness, knowledge, and skill development. Counselors need to develop a positive attitude toward learning about multiple cultural groups; in essence, counselors s hould commit to cultural competence and the process of growth. This commitment is evidenced via investment in ongoing learning and the pur-suit of culturally congruent skills. Counselors can demonstrate commitment to cultural competence through the attitude s and corre- sponding behaviors indicated in Exhibit 2 -5. Beyond the commitment to and development of these fundamental attitudes and behaviors, counselors need to work toward intervention strategies that integrate the skills discussed in the following secti ons. Frame issues in culturally relevant ways Counselors should frame clinical issues with culturally appropriate references. For example, in cultural groups that value the community or family as much as the individual, it is help ful to address substance abuse in light of its con- sequences to family or the community. The counselor might ask, \"How are your family and community affected by your use? How do family and community members feel when they see you high? \" For clients who place more value on their in dependence, it can be more effective to point out how substance depend-ence undermines their ability to manage their own lives through questions like \"How might your use affect your ability to reach your goals? \" Exhibit 2 -5: Attitudes and Behaviors of Culturally Competent Counselors Attitude Behavior Respect Exploring, acknowledging, and validating the client 's worldview Approaching treatment as a collaborative process Investing time to understand the client 's expectations of treatment Using consultation, literature, and training to understand culturally specific behaviors that demonstrate respect for the client Communicating in the client 's preferred language Acceptance Maintaining a nonjudgmental attitude toward the client Considering what is important to the client (Continued on the next page.) 49 Improving Cultural Competence Exhibit 2 -5: Attitudes and Behaviors of Culturally Competent Counselors (continued) Attitude Behavior Sensitivity Understanding the client 's experiences of racism, stereotyping, and discrimi- nation Exploring the client' s cultural identity and what it means to her/him Actively involving oneself with individuals from diverse backgrounds outside the counseling setting to foster a perspective that is more than academic or work related Adopting a broader view of family and, when appropriate, including other family or commun ity members in the treatment process Tailoring treatment to meet the cultural needs of the client (e.g., providing outside resources for traditional healing) Commitment to equality Proactively addressing racism or bias as it occurs in treatment (e.g., pr o- cessing derogatory comments made by another client in a group counseling session) Identifying the specific barriers to treatment engagement and retention among the populations being served Recognizing that equality of treatment does not translate to equit y\u2014that equity is defined as equality in opportunity, access, and outcome (Srivastava 2007) Endorsing counseling strategies and treatment approaches that match the unmet needs of diverse populations to ensure treatment engagement, reten- tion, and positive ou tcomes Openness Recognizing the value of traditional healing and help -seeking practices Developing alliances and relationships with traditional practitioners Seeking consultation with traditional healers and religious and spiritual lead- ers when appropriate Understanding and accepting that persons from diverse cultural groups can use different cognitive styles (e.g., placing more attention on reflecting and processing than on content; being task oriented) Humility Recognizing that the client 's trust is earned through consistent and compe- tent behavior rather than the potential status and power that is ascribed to the role of counselor Acknowledging the limits of one's competencies and expertise and referring clients to a more appropriate counselor or service when necessary Seeking consultation, clinical supervision, and training to expand cultural knowledge and cultural competence in counseling skills Seeking to understand oneself as influenced by ethnicity and cultural groups and actively seeking a nonracist identity Being sens itive to the power differential between client and counselor Flexibility Using a variety of verbal and nonverbal responses, approaches, or styles to suit the cultural context of the client Accommodating different learning styles in treatment approaches (e.g., the use of role -plays or experiential activities to demonstrate coping skills or al- cohol and drug refusal skills) Using cultural, socioeconomic, environmental, and political contextual factors in conducting evaluations Integrating cultural practices as treatment strategies (e.g., Alaska Native traditional practices, such as tundra walking and sustenance activities) 50 Chapter 2 \u2014Core Competencies for Counselors and Other Clinical Staff Allow for complexity of issues based on cultural context Counselors must take care with suggesting simple solutions to complex problems. It is often better to acknowledge the intricacies of the client 's cultural context and circumstances. For instance, a Native Amer ican single mother who upholds traditional values could balk at a suggestion to stop spending time with family members who drink heavily. Here, the counse-lor might encourage the woman to broaden support within her community by connecting with an elder who supports recovery or by engaging in a women 's talking circle. Likewise, a refer ral for a psychiatric evaluation for major depression may not be an appropriate initial recommendation for a Chinese client who relies on cultural remedies and healing tradi-tions. An alternative approach would be to explore the client 's beliefs in healing, develop steps that respect and incorporate the client 's help-seeking practices , and coordinate services to secure a cultural ly responsive intervention (Cardemil et al. 2011; Gallardo et al. 2012; Lynch and Hanson 2011). Make allowances for variations in the use of personal space Cultural groups have different expectations and norms of propriety concerning how close people can be while they communicate and how persona l communications can be depend- ing on the type of relationship ( e.g., peers versus elders). The concept of personal space involves more than the physical distance between people. It also involves cultural expec-tations regarding posture or stance and the use of space within a given environment. These cultural expectations, a lthough they are subtle, can have an impact on treatment. For example, an Alaska Native may feel more comfortable sitting beside a counselor, whereas a European may prefer to be separated from a counselor by a desk (Sue and Sue 2013a ). The use of space can also be a nonverbal e xpression of power. Standing too close to someone can, for exam-ple, suggest power over them. Standing too far away or sitting behind a desk can indicate aloofness. Acceptable or expected degrees of closeness between people are culturally specific; counselo rs should be educated on the gen eral Advice to Counselors and Clinical Supervi sors: Behaviors for Counselors To Avoid Addressing clients informally; c ounselors should not assume familiarity until they grasp cultural expectations and client preferences. Failing to monitor and adjust to the client 's verbal pacing (e.g., not allowing time for clients to respond to questions). Using counseling jargon and treatment language (e.g., \"I am going to send you to our primary stabilization program to obtain a biopsychosocial and then, afterwards, to partial\"). Using statements based on stereoty pes or other preconceived ideas generated from experiences with other clients from the same culture. Using gestures without understanding their meaning and appropriate context within the given culture. Ignoring the relevance of cultural identity in the cli ent-counselor relationship. Neglecting the client 's history (i.e., not understanding the client 's individual and cultural back- ground). Providing an explanation of how current difficulties can be resolved without including the client in the process to obtai n his or her own explanations of the problems and how he or she thinks these problems should be addressed. Downplaying the importance of traditional practices and failing to coordinate these services as needed. Sources: Fontes 2008; Lynch and Hanson 2011; Pack -Brown and Williams 2003; Srivastava 2007. 51 Improving Cultural Competence parameters and expectations of the given population. However, counselors should not predetermine the clients' expectations; instead, they should follow the clients ' lead and inquire about their preferences. Display sensitivity to culturally specific meanings of touch Some treatment and many support groups have opening or closing traditions that include holding hands or giving hugs. This form of touching can be very uncomfortable to new clients regardless of cultural gro ups; cultural prescriptions, including religious beliefs, con- cerning appropriate touching can compound this effect (Comas -Diaz 2012). Many cultural groups use touch to acknowledge or greet someone, to show respect or convey status or power, or to display comfort. As counselors, it is essential to understand cultural norms about touch, which often are guided by gender and age, and the contexts surrounding \"appropri- ate\" touch for specific cultural groups (Sri- vastava 2007). C ounselors need to devote time to understanding their clients' norms for and interpretation s of touch, to assisting clients in negotiating and upholding their cultural norms, and to helping clients understand the context and cultural norms that are likely t o prevail in support and treatment groups. Explore culturally based experiences of power and powerlessness Ideas about power and powerlessness are influenced by the client 's culture and social class. What constitutes power and powerless-ness varies from culture to culture according to the individual 's gender, age, occupation, ances- try, religious affiliation, and a host of other factors. For example, power can be defined in terms of one 's place within the family, with the oldest member being the most powerful and the youngest being the least powerful. Even the words \"power \" and \"powerlessness \" carry cultural meaning. The se words can carry negative connotations for clients with histories of discrimination and multiple experiences with racism, for some women, for indigenous people s with histories of colonization, and for refugees or immigrants who have left oppres- sive regimes. In this regard, counselors should use these words carefully. For example, a Hmong refugee who experienced trauma in her country of origin could already feel help- less and powerless over the events that oc-curred; thus, the concept of powerlessness, often used in drug and alcohol treatment programs, can be contraindicated in address- ing her substance -related disorder. However, a White American business executive who has authority over others and a history of financial influence may need help acknowledging that he cannot control his substance abuse. Adjust communication styles to the client' s culture Cultural groups all have different communica- tion styles. Norms for communicating vary in and between cultural groups based on class, gender, geographic origins, religion, subcul-tures, and other individual variations. Counse-lors should educate themselves as much as possible regarding the patterns of c ommuni- cating in the client 's cultural, racial, or ethnic population while also being aware of his/her own communication style. For a comprehen-sive guide in self -assessment and understand- ing of communication styles, refer to Culture Matte rs: The Peace Corps Cross -Cultural Workbook (Peace Corps Information Collection and Exchange 2012). The following are general guidelines for ascer-taining the client 's communication style: Understand the client 's verbal and nonver- bal ways of communicating. Be aware of the possible need to move away from comprehending and interpreting client re- sponses in conventional professional ways 52 Chapter 2 \u2014Core Competencies for Counselors and Other Clinical Staff How To Assess Differences in Communication Styles This exercise can be used by counselors and clinical supervisors as a self -assessment tool and a means of exploring differences in communication styles among counselor s, client s, and supervisor s. It can also serve as a group exercise to help clients discuss and understand cultural differences in communicating with others. This self- administered tool promotes self- understanding and cultural knowledge. It is not an empirically based instrument, nor is it meant to assess client communication styles or skills f ormally. Materials needed: Colored pencils/pens and copies of the exercise. Instructions: First, place an X along the line for each item that best matches your style or pattern of communi- cation overall. Communication patterns can change across situations and environments depe nd- ing on expectations, stress level, and familiarity, (e.g., attending a staff mee ting versus spending time with friends); try to assign the style that best reflects your patterns across situations. After reviewing your own patterns, compare differences between you and your client, clinical supervisor, or fellow staff member. For example, select a recent client you treated and place a second X (using a different color pen) on each line to mark your perceived view of this client 's communication style. Then examine the differences between you and your client and generate a list of potential misunderstandings that could occur due to these differences. Use clinical supervi- sion to discuss how your own patterns can hinder and/or promote the counseling process. NONVERBAL PATTERNS Eye Contact When talking: Direct, sustained Indirect or not sustained When listening: Direct, sustained Indirect or not sustained Vocal Pitch/Tone High/loud Low/soft More expressive Less expressive Speech Rate Fast Slow Pauses or Silence Little use of silence in dialog Pauses; uses silence in dialog Facial Expressions Frequent expression Little expression Use of Other Gestures Frequent expression Little expression VERBAL PATTERNS Emotional Expression Does express and identify feel- ings in speech Does not express or identify feelings in speech Self-Disclosure Frequently Rarely or little Formality Informal Formal in addressing and showing respec others t ( Continued on the next page.) 53 Improving Cultural Competence Styles of communication and nonverbal methods of communication are important aspects of cultural groups. Issues such as the appropriate space to have between people; preferred ways of moving, sitting, and standing; the meaning of gestures; and the degree of eye contact expected are all culturally defined and situation specific (Hall 1976). As an example, high -context cultural groups place greater importance on nonverbal cues and message context, whereas low -context cultural groups rely largely on verbal message content. Most Asian Americans come from high -context cultural groups in which sensitive messages are encoded carefully to avoid offending others. A provider who listens only to the content could miss the message. What is not said can possibly be more important than what is said. Listen to storytelling carefully, as it can be a way of communicating with the thera- pist. As in any good therapy, follow the as- sociations and listen for possible metaphors to better understand relational meaning, cognition, and emotion within the context of the conversation. Interpret emotional expressions in light of the client' s culture Feelings are expressed differently across and within cultural groups and are influenced by the nature of a given event and the individuals involved in the situation. A certain level of emotional expression can be socially appropri-ate within one culture yet inappropriate in another. In some cultural groups, feelings may not be expressed directly, wh ereas in oth er cultural groups, some emotions are readily expressed and others suppressed. For example, expression s of sadness may at first be more readily shared by some clients in counseling settings, whereas o thers may find it more How To Assess Differences in Communication Styles (continued) Directness Verbally explicit Indirect; subtle; doesn't believe in saying everything Context Low context; relies more on words to convey meaning High context: verbal and nonverbal cues convey much of the meaning Orientation Orientation to self; use of \"I\" statements Orientation to others, use of plural and third -person pronouns (e.g., we, he) Other Things To Consider in Exploring Communication Styles : Are there known differences in body language and expression within the given cultural group? What are the common, culturally appropriate parameters of touch across situations? For exam-ple, a handshake could be appropriate as a means of introduction for one cultural group but notfor another. How is personal space used in and outside of the office? Are there known cultural patterns in theuse of space and proximity of communication? What verbal and nonverbal counselor behaviors may affect trust in the counseling Cormier et Sue 2013a . 54 (Bland and Kraft 1998). Always be curious about the client 's cultural context and be willing to seek clarification and better un- derstanding from the client. It is as im-portant for counselors to access and engage in cultural consultation to acquire more specific knowledge and experience. Chapter 2 \u2014Core Competencies for Counselors and Other Clinical Staff comfort able to express anger as their initial response. Counselors must recognize that not all cultures place the same value on verbalizing feelings. In fact, clients from some cultures may not perceive that emotional expression is a worthy course of treatment and healing at all. Thus, c ounselors should not impose a prescribed approach that measures progress and equates healing with the ability to display emotions. Likewise, counselors should be careful not to attribute meaning based on their own cultural backgrounds or to project their own feelings onto clients' experiences. Instead, counselors need to assist their clients in iden-tifying and labeling feelings within their own cultural context s. Expand roles and practices Counselors need to acquire a mindset that allows for more flexible roles and practices \u2014 while still maintaining appropriate profession-al boundaries \u2014when working with clients. Some clients whose culture places considera-ble emphasis upon and orientation toward family could look to counselors for advice with unrelated issues pertaining to other family members. Other clients may expect a more prescribed and structured approach in which counselors give specific recommendations and advice in the session. For example, Asian American clients appear to expect and benefit from a more directive and highly structured approach (Fowler et al. 2011; Lee and Mock 2005a ; Sue 2001; Uba 1994). Still others could expect that counselors be connected to their communit ies through participation in com- munity events, in working with traditional healers, or in building collaborative relation-ships with other community agencies. As counselors, it is important to understand the cultural context s of clients and how this trans- lates to expectations in the client -counselor relationship. The appropriate role usually Results from the counselor 's understanding of and sensitivity to the values, culture s, and special needs of the individuals and groups being served (Sue and Sue 201 3d). Counselors need to adopt an ongoing commitment to developing skills and endorsing practices that assist clients in receiving and experiencing the best possible care. Exhibit 2 -6 lists counselor competencies endorsed by ACA for culturally appropriate intervention strategies . Self-Assessment for Individual Cultural Competence Several instruments for evaluating an individ- ual's cultural competence have been developed and are available on line. One assessment tool that has been widely circulated is Goode 's Self- Assessment Checklist for Personnel Providing Services and Supports to Children and Youth With Special Health Needs and Their Families. It can be adapted for counselors treating adult clients with behavioral health concerns. This tool and other additional resources are provid-ed in Appendix C. For an interactive Web- based tool on cultural competence awareness, visit the American Speech -Language -Hearing Association Web site (http:// www.asha.org ). Providing good care goe s beyond counse- lors' general knowledge, clinical skills, and approaches; it involves understanding the multicultural context of clients and of themselves as counselors. Cultural compe- tence is an ethical issue requiring counse- lors to be invested in developing the tools to provide culturally congruent care \u2014care that matches the needs and context of the client. For a review of ethics and ethical dilemmas in a multicultural context, refer to Pack -Brown and Williams (2003). 55 Improving Cultural Competence Exhibit 2 -6: ACA Counselor Competencies: Culturally Appropriate Intervention Strategies Attitudes and beliefs: Culturally skilled counselors respect clients ' religious and/or spiritual beliefs and values, includ- ing attributions and taboos, because they affect worldview, psychosocial functioning, and ex- pressions of distress. Culturally skilled counselors respect traditional helping practices and intrinsic help -giving net- works in minority communities. Culturally skilled counselors value bilingualism and do not view another language as an impedi- ment to counseling. Knowledge: Culturally skilled counselors have a clear and explicit knowledge and understanding of the generic characteristics of counseling and therapy (culture bound, class bound, and monolingual) and how they could clash with the cultural values of various minority groups. Culturally skilled counselors are aware of institutional barriers that prevent minorities from using behavioral health services. Culturally skilled counselors know of the potential bias es in assessment instruments and use pro- cedures and interpret findings in keeping with the cultural and linguistic characteristics of clients. Culturall y skilled counselors have knowledge of minority family structures, hierarchies, values, and beliefs. They are knowledgeable about family and community characteristics and resources. Culturally skilled counselors are aware of relevant discriminatory practic es at the social and com- munity levels that could be affecting the psychological welfare of the population s being served. Skills: Culturally skilled counselors are able to engage in a variety of verbal and nonverbal helping responses. They are able to send and receive both verbal and nonverbal messages accurately and appropriately. They are not tied down to only one method or approach, recognizing that helping styles and approaches can be culture bound. When they sense that their helping style is limited an d potentially inappropriate, they can anticipate and ameliorate its negative impact. Culturally skilled counselors are able to exercise institutional intervention skills on behalf of their clients. They can help clients determine whether a problem stems fr om racism or bias in others (the concept of health paranoia) so that clients do not inappropriately personalize problems. Culturally skilled counselors are not averse to seeking consultation with traditional healers, religious and spiritual leaders, and practitioners in the treatment of culturally diverse clients when appropriate. Culturally skilled counselors take responsibility for interacting in the languages requested by their client s; if not feasible, they make appropriate referral s. A serious problem arises when the linguistic skills of a counselor do not match the language of the client. When language matching is not possible, counse lors should seek a translator with cultural knowledge and appropriate pro- fessional back ground and/or refer to a knowledgeable and competent bilingual counselor. Culturally skilled counselors have training and expertise in the use of traditional assessment and testing instruments, understand their technical aspects , and are aware of their cultural limita- tions. This allows counselors to use test instruments for the welfare of diverse clients. Culturally skilled counselors are aware of and work to eliminate biases, prejudices, and discrimi-natory practices. They are aware of sociopolitical con texts in conducting evaluation and provid- ing interventions and are sensitive to issues of oppression, sexism, elitism, and racism. Culturally skilled counselors educate clients about the processes of psychological intervention, explaining such elements as goals, expe ctations, legal rights, and the counselor's theoretical orien- ng.org/docs/compet encies/ cross -cultural_competencies_and_objectives.pdf).

The counselor who con-ducted the intake interview had received training in cultural com-petence and wa s mindful of cultural factors in evaluating Zhang Min. The referral noted that Zhang Min was born in Hong Kong, so the therapist expected her to be hesitant to discuss her prob-lems, given the prejudices attached to mental illness and substance abuse in Chinese culture. During the evaluation, however, the therapist was surprised to find that Zh ang Min was quite forth- coming. She mentioned missing important deadlines at work and calling in sick at least once a week, and she noted that her cowork-ers had expressed concern after finding a bottle of wine in her desk. She admitted that she had been dri nking heavily, which she linked to work stress and recent discord with her Irish American spouse. Further inquiry revealed that Zhang Min's parents, both Chinese, went to school in England and sent her to a British school in Hong Kong. She grew up close to the British expatriate community, and her mother was a nurse with the British Army. Zhang Min came to the United States at the age of 8 and grew up in an Irish American neighborhood. She stated that she knew more about Irish culture than about Chinese c ulture. She felt, with the exception o f her physical features, that she was more Irish than Chinese\u2014 a view accepted by many of her Irish American friends. Most men she had dated were Irish Americans, and she socialized in groups in which alcohol consump tion was not only accepted but expected. Zhang Min first started to drink in high school with her friends. The counselor realized that what she had learned about Asian Improving Cultural Competence Americans was not necessarily applicable to Zhang Min and that knowledge of Zhang Min's entire history was necessary to appreci- ate the influence of culture in her life. The counselor thus developed treatment strategies more suitable to Zhang Min 's background. Multidimensional Model for Developing Cultural Competence: Clinical/Program Level 58 Zhang Min 's ca se demonstrates why thorough evaluation, including assessment of the client 's sociocultural background, is essential for treat- ment planning. To provide culturally responsive evaluation and treatment planning, counselors and programs must understand and incorporate relevant cultural fa ctors in to the process while avoiding a stereotypical or \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to treatment. Cultural responsiveness in planning and evaluation entails being open minded, asking the right questions, selecting appropriate screening and assessment instru-ments, and choosing effective treatment pro- viders and modalities for each client . Moreover, it involves identifying culturally relevant con-cerns and issues that should be addressed to improve the client 's recovery process. This chapter offers clinical staff guidance in providing and facilitating culturally responsive interviews, assessments, evaluations, and treatment planning. Using Sue 's (2001) multi- dimensional model for developing cultural competence , this chapter focuses on clinical and programmatic decisions and skills that are Chapter 3 \u2014Culturally Responsive Evaluation and Treatment Planning important in evaluation and treatment plan- ning process es. The chapter is organized around nine steps to be incorporated by clini- cians, supported in clinical supervision, and endorsed by administrators . Step 1: Engage Client s Once clients are in contact with a treatment program, they stand on the far side of a yet-to- be-established thera peuti c relationship. It is up to counselor s and other staff members to bridge the gap. Handshakes, facial expressions, greet- ings, and small talk are simple gestures that establish a first impression and begin building the therapeutic relationship. Involving one 's whole being in a greeting \u2014thought, body , attitude, and spirit \u2014is most engaging. Fifty percent of racially and ethnically diverse clients end treatment or counseling after one visit with a mental health practitioner (Sue and Sue 20 13e). At the outset of treatment, client s can feel scared, vulnerable, and uncertain about whether treatment will really help. The initial meeting is often the first encounter client s have with the treatment system, so it is vital that they leave feeling hopeful and understood. Paniagua (1998) describes how, if a counselor lacks sensitivity and jumps to premature con-clusions, the first visit can become the last: Pretend that you are a Puerto Rican taxi driv- er in New York City, and at 3:00 p.m. on a hot summer day you realize that you have your first appoint ment with the thera- pist...later, you learned that the therapist made a note that you were probably depressed or psychotic because you dressed carelessly and had dirty nails and hands...would you return for a second appointment? (p. 120) To engage the client, the counselor should try to establish rapport before launching into a series of questions. Paniagua (1998) suggests that counselors should draw attention to the present ing problem \"without giving the im- pression that too much information is needed to underst and the problem \" (p. 18). It is also important that the client feel engaged with any interpreter used in the intake process. A common framework used in many healthcare training programs to highlight culturally responsive interview behaviors is the LEARN model (Berlin and Fowkes 1983). The how -to box on the next page presents this model. Step 2: Familiarize Client s and Their Families With Treatment and Evaluation Process es Behavioral health treatment facilities maintain their own culture (i.e., the treatment milieu). Counselors, clinical supervisors, and agency administrators can easily become accustomed to this culture and assume that clients are used to it as well. However, clients are typically new to treatment language or jargon, program expectations and schedules, and the intake and treatment process. Unfortunately, clients from diverse racial and ethnic groups can feel more estranged and disconnected from treatment services when staff members fail to educate them and their families about treatment ex-pectations or when the clients are not walked Improving Cross -Cultural Communication Health disparities have multiple causes. One specific influence is cross- cultural communication between the counselor and the client. Weiss (2007) recommend s these six steps to improve communication with clients: 1. Slow down. 2. Use plain, nonpsychiatric language. 3. Show or draw pictures. 4. Limit the amount of information provided at one time. 5. Use the \"teach- back\" method. A sk the client, in a nonthreatening way , to explain or show what he or she has been told. 6. Create a shame -free environment that en- courages questions and participation. 59 Improving Cultural Competence through the treatment process, starting with the goals of the initial intake and interview. By taking the time to acclimat e clients and their families to the treatment process, counselors and other behavioral health staff members tackle one obstacle that could further impede treatment engagement and retention among racially and ethnically diverse clients. Step 3: Endor se Collaboration in Interviews, Assessments, and Treatment Planning Most clients are unfamiliar with the evalua- tion and treatment planning process and how they can participate in it. Some clients may view the initial interview and evaluation as intrusive if too much information is requested or if the content is a source of family dishonor or shame. Other clients may resist or distrust the process based on a long history of racism and oppression. Still others feel inhibited from actively participating becaus e they view the counselor as the authority or sole expert. The counselor can help decrease the influence of these issues in the interview process through a collaborative approach that allows time to discuss the expectations of both coun-selor and client; t o explain interview, intake, and treatment planning process es; and to establish ways for the client to seek clarifica- tion of his or her assessment results (Mohatt et al. 2008a ). The counselor can encourage collaboration by emphasizing the importance of clients' input and interpretations. Client feedback is integral in interpreting results and How To Use the LEARN Mnemonic for Intake Interviews Listen to each client from his or her cultural perspective. Avoid interrupting or posing questions before the client finishes talking; instead, find creative ways to redirect dialog (or explain session limitat ions if time is short). Take time to learn the client 's perception of his or her problems, concerns about presenting problems and treatment, and preferences for treatment and healing practices. Explain the overall purpose of the interview and intake process. Walk through the general agenda for the initial session and discuss the reasons for asking about personal information. Remember that the client 's needs come before the set agenda for the interview; don' t cover every intake question at the expense of taking time (usually brief) to address questions and concerns expressed by the client. Acknowledge client concerns and discuss the probable differences between you and your clients. Take time to understand each client 's explanatory model of illness and health. Recognize, whe n appropriate, the client's healing beliefs and practices and explore ways to incorporate these into the treatment plan. Recommend a course of action through collaboration with the client. The client must know the importance of his or her participation in the treatment planning process. With client assistance, client beliefs and traditions can serve as a framework for healing in treatment. However, not all clients have the same expectations of treatment involvement; some see the counselor as the expert, desire a directive approach, and have little desire to participate in developing the treatment plan themselves. Negotiate a treatment plan that weaves the client's cultural norms and lifeways into treatment goals, objectives, and steps. Once the treatment plan and modality are established and implemented, encourage regular dialog to gain feedback and assess treatment satisfaction. Re specting the client's culture and encouraging communication throughout the process increases client willing to engage in treatment and t o adhere to the treatment plan and continuing care recommendations.

Collaboration should extend to client preferences a nd desires rega rding inclusion of family and community members in evaluation and treatment planning. Step 4: Integrate Culturally Relevant Information and Theme s By exploring culturally relevant themes, counselors can more fully understand their clients and identify their cultural strengths and challenges. For example, a Korean wom-an's family may serve as a source of support and provide a sense of identity. At the same time, however, her family could be ashamed of her co -occurring generalized anxiety and substance use disorders and respond to her treatment as a source of further shame be-cause it encourages her to disclose personal matters to people outside the family. The following section provides a brief overview of suggested strength -based topics to incorpo- rate into the intake and evaluation process. Immigration History Immigration history can shed light o n client support systems and identify possible isolation or alienation. Some immigrants who live in ethnic enclaves have many sources of social support and resources. By contrast, others may be isolated, living apart from family, friends, and t he support systems extant in their coun- tries of origin. Culturally competent evalua-tion should always include questions about the client 's country of origin, immigration status, length of time in the United States, and con-nections to his or her country of origin. Ask Amer ican-born clients about their parents' country of origin, the language(s) spoken at home, and affiliation with their parents ' cul- ture(s). Questions like these give the counselor important clues about the client 's degree of acculturation in early life and at present, cul- tural identity, ties to culture of origin, potential cultural conflicts, and resources. Specific ques- tions should elicit information about : Length of time in the United States, noting when immigration occurred or the number of generations who have resided in the United States. Frequency of returns and psychological and personal ties to the country of origin. Primary language and level of English proficiency in speaking and writing. Psychological reactions to immigration and adj ustments made in the process. Changes in social status and other areas as a result of coming to this country. Major differences in attitudes toward alcohol and drug use from the time of immigration to now. Advice to Counselors: Conducting Strength -Based Interviews By nature, initial interviews and evaluations can overemphasize presenting problems and con-cerns while underplaying client strengths and supports. This list, although not exhaustive, reminds clinicians to acknowledge client strengths and supports from the outset . Strengths and supports : Pride and participation in one' s culture Social skills, traditions, knowledge, and practical skills specific to the client 's culture Bilingual or multilingual skills Traditional, religious, or spiritual practices, beliefs, and faith Generational wisdom Extended families and nonblood kinships Ability to maintain cultural heritage and practices Perseverance in coping with racism and oppression Culturally specific ways of coping Community involvement and support Source: Hays 2008 . 61 Improving Cultural Competence Cultural Identity and Acculturation As shown in Zhang Min 's case at the begin- ning of this chapter, cultural identity is a unique feature of each client. Counselors should guard against making assumptions about client identity based on general ethnic and racial identification by evaluating the degree to which an individual identifies with his or her culture(s) of origin. As Castro and colleagues (1999b ) explain, \"for each gr oup, the level of within -group variability can be assessed using a core dimension that ranges from high cultural involvement and ac-ceptance of the traditional culture 's values to low or no cultural involvement \" (p. 515). For African Americans, for example, this dimen- sion is called \"Afrocentricity. \" Scales for Af- rocentricity have been developed in an attempt to provide an indicator of an individual 's level of involvement within the traditional or core African -oriented culture (Baldwin and Bell 1985; Cokley and Williams 2005 ; Klonoff and Landrine 2000). Many other instruments based on models of identity evaluate accul-turation and identity. A detailed discussion of the theory behind such models is beyond the scope of this Treatment Improvement Proto-col (TIP); however, counselors should have a general understanding of what is being meas-ured when administering such instruments. The \"Asking About Culture and Accultura- tion\" advice box at right addresses exploration of culture and acculturation with clients. For more information on instruments that measure acculturation and/or identity, see Appendix B. Other areas to explore include the cross - cutting factors outlined in Chapter 1, such as socioeconomic status (SES) , occupation, education , gender, and other variables that can distinguish an individual from others who share his or her cultural identity. For example, a biracial client could identify with African American culture, White American culture, or both. When a client has two or more ra-cial/ethnic identities, co unselors should assess how the client self -identifies and how he or she negotiates the different worlds. Membership in a Subculture Clients often identify initially with broader racial, ethnic, and cultural groups. However, each person has a unique history that warrants an understanding of how culture is practiced and has evolved for the person and his or her Advice to Counselors: Asking About Culture and Acculturation A thoughtful exploration of cultural and ethnic identity issues will provide clues for determin-ing cultural, racial, and ethnic identity. There are numerous clues that you may derive from your clients' answers, and they cannot all be covered in this TIP; this is only one set of sample questions (Fontes 2008). Ask these questions tactfully so they do not sound like an interrogation. Try to integrate them naturally into a conversation rather than asking one after another. Not all questions are relevant in all settings. Counselors can adapt wording to suit clients' cultural contexts and styles of commu-nication, because the questions listed here and throughout this chapter are only examples: Where were you born? Whom do you consider family? What was the first language you learned? Which other language(s) do you speak? What language or languages are spoken in your home? What is your religion? How observant are you in practicing that religion? What activities do you enjoy when you are not working? How do you identify yourself culturally? What aspects of being ________ are most important to you? (Use the same term for the identified culture as the client.) How would you describe your home and neighborhood? Whom do you usually turn to for help when facing a problem? What are your goals for this interview? 62 Chapter 3 \u2014Culturally Responsive Evaluation and Treatment Planning family ; accordingly, counselors should avoid generalizations or assumptions. Clients are often part of a culture within a culture. There is not just one Latino, African American, or Native American culture; many variables influence culture and cultural identity ( see the \"What Are the Cross -Cutting Factors in Race, Ethnicity, and Culture \" section in Chapter 1). For example, an African American client from East Carroll Parish, LA , might describe his or her culture quite differently than an African American from down town Hartford, CT . Beliefs About Health, Healing, Help-Seeking, and Substance Use Just as culture shapes an individual 's sense of identity, it also shapes attitudes surrounding health practices and substance use. Cultural acceptance of a behavior, for in stance, can mask a problem or deter a person from seek-ing treatment. Counselors should be aware of how the client 's culture conceptualize s issues related to health, healing and treatment prac-tices, and the use of substances. For example, in cases where alc ohol use is discouraged or frowned upon in the community, the client can experience tremendous shame about drinking. Chapter 5 review s health -related beliefs and practices that can affect help - seeking behavior across diverse populations. Trauma and Loss Some immigrant subcultures have experienced violent upheavals and hav e a higher incidence of trauma than others. The theme of trauma and loss should therefore be incorporated into general intake questions. Specific issues under this general theme might include: Migration , relocation, and emigration history \u2014which considers separation from homeland, family, and friends \u2014and the stressors and loss of social support that can accompany these transitions. Clients' personal or familial experiences with American In dian boarding schools . Experiences with genocide, persecution, torture, war, and starvation. Advice to Counselors: Eliciting Client Views on Presenting Problems Some clients do not see their presenting physi- cal, psychological, and/or behav ioral difficulties as problems. Instead, they may view their presenting difficulties as the result of stress or another issue, thus defining or labeling the presenting problem as something other than a physical or mental disorder. In such cases, word the f ollowing questions using the client s' terminology rather than using the word \"prob- lem.\" These questions help explore how clients view their behavioral health concerns: I know that clients and counselors some-times have different ideas about illness and diseases, so can you tell me more about your idea of your problem? Do you consider your use of alcohol and/or drugs a problem? How do you label your problem? Do you think it is a serious problem? What do you think caused your problem? Why do you think it started when it did? What is going on in your body as a result of this problem? How has this problem affected your life? What frightens or concerns you most about this problem and its treatment? How is your problem viewed in your family? Is it acceptable? How is your problem viewed in your com-munity? Is it acceptable? Is it considered a disease? Do you know others who have had this problem? How did they treat the problem? How does your problem affect your stature in the community? What kinds of treatment do you think will help or heal you? How have you treated your drug and/or alcohol problem or emotional distress? What has been your experience with treat- ment programs? Sources: Lynch and Hanson 2011; Tang and Bigby 1996; Taylor 2002. 63 Improving Cultural Competence Step 5: Gather Culturally Relevant Collateral Information A client who needs behavioral health treat- ment services may be unwilling or unable to provide a full personal history from hi s or her own perspective and may not recall certain events or be aware of how his or her behavior affects his or her well- being and that of oth- ers. Collateral information \u2014supplemental information obtained with the client 's permis- sion from sources other than the client \u2014can be derived from family members, medical and court records, probation and parole officers, How To Use a Multicultural Intake Checklist Some clients do not see their presenting physical, psychological, and/or behavioral difficulties as problems. Instead, they may view their presenting difficulties as the result of stress or another issue, thus defining or labeling the presenting problem as something other than a physical or mental disorder . In such cases, word questions about the following topics using the client's terminology, rather than using the word \"problem.\" Asking questions about the following topics can help you explore how a client may view his or her behavioral health concerns: Immigration history Relocations (current migration pat- terns) Losses associated with immigration and relocation history English language fluency Bilingual or multilingual fluency Individualistic/collectivistic orientation Racial, ethnic, and cultural identities Tribal affiliation, if appropriate Geographic location Family and extended family concerns (including nonblood kinships) Acculturation level (e.g., traditional, bicultural) Acculturation stress History of discrimina tion/racism Trauma history Historical trauma Intergenerational family history and concerns Gender role s and expectations Birth order roles and expectations Relationship and dating concerns Sexual and gender orientation Health concerns Traditional healing practices Help -seeking patterns Beliefs about wellness Beliefs about mental illness and mental health treatment Beliefs about substance use, abuse, and depend-ence Beliefs about substance abuse treatment Family views on substance use and substance abuse tr eatment Treatment concerns related to cultural differences Cultural approaches to healing or treatment of substance use and mental disorders Education history and concerns Work history and concerns SES and financial concerns Cultural group affiliation Current network of support Community concerns Review of confidentiality parameters and concerns Cultural concepts of distress (DSM -5*) DSM -5 culturally related V -codes *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Psychiatric Associa- tion Sussman 2004. 64 Chapter 3 \u2014Culturally Responsive Evaluation and Treatment Planning community members, and others. Collateral information should include culturally relevant information obtained from the family, such as the organizati onal memberships, beliefs, and practices that shape the client 's cultural identi- ty and understanding of the world. As families can be a vital source of infor-mation, counselors are likely to attain more support by engaging families earlier in the treatment process. Although counselor inter- actions with family members are often limited to a few formal sessions, the families of racially and ethnically diverse clients tend to play a more significant and influential role in clients' participation in treatment. Co nsequently, special sensitivity to the cultural background of family members providing collateral infor-mation is essential. Families, like clients, cannot be easily defined in terms of a generic cultural identity (Congress 2004; Taylor et al. 2012). Even families from the same racial background or ethnic heritage can be quite dissimilar, thus requiring a multidimensional approach in understanding the role of culture in the lives of clients and their families. Using the culturagram tool on the next page in preparation for counseling, treatment plan-ning, or clinical supervision, clinician s can learn about the unique attributes and histories that influence clients' lives in a cultural context. Step 6: Select Culturally Appropriate Screening and Assessment Tool s Discussions of the complexities of psychologi- cal testing, the interpretation of assessment measures, and the appropriateness of screen-ing procedures are outside the scope of this TIP. However, counselors and other clinical service providers should be able to use assess- ment and screening information in culturally competent ways. This section discusses several instruments and their appropriateness for specific cultural groups. Counselors should continue to explore the availability of mental health and substance abuse screening and assessment tools that have been translated into or adapted for other languages. Culturally Appropriate Screening Devices The consensus panel does not recommend any specific instruments for screening or assessing mental or substance use disorders. Rather, when selecting instruments, practitioners should consider their cultural applicability to the client being served (AACE 2012; Jome and Moody 2002). For example, a screening instrument that asks the respondent about his or her guil t about drinking could be ineffective for members of cultural, ethnic, or religious groups that prohibit any consumption of alcohol. Al -Ansari and Negrete 's (1990) re- search supports this point. They found that the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test was highly sensitive with people who use alcohol in a traditional Arab Muslim society; however, one question \u2014\"Do you ever feel guilty about your drinking? \"\u2014failed to distin- guish between people with alcohol dependency disorders in treatment and people who dr ank in the community. Q uestions designed to measure conflict that results from the use of alcohol can skew test results for participants from cultures that expect complete abstinence from alcohol and/or drugs. Appendix D sum-marizes instruments tested on sp ecific popula- tions (e.g., availability of normative data for the population being served). Culturally Valid Clinical Scales As the literature consistently demonstrates, co-occurring mental disorders are common in people who have substance use disorders. Although an assessment of psychological problems helps match clients to appropriate 65 Improving Cultural Competence How To Use a Culturagram for Mapping the Role of Culture The culturagram is an assessment tool that helps clinicians understand culturally diverse clients and their families (Congress 1994, 2004; Congress and Kung 2005). It examines 10 areas of inquiry, which should include not only questions specific to clients' life experiences, but also questions specific to their family histories . This diagram can guide an interview, counseling, or clini cal supervi- sion session to elicit culturally relevant multigenerational information unique to the client and the client' s family. Give a copy of the diagram to the client or family for use as an interactive tool in the session. Throughout the interview, the client, family members, and/or the counselor can write brief responses in each box to highlight the unique attributes of the client 's history in the family context. This diagram has been adapted for clients with co -occurring mental and substance use diso rders; sample questions follow. Reasons for relocation or migration Legal and socioeconomic status Time in community Language spoken at home and in community Family: List each member and circle the client 's name Health beliefs and beliefs about drug and alcohol use Values about structure, power, myths, and rules Values about education and work Religious and cultural institutions, food, clothing, and holidays Oppression and discriminatio n Impact of trauma, substance abuse, and other crisis events Values about family structure, power, myths, and rules: Are there specific gender roles and expectations in your family? Who holds the power within the family? Are family needs more important than, or equally as important as, individual needs? Whom do you consider family? Reasons for relocation or migration: Are you and your family able to return home? What were your reasons for coming to the United States? How do you now view the initial reasons for relocation? What feelings do you have about relocation or migration? Do you move back and forth from one location to another? How often do you and your family return to your homeland? Are you living apart from your family? Legal status and SES: Has your SES improved or worsened since coming to this country? Has there been a change in socioeconomic status across generations?

(Note: Clients often need to develop trust before discussing legal status; they may come from a place where confidentiality is unfamiliar.) Time in the community: How long have you and your family members been in the country? Community? Are you and your family actively involved in a culturally based community? Languages spoken in and outside the home: What languages are spoken at home and in the community ? What is your and your family's level of proficiency in each language? How dependent are parents and grandparents on their children for negotiating activities sur-rounding the use of English? Have children become the family interpreters? Health beliefs and beliefs about help -seeking: What are the family beliefs about drug and alcohol use? Mental illness? Treatment? Do you and your family uphold traditional healing practices? How do help -seeking behaviors differ across generations and genders in your fami ly? How do you and your family define illness and wellness? Are there any objections to the use of Western medicine? Impact of trauma and other crisis events: How has trauma affected your family across generations? How have traumas or other crises affected you and/or your family? Has there been a specific family crisis? Did the family experience traumatic events prior to migration \u2014war, other forms of violence, displacement including refugee camps, or similar experiences? Oppression and discrimination: Is there a history of oppression and discrimination in your homeland? How have you and your family experienced discrimination since immigration? Religious and cultural institutions, food, clothing, and holidays: Are there specific religious holidays that your family observes? What holidays do you celebrate? Are there specific foods that are important to you? Does clothing play a significant cultural or religious role for you? Do you belong to a cultural or social club or organization? Values about education and work: How much importance do you place on work, family, and education? What are the educational expectations for children within the family? Has your work status changed (e.g., level of responsibility, prestige, and power) since migration? Do you or does anyone in your family work several jobs?

People who are abusing substances or experiencing withdrawal from substances can exhibit behaviors and thinking patterns con-sistent with mental illness. After a period of abstinence, symptoms that mimic mental illness can disappear. Moreover, clinical in-struments are imperfect measurements of equally imperfect psychological constructs that were created to organize and understand clinical patterns and thus better treat them; they do not provide absolute answers. As research and science evolve, so does our under-standing of mental illness (Benuto 2012) . Assessment tools are generally developed for particular populations and can be inapplicable 67 Improving Cultural Competence to diverse populations (Blume et al. 2005; Suzuki and Ponterotto 2008). Appendix D summarizes research on the clinical utility of instruments for screening and assessing co - occurring disorders in various cultural groups. Diagnosis Counselors should consider clients' cultural background s when evaluating and assessing mental and substance use disorders (Bhugra and Gupta 2010). Concerns surrounding diagnoses of mental and substance use disor-ders (and the cross -cultural applicability of those diagnoses) include the appropriateness of specific test items or questions, diagnostic criteria, and psychologically oriented concepts (Alarcon 2009; Room 2006). Research into specific techniques that address cultural differ-ences in evaluative and diagnostic processes so far remains limited and underrepresentative of diverse populations (Guindon and Sobhany 2001; Martine z 2009). Does the DSM -5 accurately diagnose mental and substance use disorders amon g immi- grants and other ethnic groups? Caetano and Shafer (1996) found that diagnostic criteria seemed to identify alcohol dependency con-sistently across race and ethnicity, but their sample was limited to African Americans, Latinos, and Whites. Other resea rch has shown mixed results. In 1972, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Nat ional Institutes of Health (NIH) embarked on a joint study to test the cross -cultural applicability of classification systems for various diagnoses, including sub-stance use disorders. WHO and NIH identi-fied factors that appeared to be universal aspects of mental and substance use disorders and then developed instruments to measure them. These instruments, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuro psychiatry (SCAN), include some DSM and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems criteria. Studies report that both the CIDI and SCAN were generally accurate, but the investigators urge caution in translation and interview pro-cedures (Room et al. 2003). Advice to Counselors and Clinical Supervisors: Culturally Responsive Screening and Assessment Assess the client 's primary language and language proficiency prior to the administration of any evaluation or use of testing instruments. Determine whether the assessment materials were translated using specific terms, including idioms that correspond to the client 's literacy level, culture, and language. Do not assume that translation into a stated language exactly matches the specific language of the client. Specifically, the client may not understand the translated language if it does not match his or her ways of thinking or speaking Educate the client on the purpose of the assessment and its application to the development of the treatment plan. Remember that testing can generate many emotional reactions. Know how the test was developed. Is normative data available for the population being served? Test results can be inflated, underestimated, or inaccurate due to differences within the client's population. Consider the role of acculturation in testing, including the influence of the client 's worldview in responses. Unfamiliarity with mainstream United States culture can affect interpretation of ques-tions, the client -evaluator rela tionship, and behavior, including participation level during evalua- tion and verbal and behavioral responses. Sources: Association for Assessment in Counseling and Education (AACE) 2012; Salda\u00f1a 2001. 68 Chapter 3 \u2014Culturally Responsive Evaluation and Treatment Planning Overall, psychological concepts that are ap- propriate for and easily translated by some groups are inappropriate for others. In some Asian cultures, for example, feeling refers more to a physical than an emotive state; questions designed to infer emotional states are not easily translated. In most cases, these issues can be remedied by using culture -specific resources, measurements, and references while also adopting a cultural formulation in the interviewing process (see Appendix E for the APA's cultural for mulation outline). The DSM -5 lists several cultural concepts of dis- tress (see Appendix E), y et there is little em- pirical literature providing data or treatment guidance on using the APA 's cultural formula- tion or addressing cultural con cepts of distress (Martinez 2009; Mezzich et al. 2009). Step 7: Determine Readiness and Motivation for Change Clients enter treatment programs at different levels of readiness for change. Even clients who present voluntarily could have been pushed into it by external pressures to accept treatment before reaching the action stage. These different readiness levels r equire differ- ent approaches. The strategies involved in motivational interviewing can help counselors prepare culturally diverse clients to change their behavior and keep them engaged in treatment. To understand motivational inter-viewing, it is first neces sary to examine the process of change that is involved in recovery. See TIP 35, Enhancing Motivation for Change in Substance Abuse Treatment (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT] 1999 b), for more information on this technique . Stages of Change Prochaska and DiClemente 's (1984) classic transtheoretical model of change is applicable to culturally diverse populations. This model divides the change process into several stages: Precontemplation. The individual does not see a need to change. For example, a per- son at this stage who abuses substances does not see any need to alter use , den ies that there is a problem, or blames the problem on other people or circumstances. Contemplation. The person becomes aware of a problem but is ambivalent about the course of action. For instance, a person struggling with depression recognizes that the depression has affected his or her life and thinks about getting help but remains ambivalent on how he/she may do this. Preparation. T he individual has deter- mined that the consequences of his or her behavior are too great and that change is necessary. Preparation includes small steps toward making specific changes, such as when a person who is overweight begins reading about wellness and weight man- agement. The client still engages in poor health behaviors but may be altering some behaviors or planning to follow a diet . Action. The individual has a specific plan for change and begins to pursue it. In rela- tion to substance abuse, the client may make an appointment for a dr ug and alco- hol assessment prior to becoming absti- nent from alcohol and drugs. Maintenance. The person continues to engage in behaviors that support his or her decision. For example, an individual with bipolar I disorder follows a daily relapse prevention plan that helps him or her as- sess warning signs of a manic episode and reminds him or her of the importance of engaging in help -seeking behaviors to minimize the severity of an episode. Progress through the stages is nonlinear, with movement back and fort h among the stages at different rates. It is important to recognize that change is not a one -time process, but 69 Improving Cultural Competence rather, a series of trial s and errors that eventu- ally translates to successful change. For exam- ple, people who are dependent on substances often attempt to abstain several times before they are able to acquire long -term abstinence. Motivational Interviewing Motivational interventions assess a person 's stage of change and use techniques likely to move the person forward in the sequence. Miller and Rollnick (2002) developed a thera-peutic style called motivational interviewing, which is characterized by the strategic thera-peutic activities of expressing empathy, devel-oping discrepancy, avoiding argument, rolling with resistance, and supporting self -efficacy. The counselor 's major tool is reflective listen- ing and soliciting change talk (CSAT 1999 c). This nonconfrontational , client -centered approach to treatment differs significantly from traditional treatments in several ways, creating a more welcoming relationship. TIP 35 (CSAT 1999c ) assesses Project MATCH and other clinical trials, concluding that the evidence strongly supports the use of motiva-tional interviewing with a wide variety of cultural and ethnic groups ( Miller and Rollnick 2013; Miller et al. 2008). TIP 35 is a good motivational interviewing resource. For specific application of motivational interview-ing with Na tive Americans, see Venner and colleagues (2006). For improvement of treat- ment compliance among Latinos with depres-sion through motivational interviewing, see Interian and colleagues (2010). Step 8: Provide Culturally Responsive Case Management Clients from various racial, ethnic, and cultur- al populations seeking behavioral health ser-vices may face additional obstacles that can interfere with or prevent access to treatment and ancillary services, compromise appropriate referrals, impede compliance with tre atment recommendations, and produce poorer treat- ment outcomes. O bstacles may include immi- gration status, low er SES, language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of or poor cov- erage with health insurance. Case management provides a single profes-sional contact through which clients gain access to a range of services. The goal is to help assess the need for and coordinate social, health, and other essential services for each client. Case management can be an immense help during treatment and recovery for a person with limited English literacy and knowledge of the treatment system. Case management focuses on the needs of individu-al clients and their families and anticipates how those needs will be affected as treatment proceeds. The case manager advocates for the client (CSAT 1998a ; Summers 2012 ), easing the way to effective treatment by assisting the client with critical aspects of life (e.g., food, childcare, employment, housing, legal prob-lems). Like counselors, case managers sho uld possess self -knowledg e and basic knowledge of other cultures, traits conducive to working well with diverse groups, and the ability to apply cultural competence in practical ways. Cultural competence begins with self - knowledge; counselors and case managers should be aware of and responsive to how their culture shapes attitudes and beliefs. This understanding will broaden as they gain knowledge and direct experience with the cultural groups of their client popula- tion, enabling them to better frame client issues and interact with clients in culturally specific and appropriate ways. TIP 27, Comprehensive Case Management for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT 1998a) , offers more information on effec- tive case management. 70 Chapter 3 \u2014Culturally Responsive Evaluation and Treatment Planning Exhibit 3 -1 discusses the cultural matching of counselors with clients. When counselo rs cannot provide cultura lly or linguistically competent services, they must know when and how to bring in an interpreter or to seek other assistance (CSAT 1998 a). Case management includes finding an interpreter who communi- cates well in the client 's language and dialect and who is familiar with the vocabulary re- quired to communicate effectively about s ensi- tive subject matter. The case manager works within the system to ensure that the interpret-er, when needed, can be compensated. Case managers should also have a list of appropriate referrals to meet assorted needs. For example, an immigrant who does not speak English may need legal services in his or her language; an undocumented worker may need to know where to go for medical assistance. Culturally competent case managers build and maintain rich referral resources for their clients. The Case Management Society of America 's S tandards of Practice for Case Management (2010) state that case management is central in meeting client needs throughout the course of treatment. The standards stress understand-ing relevant cultural information and com- municating effectively by respecting and being responsive to clients and their cultural context s. For standards that are also applicable to case management, refer to the National Association of Soci al Workers' Standards on Cultural Competence in Social Work Practice (2001). Step 9: Incorporate Cultural Factors Into Treatment Planning The cultural adaptation of treatment practices is a burgeoning area of interest, y et research is limited regarding the process and outcome of culturally responsive treatment planning in behavioral health treatment services for Exhibit 3 -1: Client -Counselor Matching The literature is inconclusive about the value of client- counselor matching based on race, ethnicity, or culture (Imel et al. 2011; Larrison et al. 2011; Suarez -Morales et al. 2010). Sue et al. (1991) found that for people whose primary language was not English, counselor -client matching for ethnicity and language predicted longer time in treatment (more sessions) with better outcomes for all ethnic groups studied: Asian Americans, African Americans, Mexican Ameri cans, and White Americans. Ethnic matches may work better for Latinos in treatment; gender congruence seems more important than race or ethnicity in client-counselor matching, particularly for female clients (Sue and Sue 2013a ). For Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, the many different ethnic subgroups make a cultural match more difficult. In multicultural communities, racial and ethnic matching may help develop a working alliance between the therapist and the consumer (Chao et al. 2012). Other relevant variables of both the client and therapist are age, marital status, training, language, and parental status. The extent to which a cultural match is necessary in therapy depends on client preferences, charac-teristics, presenting problems, and treatment needs. For example, gender matching could be more important than race/ethnicity matching to female sexual abuse survivors, who may have difficulty discussing their trauma with male counselors. Most clients want to know that their counselor s understands their worldview s, even if they do not share them. Counselor s' understanding of their client s' cultures improves treatment out- come s (Suarez -Morales et al. 2010). Fiorentine and Hillhouse (1999) found that empathy, regardless of race or ethnicity of counselor and client, was the most important predic tor of favorable treatment outcomes. Sue et al. (1991) found that clients using outpatient men tal health services more readily attended treatment and stayed longer if services were culturally responsive. In the treatment planning process, matching clients with providers according to cultural (and subcultural, when warranted) backgrounds can help provide treatment that is responsive to the personal, cultural, and clinical needs of clients (Fontes 2008). 71 Improving Cultural Competence diverse populations. How do counselor s and organization s respond culturally to the diverse needs of clients in the treatment planning process? How effective are culturally adaptive treatment goal s? (For a review, see Bernal and Domenech Rodriguez 2012 .) Typically, pro- grams that provide culturally responsive ser-vices approach treatment goals holistically, including objectives to improve physical health and spiritual strength (Howard 2003). Newer ap proaches stress implementation of strength -based strategies that fortify cultural heritage, identity, and resiliency. Treatment planning is a dynamic process that evolves along with an understanding of the clients' histories and treatment needs. Fore- most, counselors should be mindful of each client 's linguistic requirements and the availa- bility of interpreters (for more detail on inter- preters, see Chapter 4). Counselors should be flexible in designing treatment plan s to meet client needs and, when appropriate, should draw upon the institutions and resources of clients' cultural communities. Culturally re- sponsive treatment planning is achieved through active listening and should consider client values, beliefs, and expectations. Client health be liefs and treatment preferences (e.g., purification ceremonies for Native American clients) should be incorporated in addressing specific presenting problems. Some people seek help for psychological concerns and substance abuse from alternative sources (e.g., clergy, elders, social supports). Others prefer treatment programs that use principles and approaches specific to their cultures. Counselors can sug-gest appropriate traditional treatment resources to supplement clinical treatment activities. In sum, clinicians need to incorporate culture - based goals and objectives into treatment plans and establish and support open client - counselor dialog to get feedback on the pro- posed plan 's relevance. Doing so can improve client engagement in treatment services, com-pliance with treatment planning and recom-mendations, and treatment outcomes. Group Clinical Supervision Case Study Beverly is a 34- year- old White American who feels responsible for the tension and d issension in her family. Beverly works in the lab of an obstetrics and gynecology practice. Since early childhood, her younger brother has had prob-lems that have been diagnosed differently by various medical and mental health profession-als. He takes severa l medications, including one for attention deficit disorder. Beverly 's father has been out of work for several months. He is seeing a psychiatrist for depression and is on an antidepressant medication. Beverly's mother feels burdened by family problems and ineffec- tive in dealing with them. Beverly has always helped her parents with their problems, but she now feels bad that she cannot improve their situation. She believes that if she were to work harder and be more astute, she could lessen her family 's dist ress. She has had trouble sleeping. In the past, she secretly drank in the evenings to relieve her tension and anxiety. Most counselors agree that Beverly is too sub- missive and think assertiveness training will help her put her needs first and move out of the family home. However, a female Asian American counselor sees Beverly 's priorities differently, saying that \"a morally responsible daughter is duty-bound to care for her parents.\" She thinks that the family needs Beverly 's help, so it would be selfish to leave them. Discuss: How does the counselor' s worldview affect prioritizing the client' s presenting problems? How does the counselor 's individualistic or collectivistic culture affect treatment plan- ning? How might a counselor approach the initial interview and evaluation to minimize the in-fluence of his or her worldview in the evalu-ation and treatment planning process?

Referred to the center through his employee assistance program, he was accom-panied by his spouse and 14 -year-old son. Cavin 's wife provided his medical history and recounted her husband 's 2-year decline from a promising career as a journalist, researcher, and social commentator to a bitter, often paranoid man who abused cocaine and alcohol. Cavin, she explained, had become increasingly un-predictable. Upon admission, Cavin was initially cooperative and grateful to his spouse for her efforts, but as withdrawal continued , he became increasingly agitated, insisting that he could detoxify on his own. He resisted any intervention by staf f members whom he perceived to be critical or patronizing. On his fourth day in treatment, Cavin began to note the treatment center 's \"White \" environment . There were almost no African American employees \u2014none at the clinical level. He noted how decor reflec ted only White American culture. Driven in part by his substance use disorder, he was look-ing for reasons to leave. Later that evening, he checked out. Cavin was unable to relate to his treatment. He found no cultural cues with which to identify or connect. Therefore, he started searching for reasons to leave \u2014behavior typical in persons who abuse substances. People often leave treatment with the conscious hope of managing their substance abuse themselves and the un-conscious drive to re live positive experiences associated with sub- stance use; meanwhile, they all too easily forget the pain imposed by the use of alcohol and other substances. Cavin may have re-mained in treatment if services had been more culturally respon- sive.

Multidimensional Model for Developing Cultural Competence: Organizationa l/ Administrative Level 74 Cultural Competence at the Organizational Level At the organizational level, cultural compe- tence or responsiveness refers to a set of con-gruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that enable a system, agency, or group of profes-sionals to work effectively in multicultural environments (Cross et al. 1989). Organiza- tional cultural responsiveness is a dynamic, ongoing p rocess; it is not something that is achieved once and is then complete . Organiza- tional structure s and components change. The demographics and needs of communities change. Employees and their job descriptions change. Consequently, the commitment to increase cultural competence must also involve a commitment to maintain it through periodic reassessments and adjustments. Based on the Cross et al. (1989) definition of the culturally competent organization, Goode (2001) identi-fies three pri ncipal components (Exhibit 4 -1) that coincide with Sue 's (2001) multidimen- sional model for developing cultural compe-tence in behavioral health services. Chapter 4 \u2014Pursuing Organizational C ultural Competence This chapter provides a broad overview of how beh avioral health organizations can create an institutional framework for culturally responsive program delivery, staff develop-ment, policies and procedures, and administra- tive practices. Built on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS 's) Offi ce of Minority Health (OMH) Enhanced National Standards for C ulturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (OMH 2013; for review, see Appendix C), this chapter is organized around the Heal th Resources and Services Administrati on's (HRSA 's) domains of organi- zational cultural competence: values, governance , planning , evaluation and monitoring , communication (language ser- vices) , workforce and staff development , and organizational infrastructure (Linkins et al. 2002). (Another domain , services and inter- ventions, is covered in Chapter 3.) Within each domain, specific organizational tasks are suggested to aid program and ad-ministrative staff in developing a culturally responsive clinical, work, and organizational environment (Exhibit 4 -2); these domains and Exhibit 4 -1: Requirements for Organizational Cultural Competence The organization needs a defined set of values and principles, along with demon-strated behaviors, attitudes, policies, and structures that enable effective work across cultures. The organization must value diversity, conduct self- assessment, manage the dy- namics of difference, acquire and institu-tionalize cultural knowledge, and adapt to diversity and the cultural contexts of the communities it serves. The organization must incorporate the above in all aspects of policymaking, ad-ministration, and service delivery and sys-tematically involve consumers and families. Source: Goode 2001 .

Organizational Values Journey Mental Health Center (JMHC) , a large outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment clinic in Wisconsin, is an organization that is committed to providing accessible, community- focused, culturally responsive behavioral health services. JMHC offers the following commentary on the im-portance of clear, culturally responsive organi- zational values ( JMHC 2013, paragraphs 1-3): ...cultural competence is fundamental to providing quality services that promote indi-vidual and family strengths, dignity, and self - reliance. Cultural competence broadens and enriches the delivery of mental health and alcohol and other drug abuse (AODA) ser-vices by providing a more holistic, relevant view of the world and the helping process. Cultural competence does not stand apart from, but is intrinsic to good clinic al practice. Its threads are woven into the tapestry of ef-fective assessment, treatment planning, inter-vention, advocacy, and support. In addition, cultural competence is intrinsic to effective staff relationships and business practices. Cultural competence promotes relationships based upon understanding and knowledge of how one 's own cultural beliefs and values in- fluence the organization of information, per-ceptions, feelings, experiences, and coping strategies. It involves being able to identify, learn fro m, and incorporate these into the helping process. When cultural competence is an integral part of personal competence, there is the maximum opportunity to increase the amount and quality of information and the speed with which that information can be shared and processed and to form healthy al- liances. Cultural competence demands an ongoing commitment to openness and learning, taking time and taking risks, sitting with uncertainty and discomfort, and not having quick solu-tions or easy answers. It involves b uilding trust, mentoring, and developing and nurtur-ing a frame of reference that considers alli-ances across culture as enriching rather than threatening shared goals . Task: Commit to Cultural Competence Counselors are typically a part of a larger organization or system, but the focus on and responsibility for developing culturally respon-sive services has historically fallen on individ- ual practitioners rather than on organizations. Most literature on cultural competence ad-dresses the cultural awareness, kno wledge, and skills of the practitioner, but until recently, it has failed to apply these same concepts to agencies . Cultural competence among coun- selors is only as effective as their agencies ' commitment to and support of cultural com- petence and ability to value diversity through culturally congruent administrative practices, including \u2014but not limited to \u2014policies and procedures, programming, staffing, and com-munity involvement. Counselors are unlikely to affect organization- al change to the same degree as t he agency 's overall administration can. H ence, culturally responsive treatment cannot be sustained without an agency 's commitment and support. In fact, the organization itself can prevent clients from receiving culturally responsive services or treatment opportunities. Organiza-tions that are unaware of cultural issues can fail to recognize that diverse groups may have difficulty accessing and engaging in treatment. Also, counselors who attempt to use culturally responsive practices \u2014such as the involvement of family members (as defined by the client) and traditional healers \u2014can encounter insur- mountable hurdles if their agenc ies' policies 76 Chapter 4 \u2014Pursuing Organizational C ultural Competence and resources do not support these practices. The system can actually impede efforts made by counselors invested and trained in cultural competence. Th us, the development of cultural competence begins at the top level of the organization, with an initial focus on systemic changes. Cultural competence does not occur by acci-dent. To maximize its effectiveness in working with diverse groups, the organization must first view diversity as an asset. As importantly, the organization must ensure that its process of developing cultural competence has the genuine, full, and lasting support of the organ-ization 's leader ship. The chief executive officer (CEO), senior management, and board of directors play critical roles. A strong mandate from the board or CEO, coupled with a com-mitment to provide resources, can be a good motivator for staff and committees to under-take ma jor organizational change. S upport of cultural competence must be made clear throughout the organization and community in meaningful ways, in words and actions. Leadership can make a difference in the im-plementation of culturally responsive practices by cr eating an organizational climate that encourages and supports such practices. This includes a willingness to discuss the im-portance of cultural competence, try new practices or approaches, tolerate the uncertain-ty that accompanies transitional periods dur-ing which practices and procedures are evolving, respond to unforeseen barriers, and revise innovations that are not working as intended. It is important that leadership be genuinely commi tted to the effort and that their support be tangibly apparent in the allocation of relevant resources. A strong commitment to improving organizational cultural competence should include the obli-gation to monitor procedures after they have been implemented, maintain and reevaluate new practices, and provide resources and opportunities for ongoing training and cultur- ally competent supervision. Task: Review and Update Vision, Mission, and Value Statements The organization 's mission, vision, and value statements are vitally important in creating a conceptual framework that promotes cultur- ally responsive behavioral health services. Agencies should examine how these state- ments are developed. Are stakeholders in- volved in the development process? In what ways does the organization ensure that its values and mission reflect the community and populations that it serve s? Does the organiza- tion see this task as a singular event, or has it planned for periodic review of its values and mission to ensure continued organizational responsiveness as needs, populations, or envi-ronments change? Initially, the planning committee should de-termine how the culture of the organization as well as the surrounding community can sup- port achievement of the mission and vision statements. Culturally responsive organiza-tional statements cannot provide a tangible framework unless supported by community, referral, and client demographics; a needs assessment; and an implementation plan. Mission and vision statements need to be operationalized through identified goals as well as measurable indicators to track progress. The Hands Across Cultures Corporation of Organizations that fail to endorse and make a commitment to cultural compe- tence will more than likely displace the responsibility of cultural competence onto counselor s or client s. If the responsibility is on the client s, it is likely that the clients will have to \"fit\" or change to match the treatment or program rather than treat- ment services being adapted to fit the needs of clients . 77 Improving Cultural Competence northern New Mexico, which serves Native peoples within pueblos (American Indians), the City of Espa\u00f1ola, Pojoaque Valley, and surrounding communities (predominantly Latino) , addresses the importance of the cultural context of its work in its mission and philosophy statements ( Exhibit 4 -3). Task: Address Cultural Competence in Strategic Planning Processes The strategic planning process provides an opportunity to reevaluate an agency 's values, mission, and vision regarding cultural compe- tence. A comprehensive process involves eval-uating the organization 's internal and external environment s prior to holding planning meet- ings; this evaluation involves conducting staff, client , and community assessments. From assessing current needs to evaluat ing global factors that influence the direction and deliv- ery of services (e.g., funding sources, treat- ment mandates , changes in health insurance), organizations can begin to gain insight into the demands and challenges of providing cultura lly responsive services. Moreover, stra- tegic planning is an opportunity to explore and develop short - and long -term goals that focus on incorporating culturally responsive delivery systems while addressing issues of sustainability (i.e., how to provide res ources and support the implementation of culturally responsive policies and procedures over time). A formal strategic planning meeting should be held to determine specific goals, objectives, and tasks that will ensure quality improvement in culturally responsive services. The develop-ment of timelines and methods to evaluate progress, obstacles, and direction s for each goal are equally important. For organizations that do not have a specific cultural competence plan prior to the strategic planning meeting, this process can provide the forum for devel-oping the steps needed to create a formal plan. Governance Task: Assign a Senior Manager T o Oversee the Development of Culturally Responsive Practices and Services From the outset, a senior staff member with the authority to implement change should be assigned to oversee the developmental process of planning, evaluating, and implementing culturally responsive administrative and clini-cal services. Key responsibilities include the ongoing development and facilitation of cul-tural competence committees and advisory boards, management of evaluative processes, facilitation of the development of a cultural competence plan and its implementation, and oversight of policies and p rocedures to ensure cultural competence within the organization and among staff. Cultural competence cannot come to fruition with only one voice being heard, but assigning a key person to oversee Exhibit 4 -3: Hands Across Cultures Mission Statement Mission To improve the health, education and well being of the people of Northern New Mexico through family -centered approaches deeply rooted in the multicultural traditions of their communities. Philosophy To believe in culture as the foundation of human growth; spirituality as the strength of the people; each person' s need to love and be loved; family preservation; individual responsi- bility; and the pursuit of human potential. With a firm commitment to these beliefs, Hands Across Cultures ' Board of Directors, staff, and collaborators hold that: Culture Is the Cure La Cultura Cura Source: Hands Across Cultures 2014. 78 Chapter 4 \u2014Pursuing Organizational C ultural Competence the process will more likely keep top-priority goals and obj ectives in view. Task: Develop Culturally Competent Governing and Advisory Boards Beyond hav ing the foresight to plan for and develop culturally responsive services, it is vital that executive staff members on governing and advisory board s and committees are educated about and invested in the organization 's mis- sion and plan. For example, the board 's hu- man resources committee may be more invested in developing and reinforcing cultur- ally responsive recruitment and hiring policies and practices if they are inv olved in the strate- gic planning process and educated about the organization 's mission, values, and vision. At the same time, the organization should seek outside direction. Given that sharing infor-mation about the agency 's activities with others outside th e organization can create some hesitancy or be a potential barrier, the executive staff can frame the planning process as an opportunity for positive development and community involvement as a powerful resource. The organization should establish a communit y advisory board that includes stakeholders, specialists, and/o r experts in multicultural behavioral health services along with key administrators and staff. This adviso-ry board should consist of local community members from whom the organization can solicit valuable advice, input, and potential support for the development of culturally responsive treatment (Minnesota Department of Human Services 2004). Representation should include clients, alumni, family members, and community -based organizations and ins titutions (e.g., commu- nity centers, faith communi ties, social service organizations). Developing an inclusive advi-sory board of community members can e n- hance and extend use of and referral from other community agencies. Moreover, this board can help identify community leaders and culturally appropriate resources for the client population to supplem ent treatment activities, such as traditional healing practices (Castro et al. 1999a ). The advice box on the next page reviews strategies for engaging communities in the development of culturally responsive services. Task: Establish a Cultural Competence Committee By creating a committee within the organ iza- tion to guide the process of becoming cultur- ally competent and responsive, the organization ensu res that a core group will provide oversight and direction. This commit-tee should be inclusive not only in terms of the racial and ethnic composition of the popu- lation served, but also in terms of drawing from all levels of the organization (Whaley and Longoria 2008). Representatives of the advisory board should also be included. Pro-gram administrators should provide direction to the cultural competence committee. The person assigned to take the lead on cultural competence should chair the committee, and the CEO should be noticeably involved. The cultural competence committee will oversee the organization 's self -assessment process while also creating the demographic profile of the organization 's community, devel- oping a cultural competence plan, and formu-lating and monitoring procedures that evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the organization 's plan in developing culturally responsive services and practices. The commit-tee should ensure that the organization 's plans are continually updated. To succeed, this team must be empowered to influence, formulate, implement, and enforce initiatives on all levels and throughout every department of the organization (Constantine and Sue 2005; Fung et al. 2012), including, for example, 79 Improving Cultural Competence presenting data and subsequent recommenda- tions to the administration and boards based on employee fe edback about their experiences with newly adopted, culturally responsive procedures in the organization. Exhibit 4 -4 highlights key issues in behavioral health treatment that must be addressed in providing culturally responsive services. Planning Task: E ngage Clients, Staff, and the Community in the Planning, Development, and Implementation of Culturally Responsive Services Organizations can sometimes have the best intentions of creating culturally responsive services but miss the mark by operating in a vacuum. Initially, the vacuum approach can appear less time consuming, complex, and expensive, but it can also represent paternalism whereby organizations or administrators assume that they inherently know what is best for the progra m, client s, staff, and community. Instead, organizations and the services that Exhibit 4 -4: Critical Treatment Issues To Consider in Providing Culturally Responsive Services Access: Degree to which services f or clients are quickly and readily available.

Advice to Administrators: Strategies T o Engage Communities in Developing Culturally Responsive Treatment Services Ask board members to help recruit key members of the local community. Create a community advisory group to complement the governing boards in assessing and recommending culturally responsive policies, procedures, and practices. Develop local community focus groups to discuss key treatment needs, health beliefs, and atti-tudes and behaviors related to substance use, mental illness, and help -seeking that could be un- known to others outside of the community and in the organization. Develop a policy that supports the use of culturally congruent communication modalities and technologies for sharing information with communities. Provide inservice training, continuing education, and other professional development activities (e.g., networking events) that focus on strengthening skills for collaboration with culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Develop policies and procedures to support community involveme nt in the treatment setting (e.g., incorporating peer support programs, having a presence at community housing events, developing partnerships with traditional healers). Develop local outreach and educational programs in multiple languages (e.g., provide family education on substance use patterns and community issues in Spanish at a community center). Participate in community events to raise awareness of services, to develop trust and build rela-tionships, and to gain further knowledge of local cultural gro ups and community practices. Periodically analyze community demographic trends and populations served by the treatment organization; ensure representation of these diverse populations on the advisory board. Become knowledgeable about and use available lo cal goods and services.

Otherwise, services may be poorly matched to clients, underused by the community, and detriment al to agency financial resources. For example, an agency could decide that family therapy is a culturally appropriate service and proceed to create a multifamily program (treating several families together in a group format) without considering that, for some cultural groups, family shame associated with seeking help can deter the use of such services. Staff members are likely to have specific knowledge of client needs and to be able to identify potential obstacles or challenges in how an organization attempts to implement culturally responsive policies and procedures. A parallel process that can influence the po- tential success of staff involvement and com- mitment to the development of cultural competence is the organizational culture. Suppose, for example, that the staff perceives the organization 's new commitment to cultural competence as another expectation of more work without training, adequate clinical supervision, or ongoing support . Maybe staff members have historically experienced fre- quent announcements, mandates, or excite-ment generated by the administration that fade quickly . Perhaps the organization ar- ranges committees and meetings, purporting that they want staff input despite the fact that decisions have already been made. The organizational climate sets the stage for staff responsiveness and motivation in devel-oping cultural competence and in implement-ing culturally responsive services. Without an organizational history and culture of support-ing change across time, staff members will likely resent an increase in expectations with-out some means of compensating for addi-tional work, perceive themselves as powerles s over the proposed changes, or minimize the need to make any immediate changes. For example, staff members may view changes as temporary or a phase and believe that the organization will focus on other issues or new directions once the pressure or attention on this specific issue subsides. Task: Develop a Cultural Competence Plan To ensure the delivery of culturally responsive services, it is important t o develop a cultural competence plan (see the \"Criter ia for Devel- oping an Organizational Cultura l Compe- tence Plan\" advice box on the next page ). Using demographic data and an organizational self-assessment (including community and advisory board input), the organization 's cul- tural competence committee can begin writing an organizational plan for impr oving cultural competence. The committee will need to assign staff members to research and write each component of the plan , which should outline specific objectives, means of achieving these objectives, and recommend timelines and processes for evaluating progress . The plan should contain at least the following components: A narrative introduction that covers com- munity demographics and history, organi- zational self -assessment and other evaluation tools , the rationale for provid- ing culturally responsive ser vices, and the organization 's strengths and needs for im- provement in providing services that are responsive to client cultural groups; a brief overview of current priorities, goals, and tasks to help the organization develop and improve culturally responsive clinical ser- vices and administrative practices is also advisable . 81 Improving Cultural Competence Strategies for recruiting, hiring, retaining, and promoting qualified diverse staff. Resources and policies to support language services and culturally responsive services. Methods to enhance professional devel- opment (e.g., staff education and training, peer consultation, clinical supervision ) in culturally responsive treatment services. Mechanisms for community involvemen t, beginning with the development of a community advisory board and cultural competence committee and including community participation in relevant treatment activities or in support of treat- ment services (e.g. , spiritual direction ). Approaches to amending facility design and operations to present a culturally con- gruent atmosphere. Identification of and recommendations for culturally and linguistically appropriate program materials. Programmatic strategies to incorporate culturally congruent clinical and ancillary treatment services. Fiscal planning for funding and human resources needed for priority activities (e.g., training, language ser vices, program development, organizational infrastructure ). Guidelines for implementation that de- scribe roles, responsibilities, timeframes, and specific activities for each step. The committee must determine how to over- see the plan (e.g., by tracking accomplish- ment s, obstacles, and remediation strategies ). Who will develop and revise guidelines for treatment plan ning, introduce new guidelines to the staff and provide counsel or training, and coordinate revisions with the information technology specialist or department? Task: Develop and Review Policies and Procedures T o Ensure Culturally Responsive Organizational Practices In essence, policies and procedures are the backbone of an organization 's implementation of culturally responsive services. By creating, reviewing, and adapting clinical and adminis- trative policies and procedures in response t o the ever -changing needs of client population s, the agency is able to provide counselors and Advice to Administrators: Criteria for Developing an Organizational Cultural Competence Plan Using the core elements of access, engagement, and retention as criteria in developing a cultural competence plan, the following recommendations are offered: Develop a thorough knowledge and understanding of the social, cultural, and historical experi- ences of the community of people your agency is serving. Identify and clearly articulate an understanding of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and social groups in the area your agency serves. Document, track, and evaluate/assess the reasons why clients are not accepted for services. Know the demographics of clients within the program and their rates of program completion. Keep profiles of clients who do not complete services. Design steps for your agency to take to remove identified barriers that keep clients from using your agency's services. Establish steps your agency will implement or sustain to create a consumer -friendly environment that reflects and respects the diversity of the clients that use your services. Establish internal criteria the agency will use to measure the impact of the services and programs that it offers.

Programs are likely to have the foresight to develop relevant policies and procedures through the planning and evaluative processes outlined in this chapter, but it is unlikely that they will anticipate every situation. T hus, ongoing flexibility is paramount. When putting together an organizational cultural competence plan, providers should be careful to follow the requirements set by state licensing boards , accreditation agencies, and professional organizations that oversee certifi-cation and licensing of treatment profession-als. Much of the push for cultural competence throughout the healthcare field is in response to the mandates of accrediting agencies, f un- ders, and managed care organizations. These entities have standards and guidelines that state minimum expectations for client rights, program structure, and staffing, along with treatment content and conditions. Behavioral health organizations, including substance abuse treatment programs , must meet these standards to be accredited by national organi-zations and compensated by funders. Although many accrediting bodies require a cultural competence plan that is assessed as part of the accreditation process , their requirements can be minimal. Consequently, organizations should go beyond such requirements in their own thinking and planning to ensure that they are responding adequately to the needs of the communities they serve. Above all, are the policies, pr ocedures, and systems of care suited to the served populations? Do policies reflect the organization 's commitment to cultural competence in administrative practices? F or example, are strategies for professional devel- opment, personnel recruitment, and reten tion of culturally competent staff members reflec- tive of the populations and cultures that they serve? If an organization fails to develop culturally responsive policies or procedures yet claims to endorse or support culturally responsive ser- vices, counsel ors and staff members will likely carry the entire burden of implementing these services and will face numerous obstacles that could prevent the delivery of responsive ser-vices. Take, for example, a counselor from a county -funded program who was directed b y her supervisor to complement her counseling approach with the client 's traditional healing beliefs and practices. The agency did not provide staff support, have policies or proce-dures consistent with this request, or exhibit a willingness to adapt current procedures to meet the client 's need s. The counselor had difficulty following this direction because of barriers in finding an appropriate traditional practitioner in the local area, coordinating services, establishing and securing confidenti-ality for the client and with the practitioner (including educating the practitioner about confidentiality), arranging transportation for the client , obtaining a stipend for services, and discerning how and when to incorporate the traditional practice into the t reatment milieu. Counselors who feel that they have been left to go it alone can view implementation of culturally responsive practices as an insur- mountable challenge when the agency pro- vides limited support or fails to endorse adaptive policies that are congruent with the needs of the client population. C ounselors may have high motivation to incorporate culturally responsive care but find themselves without appropriate agency resources, permis-sion, or infrastructure to implement it. By developing and endo rsing culturally responsive policies and procedures, an organization can provide carefully thought -out strategies and processes to help staff members provide real- time responsive services. Well -defined policies and procedures reinforce commitment to and expectation s of cultural competence. 83 Improving Cultural Competence Evaluation and Monitoring To develop a viable cultural competence plan, information must be gathered from all levels of the organization, from clients and commu- nity, and from other stakeholders. Beginning with acquiring initial demographic data from the populations that are or could be served by the agency and extending to soliciting feed-back from various stakeholders, gathering information prior to plan development helps the organization provide direction and deter-mine p riorities. Gathering i nformation also allows ongoing monitoring and feedback regarding the plan 's effectiveness and areas in need of improvement. Areas of evaluation and monitoring can include a demographic profile of the client, community, staff, and boar d constellations; community needs assessment; client, family, and referral feedback; adminis-trative, clinical, medical, and nonclinical staff assessments; and more ( American Evaluation Association 2011; LaVeist et al. 2008). Task: Create a Demographic Profile of the Community, Clientele, Staff, and Board Intake, admission, and discharge data provide a good starting point for determining the demographic s of current populations being served. Programs would likely benefit from developing a demographic summar y for each population served , consisting of age, gender, race, ethnic and cultural heritage, religion, socioeconomic status , spoken and written language preferences and capabilities, em-ployment rates, treatment level, and health status (HHS 2003b ). With ad equate resources, the organization can generate reports dating back 5 years to determine program trends. Agencies should also gather demographic information on groups in the agency 's local community (Hernandez et al. 2009). This information can be easily obtained through census data and national centers (e.g., Bureau of Labor Statistics) or through local sources, including the library, city hall, or the county commissioner 's office (Whealin and Ruzek 2008). Community demographics can provide a quick benchmark on how well an agency serves the local community and how the community is represented at all levels of the organization. A demographic profile should also summarize information about clinical, medical, and nonclinical staff members as well as board members. Other information can also be helpful for specific agencies, as can hiring a consultant to gather demographic information and conduct the organization 's self -assessment of cultural competence to limit bias; howe ver, lack of funding can prohibit this possibility. Task: Conduct Organizational Self - Assessment of Cultural Competence An organization must have an awareness of how it functions within the context of a multi-cultural environment, evaluating operational aspects of the agency as well as staff ability and competence in providing culturally con- gruent services to racially and ethnically di-verse populations. Therefore, an agency should assess how well it currently provides culturally responsive treatment. An hon est and thorough organizational self -assessment can serve as a blueprint for the cultural competence plan and as a benchmark to evaluate progress across time (National Center for Cultural Competence 2013). To review a sample as- sessment guide, refer to Appendix C. The importance of organizational self - assessment cannot be over stated. Thorough, reliable, valid evaluations can gauge the effec- tiveness of an agency 's services, structure, and practices (e.g., clinical services, governing practices, policy development, staff composi-tion, and professional development) with culturally and racially diverse clients, staff, and 84 Ch apter 4 \u2014Pursuing Organizational C ultural Competence communities. More and more, public and private funding sources \u2014as well as accrediting bodies \u2014use an organization 's self -assessment as a means of measuring compliance, effec-tiveness, or quality improvement practices. A self-assessment can seem intensive in terms of both labor and capital , but in the long run, it can guide an organization 's quality im- provement process more efficiently by helping it provide the most relevant services at the right time. Gathering feedback from many internal and external sources gives agencies considerable information needed to effectively evolve as a culturally responsive organization, including data on current performance, areas needing improvement, and development needs. In the initial self -assessment, an or- ganization should obtain demographic in-formation and seek feedback from key stakeholders \u2014including community mem- bers, clients, families, and referral sources (e.g., probation and parole offices, family and child services, private practitioners) \u2014and from all levels of the organization, including administrative, managerial, clinical, medical, and support staff. The following steps are recommended to help an agency g ain the information necessary to guide and support the development of its cultural competence plan. Step 1: With the advisory board and cultural competence committee, identify key stake-holders who can provide valuable feedb ack about current strengths and areas in need of improvement regarding the function of the organization and the needs of its community. Step 2: Adopt a self -assessment guideline for organizational cultural competence (see Appendix C). Step 3: Determine t he feasibility of using consultants and/or external evaluators to select, analyze, and manage assessment . For many organizations, hiring outside con- sultants is financially prohibitive. Nonetheless, the cultural competence committee could recommend hiring outside evaluators and consultants to help them plan, conduct, and assess the results of the organizational self - evaluation. The committee should ensure that consultants understand the population being served by the treatment facility. This means understanding the population 's cultural groups across dimensions: language and communica-tion, cultural beliefs and values, history, socio-economic status, education, gender roles, substance use patterns, spirituality, and other distinctive aspects. Candidates should be able to articulate a clear understanding of cultural competence (American Evaluation Association 2011). If consultants will train staff, they should have specific knowledge and profi-ciency in training development and delivery. If financially feasible, it can be useful for the agency to consider using more than one con- sultant and to invite each prospective c onsult- ant to present their qualifications to the board of directors and/or to a cultural competence The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Cultural Competence Item Set This assessment tool evaluates provider cultural competence through client surveys. It helps identify strengths and weaknesses of individual behavioral health service providers and organizations, aid s in provider comparisons, and assesses the extent to which client responses differ based on race, ethnicity, or primary language. The surveys are available online through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( https:// cahps.ahrq.gov/clinician_group/), as is an overview and instructions (https://cahps.ahrq.gov/surveys -guidance/hp/instructions/index.html ). 85 Improving Cultural Competence committee so that the best match can be achieved between the agency 's needs and the consultant based on his or her expertise, cost, and consulting style. If a consultant is hired, the organization should establish guidelines for working closely with that person, including reporting requirements to the cultural compe-tence committee. The orga nization must retain ownership of the process and provide clear oversi ght and guidance. Step 4: Select assessment tools suitable for each stakeholder group (e.g., clinical staff, agency referrals, clients). S everal self - assessment tools are available, including checklists and surveys, for use in evaluation or as development guide s. To date, most instru- ments available have limited empirical support (Delphin -Rittmon et al. 2012b ; Shorkey et al. 2009). More often than not, surveys and feedback questionnaires will need to be individually developed and tailored to the organization and stakeholder group depending upon setting; available resources; racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds; language preferences; and com-munity accessibility (e.g., rural versus urban). Appendix C provides standards and lists the items that should be included in evaluating an agency and its services. Additional resources for provider and organizational assessment of cultural competence are available through the National Center for Cultural Competence (http://nccc.georgetown.edu/ ) and the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health (http://www.hogg.utexas.edu/index.php ). Step 5: Determine dist ribution, administra- tion, and data collection procedures (e.g., confidentiality, participant selection methods, distribution time frames). Whatever methods are used to gather data for the self -assessment process, it is critical to explain the context of the assessment to all participants. They need to know why the assessment is being conduct-ed and how the information they give will be used. Confidentiality can be a major concern for some respondents, especially staff members and clien ts, and every effort should be made to address this concern. Ideally, the evaluatio n Advice to Administrators: Gathering Feedback From Clients, Community Members, and Referrals Agencies should incorporate a client satisfaction survey into the assessment process. This survey should include questions to help determine whether clients believe that the organization relates well to persons of their ethnicity or race and gives them an oppo rtunity to pinpoint proble m are as. To review a sample assessment tool for clients, refer to the Iowa Cultural Understanding Assessment - Client Form (White et al. 2009) , available in Appendix C. The tool is also available in Spanish. If desired, external consultants can conduct interviews with a representative sample of clients, family members, and local community members. The key question should be \"What can the treatment provider do to be more responsive to community needs?\" The survey process can be as simple as a questionnaire, or it can involve interviews or focus groups with key people in touch with community issues. It can also be helpful to obtain a small but representative sample of community members at large to determine their level of awareness of the services available and their perceptions of the treatment agency based on what they have heard. Information from people not in treatment can be revealing and could suggest areas in which publicity is needed to counter misinformation. Likewise, facilitators can develop, from the information gathered, a map that highlights where people go to receive various services (Center for Substance Abuse Prevention 1995). The agency could also ask their sources of referrals, such as faith- based organizations, community agencies, or primary c are physicians, whether they are referring clients to the agency, and if not, why. It is important to know who is not walking through the door. 86 Chapter 4 \u2014Pursuing Organizational C ultural Competence instrument(s) should be administered by an objective third party, such as a consultant or a member of the cultural competence commit-tee. Staff members should be asked about their attitudes toward cultural issues with the un- derstanding that their attitude s are not neces- sarily indicative of the degree to which the staff mirrors the cultural groups served. In soliciting community feedback, the more credibility the organ ization has in the com- munity, the higher the return rate will likely be. The lower the credibility, the more the organization needs to re assure respondents that it intends to listen to, and act on, what it hears. If many survey forms are to be distrib- uted, the organization could consider hiring students or community members on a tempo-rary basis to make follow -up or reminder calls. Step 6: Compile and analyze the data. The process of reviewing and assessing data should be overseen by the cultural competence com-mittee. Basic data analysis procedures should be used to ensure the accuracy of result s and credibility of reported information. For most well-designed instruments, there are relatively simple and appropriate ways to present data. All avai lable data should be assembled in a report, along with interpretive comments and recommended action steps. The report should note areas of strength and needed improve- ment and should offer possible explanations for any shortcomings. For example, if the community is 20 percent African American, but only 2 percent of the agency 's clientele are African American , what are some possible explanations for this group 's apparent un- deruse of services? It is also particularly im-portant to share results with those who participated in the assessment process. Find-ings should be made available to staff, clients, community m embers, boards, and manag ers. This increases overall sense of ownership in the assessment and cultural competence devel- opment process and in implementing the changes that will be made based on the find-ings of and the prior ities esta blished through this ass essment. Step 7: Establish priorities for the organiza- tion and incorporate these priorities into the cultural competence plan . After obtaining the results of the self -assessment process, the organization \u2014including boards, cultural competence committee, community stake- holders , and staff members\u2014need s to estab- lish realistic priorities b ased on the current needs of clients and the community. Signifi- cant consideration should be given to the level of influence any given priority cou ld have in effecting organizational change that will improve culturally responsive services. Some priorities will require more planning to im- plement and can involve more financial and staff resources, wh ereas other priorities will be easier to implement from the outset (e.g., hiring culturally competent counselors who are bilingual versus translating intake and program forms). Therefore, long - and short - range priorities should be established at the same time to maintain the momentum of chan ge in the organization. Step 8: Devel op a system to provide ongoing monitoring and performance improvement strategies. Similar to the clinical assessment process with clients, the organizational self - assessment is only valuable if it provides guid-ance, d etermines direction and priorities, and facilitates action . Assessment is not a one -time activity . It is important to continue monitoring to identify barriers that m ay impede the full implementation of the cultural competence plan, to evaluate progress and performance, and to identify new service needs. Establishing a system to monitor an organization 's cultural responsiveness equips it with the information necessary to formulate strategies to meet new demands and to continuously improve q uality of services. 87 Improving Cultural Competence Language Services Task: Plan for Lan guage Services Proactively An organization must anticipate the need for language services and the resources required to support these services, including funding, staff composition, program materials, and transla-tion services. A ssessing the language needs of the population to be served is essential. Upon determination, the foremost task is letting clients with limited English proficiency know that language services are available as a basic right for a client. Treatment providers need to plan for the provision of linguistically appro-priate services, beginning with actively recruit- ing bicultural and bilingual clinical staff, establishing translation services and contracts, and developing treatment materials prior to client contact. Although it is not realistic to anticipate the language ne eds of all potential clients, it is important to develop a list of available resources and program procedures that staff members can fo llow when a client 's language needs fall outside the organization 's usual client demographics (The Joint Commission 20 09). Planning for language services is crucial, and the need for these services must be assessed by staff members who have initial contact with clients, their family members, and/or other individuals in their support systems (American Psychological Associat ion [APA] 1990, 2002). If frontline administrative and clinical staff members are bilingual, the initial screening and assessment process can begin uninter-rupted . If this is not the case, receptionists or frontline clinical staff members should at least be familiar with some rudimentary phrases in the preferred languages of their client base . The conversation can be scripted so that they can convey their limited ability to speak the client 's language, obtain contact information and inquire about language service needs, and inform the client that someone who can speak the language more fluently will be made avail-able to facilitat e the initial screening process. Most importantly, procedures should be in place to provide pretreatment contact and follow -up in the client 's language to bridge the gap between initial co ntact and subsequent arrangement of language services. Written and illustrated materials or a video about the program in the languages spoken by the client population should be available to answer frequently asked questions. All materi-als given to clients, family members, and community members should be availab le in their primary languages. It is preferable to develop the materials initially in those languages rather than sim ply translating mate- rials from one language to another. Along with language, one should also consider the level of literacy of the group in question. Some clients may be functionally illiterate even in their native languages. Materials should graphically reflect the population served through pictures or photographs, using ethnic themes and traditional elements familiar to the target audience. Also, materials should be tested with the populations with whom they How To Inform Clients About Language Assistance Services Use language identification or \"I speak...\" cards. Post signs in regularly encountered lan-guages at all points of entry. Establish uniform procedures for timely, effective telephone communication be-tween staff members and persons with lim-ited English proficiency. Include statements about the services available and the right to free language as-sistance services in appropriate non -English languages in brochures, book lets, outreach materials, and other materials that are rou- tinely distributed to the public. Source: OMH 2000. 88 Chapter 4 \u2014Pursuing Organizational C ultural Competence will be used, perhaps through focus groups, to ensure that they communicate effectively. Task: Establish Practice and Training Guidelines for the Provision of Language Services Key issues to consider in implementing and overseeing language services within an organi-zation include staff monitoring of language proficiencies, selection of translators and interpreters , confidentiality issues, and train- ing needs. First, agencies need to assess lan- guage proficiencies among staff members and encourage them to learn a language relevant to the population served. At a minimum , staff members should acquire in the given language some basic terminology and phrases that are commonly used in the treatmen t setting. In recruiting and hiring translators and inter- preters , administrative staff members should consider experience, motivation, skill level, mastery of English, and fluency in the lan-guage in need of interpretation (OMH 2000; American Translators A ssociation 2011). Be aware, however, that there can be considerable variation in dialects and levels of proficiency within the language, and these must be de-termined in the selection process. To supple-ment hiring practices, administrative policies should provide a means for determining the credentials of any language services organiza- tions (Appendix F lists American Translators Association credentialing information). Other important hiring issues revolve around potential e thical dilemmas. In particular, care should be taken in using interpreters from the local community, which can create potential challenges with confidentiality and dual rela-tionships (e.g., the interpreter may also be client 's cousin or neighbor). Policies should place the burden on langua ge service providers to identify and disclose dual relationships to supervisors immediately and on supervisors to assess and determine the appropriateness of using certain translator. Once a selection has been made, a confidentiality agreement should be signed . Organizations need to provide information routinely to client s about their confidentiality rights in using language ser- vices. Implement ing a procedure for handling client grievances is also recommended. In planning for the use of language services, organizations should initially provide training for staff on how to incorporate these services and should familiarize translators and inter- preters with the clinical setting, terminology, behavioral expectations , and content related to behavioral health (see the \"Training Content for Language Service Personnel \" advice box on the next page ). The language of mental health and substance abuse services requires an additional degree of specialization. Experi-enced tran slators and interpreters who are unfamiliar with concepts of addiction , illness, and recovery could convey information ade- quately from a linguistic perspective but not accurately convey the intent or meaning of clinically oriented information or dialog . Various training approaches can be used, including role -plays mirroring intakes, evalua- tions, and counseling sessions; indirect expo-sure to client sessions through audio or video recordings of sessions or viewing from an observation room; direct observation by sitting in on a session, if appropriate; and consulta- tion with other experienced language service providers and clinical staff. Using other expe- rienced translators and interpreters for train-ing and/or for consultations, as well as sharing experiences in a peer support format , can be very beneficial for new language service providers . 89 Improving Cultural Competence Organizations must also create opp ortunities for translators and interpreters to inquire about and clarify clinical content and mean-ing. Language service providers often attempt to convey terminology or concepts that do not exactly match the words or meaning of the client 's language or culture by becoming more descriptive, taking longer to deliver the mes- sage in an effort to match the intent of a specific word or concept in English. Workforce and Staff Development Task: Develop Staff Recruitment, Retention, and Promotion Strateg ies That Re flect the Populations Served To determine whether it adequately reflects the population it serves, an organization has to assess its personnel, including counselors, administrators, and board of directors. Ac-cording to a 10- year study that collected data on treatment admissions, racial and ethnic composition of treatment populations has not significantly changed. Racially diverse groups (excluding non -Latino Whites) represent approximately 40 percent of treatment admis-sions (Substance Abuse and Mental Heal th Services Administration [SAMHSA] 2011 c), yet 80 percent of counsel ors are non -Latino Whites (Duffy et al. 2004). In striving to improve cultural responsiveness, staff compo-sition should be a major strategic planning consideration . As much as possible, t he staff should mirror the client population. Nevertheless, providers should avoid hiring \"ethnic representatives, \" which means hiring a single person from an ethnic or cultural group and expecting him or her to serve as the cul-tural resource on that group for the entire staff. This can be burdensome, if not offensive, to that person. Belonging to a group does not ensure cultural responsiveness toward, knowledge of, or skill in working with mem-bers of that group, nor does it guarantee that the person culturally identifies with that cul- tural group or its heritage. Hiring ethnic Advice to Clinical Supervisors and Administrators: Training Content for Language Service Personnel Translators and interpreters need additional training to work in a clinical setting. Initial training should include: General mental health and substance abuse information. Introduction to behavioral health services. Familiarity with interviewing and assessment questions, instruments, and format s. Legal and ethical issues, including confi-dentiality and professional boundaries. Relevant programmatic policies and pro-cedures. Review of program materials, forms, ques-tionnaires, and other written clinical mate-rials that clients receive during the course of treatment. Knowledge of technical vocabulary relevant to the behavioral health field. Emphasis on the importance of accurate interpretation and translation without addi-tions or omissions. Behavioral and professional guidelines on how to manage potential client reac tions in and outside the session (e.g., outward dis-plays of anger or hostility; grief reactions; disclosing information to the translator with a request to keep it a secret from clinical staff; discomfort with translator's biologi-cal, social, and/or demogr aphic character- istics, such as gender orientation, age, or socioeconomic status ). Importance of cultural sensitivity in dialog between translator and client, including how questions are asked. General guidelines on how to handle personal issues that can be elicited by par-ticipation in the intake, assessment, and treatment processes, including identifica-tion with similar clinical issues (e.g., sub-stance use patterns, family dynamics, traumatic events, emotional distress). 90 Chapter 4 \u2014Pursuing Organizational C ultural Competence representatives undermines the expansion of diversity at all organizational levels and the importance of developing opportunities for all staff members to gain awarenes s and improve their ability to effectively work with clients. Some organizations struggle to find multicul-tural staff members that represent the diversity of their communit ies and client eles. If re- cruitment is perceived as an immediate short - term goal, ong oing difficulties are likely in hiring, promoting, and retaining a diverse staff. Instead, recruitment strategies need to em-brace a more comprehensive and long -term approach that includes internships, marketing to those interested in the field at an early age, mentoring programs for clinical and adminis-trative roles, support networks, educational assistance, and training opportunities. Task: Create Training Plans and Curricula That Address Cultural Competence The primary purpose of training is to increase cultural competence in the delivery of services, beginning with outreach and extending to continuing care services that support behav- ioral health. Training should increase staff self-awareness and cultural knowledge, review culturally responsive policies and procedures, and improve culturally responsive clinical skills (Anderson et al. 2003; Brach and Fraser 2000; Lie et al. 2011). The organization should be prepared to offer relevant professional d evel- opment experiences consistent with counselors' personal goals and assigned responsibilities as well as the organization 's goals for culturally responsive services. Board members, volun- teers, and interpreters should all receive ap-propriate training. A professional development training plan details the frequency, content, and schedule for staff training and continuing education. Be-cause becoming culturally competent is a process, training and support for engaging in culturally responsive services can be more appropriate when delivered across a period of time involving follow -up sessions rather than through a single session . Outcome research that evaluat es the effectiveness of cultural competence training materials, format, and content in mental health services, including treatment for substance use disorders (Bhui et al. 2007; Lie et al. 2010), is limited . Nonethe- less, numerous resources have suggested that effective cultura l training does feature certain qualities (Exhibit 4 -5). Sometimes, staff members will express re- sistance to participation in training activities aimed at promoting cultural competence \u2014 they may feel forced to learn about cultural competence , or they may feel unable to take the time away from their clients to attend the \"Improving the workforce to provide competent services to diverse populations goes far beyond merely increasing the number of individuals from each of the respective groups. While this is clearly an important strategy, there is a need not only to increase the numbers but also to improve the quality of training for all clinicians, regardless of their racial, ethnic, cultural, or linguistic background. This also includes the necessity to recruit, train, and support interpreters. \" (Hoge et al. 2007, p. 192). \"The learning objectives of a professional development program should include awareness - and knowledge -based objec- tives and skills -based objectives that motivate students to explore personal perspectives and multiple worldviews, understand and embrace culturally com- petent health promotion strategies, and engage in self -directed competency development .\" (Perez and Luquis 2008, p. 178). 91 Improving Cultural Competence trainings. Others might object on the grounds that they treat everyone equally, thus ignoring their own cultural blindness. The organization 's leadership needs to address staff reluctance and concerns regarding train- ing through initial education on the rationale for cultural competence. Assume that staff members are invested in creating the best opportunities for their clients to achieve suc-cess, and use this premise to introduce the need for training centered on cultur ally re- sponsive care. Some staff members may re- spond to incentives or pre determined objectives and criteria reflected in empl oyee performance evaluations. O thers may be more motivated by opportunities that arise from the organization 's commitment to cultur ally re- sponsive services or by other factors, such as specialized training and supervision , the Exhibit 4 -5: Qualities of Effective Cultural Competence Training The qualifications of the trainer, the selection of training strategies, a nd the use of reputable training curricula are extremely important in developing culturally competent staff and responsive services. The following concepts should be considered in the development and implementation of cultural training: Cultural training should begin with educating new staff members about the organization 's vision, values, and mission as related to culturally responsive services. Orientation should address the demographic composition of clientele, policies and procedures for cultural and linguistic ser- vices, counseling and performance expectations for assessment, treatment planning, and deliv-ery of culturally responsive services . Before developing and initiating a training plan for culturally responsive services, ask staff mem-bers about th eir training needs specific to the cultural groups that they serve. Receptivity will likely increase if managers and administrators involve clinical staff in the planning process rather than assuming that they know exactly what staff members need regarding cultural training. Training should occur across time, and a training plan should detail how to provide training for new employees. Too often, trainings occur at one time, ignoring the complexity of cultural groups and suggesting that one training session is sufficient to achieve cultural competence. Cultural competence evolves from ongoing professional development. Training should incorporate diverse learning strategies, including experiential learning and cultural immersion when appropriate (e.g., partic ipation in community activities, role -plays, case presentations). Training should be experientially based and process oriented, allowing self-reflection as part of the training and assigning self- reflection activities between training sessions (see the how -to box on self -reflection on the next page) . Training should provide information that is practice - or research -based to ensure that partici - pants see it as reputable and clinically sound. Training should create a welcoming, nonjudgmental, and professional atmosphere in which staff members, regardless of race, ethnicity, or cultural group, have the freedom and safety to ex-plore their own beliefs and to learn about other cultural groups. Training efforts should not scapegoat mainstream cultural groups or ma ke general statements about specific racial or ethnic groups without noting that there are many cultural sub groups within a given racial or ethnic group \u2014often characterized by, but not limited to, geographic location, socioeconomic status, or educational levels. Participation guidelines should be clarified for each training. Training should be conducted by an interdisciplinary, multicultural training team that is experi-enced in training and well versed in cultural competence. Trainers should allow time for staff members to ask questions and process the presented materi-als and experiential exercises, and they should use staff questions and exercises to explore and correct misperceptions in a nonjudgmental manner.

Opportunities for cultural competence train-ing abound. National organizations , agencies dedicated to multicultural learning, academic institutions, government agencies, and infor- mation clearinghouses offer training or have information about training opportunities and curricula on cultural competence on their Web sites. In addition to OMH guidelines on staff education and training ( Exhibit 4 -6), guide- lines are availab le from psychologi cal and counseling associations (APA 2002). To re-view sample training modules, see Cultural Competence for Health Administration and Public Health (Rose 2011). Task: Provide Culturally Congruent Clinical Supervision Little research is available that measures cul- tural competence among clinical supervisors or evaluates the effects of supervision on cultural competence among counselors (Colistra and Brown -Rice 2011; Constantine and Sue 2005). Not much is known about the effectiveness of clinical supervision in enhancing culturally competent behavior among counselors, How To Engage in Self-Reflection : A Tool for Counselor Training and Supervision Ask participants to preselect three clients whom they are currently counseling and will likely continue to counsel prior to the next training or supervision session. Selection should be based on clients' diversity in age, race, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, and/or geographic loca-tion. After each participant has selected three clients (remind participants not to disclose actual client identity if this is an external training outside of the agency), ask them to keep a self- reflection journal wherein the number of entries coincide with each client session until the next training. Partic- ipants should write about their internal process, including reactions such as feelings, thoughts, or behaviors during the session that relate to the influence of culture. For example: Identify racial, ethnic, and cultural si milarities and differences between you and your client. Explain how your cultural and clinical worldviews influence your dialog, treatment planning, and expectations of yourself and your client in the session. Describe assumptions that you have learned to make about your client's specific race, ethnicity, or culture(s). Even if you think these assumptions, beliefs, or biases do not play a role in your current counsel-ing relationship and approach, discuss how they could influence your counseling. Provide a s pe- cific example. Describe the feelings that you have about your client. How do these feelings relate to your client's racial, ethnic, or cultural identity? Explain the differences and similarities in worldviews between you and your client. Discuss how your and your client's beliefs about health, healing, disease, and addiction differ. Describe how your client's experience with discrimination, oppression, and prejudice could influence his/her current level of distress, psychological functioning, and response to treatment. Explore how you attend to your client's worldview in each session. Describe a misunderstanding or erroneous counseling response during a counseling session that appears related to differences in cultural identification, values, or behavior. Identify cultural knowledge that you must obtain to gain a better understanding of your client. Discuss the most important lessons that you have learned from your client. \"It takes time and energy to work through significant changes, whether in the work- place or in our personal lives. Many times, resistance to change is a natural reaction of people trying to understand what is expec ted of them and how the change will impact their lives .\" (Addiction Technology Transfer Center 2004, p. 28) 93 Improving Cultural Competence although some research with a multicultural focus has measured counselor self -efficacy after receiving supervision and has examined the dynamics of supervi see-supervisor rela- tionships. Even though educational institu-tions have developed curricula and standards to reinforce the need for a multicultural per-spective in training, many clinical supervisors lack sufficient training in this area (e.g., avoid cultur al topics in supervision, have difficulty giving culturally appropriate consultations or direction, fail to guide/reinforce timely i m- plementation of policies or procedures that support culturally responsive services with their supervisees) . This can significantly im- pede organizations attempting to introduce or improve culturally responsive clinical services. It is essential for organization s to provide counselors with clinical supervisors who are culturally aware, have engaged in multicultural training, and model culturally competent behaviors in clinical supervision s essions (e.g., allowing or engaging in discussions centered on race, ethnicity, and cultural groups in the session). Clinical supervision is the glue that Advice to Clinical Supervisors: Culturally Competent Clinical Supervision Supported by a review of research on multicultural clinical supervision, Miville et al. (2005) suggest that clinical supervisors gain awareness of and assess: Their own racial, ethnic, and cultural identities and attitudes and those of their supervisees. Their own knowledge base, strengths, and weaknesses and those of their supervisees. Racial, ethnic, and cultural issues that generate reactions in supervisors and in supervisees. Current engagement in professional development activities that support culturally responsive practices (see the professional development advice box on the next page). Exhibit 4 -6: OMH Staff Education and Training Guidelines Only general agreement exists as to what constitutes an acceptable cultural competence curriculum. OMH (2000) recommends tailoring curriculum topics to the roles and responsibilities of trainees and the specific needs of populations served over time but suggests that training should at least address: The effects of cultural differences between counselors and clients/consumers on clinical and other workforce encounters, such as the therapeutic alliance. The elements of effective communication among staff members and clients/consumers from diverse cultural groups who use different languages, including how to work with interpreters and telephone language services. Strategies for resolving racial, ethnic, or cultural conflicts between staff members and clients. The organization's policies and procedures for written language access, including how to gain access to interpreters and translated written materials. Parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that address services for clients with limited English profi-ciency. The organization's complaint or grievance proc edures. The effects of cultural differences on health promotion and disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and supportive care. The impact of poverty and socioeconomic status, race and racism, ethnicity, and sociocultural factors on access to care, service use, quality of care, and health outcomes. Differences in the clinical management of diseases and conditions indicated by differences in the race or ethnicity of clients. The effects of cultural differences among clients/consumers and staff member s on health out- comes, client satisfaction, and treatment planning. Source: OMH 200 0. Adapted from material in the public domain. 94 Chapter 4 \u2014Pursuing Organizational C ultural Competence reinforces culturally competent behavior, and it is often the only avenue of ongoing clinical training and follow -up after specific workshops or trainings are offered by the organization. Clinical supervisors should adopt a multicul- tural framework to guide the supervision process (e.g., Sue 's [2001] multidimensional model for developing cultural competence). Endorsement of a model for develop ing and enhancing cultural competence helps both supervisor s and supervisees understand how to address cultural issues in supervision and pursue personal and professional development that supports culturally responsive clinical services. (For a specific example, see Field and colleagues ' [2010] Latina -Latino multicultural developmental supervisory model.) The model guide s supervision and reinforces the premise that cultural variables influence each aspect of supervision: the relationship between supervi-sors and supervisee s, the supervisors' and supervisees' perception s and assessment s of client s' presenting issue s, the interactions between supervisees and their client s, and the treatment recommendations and direction s that evolve from supervision. Task: Evaluate Staff Performance on Culturally Congruent and Complementary Attitudes, Knowledge, and Skills Organizations committed to endorsing and implementing culturally responsive services need policies and procedures that reflect this commitment in job descriptions and staff evaluations across all levels of the organiza-tion. By incorp orating specific goals, How To Discuss Professional Development in Multicultural Counseling This tool facilitates supervis ee-supervisor discussions surrounding professional development activi- ties that promote cultural competence. Supervisors can ask supervisees to review the list and check off activities that they have engaged in recently or in the past several months . Superv isors can then use the completed exercise as a starting point for gaining more specific information on activities endorsed by supervisees. Even if supervisees check off no items, reviewing the list reinforces activi-ties that build cultural competence. Materials needed: A printed copy of the checklist and a pen or pencil. Instructions: Mark off the activities you have engaged in during the past month and/or 6 months. Past Past 6 month months ____ ____ I recognized a prejudice I have about certain people. ____ ____ I talked to a colleague about a cultural issue. ____ ____ I sought guidance about a cultural issue that arose in therapy. ____ ____ I attended a multicultural training seminar. ____ ____ I attended a cultural event. ____ ____ I attended an event in which most other people weren 't of my race. ____ ____ I reflected on my racial identity and how it affects my work with cli ents. ____ ____ I read a chapter or an article about multicultural issues. ____ ____ I read a novel about a racial group other than my own. ____ ____ I sought consultation or supervision about multicultural issues. ____ ____ I talked to a friend/associate about how our racial differences affect our relationship. ____ ____ I challenged a racist remark \u2014my own or someone else 's.

Organizational Infrastructure Task: Plan Long -Range Fiscal Support of Cultural Competence An organization 's commitment to providi ng culturally responsive treatment services will only succeed if resources are consistently dedicated to supporting the plan. Realistical-ly, treatment program fund s may be insuffi- cient to initially meet the goals outlined in the organization 's self -assessm ent. More often than not, the committee, executive staff, and board will have to prioritize the specific changes that are financially feasible. However, this necessity does not preclude the organiza-tion from soliciting help from the communi-ty, finding crea tive and inexpensive ways to make organizational changes, and using strategic and financial planning to build resources designated for culturally responsive services. Task: Create an Environment That Reflects the Populations Served The self -assessment pro cess should include an environmental review of the organization 's physical facilities in which barriers to access are examined. The plan should address iden-tified deficits. For example, signage should be written in all primary languages spoken by the clien ts served; it should be written at an appropriate level of literacy in those lan-guages. When possible, signs should use pictures and graphics to replace written in-structions. The design of the facility, includ- ing use of space and d\u00e9cor, should be inviting, comfortable, and culturally sensitive. The plan should establish how to make facilities more accessible and culturally appropriate. In addition, the organization should create an environment that reflects the culture(s) of its clients not only within the facility , but through business practices, such as using local and community vendors. Task: Develop Outreach Strategies To Improve Access to Care The best -laid plans for providing culturally competent treatment are futile if clients cannot access treatment. Providers should develop outreach plans for diverse ethnic and Advice to Administrators and Clinical Supervisors: Culturally Responsive Performance Evaluation Criteria Cultural competence is measured by the degree to which counselors, administrators, and other staff members engage in observable actions and attitudes that reflect cultural responsiveness. Following are examples of descriptive evaluation criteria that address a few aspects of culturally responsive behavior: Engages in ongoing self- analysis to identify and address personal and cultural biases. Actively seeks to view life through the eyes of others and, through doing so, develops a greater level of sensitivity for the values and life challenges of other groups. Participates in hands- on training opportunities and seeks practice and feedback that build toward mastery of responsive needs assessment techniques. Seeks opportunities to engage in cross -cultural activities and interactions. 96 Chapter 4 \u2014Pursuing Organizational C ultural Competence Advice to Administrators: Improving Outreach and Access to Care Whenever it is not feasible to provide behavioral health services in the neighborhoods or communi- ties where they are needed, treatment providers should consider the following: Referring clients to c ommunity resources: Ensure that all counselors and referr al sources know where to refer individuals for culturally appropriate community services. Individuals should not have to \"bounce around\" through the system seeking care that is already difficult to access. Have culturally and linguistically appropriate bro chures available that describe community ser- vices, eligibility, and the referral process. Collaborating with other community services: Collaboration with other community -based organizations is essential to compensate for the limitations faced by any single agency. Be-havioral health service providers can reach larger numbers of underserved populations by team-ing with others who have complementary missions and, at times, greater funding, such as other behavioral health agencies and programs dealing with wel fare-to-work services, homelessness, or HIV/AIDS. Additional collaboration to increase use includes sending culturally competent counselors to work at another agency or community group on at least a part -time basis, training community members or other agency personnel to provide brief interventions or referral ser-vices, and supporting the establishment of mutual -help groups with translated/adapted litera- ture in neighborhood locations. Co-locating services (creating a one -stop facility): Co -locati ng with other agencies is often highly desirable, as it can facilitate connections among various community services that clients need and provide an easy central location to access these services (e.g., a substance abuse intensive outpatient treatment program, a community health service agency, and a com-munity outpatient mental health program offered at one location). For culturally diverse people, the process of accessing services across agencies can be complex because of the need to obtain linguistically and culturally appropriate services and to overcome other barriers, such as eco- nomic challenges, issues surrounding eligibility, or the cumbersome repetition of completing forms for each agency. An effective one- stop facility ensures close coordination bet ween each agency that participates while also ensuring client confidentiality. Co -location with a community - based organization that already has solid, positive visibility in the community and a culturally competent workforce can help improve the outreach a nd treatment efforts of behavioral health organizations that have had difficulty connecting with the communities that they serve. Eliciting support from the community and employing outreach workers: It is often easier and more persuasive for people who abuse substances or need mental health services to receive in-formation and be encouraged to seek treatment by persons who are ethnically similar to them and speak the same language as they do. This is especially important for new immigrants, who do not yet k now their way around the new country and could be unsure of whom they can trust. When possible, outreach workers should be of similar cultural origin as the population being served and should be familiar with the community where they are working. This allo ws them to explain the advantages of treatment in culturally appropriate ways, speak the appropriate lan-guage or dialect, address the concerns of community members, and respect clients' priorities and issues. Outreach efforts can forge connections with imp ortant members of the community who encourage people with mental and substance use disorders and their families to seek treatment. These efforts are particularly important with new immigrants who may face legal and language barriers or may have a limited u nderstanding of contemporary medicine and treatment possibilities. For example, lay people trained as promotores de salud (promoters of health) have been successful in reaching Latino migrant workers (Azevedo and Bogue 2001). Supplying support services: Providers can use a variety of means to make treatment accessible to culturally diverse clients. One strategy is to provide transportation from clients' neighbor-hoods to the provider site. In many areas, people must travel long distances to receive culturall y appropriate services. This limits the number of people able to receive treatment, especially (Continued on the next page.) 97 Improving Cultural Competence racial communities, particularly those wh ose members may find it difficult to seek services on their own . For example, see Community - Defined Solutions for Latino Mental Health Care Disparities (Aguilar -Gaxiola et al. 2012). From the outset, effective outreach and im-proved access to care should include formal and informal contacts with community organ- izations, spiritual leaders, and media. Providers can learn from these contacts about the behav-ioral health concerns in the community, spe-cial considerations for wo rking with members of the community, cultural impediments to treatment, and cultural resources t o aid treat- ment and recovery. Unfortunately, many providers lack sufficient funding to offer the level of outreach servi ces needed by the communities they serve. Be-cause they are overwhelmed already, the issue of outreach to underserved populations is often seen as a low priority, which can cause these providers to send people in need of treatment away , disappointed and disheart- ened. However, thoughtful and strategic use of community resources can result in more mem- bers of underserved populations receiving the treatment they need and deserve . At mini- mum, outreach enables provider s to offer accurate information and referral t o appropri- ate mutual -help or community group s. Regarding fiscal planning and funding op- portunities, some HHS initiatives support outreach through integrated care . For exam- ple, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Center for Integrated Health Solutions (CIHS) promotes the devel- opment of integrated primary and behavioral health services to better address the needs of individuals with mental health and substance use concerns. Resources are available to h elp physicians screen for behavioral health prob-lems and refer individuals to appropriate treatment. SAMHSA 's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment has a T argeted Capacity Expansion Program that offers grants in support of ou treach to specific populations. The chall enges outlined in this chapter are burdensome but can be overcome. Many organizations have been able to develop cul-tural competence over time (for a historical perspective of one organization 's journey, see Exhibit 4 -7). A well -defined and organized plan, coupled with a consistent o rganizational commitment , will enable organizations to initiate and accomplish the tasks necessary to promote culturally responsive services. Advice to Administrators: Improving Outreach and Access to Care (continued) individuals with incomes too low to support travel. In addition, lengthy travel requirements re- duce the chances of a person in the early stages of change with low motivation reaching a coun-selor who can help increase motivation and move the person toward recovery. Other strategies are the inclusion of child care and language services within the program. In addition, home- based outpatient treatment and telemedicine strategies can work, particularly for rural populations. Selecting culturally appropriate strategies to provide community education: Certa in forms of outreach are more likely to be successful in some populations than in others. For example, in Chinese and Korean communities, community fairs are often an excellent way to publicize treat-ment services. Notices in community newspapers, on radio and television channels, on billboards, and in stores in the languages spoken locally can reach other potential clients. The person chosen to deliver or represent the messages in such situations should be someone familiar with the community and likely to inspire trust. Some agencies serving American Indian people have expe-rienced success in publishing a monthly newsletter that is sent to individual American Indians and agencies serving the Native American community. 98 Chapter 4 \u2014Pursuing Organizational C ultural Competence Exhibit 4 -7: Cultural Competence Initiative Across Time in One Organization Late 1980s The executive director and board endorse the need to pursue cultural competence and outline agency goals. An agency cultural competence committee forms to help develop policies, procedures, and a cultural competence plan. Community and client representation is established. A sen ior staff member is hired to oversee the organization's efforts to diversify staff. Early 1990s The executive director, board of directors, and advisory board endorse the need to pursue culturally competent practices throughout the organization. General goals are established and senior management and staff members begin educating the staff on cultural competence. Mid 1990s Culturally competent clinical standards are developed and implemented. Initial vision, mission, and value statements are modified to include cultural competence. Training for management and clinical supervisors incorporates cultural competence in practice. The agency begins a community cultural assessment and introduces a client satisfaction survey to gain feedback on current implementation of culturally responsive practices and to guide fu-ture direction and focus. Ongoing clinical supervisor training on cultural competence is initiated. The cultural competence committee develops recommendations for job descriptions and perfor - mance app raisals to reflect cultural competence skills and responsibilities. Late 1990s Individuals and families who receive services are now involved in focus groups, orientations, and trainings. Partnerships with other agencies to promote cultural competence throughout the community are more strongly encouraged. A curriculum to train all staff members in the foundations of cultural competence is developed and implemented. 2000s Across the organization, clinical and administrative programs engage in cultural compet ence review and goal -setting. The mission statement is redefined to formally acknowledge the organization's values of respect for cultural differences, recovery, and advocacy. 99 John, 27, is an American Indian from a Northern Plains Tribe. He recently entered an outpatient treatment program in a midsized Midwestern city to get help with his drinking and subsequent low mood. John moved to the city 2 years ago and has mixed feelings about living there, but he does not want to return to the reserva-tion because of its lack of job opportunities. Both John and his counselor are concerned that (with the exception of his girlfriend, Sandy, and a few neighbors) most of his current friends a nd coworkers are \"drinking buddies. \" John says his friends and family on the reservation would support his recovery\u2014including an uncle and a best friend from school who are both in recovery\u2014but his contact with them is infrequent. John says he entered trea tment mostly because his drinking was interfering with his job as a bus mechanic and with his relationship with his girlfriend. W hen the counselor asks new group members to tell a story about what has brought them to treatment, John explains the specific event that had motivated him. He describes having been at a party with so me friends from work and watching one of his coworkers give a bowl of beer to his dog. The dog kept drinking until he had a seizure, and John was disgusted when p eo- ple laughed. He says this event was \"like a vision; \" it showed him that he was being treated in a similar fashion and that alcohol was a poison. When he first began drinking, it was to deal with bore-dom and to rebel against strict parents whose Pentecostal Christian beliefs f orbade alcohol. However, he says this vision showed him that drinking was controlling him for the benefit of others. Later, in a one -on-one session, John tells his counselor that he is afraid treatment won 't help him. He knows plenty of people back 5 Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups IN THIS CHAPTER Introduction Counseling for African and Black Americans Counseling for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Other Pacific Islanders Counseling for Hispanics and Latinos Counseling for Native Americans Counseling for White Americans 101 Improving Cultural Competence home who have been through treatment and still drink or use drugs. Even though he doesn 't consider himself particularly tradition- al, he is especially concerned that there is nothing \"Indian \" about the program ; he dis- likes that his treatment plan focuses more on changing his thinking than addressing his spiritual needs or the fact that drinking has been a poison for his whole community. John's counselor recognizes the importance of connecting John to his community and, if possible, to a source of traditional healing. After much research, his counselor is able to locate and contact an Indian service organiza- tion in a larger city nearby. The agency puts him in touch with an older woman from John's Tribe who resides in that city. She, in turn, puts the counselor in touch with another member of the Tribe who is in recovery and had been staying at her house. This man agrees to be John 's sponsor at local 12 -Step meetings. With John 's permission, the counse- lor arranges an initial family therapy session that includes his new sponsor, the woman who serves as a local \"clan mother, \" John's girl- friend, and, via telephone, John 's uncle in recovery, mother , and brother. With John 's permission and the assistance of his new sponsor, the counselor arranges for John and some other members of his treatment group to attend a sweat lodge, which proves valuable in helping John find some inner peace as well as giving his fellow group members some insight into John and his culture. To provide culturally responsive treatment, counselors and organizations must be commit- ted to gaining cultur al knowledge and clinical skills that are appropriate for the specific racial and ethnic groups they serve. Treatment pro-viders need to learn how a client 's identifica- tion with one or more cultural groups influences the client 's identity, patterns of subst ance use, beliefs surrounding health and healing, help -seeking behavior, and treatment expectations and preferences. Adopting Sue 's (2001) multidimensional model in developing cultural competence, this chapter identifies cultural knowledge and its relation ship to treatment as a domain that requires proficien-cy in clinical skills, programmatic develop-ment, and administrative practices. This chapter focuses on p atterns of substance use and co -occurring disorders (CODs) , beliefs abou t and traditions involving substance use, beliefs and attitudes about behavioral health treatment, assessment and treatment consider-ations, and theoretical approaches and treat-ment interventions across the major racial and ethnic groups in the United State s. Introduction Culture is a primary force in the creation of a person 's identity. C ounselors who are culturally competent are better able to understand and respect their clients' identities and related cultural ways of life . This chapter proposes strategies to engage clients of di verse racial and ethnic groups (who can have very differ-ent life experiences, values, and traditions) in treatment. The major racial and ethnic groups in the United States covered in this chapter are African Americans, Asian Americans (including Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders), Latinos, Native Americans (i.e., Alaska Natives and American Indians), and White Americans. In addition to providing epidemiological data on each group, the chap-ter discusses salient aspects of treatment for these racial/ethnic groups, drawing on clinical and researc h literature. This information is only a starting point in gaining cultural knowledge as it relates to behavioral health. Understanding the diversity within a specific culture, race, or ethnicity is essential; not all information presented in this chapter will apply to all individuals . The material in this chapter has a scientific basis, yet cultural beliefs, 102 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups Multidimensional Model for D eveloping Cultural Competence: Cultural Knowledge of Behavioral Health traditions, and practices change with time and are not static factors to consider in providing services for clients, families, or communities. Although these broad racial/ethnic categories are often used to describe diverse cultural groups, the differences between two members of the same racial/ethnic group can be greater than the differences between two people from different racial/ethnic groups (Lamont and Small 2008; Zuckerman 1998). It is not possi- ble to capture every aspect of diversity within each c ultural group . Behavioral health workers should acknowledge that there will be many individual variations in how people i nteract with their environments, as well as in how environment al context affects behavioral health. However, to provide a framework for understanding many diverse cultural groups, some generalizations are necessary; thus, broad categories are used to organize information in this chapter. Counselors are encouraged to learn as much as possible about the specific populations they serve. Sources listed in Appendix F provide additional information . Counseling for African and Black Americans According to the 2010 U.S. Census definition , African Americans or Blacks are people whose 103 Improving Cultural Competence origins are \"in any of the black racial groups of Africa \" (Humes et al. 2011, p. 3). The term includes descendants of African slaves brought to this country against their will and more recent immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean, and South or Central America (many individ-uals from these latter regions, if they come from Spanish -speaking cultural groups, iden- tify or are identified primarily as Latino). The term \"Black \" is often used interchangeably with African American, although sometimes the term \"African American \" is used specifi- cally to describe people whose families have been in this country since at least the 19 th century and thus have developed distinct African American cultural groups. \"Black \" can be a more inclusive term describing African Americans as well as more recent immigrants with distinct cultural backgr ounds. Beliefs About and Traditions Involving Substance Use In most African American communities, significant alcohol or drug use may be socially unacceptable or seen as a sign of weakness (Wright 2001), even in communities with limited resources, where the sale of such sub-stances may be more acceptable. Overall, African Americans are more likely to believe that drinking and drug use are activities for which one is personally responsible; thus, they may have difficulty accepting alcohol abuse/dependence as a disease (Durant 2005). Substance Use and Substance Use Disorders To date, there has not been much research analyzing differenc es in patterns of substance use and abuse among different groups of Blacks, but there are indications that some gender differe nces exist. For example, alcohol consumption among African American wom-en increases as they grow older, but Caribbean Black women report consistently low alcohol consumption as they grow older (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT ] 1999a ; Galvan and Caetano 2003). Rates of overall substance use among African Americans vary significantly by age. Several researchers have observed that despite Black youth being less likely than White American youth to use substances, as African Americans get older, they tend to use at rates comparable with those of White Americans (Watt 2008). This increase in substance use with age among Blacks is often referred to as a crossover effect. However, Watt (2008), in her analysis of 4 years of National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH ) data (1999-2002), found that when controlling for factors such as drug exposure, marriage, employment, education, income, and family/social support, the cross-over effect disappeared for Blacks ages 35 and older; patterns for drug and heavy alcohol use among Black and White American adults remained the same a s for Black and White American adolescents ( i.e., White Americans were significantly mor e likely to use substanc- es). Watt concludes that systemic issues, such as lower incomes and educat ion lev els, and other factors , such as lower marriage rates, contribute to substance use among Black adults. Additional research also suggests that exposure to discrimination increases willing-ness to use substances in African American youth and their paren ts (Gibbons et al. 2010). When comparing African Americans with other racial and ethnic groups, NSDUH data from 2012 suggest that they are somewhat more likely than White Americans to use illicit drugs and less likely than White Americans to use alcohol. They also appear to have a n inci- dence of alcohol and drug use disorders simi- lar to that seen in White Americans (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA] 201 3d). Crack cocaine use is more prevalent among Blacks 104 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups than White Americans or Latinos, whereas rates of abuse of methamphetamine, inhalants, most hallucinogens, and prescription drugs are lower (SAMHSA 2011a ). Phencyclidine use also appears to be a more serious problem, albeit affecting a relatively small group , among African Americans than among members of other racial/ethnic groups. There appear to be some other differences in how African Americans use substances com-pared with members of other racial/ethnic groups. For example, Bourgois and Schonberg (2007) o bserved that among people who inject- ed heroin in San Francisco, White Americans tended to administer the drug quickly whether or not they could find a vein, which led them to inject into fat or muscle tissue and resulted in a higher rate of abscesses. Howe ver, African Americans who injected heroin were more methodical and took the time to find a vein , even if it took multiple attempts. This , in turn, often resulted in using syringes that were already bloodied and increased their chances of contracting HIV /AIDS and other blood - borne diseases. African Americans who inject-ed heroin were significantly more likely to also use crack cocaine than were White Americans who injected heroin (Bourgois et al. 2006). African American patterns of substance use have changed over time and will likely contin- ue to do so. Based on treatment admission data, admissions of African Americans who injected heroin declined by 44 percent during a 12- year period, whereas admissions declined by only 14 percent among White Americans (Broz and Ouellet 2008). Additionally, during this period, the peak age for African Americans who injected heroin increased by 10 years, yet it decreased by 10 years for White Americans. This suggests that the decrease in injectable heroin use among African Americans was largely due to decreased use among younger individuals. Some preliminary evidence suggests that African Americans are less likely to develop drug use disorders following initiation of use (Falck et al. 2008), yet more research is needed to identify variables that influence the devel-opment of drug use disorders. Even though African Americans see m less likely than White Americans to develop alcohol use disorders, a number of older studies have found that they more frequently experience liver cirrhosis and other alcohol -related health problems (Caetano 2003; Polednak 2008). I n tracking 25 years of data, Polednak (2008) found that the magnitude of difference has decreased over time; n onetheless, health dispar- ities continue to exist for African Americans in terms of access to and quality of care, which can affect a number of health problems (Agency fo r Healthcare Research and Quality 2009; Smedley et al. 2003). Mental and Co -Occurring Disorders A number of studies have found biases that result in African Americans being overdiag-nosed for some disorders and underdiagnosed for others. African Americans are less likely than White Americans to receive treatment for anxiety and mood disorders, but they are more likely to receive treatment for drug use disorders (Hatzenbuehler et al. 2008). In one study evaluating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Af rican Americans in an outpatient mental health clinic, only 11 per-cent of clients had documentation referring to PTSD, even though 43 percent of the clients showed symptoms of PTSD (Schwartz et al. 2005). Black immigrants are less likely to be diagnosed wi th mental disorders than are Blacks born in the United States (Burgess et al. 2008; Miranda et al. 2005b ). African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and less likely to be diagnosed with affective disorders than 105 Improving Cultural Competence White Americans, even though multiple studies have found that rates of both disorders among these populations are comparable (Baker and Bell 1999; Bresnahan et al. 200 0; Griffith and Baker 1993; Stockdale et al. 2008; Strakowski et al. 2003 ). African Americans are about twice as likely to be diagnosed with a psychotic disorder as White Americans and more than three times as likely to be hospital-ized for such disorders. These differences in diagnosis are likely the result of clinician bias in evaluating symptoms (Bao et al. 2 008; Trierweiler et al. 2000 ; Trierweiler et al. 2006). Clinicians should be aware of bias in assessment with African Americans and with other racial/ethnic groups and should consid-er ways to increase diagn ostic accuracy by reducing biases. For an overview of mental health across populations, refer to Mental Health United States, 2010 (SAMHSA 2012a ). In some African American communities, incidence and prevalence of trauma exposure and PTSD are high, and substance use ap-pears to increase trauma exposure even further (Alim et al. 2006; Breslau et al. 1995; Curtis-Boles and Jenkins -Monroe 2000; Rich and Grey 2005). Black women who abuse sub-stances report high rates of sexual abuse (Ross- Durow and Boyd 2000). Trauma histo- ries can also have a greater effect on relapse for African American clients than for clients from other ethnic/racial groups (F arley et al. 2004). There are few integrated approaches to trau-ma and substance abuse that have been evalu-ated with African American clients, and although some have been found effective at reducing trauma symptoms and substance use, the extent of that effectiveness is not necessarily as great as it is for White Americans (Amaro et al. 2007; Hien et al. 2004; SAMHSA 2006). African Americans are less likely than White Americ ans to report lifetime COD s (Mericle et al. 2012). However, limited research indi- cates that, as with other racial groups, there are differences across African American groups in the screening and symptomatology of CODs. Seventy -four percent of African Amer icans who had a past -year major depressive episode were identified as also having both alcohol and marijuana use disorders (Pacek et al. 2012). Miranda et al. (2005b ) found that American - born Black women were more than twice as likely to be screened as possibly having depres-sion than African - or Caribbean -born Black women, but this could reflect, in part, differ-ences in acculturation (see Chapter 1). How-ever, research findings strongly suggest that cultural responses to some disorders, and possibly the rates of those disorders, do vary among different groups of Blacks. D ifferences do not appear to be simply reflections of differences in acculturation (Joe et al. 2006). For a review of African American health, see Hampton et al. (2010). Treatment Patterns African Americans may be less likely to re- ceive mental health services than White Americans. In the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Services Area study conducted during the 1980s, African Americans were less likely than White Americans to receive mental health services. However, at follow -up in the early 1990s, African American respondents were as likely as White Americans to receive such services, but they were much more likely to receive those services from general practi-tioners than from mental health specialists (Cooper -Patrick et al. 1999). Stockdale et al. (2008) analyzed 10 years of data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey; they found significant improvements in diag-nosis and care for mental disorders among African Americans in psychiatric settings 106 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups between 1995 and 2005, but they also found that disparities persisted in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders in primary care settings. Fortuna et al. ( 2010) suggest that persistent problems exist in the delivery of behavioral health s ervices, as eviden ced by lower retention rates for treating depression. Even among people who enter substance abuse treatment, African Americans are less likely to receive services for CODs. A study of administrative records from substance abuse and mental health treatment providers in New Jersey found that African Americans were significantly more likely than White Americans to have a n undetected co-occurring mental disorder, and, if detected, they were signifi- cantly less l ikely than White Americans or Latinos to receive treatment for that disorder (Hu et al. 2006). Among person s with sub- stance use disorders and co -occurring mood or anxiety disorders, Afri can Americans are significantly less likely than White Americans to receive services (Hatzenbuehler et al. 2008). African Americans who do receive services for CODs are more likely to obtain them through substance abuse treatment programs than mental healt h programs ( Alvidrez and Havassy 2005). According to the Treatment Episode Data Sets (TEDS) from 2001 to 2011, African American clients entering substance abuse treatment most often reported alcohol as their primary substance of abuse, followed by mari-juana. However, gender differences are evident, indicating that women report a broader range of substances as their primary substa nce of abuse than men do (SAMHSA, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality [CBHSQ], 2013). Most recent research sug-gests that African Americans are about as likely to seek and eventually receive substance abuse treatment as are White Americans (Hatzenbuehler et al. 2008; Perron et al. 2009; SAMHSA, CBHSQ 2011; Schmidt et al. 2006). D ata analyzed by Perron et al. (2009) indicate that among African Americans with lifetime diagnoses of drug use disorders, 20.8 percent had received some type of treatment, as defined broadly to include resources such as pastoral counseling a nd mutual- help group attendance. This made them more likely to have received treatment than White Ameri-cans (15.5 percent of whom received treat-ment) or Latinos (17.3 percent of whom received treatment) . Although data indicate that African Americans were less likely to receive services from private providers, they also indicate that African Americans were more likely to use more informal services ( e.g., pastoral counseling, mutual help). Although most major studies have found that race is not a significant factor in receiving treatment, African Americans report lengthier waiting periods, less initiation of treatment, more barriers to treatment participation (e.g., lack of childcare, lack of insurance, lack of knowledge about available services), and shorter lengths of stay in treatment than do White Americans (Acevedo et al. 2012; Brower and Carey 2003; 2001; Marsh et al. 2009; SAMHSA 2011 c; Schmidt et al. 2006). In SAMHSA 's 2010 NSDUH, 33.5 percent of African Americans who had a need for substance abuse treatment but did not receive it in the prior year reported that they lacked money or the insurance coverage to pay for it (SAMHSA, CBHSQ 2011). Economic disadvantage does leave many Africans Amer-icans uninsured; approximately 16.1 percent of non- Latino Blacks had no coverage in 2004 (Schiller et al. 2005). Likewise, some researchers have found that African Americans are less likely than White Americans to receive needed ser vices or an appropriate level of service (Alegria et al. 107 Improving Cultural Competence 2011; Bluthenthal et al. 2007; Marsh et al. 2009). For example, African Americans and Latinos are less likely than White Americans to receive residential treatment and are more likely to receive outp atient treatment, even when they present with more serious substance use problems (Bluthenthal et al. 2007). Other studies have found that African Americans with severe substance use or CODs were less likely to enter or receive treatment than White America ns with equally severe disorders (Schmidt et al. 2006, 2007). African Americans are overrepresented among people who are incarcerated in prisons and jails (for review, see Fellner 2009), and a sub-stantial number of those who are incarcerated (64.1 percent of jail inmates in 2002) have substance use disorders (Karberg and James 2005) and mental health problems (SAMHSA 2012a ). However, according to Karberg and (James 2005), African Americans with sub- stance dependence disorders who were in jail in 2002 were l ess likely than White Americans or Latinos to participate in substance abuse treatment while under correctional supervision (32 percent of African Americans participated compared with 37 percent of Latinos an d 45 percent of White Americans). In the 2010 TEDS survey, African Americans entering treatment were also less likely than Asian Americans, White Americans, Latinos, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, or American Indians in the same situation to be referred to treatment through the criminal justice sys tem (SAMHSA, CBHSQ 2012). Notwithstand-ing, African Americans a re more likely to be referred to treatment from criminal justice settings rather than self -referred or referred by other sources (Delphin -Rittmon et al. 2012) Beyond issues related to diagnosis and care that can prevent African Americans from accessing mental health services, research suggests that a lack of familiarity with the value and use of specialized behavioral health services among some African Americans may limit service use. Hines -Marti n et al. (2004) found a positive relationship between famili-arity and use of mental health services among African Americans. Additionally, factors such as social and familial prejudice s (Ayalon and Alvidrez 2007; Mishra et al. 2009; Nadeem et al. 2007) and fears relating to past abuses of African Americans within the mental health system (Jackson 2003) can contribute to the lack of acceptance and subsequent use of these services. An essential step in decreasing dis- parity in behavioral health services among African Americans involves conducting cul- turally appropriate mental health screening s and using culturally sensitive instruments and evaluation tools (Baker and Bell 1999). Beliefs and Attitudes About Treatment According to 2011 NSDUH data, African Americ ans were, next to Asian Americans, the least likely of all major ethnic and racial groups to state a need for specialized sub-stance abuse treatment (SAMHSA, CBHSQ 2013a ). Still, l ogistical barriers may pose a greater challenge for African Americans than for members of other major ra cial and ethnic groups. For example, 2010 NSDUH data regarding individuals who expressed a need for substance abuse treatment but did not receive it in the prior year indicate that African Americans were more likely than members of other major ethnic/racial groups to state that they lacked transportation to the program or that their insurance did not cover the cost of such treatment (SAMHSA 2011a ). African Americans experience several challenges in ac cessing behavioral health treatment, including fears about the therapist or therapeutic process and concerns about discrimination and costs (Holden et al. 2012; 108 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups Holden and Xanthos 2009; Williams et al. 2012). Longstanding suspicions regarding established healthcare institutions can also affect African Americans ' participation in , attitudes toward , and outcome s after treatment (for review, see Pieterse et al. 2012). H istorically, the mental health system has shown bias against African Americans, having been used in times past to control and punish them (Boyd -Franklin and Karger 2012; Jackson 2003). A fter controlling for socioeconomic factors , African Americans are significantly more likely to perceive the healthcare system as poor or fair and signifi-cantly m ore likely to believe that they have been discriminated against in healthcare settings (Blendon et al. 2007). Attitudes to-ward psychological services appear to become more negative as psychological distress in-creases (Obasi and Leong 2009). In many African American communities, there is a persistent belief that social and treatment services try to impose White American values, adding to the ir distrust of the treatment sys- tem (Larkin 2003; Solomon 1990). African Americans, even when receiving the same amount of services as White Americans, are less likely to be satisfied with those services (Tonigan 2003). However, recent evi dence suggest s that, once engaged, African American clients are at least as likely to continue partici- pation as members of other ethnic /racial groups (Harris et al. 2006). Because distrust of the healthcare system can make it more diffi-cult to engage African American clients ini-tially in treatment, Longshore and Grills (2000) recommend culturally congruent moti-vational enhancement strateg ies to address African American clients ' ambivalence about treatment services. Providers also need to craft culturally responsive health -related messages for African Americans to improve treatment engagement and effectiveness (Larkin 2003). Most importantly, providers need to demon-strate multicultural experience. In a study comparing outcomes among Black and White clients at community mental health centers, the only clinician factor that predicted more favorable outcomes was clinicians ' gener al experiences and relationships with people from racial/ethnic and cultural groups other than their own (Larrison et al. 2011). Treatment Issues and Considerations African American clients generally respond better to an egalitarian and authentic relation-ship with counselors (Sue 2001). Paniagua (1998) suggests that in the initial sessions with African American clients, counselors should develop a collaborative client -counselor rela- tionship. C ounselors should request personal information gradually rather t han attempting to gain information as quickly as possible, avoid information -gathering methods that clients could perceive as an interrogation, pace the session, and not force a data -gathering agenda (Paniagua 1998; Wright 2001). Coun-selors must also estab lish credibility with client s (Boyd- Franklin 2003). Next, counselors should establish trust. Self - disclosure can be very difficult for some clients because of their histories of experiencing racism and discrimination. These issues can be exacerbated in African American men whose experience of racism has been more severe or who have had fewer positive relationships with White Americans (Reid 2000; Sue 2001). Counselors, therefore, need to be willing to address the issue of race and to validate African Americ an clients ' experiences of racism and its reality in their lives, even if it differs from their own experiences (Boyd -Franklin 2003; Kelly and Parsons 2008). Moreover, racism and discrimination can lead to feelings of anger, anxiety, or depression. Often, these feelings are not specific to any given event ; 109 Improving Cultural Competence Exhibit 5 -1: Core Culturally Responsive Principles in Counseling African Americans According to Schiele (2000), culturally respon- sive counseling for African American clients involves adherence to six core principles: 1. Discussion of clients' substance use should be framed in a context that recognizes the totality of life experiences faced by client s as African American s. 2. Equality is sought in the therapeutic coun-selor -client r elationship, and counselors are less distant and more disclosing. 3. Emphasis is placed on the importance of changing one' s environment \u2014not only for the good of client s themselves , but a lso for the greater good of their communities . 4. Focus is placed on alterna tives to sub- stance use that underscore personal rituals, cultural traditions, and spiritual well -being. 5. Recovery is a process that involves gaining power in the forms of knowledge, spiritual insight, and community health. 6. Recover y is framed within a broade r con- text of how recovery contributes to the overall healing and advancement of the African American community. rather, they are pervasive (Boyd -Franklin et al. 2008). Counselors should explore with clients the psychological effects of racism and develop approaches to challenge internal negative messages that have been received or generated through discrimination and prejudice (Good-ing 2002). Additional methods that may enhance en-gagement and promote participation include peer-supported interventions and strategies that promote empowerment by emphasizing strengths rather than deficits (Paniagua 1998; Tondora et al. 2010; Wright 2001). It is important to explore with clients the strengths that have brought them this far. What personal, community, or family strengths have helped th em through difficult times? What strengths will support their recovery efforts ? Exhibit 5-1 gives an overview of core guiding principles in work- ing with African American clients. Theoretical Approaches and Treatment Interventions Research suggests that culturally congruent interventions are effective in treating African Americans (Longshore and Grills 2000; Longshore et al. 1998 a; Longshore et al. 1998b; 1999). Although there are conflicting results on the effectiveness of motivational interviewing among African American client s (Montgomery et al. 2011), some motivational interventions have been found to reduce sub-stance use among African Americans (Bernstein et al. 2005; Longshore and Grills 2000). Longshore and Grills (2000) describe a culturally specif ic motivational intervention for African Americans involving both peer and professional counseling that makes use of the core African American value of commu-nalism by addressing the ways in which the individual 's substance abuse affects his or her whole co mmunity. The motivational program affirms \"the heritage, rights, and responsibili- ties of African Americans...using interaction styles, symbols and values shared by members of the group \" (Longshore et al. 1998b , p. 319). So too, African American music, artwork, and food can help programs create a welcoming and familiar atmosphere, as is the case for other racial and ethnic groups when familiar cultural symbols appear in the clinical setting. Many of the interventi ons developed for substance abuse treatment services in general have been evaluated with populations that were at least partly composed of African American s; many of these interventions are as effective for African Americans as they are for White Americans (Milligan et al. 2004; To- nigan 2003). One intervention that appears to work better for African American (and Latino) clients than for White American client s\u2014 perhaps because it focuses on improving 110 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups client -counselor communication \u2014is node - link mapping (visual representation using information diagrams, fill -in-the-blank graph- ic tools, and client -generated diagrams or visual maps). This approach was associated with lower rates of substance use, better treat-ment attendance, and better counselor ratings of motiva tion and confidence among African Americans than among White Americans (Dansereau et al. 1996; Dansereau and Simpson 2009). In addition, cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) has certain distinct advantag es for African American clients; it fosters a collabo- rative relationship and recognizes that clients are experts on their own problems (Kelly and Parsons 2008). Maude -Griffin et al. (1998) compared CBT and 12 -Step facilitation for a group of mostly African American (80 per-cent) men who were homeless and found that CBT achieved significantly better abstinence outcomes, except among those who considered themselves very religious (these individuals had better outcomes with 12 -Step facilitation). Other i nterventions that use CBT principles have also been effectiv e with African American populations. For example, a number of studies have evaluated contingency management approaches with predominantly African American client populations, finding that this model was effective at reducing cocaine and illicit opioid use, improving employment outcomes for clients in methadone mainte-nance (Silverman et al. 2002; Silverman et al. 2007), reducing substance use during and after treatment, and improving self -reported quality of life (Petry et al. 2004 ; Petry et al. 2005; Petry et al. 2007). The Living in the Balance inter-vention, which uses psychoeducation and CBT techniques, has also been evaluated with a mostly African American sample and has been shown to improve treatment retention and reduce substance use (Hoffman et al. 1996). Another therapy that has been evaluated with African American clients and found effective is supportive-expressive psychotherapy, which reduces substance use and improves psycho-logical functioning for individuals in metha-done maintenance (Woody et al. 1987 ; Woody et al. 1995). Medications for substance abuse can also work well with African American clients. In one large study, African Americans were more likely than Latinos or White Americans to indicate that they found metha-done helpful (Gerstein et al. 1997), and in another study, they reported greater perceived quality of life as a result of participation in a methadone program (Geisz 2007). Schroeder et al. (2005) also reported that African Americans in a methadone program had significantly fewer adverse medical events (e.g., infections, gastrointestinal complaints) than did White American participants . African Americans who were being treated for cocaine depend-ence remained in treatment significantly longer than did other African Americans if they received disulfiram (Milligan et al. 2004). A review of cultural adaptations of evidence - based practices is given by Bernal and Domenech Rodriguez (2012). For an over- view of gender -specific treatment considera- tions for mental and substance use disorders among African Ame rican men and women, see Shorter -Gooden (2009). Family therapy African American clients appear more likely to stay connected with their fami lies through- out the course of their addiction. For instance, Bourgois et al. (2006) reported that in compar-ing African American and White American individuals who injected heroin, African Americans appeared to be more likely to maintain contact with their extended families. Some research also suggests that African Americans with substance use disorders are more likely to have family members with 111 Improving Cultural Competence Advice to Counselors: Strengths of African American Families African American kinship bonds have historically been source s of strength. Although substance abuse lessens the strength of the family and can erode relationships, counselors can use the inherent strengths of the family to benefit clients and their families (Boyd -Franklin and Karger 2012; Larkin 2003; Reid 2000). Bell - Tolliver et al. (2009) and Hill (1972) suggest that strengths of African American family life include: Strong bonds and extensive kinship. Adaptability of family roles. A strong family hierarchy. A strong work orientation. A high achievem ent orientation. A strong religious orientation. histories of substance abuse, suggesting an even greater need to address substance abuse within the family (Brower and Carey 2003). Strong family bonds are important in African American cultural groups. Afr ican American families are embedded in a complex kinship network of biologically related and unrelated persons. Hence, counselors should be willing to expand the definition of family to a more extended kinship system (Boyd -Franklin 2003; Hines and Boyd -Franklin 2005). Clients need to be asked how they define family, whom they would identify as family or \"like family, \" who resides with them in their homes, and who m they rely on for help. Hines and Boyd -Franklin (2005) discuss the importance of both blood and nonblood kinship networks for African American families. To build a support network fo r African American clients, counselor s should start by asking c lients to identify people (whether biological kin or not) who would be willing and able to support their r ecovery and then ask client s for permis- sion to contact those people and include them in the treatment process. Family therapy is often a productive approach to treatment with African Americans (Boyd - Franklin 2003; Hines and Boyd -Franklin 2005; Larkin 2003) . However, the extended family can be large and have many ties with other families in a community; therefore, the family therapist sometimes needs to take on other roles to assist with case management or other activities, including involvement in community -wide interventions (Sue 2001). In reviewing specific family therapy approaches for African Americans, Boyd -Franklin (2003) discusses the use of a multisystem family therapy approach, which incorporates an extended network of relationships that play a part in clients ' lives. Using this model, social service and other community agencies can be considered a significant part of the family system. Network therapy, which involves clients' extended social networks , has also been found to improve substance use out comes for African American clients when added to standard treatment (Keller and Galanter 1999). Likewise, the family team conference model can be a useful approach, given that it also engages both families and comm unities in the helping process by attempti ng to stimulate extensive mobilization of activity in the formal and informal relationships in and around cli- ents' families (State of New Jersey Department of Human Services 2004). Brief structural family therapy and strategic family therapy reduce substance use as well, but research has primarily focused on African American youth (Santisteban et al. 1997 ; Santisteban et al. 2003; Szapocznik and Williams 2000). M ultidimensional family therapy has increased abstinence from sub-stance use among African American adoles- cents and produced more lasting effects than CBT, but it also has not been evaluated with adult clients (Liddle et al. 2008). In reviewing specific family programs, Larkin (2003) reports promising preliminary data on a family therapy interv ention among African Americans in public housing that addresses substance abuse. 112 Cha pter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups The program initially engages families via psychoeducation on substance abuse and its effects on the family, followed by a strength - based family therapy intervention. Despite the small sample size, all 10 families admitted to the program completed treatment, and 7 of 10 family members with substance abuse prob-lems entered recovery and continuing care. Participant surveys indicated that 60 percent of families preferred multiple -family therapy over single -family therapy, and 80 percent preferred services delivered in the housing project community center to other venues. Engaging Moms is another family -oriented program and intervention developed specifi-cally for African American mo thers that has been shown to significantly improve treatment engagement (Dakof et al. 2003). The interven-tion is designed for women who have children and have been identified as cocaine users. The program focuses on mobilizing family members who would be likely to motivate the mother s to enroll and remain in substance abuse treatment. Research has shown no long-term impact, yet women who received the intervention were significantly more likely to enter treatment (88 percent of women involved in the program versus 46 percent of the control group) and remain for at least 2 weeks. Group therapy Because of the communal, cooperative values held by many African Americans, group ther-apy can be a particularly valuable component of the treatment process (Sue and Sue 2013b ). A strong oral tradition is one of many forms of continuity with African tradition main-tained in the African American experience ; therefore , speaking in groups is generally acceptable to African American clients. How-ever, Bibb and Casim er (2000) not e that Black Caribbean Americans can be less comfortable with the group process, particularly the re-quirement that they self -disclose personal problems to people who are relative strangers. African Americans seem less likely to self - disclos e about the past in group settings that include non -Hispanic Whites ( Johnson et al. 2011; Richardson and Williams 1990). Con-sequently, groups composed only of African Americans can be more beneficial. Homoge-nous African American groups can also be good venue s for clients to deal with systemic problems, such as racism and lack of economic opportunities in the African American com-munity (Jones et al. 2000). Mutual-help groups A variety of mutual -help groups are available for African Americans entering recovery from substance use and mental disorders. However, most of the literature focuses on 12- Step groups, including Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous. Some find that the 12 -Step approach warrants careful consideration with African Americans, who can find the c oncept of powerlessness over substances of abuse to be too similar to experi-ences of powerlessness via discrimination. Additionally, the disease concept of addiction presented in 12 -Step meetings can be difficult for many African Americans (Durant 2005). In some instances, the Black community has changed the mutual -help model for substance use and mental health to make it more em-powering and relevant to African American participants . For additional information on the 12 Steps for African Americans, visit Alcohol-ics Anonymous World Services (AAWS) , AA for the Black and African American Alcoholic, available on line (http:// www.aa.org/ pdf/products/p -51_CanAA HelpMeToo.pdf ). Despite their emphasis on the concept of powerlessness, 12 -Step programs are significant support systems for many African American s. In AA 's 2011 membership survey, 4 percent of members identified their race as Black (AAWS 2012). Analysis of 2006-2007 113 Improving Cultural Competence NSDUH data showed that African Americans were less likely to use mutual -help groups in the p ast year for substance use (about 1 1 percent did) than White Americans ( about 67 percent did) or Latinos ( about 16 percent did; SAMHSA 2013d ). However, the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions ( NESARC ) survey did find that African Americans who had a lifetime drug use disorder diagnosis and had sought help were more than three times as likely to have attended mutual -help meetings as were White Americans or Latinos (Perron et al. 2009). Several other surveys suggest that African Americans with alcohol -related problems are at least as likely to parti cipate in AA as White Americans and that greater problem severity is associated with increased likelihood of partici-pation (Kingree a nd Sullivan 2002). Of the participants who attended mutual -help group sessions for mental health in the past year, approximately 10 percent were Black or Afri-can American , 75 percent were White Ameri- can, and 11.4 percent were Latino (SAMHSA 2010). Durant (2005) observes that Afric an American 12-Step participants tend to participate differ- ently in meetings where participants are most-ly White Americans than in meetings where most participants are African American . In some areas, there are 12 -Step meetings that are largely or entirely composed of African American members, and some African American clients feel more comfortable par- ticipating in these meetings. Mutual -help groups can be particularly helpful for African Americans who consider themselves religious. Maude -Griffin et al. (1998) found that indi- viduals who identified as highly religious did significantly better when receiving 12 -Step facilitation than when receiving CBT, but that pattern was reversed for those who did not consider themselves highly religious. Other studies have found that African Americans express a greater degree of comfort with shar- ing in meetings, and they are more likely to engage in AA services and state that they had a spiritual awakening as a result of AA partic-ipation (Bibb and Casim er 2000; Kaskutas et al. 1999; Kingree 1997). Research suggests that African Americans who attend 12 -Step programs have higher levels of affiliation than White Americans in the same program s (Kingree and Sullivan 2002). However , they are less likely to have a sponsor or to rea d program materials (Kaskutas et al. 1999), and their abstinence appears to be less affected by meeting attendance (Timko et al. 2006). Other research has found that African Americans who participate in 12 -Step groups report an increase in the number of people within their social networks who sup- port their recovery efforts (Flynn et al. 2006). Other mutual -help groups for African Americans are available, particularly faith - based programs to support recovery from mental illness and substance use disorders an d to aid individuals in the process of transition-ing from correctional institutions. For exam-ple, the Nation of Islam has been involved in successful substance abuse recovery efforts, especially for incarcerated persons (Sanders 2002; White and Sanders 2004). Traditional healing and complementary methods In general, African Americans are less likely to make use of popular alternative or comple-mentary healing methods than White Ameri-cans or Latinos (Graham et al. 2005). However, the African American culture and history is steeped in healing traditions passed down t hrough generations, including herb al remedies, root medicine s, and so forth (Lynch and Hanson 2011). The acceptance of tradi- tional practices by African American clients and their families does not necessarily indicate that they oppose or reject the use of modern 114 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups Advice to Counselo rs: The Role of African American Religious Institutions in Treatment and Recovery Within African American communities, religious institutions and clergy often function as service providers as well as counselors (Boyd -Franklin 2003; Reid 2000; Taylor et al. 2000). It is not uncom- mon for African Americans to approach clergy first when faced with their own or family members ' mental health or substance abuse problems, but many African American clergy members believe they are not well -prepared to address those problems (Neighbors et al. 1998; Sexton et al. 2006). According to NESARC data, African Americans are twice as likely as Latinos and nearly three times as likely as White Americans to receive pastoral counseling for their drug use (Perron et al. 2009). For many African Americans in recovery, churches play a significant role in helping them maintain abstinence (Perron et al. 2009). Beyond pastoral counseling, research suggests that other means of engagement within the church can lead to recovery. For example, participation in religious services has been associated with significantly better outcomes for African American men in continuing care following court -mandated treatment (Brown et al. 2004). Stahler et al. (2007) also report successful use of peer mentors drawn from churches for African American women in treatment, marked by significantly fewer drug -positive urine samples in the 6 months following treatment. Counselors working with African American clients should prepare to include churches , mosque s, or other faith communities in the therapeutic process, and they should develop a list of appropriate spiritual resources in the community. Treatment providers may consider involving African American clergy in treatment programs to improve clergy members ' understanding of behavioral health prob- lems and treatment s and to better engage clients and t heir families. Programs can conduct outreach with local faith -based institutions and clergy to facilitate treatment referrals (Taylor et al. 2000). therapeutic approaches or other alternative approaches. They can accept and use all for ms of treatment selectively, depending on the perceived nature of their health problems. That said, psychological and substance abuse problems can be seen as having spiritual causes that need to be addressed by traditional heal-ers or religious practices (B oyd-Franklin 2003). Moreover, African Americans are much more likely to use religion or spirituality as a response to physical or psychological problems (Cooper et al. 2003; Dessio et al. 2004; Graham et al. 2005; Nadeem et al. 2008). African American cultural and religious insti-tutions (see advice box below) play an im-portant role in treatment and recovery, and African Americans who use spirituality or religion to cope with health problems are nearly twice as likely as other African Americans to also make use of complementary or alterna- tive medicine (Dessio et al. 2004). Likewise, African American churches and mosques play a central role in education, politics, recreation, and social welfare in African American com- munities. To date, African Americans repor t the highest percentage (87 percent) of reli-gious affiliation of any major racial/ethnic group (Kosmin and Key sar 2009; Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life 2008). Even though most are committed to various Christian denominations (with the Baptist and African Methodist Episcopal churches ac- counting for the largest percentages), a growing number of African Americans are converts to Islam, and many recent immigrants from Africa to the United States are also Muslims (Boyd- Franklin 2003; Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life 2008). Relapse prevention and recovery African Americans appear to be responsive to continuing care participation and recovery activities associated with substance use and mental disorders, yet research is very limited. According to NESAR C data (Dawson et al. 115 Improving Cultural Competence 2005), African Americans in recovery from alcohol dependence were more than twice as likely as White Americans to maintain absti-nence rather than just limit ing alcohol con- sumption or chang ing drinking patterns. In another study analyzing the use of continuing care following residential treatment in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs care system, African American men were significantly more likely than White Americans to partici-pate in continuing care (Harris et al. 2006). Other re search evaluating continuing care for African American men who had been man-dated to o utpatient treatment by a parole or probation office found that participants as-signed to a continuing care intervention were almost three times as likely to be abstinent an d five times less likely to be using any drugs on a weekly basis during the 6 -month follow -up period compared with those who did not receive continuing care (Brown et al. 2004). In evaluating appropriate relapse prevention strategies for African American clients, Walton et al. (2001) found that African American clients leaving substance abuse treatment reported fewer cravings, greater use of coping strategies, and a greater belief in their self -efficacy. However, they also expected to be involved in fewer sober leisure activities, to be exposed to greater amounts of substance use, and to have a greater need for continuing care services (e.g., housing, medical care, assistance with employment). Walton notes that these findings could reflect a tendency of African American clients to underestimate the difficulties they will face after treatment ; they report a greater need for resources and greater exposure to substance use, but they still have a greater belief in their ability to remain free of substances. Alth ough an individual 's belief in coping can have a positive effect on initially managing high -risk situations, it also can lead to a failure to recognize the level of risk in a given situation, anticipate the consequences, secure resources and appropriate support when needed, or engage in coping behaviors condu-cive to maintaining recovery. C ounselors can help clients practice coping skills by role - playing, even if client s are confident that they can manage difficult or high -risk situations. Counseling for As ian Americans , Native Hawaiian s, and Other Pacific Islanders Asian Americans, per the U.S. Census Bureau definition, are people whose origins are in the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian sub-continent (Humes et al. 2011). The term in- cludes East Asians (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Americans), Southeast Asians (e.g., Cambodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese American s), Filipinos, Asian Indians, and Central Asians (e.g., Mongolian and Uzbek Americans ). In the 2010 Cen sus, people who identified solely as Asian American made up 4.8 percent of the population, and those who identified as Asian American along with one or more other races made up an additional 0.9 percent. Census data includes specific infor-mation on people who identify as Asian Indian , Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese , and \"other Asians. \" The largest Asian populations in the United States are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Asian Indian Americans, Korean Americans, and Vietnamese Americ ans. Asian Americans overwhelmingly live in urban areas, and more than half (51 percent) live in just three states (NY, CA, and HI; Hoeffel et al. 2012). Not all people with origins in Asia belong to what is commonly conceived of as the Asian race. Some A sian Indians, for example, self - identify as White American. For this reason, among others, counselors should be careful to learn from their Asian American clients how 116 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups they identify themselves and which national heritage s they claim. Counselors should rec- ognize that clients who appear to be Asian may not necessarily think of themselves pri- marily as persons of Asian ancestry or have a deep awareness of the traditions and values of their countries of origin. For example, Asian orphans who have been adopted in the United States and raised as Americans in White American families may have very little con-nection with the cultural groups of their bio-logical parents (St. Martin 2005). Counselors should not make generalizations across Asian cultures; each culture is q uite distinct. Little l iterature on substance use and mental disorders, rates of co -occurrence, and treatment among Asian Americans focuses on behavioral health treatment for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders; thus , a text box at the end of this section summarizes available information . Beliefs About and Traditions Involving Substance Use Within many Asian societies, the use of intox- icants is tolerated within specific contexts. For example, in some Asian cultural groups, alco-hol is believed to have curative, ceremonial, or beneficial value. Among pregnant Cambodian women, small amounts of herbal medicines with an alcohol base are sometimes used to ensure an easier delivery. Following childbirth, similar medicines ar e generally used to in- crease blood circulation (Amodeo et al. 1997). Some Chinese people believe that alcohol restores the flow of qi (i.e., the life force). The written Chinese character for \"doctor \" con- tains the character for alcohol, which implies the u se of alcohol for medicinal purposes. Some Asian American cultural groups make allowances for the use of other substances. Marijuana, for instance, has been used medici-nally in parts of Southeast Asia for many years (Iversen 2000; Martin 1975). However, s ome Asian Americans tend to view illicit substance use and abuse as a serious breach of acceptable behavior that cannot readily be discussed. Nonetheless, there are broad differences in Asian cultures' perspectives on substance use, thus requiring counselo rs to obtain more specific information during intake and subse-quent encounters. Acknowledging a substance abuse problem often leads to shame for Asian American clients and their families. Families may deny the problem and inadvertently, or even inten-tional ly, isolate members who abuse substances (Chang 2000). For example, some Cambodian and Korean Americans perceive alcohol abuse and dependence as the result of moral weak-ness, which brings shame to the family (Amodeo et al. 2004; Kwon -Ahn 2001). Substance Use and Substance Use Disorders According to the 2012 NSDUH, Asian Americans use alcohol, cigarettes, and illicit substances less frequently and less heavily than members of any other major racial/ethnic group (SAMHSA 201 3d). However, large surveys may undercou nt Asian American substance use and abuse, as they are typically conducted in English and Spanish only (Wong et al. 2007b ). Despite the limitations of research, data suggest that although Asian Americans use illicit substances and alcohol less frequently than other Americans, sub-stance abuse problems have been increasing among Asian Americans. The longer Asian Americans reside in the United States, the more their substance use resembles that of other Americans. Excessive alcohol use, intox-ication, and substance use disorders are more prevalent among Asians born in the United States than among foreign- born Asians living in the United States (Szaflarski et al. 2011). 117 Improving Cultural Competence Among Asian Americans who entered sub- stance abuse treatment between 2000 and 2010, methamphetamine and marijuana were the most commonly reported illicit drugs (SAMHSA, CBHSQ 2012). Methampheta-mine abuse among Asian Americans is partic-ularly high in Hawaii and on the West Coast (OAS 2005a ). As with other racial and ethnic groups, numerous factors \u2014such as age, birth country, immigration history, acculturation, employment, geographic location , and in- come \u2014add complexity to any conclusions about prevalence among specific Asian cultur-al groups. Asian Americans who are recent immigrants, highly acculturated , unemployed, or living in Western s tates are generally more likely than other Asian Americans to abuse drugs or alcohol (Makimoto 1998). For exam-ple, according to the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS) , Asians who are more accult urated are at greater risk for prescription drug abuse (Watkins and Ford 2011). There are variations among particular groups of Asians; some Asian cultural groups have different attitudes toward substance use than others, and these differences tend to be o b- scured in large -scale surveys. Researchers have found that Korean American college students drank more frequently and drank greater quantities than did Chinese American stu-dents at the same schools and were more likely to consider drinking socially accept able (Chang et al. 2008). Ano ther study in the District of Columbia and surrounding metro-politan area compared substance use among different groups of Southeast Asians (i.e., Cambodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese Americans ); Vietnamese Americans had the highe st rates of alcohol use, but Cambodian Americans had the highest rates of illicit drug use (Wong et al. 2007 b). Research in San Francisco found Chinese Americans to be less likely than Vietnamese or Filipino Americans to use illicit drugs, whereas Filipino Americans had the highest rate of illicit drug use (Nemoto et al. 1999). In tha t same study, Filipino American immigrants were also significantly more likely to have begun using substances prior to immigrating than were Chinese or Vietnamese immigrants. O ther studies have found that Filipino Americans are more likely to use illicit drugs and to inject drugs than other Asian American populations (see review in Nemoto et al. 2002). To date, the largest national study to assess substance use and mental disorders across Asian American groups is the NLAAS (Takeuchi et al. 2007). This study found that Filipino American men were 2.38 times more likely to have a lifetime substance use disorder than were Chinese American men, whereas the differences among women of diverse Asian ethnicities were much smaller. Other research suggests that Korean Americans are more likely to have family histories of alcohol de-pendence than are Chinese Americans (Ebberhart et al. 2003). Besides the variations across different cultures, substance use and abuse among Asian Ameri-cans is also influenced by age. Substance abuse appears higher for young Asian Americans than for those who are older (possibly reflect-ing differences in acculturation). A study conducted in New York City showed tha t Asian American junior and senior high school students had the lowest percentage of heavy drinkers of any ethnic group, but those who were heavy drinkers drank twice as much daily as those who did not drink heavily (Makimoto 1998). Asian American youth, e specially im- migrants, tend to start using substances at a later age than members of other ethnic groups, which could be a factor in the lower levels of abuse seen among Asian Americans. Despite rates of substance use disorders among Asian Americans hav ing increased over 118 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups time, research has regularly found that, of all major racial/ethnic groups in United States, Asian Americans have the lowest rates of alcohol use disorders (Grant et al. 2004 ; SAMHSA 2012 b). This phenomenon has typically been explained in p art by the fact that some Asians lack the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which chemically breaks down alcohol (McKim 2003). Thus, high levels of acetaldehyde, a byproduct of alcohol metabo-lism, accumulate and cause an unpleasant flushing response (Yang 200 2). The alcohol flushing response primarily manifests as flush- ing of the neck and face but can also include nausea, headache s, dizziness , and other symptoms. Additional factors that could play a part in increasing the likelihood of substance use disorders among Asian Americans include experiences of racism and the absence of ethnic identification. Compared with Asian Americans who do not have alcohol use disor-ders, Asian Americans who have alcohol use disorders are more than five times as likely to report unfair treatment because of their race and are more than twice as likely to deny strong ethnic identification (Chae et al. 2008). Compared with other racial an d ethnic groups, Asian Americans who drink heavily are more likely to have friends or peers who also drink heavily (Chi et al. 1989). Mental and Co -Occurring Disorders Overall, health and mental health are not seen as two distinct entities by Asian Ameri- can cultural groups. Most Asian American views focus on the importance of virtue, maturity, and self -control and find full emo- tional expression indicative of a lack of ma- turity and self -discipline (Cheung 2009). Given the potential shame they often associat e with mental disorders and their typically holistic worldview of health and illness, Asian Americans are more likely to present with somatic complaints and less likely to present with symptoms of psychological distress and impairment (Hsu and Folstein 1997; Kim et al. 2004; Room et al. 2001; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [ HHS ] 2001; Zhang et al. 1998), even though mental illness appears to be nearly as common among Asian Americans as it is in other ethnic/racial groups. In 2009, approximately 15.5 percent of Asians reported a mental illness in the past year, but only 2 percent reported past -year occurrence of serious mental illness (SAMHSA 2012a ). Asian Americans have a lower inci- dence of CODs than other racial/ethnic groups because the prevalence of substance use disor-ders in this population is lower. In the 2012 NSDUH, 0.3 percent of Asian Americans indicated co -occurring serious psychological distress and substance use disorders, and 1.1 percent had some symptoms of mental distress along with a substance use disorder \u2014the low- est rates of any major racial/ethnic group in the survey (SAMHSA 201 3c). Considerable variation in the types of mental disorders diagnosed among diverse Asian American communities is evident, although it is unclear to what extent this reflects diagnostic and/or self -selection biases. For example, Barreto and Segal (2005) found that Southeast Asians were more likely to be treated for major depression than other Asians or mem-bers of other ethnic/racial groups; East Asians were the most likely of all Asian American groups to be treated for schizophrenia (nearly twice as likely as White Americans). Traumat- ic experiences and PTSD can be particularly difficult to uncover in some Asian American clients. Although Asian Americans are as likely to experience traumatic events (e.g., wars experienced by first -generation immi- grants from countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia) in their lives, their cultural respons-es to trauma can conceal its psychological 119 Improving Cultural Competence effects. For instance, some Asian cultural groups believe that stoic acceptance is the most appropriate response to adversity (Lee and Mock 2005a,b ). Treatment Patterns Treatment -seeking rates for mental illness are low among most Asian populations, with rates varying by specific e thnic/cultural heritage and, possibly, level of acculturation (Abe- Kim et al. 2007; Barreto and Segal 2005; Lee and Mock 2005a,b ). Asian Americans who seek help for psychological problems will most likely consult family members, clergy, or tradi-tional heal ers before mental health profession- als, in part because of a lack of culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health ser-vices available to them (HHS 2001; Spencer and Chen 2004). However, among those Asian Americans who seek behavioral health treat-ment, the amount of services used is relatively high (Barreto and Segal 2005). Asian Americans tend to enter treatment with less severe substance abuse problems than members of other ethnic/racial groups and have more stable living situations and fewer criminal justice problems upon leaving treat- ment (Niv et al. 2007). However, for Asian Americans involved in the criminal justice system, there is a more pronounced relation-ship between crime and drug abuse than for other ethnic and rac ial groups. In the earl y 1990s, an estimated 95 percent of Asian Americans in California prisons were there because of drug -related crimes (Kuramoto 1994). According to SAMHSA 's 2010 TEDS data, 48.5 percent of Asian Americans in treatment were referred by the criminal justice system in that year, compared with 36.4 per-cent of African Americans and 36.6 percent of White Americans (SAMHSA, CBHSQ 2012). According to 2010 NSDUH data regarding i ndividuals who reported a need for treatment but did not receive it in the prior year, Asian Americans were also the most likely of all major racial/ethnic groups to report that they could not afford or had no insurance coverage for substance abuse treat-ment (SAMHSA, CBHSQ 2011). Beliefs and Attitudes About Treatment Compared with the general population, Asian Americans are less likely to have confidence in their medical practitioners, feel respected by their doctors, or believe that they are involved in healthcare decisions. Many also believe that their doctors do not have a sufficient under-standing of their background s and values; this is particularly true for Korean Americans (Hughes 2002). Even so , Asian Americans, especially more recent immigrants, seem more likely to seek help for mental and substance use disorders from general medical providers than from specialized treatment providers (Abe -Kim et al. 2007). Many Asian American immigrants underuse healthcare services due to confusion about eligibility and fears of jeopard-izing their residency status (HHS 2001). As with other groups, discrimination, accul-turation stress, and immigration and genera-tional status, along with language needs, have a large influence on behavioral health and treatment -seeking for Asian Americans (Meyer et al. 2012; Miller et al. 2011). The NLAAS found that although rates of behavioral health service use were lower for A sian American s who immigrated recently than for the general population, those rates increased significantly for U.S. -born Asian Americans; third - generation U.S. -born individuals ' rates of ser- vice use also were relatively high (Abe -Kim et al. 2007). Of those Asian Americans who had any mental disorder diagnosis in the prior year, 62.6 percent of third -generation Americans sought help for it in the prior year compared with 30.4 percent of first -generation Americans . 120 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups Overall, Asian Americans place less value on substance abuse treatment than other popula-tion groups and are less likely to use such services (Yu and Wa rner 2012). Niv et al. (2007) found that Asian and Pacific Islanders entering substance abuse treatment programs in California expressed significantly more negative attitudes toward treatment and rated it as significantly less important than did others entering treatment. Seeking help for substance abuse can be seen, in some Asian American cultural groups, as an admission of weakness that is shameful in itself or as an interference with family obligations (Masson et al. 2013). Among 2010 NSDUH respond- ents who stated a need for substance abuse treatment in the prior year but did not receive it, Asian Americans were more likely than members of all other major racial/ethnic groups to say that they could handle the prob-lem without treatment or that they did not believe treatment would help (SAMHSA 2011c ). Combining NSDUH data from 2003 to 2011 NSDUH, Asian Americans who needed but did not receive treatment in the past year were the least likely of all major ethnic/racial groups to express a need for such treatmen t (SAMHSA, CBHSQ 2013c ). Treatment Issues and Considerations It is important for counselors to approach presenting problems th rough clients' culturally based explanations of t heir own issues rather than imposing views that could alter the ir acceptance of treatment. In Asian cultural groups, the physical and emotional aspects of an individual 's life are undifferentiated (e.g., the physical rather than emotional or psycho-logical aspect of a problem can be the focus for many Asian American s); thus, problems as well as remedies are typically handled holisti-cally. Some Asian Americans with traditional backgrounds do not readily accept Western biopsychosocial explanations for substance use and mental disorders. C ounselors should promote discussion s focused on client s' under- standing of their presenting problems as well as any approaches the client s have used to address them. Subsequentl y, presenting prob- lems need to be reconceptualized in language that embraces the clients' perspectives (e.g., an imbalance in yin and yang, a disruption in chi ; Lee and Mock 2005 a,b). It is advisable to educate Asian American client s on the role of the counselor/therapist, the purpose of thera- peutic interventions, and how particular aspects of the treatment process (e.g., assessment) can help client s with their presenting problems (Lee and Mock 2005a ,b; Sue 2001). Asian American clients who receive such education participate in treatment longer and express greater satisfaction with it (Wong et al. 2007 a). As with other racial/ethnic groups, Asian American clients are responsive to a warm and empathic approach. Counselors should realize, though, that building a strong, trusting rela-tionship take s time. Among Asian American clients, humiliation and shame can permeate the treatment process and derail engagement with services. Th us, it is ess ential to assess and discuss client beliefs about shame (see the \"Assessing Shame in Asian American Clients\" advice box on the next page) . In some cases, self-disclosure can be helpful, but the counse- lor should be careful not to self -disclose in a way that will threaten his or her position of respect with Asian American clients. Asian American clients may look to counse- lors for expertise and authority. Counselors should attempt to build client confidence in the first session by introducing themselves by title, displaying diplomas, and mentioning his or her experience with other clients who have similar problems (Kim 1985; Lee and Mock 2005a,b ). Asian American clients may expect and be most comfortable with f ormalism on 121 Improving Cultural Competence the part of counselors, especially at the begin- ning of treatment and prior to assessment of clients' needs (Paniagua 1998). Many Asian American clients expect counselors to be directive (Leong and Lee 2008). Passivity on the part of the counselor can be misinterpret-ed as a lack of concern or confidence. Counselors who are unaccustomed to working with Asian populations will likely encounter conflict between their theoretical worldview of counseling and the deference to autho rity and avoidance of confrontation that is common among more traditional Asian American clients. Some clients can be hesitant to con-tradict the counselor or even to voice their own opinion s. Confrontation can be seen as something to avoid whenever possible. Fur- thermore , many Asian cultural groups have high-context styles of communication, mean- ing that members often place greater im-portance on nonverbal cues and the context of verbal messages than on the explicit content of message s (Hall 1976). Asian Ameri cans often use indirect communication, relying on subtle gestures, expressions, or word choices to con-vey meaning without being openly confronta-tional. Counselors must not only be observant of nuances in meaning, but also learn about verbal and nonverbal communication styles specific to Asian cultural groups (for a review of guidelines to use when working with Asian Americans, see Gallardo et al. 2012). Asian American clients appea r to respond more favorably to treatment in programs that provide services to other Asian clients. Takeuchi et al. (1995) found that Asian Americans were much more likely to r eturn to mental health clinics where most clients were Asian American than to pro grams where that was not the case (98 percent and 64 percent returned, respectively). When demographic differences were controlled for, those who attended programs that had predominantly Asian clients were 15 times more likely to return after the initial v isit. Asian Americans were also more likely to stay in treatment when matched with an Asian American coun-selor regardless of the type of program they attended. Sue et al. (1991) also found that Asian American clients attended significantly more treatment sessions if matched with an Asian American counselor. Among Asian American women, crucial strategies include reducing the shame of sub-stance abuse and focusing on the promotion of overall health rather than just addressing substance abuse. Such strategies reduce the chance of a woman and her family seeing substance abuse as an individual flaw. Home visits, when agreed in advance with the client, can be appropriate in some cases as a way to gain the trust of, and show respect for, Asian American women. Asian American women may not be as successful in mixed -gender Advice to Counselors: Assessing Shame in Asian American Clients Shame and humiliation can be signifi cant barri- ers to treatment engagement for Asian Ameri- cans. Gaw (1993) suggests that the presence of the following factors may indicate that a client has shame about seeking treatment: The client or a family member is extremely concerned about the qualifications of the counselor. The client is hesitant to involve others in the treatment process. The client is excessively worried about confidentiality. The client refuses to cover expenses with private insurance. The client frequently misses or arrive s late for treatment. Family members refuse to support treat-ment. The client insists on having a White Ameri-can counselor to avoid opening up to an-other Asian. The client refuses treatment even when severe problems are evident. 122 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups groups if strict gender roles exist whereby communication is constricted within and out- side the family; women will likely remain silent or defer to the men in the group (Chang 2000). For more information on treating women, see Treatment Improvemen t Protocol (T IP) 51, Substance Abuse Treatment: Addressing the Specific Needs of Women (CSAT 2009c ). Theoretical Approaches and Treatment Interventions Some Asian cultural groups emphasize cogni- tions. For instance, Asian cultural groups that have a Buddhi st tradition, such as the Chinese, view behavior as control led by thought. Thus, they accept that addressing cognitive patterns will affect behaviors (Chen 1995). S ome Asian cultural groups encourage a stoic attitud e toward problems, teaching emotional suppres-sion as a coping response to strong feelings (Amodeo et al. 2004; Castro et al. 1999b ; Lee and Mock 2005a,b ; Sue 2001). Treatment can be more effective if providers avoid approaches that target emotional responses and instead use strategies that are more indirect in discuss- ing feelings (e.g., saying \"that might make some people feel angry \" rather than asking directly what the client is feeling; Sue 2001). Asian Americans often prefer a solution - focused approach to treatment that provides them with c oncrete strategies for addressing specific problems (Sue 2001). Even though little research is available in evaluating specific interventions with Asian Americans, clinicians tend to recommend cognitive -behavioral, solution -focused, family, and acceptance commitment therapies (Chang 2000; Hall et al. 2011; Iwamasa et al. 2006; Rastogi and Wadhwa 2006; Sue 2001). Asian American clients are likely to expect that their counselors take an active role in structuring the therapy session and provide clear guidelines about what they expect from clients. CBT has the Advice to Administrators: Culturally Responsive Program Development Behavioral health service program administrators can improve engagement and retention of Asian clients by making culturally appropriate accommodations in their programs. The accommodations required will vary according to the specific cultural groups, language preferences, and levels of acculturation in question. The following cult urally responsive program suggestions were initially identified for Cambodian clients but can be adapted to match the unique needs of other Asian clients from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds: Create an advisory committee using representatives from the community. Incorporate cultural knowledge and maintain flexible attitudes as a counselor. Use cotherapist teams in which one member is Asian and bilingual. Provide services in the clients' primary language. Develop culturally specific questionnaires for intake to capture information that may be missed by standard questionnaires. Conduct culturally appropriate assessments of trauma that ask about the traumatic experiences common to the population in question. Visit client homes to improve family involvement in treatment. Provide support to families during transitions from and to professional care. Emphasize traditional values. Explore client coping mechanisms that draw upon cultural strengths. Use acupuncture or other traditional practices for detoxifi cation. Integrate Buddhist ideas, values, and practices into treatment when appropriate. Emphasize relationship -building; help clients with life problems beyond behavioral health concerns. Provide concrete services, such as housing assistance and legal help.

Although specific data on the effectiveness of CBT among Asian Americans is not available, there is some research indicating that CBT is effective for treating depressive symptoms in Asians (Dai et al. 1999; Fujisawa et al . 2010). In China, a Chinese Taoist version of CBT has been developed to treat anxiety disorders and was found to be effective, especially in conjunction with medication (Zhang et al. 2002). Family therapy Some Asian Americans, particularly those who are less acculturated, prefer individual therapy to group or family interventions be-cause it better enables them to save face and keep their privacy (Kuramoto 1994). Some clients may wish to enter treatment secretly so that they can ke ep their families and friends from knowing about their problems. Once treatment is initiated , counselors should strongly reinforce the wisdom of seeking help through statements such as \"you show concern for your husband by seeking help \" or \"you are obvious ly a caring father to seek this help .\" The norm in Asian families is that \"all prob- lems (including physical and mental problems) must be shared only among family members\"; sharing with others can cause shame and guilt, exacerbating problems (Paniagua 1998, pp. 59-60). Counselors should expect to take more time than usual to learn about clients' situations , anticipat e client need s for reassur- ance in divulging sensitive information, and frame discus sions in a culturally competent way. For example, counselor s can assure cli- ents that discussing problem s is a step toward resuming their full share of responsibility in their families and removing some of the stress their families have been feeling. For most Asian Americans, particularly those who are less acculturated, successful treatment involves the client 's family (Chang 2000; Ki m et al. 2004; Rastogi and Wadhw a 2006). Even in individual treatment, it is important to understand the client 's family an d his or her relationship with its members, the dynamics and style of the family, and the family 's role in the client 's substance abuse (Meyer et al. 2012). Particularly among Asian American women, family involvement can be essential due to the client 's concern about being re- sponsive to her family 's needs. Nonetheless, involving the family can be quite difficult, as both male and female clients may wish to conceal their substance abuse from their fami-lies because of the shame that it brings. Advice to Counselors: Culturally Respo nsive Family Therapy Guidelines for Asian Families Kim et al. (2004) reviewed references that provide guidelines for family therapy with Korean Americans. They established 11 essen-tial ingredients applicable to Korean and other Asian American groups and families. To pro-vide culturally responsive therapy to Asian Americans, counselors should: Assess support from community and ex-tended family systems. Assess immigration history, if appropriate. Establish credibility as a professional in the initial meeting with the family. Explain the key principles and expectations of family therapy and the family roles (es-pecially elders/decisionmakers) in the pro-cess. Enable clients, particularly male elders or decisionmakers, to save face. Validate and address somatic complaints. Be both problem focused and present focused. Be directive in guiding therapy. Respect the family's hierarchy. Avoid being confrontational and facilitate interactions that are nonconfrontational. Reframe problems in positive terms. Source: Kim et al. 2004 . 124 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups To engage fami ly members in the client 's treatment, the counselor first needs to be familiar with the way the family functions. Different acculturation levels among individu-al family members and across generations can affect how the family functions, producing significant stress and internal conflict. Also, the counselor must be aware of how gender roles and generational status influence the communication patterns and rules within each family (e.g., expectations of how a child ad-dresses a parent, the potential relegation of authority among female family members). Even more than for other clients, it is critical for Asian Americans to \"avoid embarrassing the family members in front of each other. The counselor should always protect the dignity and self -respect of the clien t and his or her family \" (Paniagua 1998, p. 71). Group therapy Group therapy may not be a good choice for Asian Americans, as many prefer individual therapy (Lai 2001; Sandhu and Malik 2001). Paniagua (1998, p. 73) suggests that \"group therapy...would be appropriate in those cases in which the client 's support system (relatives and close friends) is not available and an alternative support system is quickly needed. \" Some Asian Americans participating in group therapy will find it difficult to be assertive in a group setting, preferring to let others talk. They can also abide by more traditional roles in this context; men might not want to divulge their problems in front of women, women can feel uncomfortable speaking in front of men, and both men and women mi ght avoid con- tradicting another person in group (especially an older person). I t may not make sense to Asian American clients to hear about the problems of strangers who are not part of their community. Asian Americans are likely to be motivated to work f or the good of the group ; presenting group goals in this framework can garner active participat ion. Still, in group settings and in other instances, Asian American clients may expect a fair amount of direction from the group leader. Chen (1995) described lead er- ship of a culturally specific therapy group for Chinese Americans, noting that clients expect a group leader to act with authority and give more credence to his or her ex pertise than to other group members. I f members of the group belong to the same Asian American community, the issue of confidentiality will loom large, because the community is often small. Asian cultural groups generally appreci- ate education in more formal settings, so psychoeducation groups can work well for Asian Americans. I t is possible for a psy- choeducational group with Asian American participants to evolve comfortably into group therapy . Mutual-help groups According to 201 2 NSDUH data, Asian American s were less likely than o ther racial and ethnic groups to report the use of mutual - help groups in the past year (SAMHSA 2013d ). Mutual -help groups can be challeng- ing for Asian Americans who find it difficult and shaming to self -disclose publicly. The degre e of emotion and candor within these groups can further alienate tradition al Asian American clients. Furthermore, linguistically appropriate mutual -help groups are not always available for people who do not speak English . Highly acculturated Asian Am erican s may perceive participation in mutual -help groups as less of a problem, but nevertheless, Asian Americans can benefit from culture -specific mutual -help groups where norms of interper- sonal interaction are shared. Asian American 12-Step groups are available in some locales. It is important for counselors to assess client attitude s toward mutual -help participation and find alternative strategies and resources, 125 Improving Cultural Competence including encouragement to attend without sharing (Sandhu and Malik 2001). Although they are not mut ual-help groups in the traditional sense, mutual aid societies and associations are important in some Asian American communities. Some mutual aid societies have long histories and have provided assistance ranging from financial loans to help with childcare and funerals. The Chinese have family associations for people with the same last name who share celebrations and offer each other help. Japanese, Chinese, and South Asians have specific associations for people from the same province or village. For some Asian American groups, such as Koreans, churches are the primary organizational vehi-cles for assistance. These social support groups can be important resources for Asian American clients, their families, and the behavioral health agencies that provide servi ces to them. Traditional healing and complementary methods Asian Americans are twice as likely as other Americans to report making use of acupunc- ture and traditional healers. Even though there is considerable variation in the ir use of com- plementary and traditional medicine (Hughes 2002), many Asian Americans highly regard traditional healers, herbal preparations, and other culturally specific interventions as a means of restoring harmony and balance. However, Asian American clients do not always readily dis close the use of traditional medicine to Western treatment providers. Ahn et al. ( 2006) found that about two -thirds of Chinese and Vietnamese Americans who spoke no or limited English had used tradi-tional medicine, but only 7.6 percent had discussed the use of these therapies with their Western medical providers. Traditional treatment to restore physical and emotional balance for Asian Americans occurs through a variety of culture -specific interven- tions. For example, some Southeast Asian cultural groups practice cao gio \u2014massaging the skin with ointment and hot coins (Chan and Chen 2011). The Chinese have developed enormously complex systems of medical treatment over centuries of pragmat ic experi- mentation. Traditional herbal medicine com-bines plant substances according to precise formulas to have the desired influence on the affected organs of the body. Acupuncture techniques involve regulating the flow of energy ( qi) through the body by inserting needles at precise locations called acupuncture points. In traditional Chinese medicine, which has influenced traditional medical practices in other Asian cultural groups, illness is seen as an imbalance of yin and yang; a return to physical well ness can require introducing elements such as herbs to increase yin or yang as needed (Torsch and Ma 2000). Among less acculturated Asian Americans, Western medicine, including Western behav-ioral health services, can be insufficient to deal with a problem such as substance abuse and its effects on clients and their families. For exam-ple, all health problems for the Hmong (whether physical or psychological) are con-sidered spiritual in natur e; if providers ignore the clients ' understanding of the ir problem s as spiritual maladies, they are unlikely to effect positive change (Fadiman 1997). Even for more acculturated Asian Americans, the use of traditional healing methods and spirituality can be a very important aspect of treatment (see Chan and Chen 2011 for an overview of health beliefs and practices). Such use can provide a spiritual connection that helps man-age feelings that are especially difficult to express to others. M any practices associated with meditation, yoga, and Eastern religious traditions can hel p disperse the stress and anxiety experienced during treatment and recovery. In the United States, there are few 126 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups Behavioral Health Counseling for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders The ancestors of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders were the original inhabitants of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, and other Pacific islands. The population of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders grew more than three times faster than the total U.S. population from 2000 to 2010. More than half of Native Ha waiian and other Pacific Islanders live in Hawaii and California. The largest Pacific Islander populations in the United States comprise Hawaiians, Samoans, and Chamorros \u2014the indigenous people of the Mariana Islands, of which Guam is the largest (Hixson et al. 2012). Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders make up a relatively small proportion of the total United States population. In the 2010 Census, 540,000 people, or 0.2 percent of the population, reported their race as Native Hawaiian or other Paci fic Islander, and another 685,000 people (0.2 percent of the population) stated that they were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander in addition to one or more other races (Hixson et al. 2012). The largest concentration of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders is in Hawaii, where individuals with at least some of this ancestry made up 23.3 percent of the population. In 2012, according to NSDUH data, 5.4 percent of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders interviewed had a substance use disord er in the prior year, and 7.8 percent engaged in current illicit drug use (SAMHSA 2013d ). Binge and heavy drinking appear to be relatively high, especially among Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women. Data from the 2001- 2011 TEDS surveys indicate that the most common primary substances of abuse among Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders entering substance abuse treatment are alcohol, cannabis, and methamphetamine (SAMHSA 2013c). Because of its relatively small size, many studies have either ignored or been unable to make conclu- sions about substance use and abuse in this population; other research has grouped Native Hawaiian s and other Pacific Islanders together with Asians (more for the sake of convenience than for underlying cultural similarities). According to NSDUH data, 1.8 percent of adult Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders report-ed serious mental illness. Insufficient data were available to analyze past -year mental illness rates (SAMHSA 2013 c). Similar to substance use data, specific mental health data are limited across national studies, primarily because the population has been grouped with Asians. However, the evidence that is available suggests that Native Hawaiians are less likely than other racial/ethnic groups in Hawaii to acces s treatment services even though they experience higher rates of mental health problems (for a review of health beliefs and practices, see Mokuau and Tauili 'ili 2011). A few examples of culturally specific interventions for Native Hawaiians have been presented in the literature. For example, the Rural Hawai'i Behavioral Health Program, which provides substance abuse and mental health services to Native Hawaiians living in rural areas, incorporates Native Hawaiian beliefs and practices into all areas of the program, emphasizing the value of ' ohana (family) relations, including the importance of respecting and honoring ancestors and elders and passing on cultural ways to the next generation. Program staff members are trained in Native Hawaiian culture and beliefs, including spirituality and the essential value of graciousness, the honoring of mana (life energy), healing rituals such as pule (prayer), the use of healing herbs, and Native Hawaiian beliefs about the causes of illness, such as wrongdoing and physical disruption (Oliveira et al. 2006). Ho'oponopono is a form of group therapy used by Native Hawaiians; it involves family members and is facilitated by a K\u00fcpuna (elder). A qualitative study by Morelli and Fong (2000) of Ho 'oponopono with pregnant or postpartum women with substance use disorders (primarily methamphetamine abuse) reported high client satisfaction and positive outcomes (80 percent were abstinent 2 years after treatment). The Na Wahine Makalapua Project, sponsored by the Hawaii Department of Health's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division and SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, uses elements of Hawaiian culture to treat women with substance use disorders, such as by having K\u00fcpuna counsel younger generations. 127 Improving Cultural Competence examples of culturally specific treatment pro- grams that focus on Asian religious or spiritual treatment; however, there are programs over- seas, such as the Thai Buddhist treatment center described by Barrett (1997). Asian Americans are much more likely than members of other racial/ethnic groups to label themselves as secular, agnostic, or atheist (Kosmin and Keys ar 2009; Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life 2008). That said, a substantial number of Asian Americans still have religious affiliations. A bout 45 percent are Prote stant ; 17 percent , Catholic ; 14 per- cent, Hindu ; 9 percent , Buddhist ; and 4 per- cent, Muslim (Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life 2008). More acculturated Asian Americans are likely to enter treatment through medical settings and to be comforta-ble with a medical model for treatment, but those who are less acculturated or are foreign - born can prefer the use of traditional healing and/or religious traditions and beliefs as part of their treatment ( Ja and Yuen 1997). R eli- gious institutions can play an important part in the treatment of some groups of Asian Americans . For example, Kwon -Ahn (2001) notes that many Korean Americ ans, particu- larly more recent immigrants, turn to Chris-tian clergy or church groups for assistance with family and personal problems, such as substance abuse , before seeking professional help. Amodeo et al. (2004) suggest that, in working with Cambodian immigrants, provid- ers integrate Buddhist philosophy and practic-es into treatment , and, if possible, partner with Buddhist temples to facilitate treatment entry or to provide services for clients who choose to reside in Buddhist temple s. Relapse prevention and recovery Little research has evaluat ed relapse preven- tion and recovery promotion strategies specifi-cally for Asian Americans. H owever , issues involving shame can make the adjustment to abstinen ce difficult for Asian clients. Counse- lors should take this into account and address difficulties that can arise for clients with fami-lies who have shame about mental illness or substance use disorders. To date, there are no indications that standard approaches are un-suitable for Asian American clients. For more information on these approaches, see the planned TIP, Relapse Prevention and Recovery Promotion in Behavioral Health Services (SAMHSA planned e). Counseling for Hispanics and Latinos The terms \"Hispanic \" and \"Latino \" refer to people whose cultural origins are in Spain and Portugal or the countries of the Western Hemisphere whose culture is significantly influenced by Spanish or Portuguese coloniza-tion. Technically, a distinction can be drawn between Hispanic (literally meaning people from Spain or its former colonies) and Latino (which refers to persons from countries ranging from Mexico to Central and South America and the Caribbean that were colonized by Spain, and also including Portugal and its former colonies); th is TIP uses the more inclusive term (Latino), except when research specifically indicates the other. The term \"Latina \" refers to a woman of Latino descent . Latinos are an ethnic rather than a racial group; Latinos can be of any race. According to 2010 Cens us data, Latinos made up 16 percent of the total United States population ; they are its fastest growing ethnic group (Ennis et al. 2011). Latinos include more than 30 national and cultural subgroups that vary by national origin, race, generational status in the United States, and socioeconomic status (Padilla and Salgado de Snyder 1992; Rodriguez -Andre w 1998). According to Ennis et al. (2011), o f Latinos currently living in the United States (e xcluding Puerto Rico and 128 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups other territories), Mexican Americans a re the largest group (63 percent), followed by Central and South Americans (13.4 percent), Puerto Ricans (9.2 percent), and Cubans (3.5 percent ). Beliefs About and Traditions Involving Substance Use Attitudes toward substance use vary among Latino cultural groups, but Latinos are more likely to see substance use in negative terms than are White Americans. Marin (1998) found that Mexican Americans were signifi-cantly more likely to expect negative conse-quences and less likely to expect positive outcomes as a result of drinking than were White Americans. S imilarly, Hadjicostandi and Cheurprakobkit (2002) note that most Latinos believe that prescription drug abuse could have dangerous effects (85.7 percent), that individual s who abuse substances cause their whole families to suffer (81.4 percent), and that people who use illicit drugs will participate in violent crime (74.9 percent) and act violently toward family members (78.9 percent ). Driving under the influence of alco- hol is one of the most serious substance use problems in the Latino community. Other research suggests that some Latinos hold different alcohol expectancies. When comparing drinking patterns and alcohol expectancies among college students, Velez - Blasini (1997) found that Puerto Rican partic-ipant s were more likely than other students to see increased sociability as a positive expectan-cy related to drinking and sexual impairment as a negative expectancy. Puerto Rican partici-pants were also significantly more likely to report abstinence from alcohol. In another study comparing Puerto Ricans and Irish Americans, Puerto Rican participants who expected a loss of control when drinking had fewer alcohol -related problems, whereas Irish Americans who expected a loss of control had a greater number of such problems (Johnson and Glassman 1999). The authors concluded that \"losing control \" has a different cultural meaning for these two groups, which in turn affects how they use alcohol. For many Latino men, drinking alcohol is a part of social occasions and celebrations. By contrast, solitary drinking is discouraged and seen as d eviant. Social norms for Latinas are often quite different, and those who have substance abuse problems are judged much more harshly than men. Women can be per-ceived as promiscuous or delinquent in meet-ing their family duties because of their substance use (Hernandez 2000). Amaro and Aguiar (1995) note that the heavy emphasis on the idealization of motherhood contributes to the level of denial about the prevalence of substance use among La tinas. Women who use injection drugs feel the need to maintain their roles as daughters, mothers, partners, and community members by separating their drug use from the rest of their lives (Andrade and Estrada 2003), yet research suggests that substance abu se among women does not go unrecognized within the Latino community (Hadjicostandi and Cheurprakobkit 2002). Among families, Latino adults generally show strong disapproval of alcohol use in adoles-cents of either gender (Flores -Ortiz 1994). Adults of both genders generally disapprove of the initiation of alcohol use for youth 16 years of age and under (Rodriguez -Andrew 1998). Long (1990) also found that even among Latino families in which there has been multi-generational drug abuse, young people were rarely initiated into drug abuse by family members. However, evidence regarding paren-tal substance use and its influence on youth has been mixed; most studies show some correlation between parental attitudes toward alcohol use and youth drinking (Rodriguez - Andre w 1998). For instance, research with college students found that family influences 129 Improving Cultural Competence had a significant effect on drinking in Latinos but not White Americans; the magnitude of this effect was greater for Latinas than for Latino men (Corbin et al. 2008). Substance Use and Substance Use Disorders According to 201 2 NSDUH data, rates of past-month illicit substance use, heavy drink- ing, and binge drinking among Latinos were lower than for White Americans, Blacks, and Native Americans, but not significantly so (SAMHSA 201 3d). The same data showed that 8.3 percent of Latinos reported past - month illicit drug use compared with 9.2 percent of White Americans and 11.3 percent of African Americans. Although data are available from a number of studies regarding Latino drinking and drug use patterns, more targeted research efforts are needed to unravel the complexities of sub-stance use and the many factors that affect use, abuse, and dependence among subgroups of Latino origin (Rodriguez -Andrew 1998). For example, some studies show that Latino men are more likely to have an alcohol use disorder than are White American men (Caetano 2003), whereas others have found the reverse to be true (Schmidt et al. 2007). Disparities in survey result s may reflect varying efforts to develop culturally responsive criteria (Carle 2009; Hasin et al. 2007). The table in Exhibit 5-2 shows lifetime prevalence of substance use disorders among Latinos based on Exhibit 5 -2: Lifetime Prevalence of Substance Use Disorders According to Ethnic Subgroup and Immigration Status Ethnic Subgroup Any Substa nce Use Disorder, % Alcohol Abuse , % Alcohol Dependence, % Drug Abuse , % Drug Dependence, % Puerto Ricans (born in the U.S. mainland ) 15.9 7.7 5.6 4.6 4.3 Puerto Ricans (born in Puerto Rico) 11.1 4.6 5.3 4.3 3.6 Cuban Americans (born in the U.S.) 20.9 6.5 8.2 3.6 5.7 Cuban Americans (foreign -born) 6.4 3.4 2.2 2.2 1.9 Mexican Ameri- cans (born in the U.S.) 21.4 9.4 7.7 5.8 5.3 Mexican Ameri- cans ( foreign -born) 7 3.5 2.8 2.0 1.7 Other Latino (born in the U.S. ) 20.4 10.4 5.3 8.4 5.2 Other Latino (foreign- born) 5.7 3.2 2.2 2.1 1.0 Source: Alegria et al. 2008a . 130 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups immigration status and ethnic subgroup (Alegria et al. 2008a ). Among di verse Latino cultural groups, differ- ent patterns of alcohol use exist. For example, some older research suggests that Mexican American men are more likely to engage in binge drinking (having five or more drinks at one time; drinking less frequently, but in higher quantities) than other Latinos but use alcohol less frequently (Caetano and Clark 1998). There are also differences regarding the abuse of other substances. Among Latinos entering substance abuse treatment in 2006, heroin and methamphetamine use were espe-cially high among Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans, respectively. Other research has found that Puerto Ricans are more likely to inject drugs and tend to inject more often during the course of a day than do other Latinos (Singer 1999). Patterns of su bstance use are also linked to gender, age, socioeconomic status, and accul-turation in complex ways (Castro et al. 1999 a; Wahl and Eitle 2010). For instance, increased frequency of drinking is associated with great-er acculturation for Latino men and women , yet the drinking patterns of Latinas are affect-ed significantly more than those of Latino men (Markides et al. 2012; Zemore 2005). Age appears to influence Latino drinking patterns somewhat differently than it does for other racial/ethnic groups. Research indicates that White Americans often \"age out \" of heavy drinking after frequent and heavy al co- hol use in their 20s, but for many Latinos, drinking peaks between the ages 30 and 39. Latinos in this age range have the lowest abstention rates and the highest proportions of frequent and heavy drinkers of any age group ( Caetano and Clark 1998). In the same study, Latino men between 40 and 60 years of age had higher rates of substance use disorders than men in the same age group across other racial/ethnic populations. Latino youth appear to start using illicit drugs at an earlier age than do members of other major ethnic/racial groups. Cumulative data from 28 years of the Monitoring the Future Study show Latino eighth graders as having higher rates of heavy drinking, marijuana use, cocaine use, and heroin use than African or White Americans in the same grade. Among youth in grade 12, the rates of use among Latino and White American students are more similar, but Latinos still had the highest rates of crack cocaine and injected heroin use ( Johnston et al. 2003). Patterns of substance use and abuse vary based on Latinos ' specific cultural background s. Among Latinos, rates of past -year alcohol dependence were higher among Puerto Rican and Mexican American men (15.3 percent and 15.1 percent, respectively) than among South/Central Am erican or Cuban American men (9 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively). Among Latinas, past -year alcohol dependence rates were significantly higher for Puerto Rican women (6.4 percent) than for Mexican American (2.1 percent), Cuban American (1.6 percent), or South/Central American (0.8 percent ) women (Caetano et al. 2008). Mental and Co -Occurring Disorders As with other populations, it is important to address CODs in Latino clients, as CODs have been associated with higher rates of treatment dropout (Amodeo et al. 2008). There are also reports of diagnostic bias, sug-gesting that some disorders are underreported and other s are overreported. Minsky et al. (2003) found that , at one large mental health treatment site in New Jersey, major depression was overdiagnosed among Latinos, especially Latinas, wh ereas psychotic symptoms were 131 Improving Cultural Competence sometimes ignored. Among Latinos with CODs, other mental disorders preceded the development of a substance use disorder 70 percent of the time (Vega et al. 2009). Overall, research indicates fewer mental disor-ders and CODs among Latinos than among White Americans (Alegria et al. 2008 a; Vega et al. 2009). However, data from the 2012 NSDUH indicate that the magnitude of the difference may be decreas ing; 1.2 percent of Latinos had both serious mental illness and substance use disorders in the prior year, as did White Americans, similar to the rate seen among African Americans (0.9 percent; SAMHSA 201 3c). When any mental disorder symptoms co -occurring with a substance use disorder diagnosis were evaluated, Latinos had a slightly higher rate of co -occurrence (3.4 percent) than did African Americans ( 3.3 percent; SAMHSA 201 3c). Rates of mental disorders and CODs also vary by Latino subgroup (Alegria et al. 2008 a), and accultura- tion can play a confounding, but inconsistent, role in the identification and development of CODs in Latino populations (Alegria et al. 2008a ; Vega et al. 2009). Treatment Patterns Barriers to treatment entry for Latinos in-clude, but are not limited to, lack of Spanish - speaking service providers, limited English proficiency, financial constraints, lack of cul- turally responsive service s, fears about immi- gration status and losing custody of children while in treatment, negative attitudes toward providers, and discrimination (Alegria et al. 2012; Mora 2002). Among all ethnic/racial groups included in the 2010 NSDUH, Lati-nos were the most likely to report that they had a need for treatment but did not receive it because they could not find a program with the appropriate type of treatment or because there were no openings in programs that they wished to attend , which may reflect a lack of linguistically and/or culturally appropriate services (SAMHSA 2011 c). They were about twice as likely to state the former and four times as likely to state the latter as members of the group that was the next most likely to make such statements. A significant problem prohibiting participa-tion in substance abuse treatment among Latinos is the lack of insurance coverage to pay for treatment. In SAMHSA 's 2010 NSDUH, 32 percent of Latinos who needed but did not receive substance abuse treatment in the past year r eport ed that they lacked mon- ey or insurance coverage to pay for it compared with 29.5 percent of White Americans and 33.5 percent of African Americans (SAMHSA 2011c ). Other national surveys also found that Latinos with self -identified drinking problems were significantly more likely than either White Americans or African Americans to indicate that they did not seek treatment because of logistical barriers, such as a lack of funds or being unable to obtain childcare (Schmidt et al. 2007). Latinos with substance use disorders are about as likely to enter substance abuse treatment programs as White Americans (Hser et al. 1998; Perron et al. 2009; Schmidt et al. 2006). Latinos tend to enter treatment at a younger age than either African Americans or White Ameri cans (Marsh et al. 2009). There are also significant differences in treatment -seeking patterns among Latino cultural groups. For example, Puerto Ricans who inject heroin are much more likely to participate in methadone main -tenance and less likely to enter other less-effective detoxification programs than are Dominicans , Central Americans, and other Latinos (Reynoso -Vallejo et al. 2008). The researchers note, however, that this could be due partially to the fact that Puerto Ricans, compared with other Latin os, have a greater awareness of treatment options. 132 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups Beliefs and Attitudes About Treatment In general, Latino attitudes toward health care are shaped by a lack of access to regular quality care, including inability to afford it (see review of health beliefs and help -seeking behavio rs among Mexican Americans and Mexicans dwelling in the United States in Rogers 2010). DeNavas -Walt et al. (2006) found that Lati- nos are less likely to have health insurance (32.7 percent were uninsured in 2005) than either non -Latino White Americans (11.3 percent were uninsured) or African Americans (19.6 percent were uninsured). They are also less likely to have had a regular place to go for conventional medical care (Schiller et al. 2005). Lack of knowledge about available servic es can be a major obstacle to seeking services (Vega et al. 2001). In their review, Murguia et al. (2000) identified several factors that influence the use of medical services, including cultural health beliefs, demographic barriers, level of acculturation , English profi- ciency, accessibility of service providers, and flexibility of intake procedures; they found that many Latinos only seek medical care for serious illnesses. Research on substance abuse indicates that Latinos who use illicit drugs appear to h ave relatively unfavorable attitudes toward treat-ment and perceive less need for treatment than do illicit drug users among every other major ethnic and racial group but Native Americans (Brower and Carey 2003). However, in the 2011 NSDUH, Latinos were more likely than White Americans, African Americans, or Asian Americans to indicate that they had a need for substance abuse treatment in the prior year but did not receive it (SAMHSA 2012b ). Other studies have found that Latinos with substance use disorders are about as likely to enter substance abuse treatment programs as other racial and ethnic groups (Hser et al. 1998; Perron et al. 2009; Schmidt et al. 2006). Latinos who receive substance abuse treatment also report less satisfaction with the services they receive than White or African Americans (Wells et al. 2001). Even when receiving a level of substance abuse treatment services comparable to those received by White and African America ns, Latinos are more likely to be dissatisfied with treatment (Tonigan 2003). Treatment Issues and Considerations Latino clients ' responsiveness to therapy is influenced not only by counselor and program characteristics, but also by individual charac-teristics, including worldview, degree of accul- turation, gender orientation , religious beliefs, and personality traits. As with other cultural groups, efforts to establish clear communica-tion and a strong therapeutic alliance are essential to positive treatment outcomes among Latino clients. Foremost, counselors should recognize the importance of \u2014and integrate into their counseling style and ap- proach \u2014expressions of concern, interest in clients' families, and personal warmth ( person- alismo ; Ishikawa et al. 2010). Counselors and clinical supervisors need to be educated about culturally specific attributes that can influence participation and clinical interpretation of client behavior in treatment. For instance, some Latino cultural groups view time as more flexible and less structured; thus, rather than negatively interpreting the client 's behavior regarding the keeping of strict schedules or appointment times, counselors should adopt scheduling strategies that pro-vide more flexibility (Alvarez and Ruiz 2001; Sue 2001). However, counselors should also advise Latino clients of the need to take rele-vant actions with the aim of arriving on time for each appointment or group session. Coun- selors should try to avoid framing noncompli- ance in Latino clients as resistance or anger. It 133 Improving Cultural Competence is often, instead , a pelea nonga (relaxed fight) showing both a sense of being misunderstood and respeto (respect that also encompasses a sense of duty) for the counselor 's authority (Bar\u00f3n 2000; Medina 2001). Unfortunately, many providers who wo rk with Latino cultural groups continue to have mis-perceptions and can even see culture as a hindrance to effective treatment rather than as a source of potential strength (Quintero et al. 2007). For instance, in treating the alcohol problems of Latinas, m any counselors believe that they should not incorporate endorsement of traditional and possibly harmful cultural patterns into the services they provide (Mora 2002). However, o ther counselors note that the transformative value of the most positive aspects of Latino cultural groups can be em- phasized: strength, perseverance, flexibility, and an ability to survive (Gloria and Peregoy 1996). Respecting women 's choices can mean suppor ting empowerment to pursue new roles and make new choices free of alcohol, guilt, and discrimination (Mora 2002). F or others, it can m ean reinvigorating the positivity of Latina culture to promote abstinence while respecting and maintaining traditional family roles for wome n (Gloria and Peregoy 1996). Because some research has found that Latinos have higher rates of treatment dropout than other populations (Amaro et al. 2006), pro-grams working with this population should consider ways to improve retention and out-come s. Treatment retention issues for Latinos can be similar to those fo und for other popu- lations (Amodeo et al. 2008), but culturally specific treatment has been associated with better retention for Latinos (Hohman and Galt 2001). Research evaluating ethnic match-ing with brief motivational interventions also found more favora ble substance abuse treat- ment outcome s at 12- month follow -up when client s and providers were ethnically matched (Field and Caetano 2010). A vailable literature and research highlight four main themes sur- rounding general counseling issues and pro-grammatic st rategies for Latinos, as follows . Socializing the client to treatmen t: Latino clients are likely to benefit from orien tation sessions that review treatment and counseling processes, treatment goals and expectations, and other components of services ( Organi sta 2006). Reassurance of confidentialit y: Regardless of the particular mode of therapy, counselors should explain confidentiality. Many Latinos, especially undocumented workers or recent immigrants, are fearful of being discovered by authorities like the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services and subsequentl y deported back to their countries of origin (Ramos -Sanchez 2009). Client -counselor matching based on gen- der: To date, research does not provide con- sistent findings on client -counselor matc hing based on similarity of Latino ethnicity. How-ever, client -counselor matching based on gender alone appears to have a greater effect on improving engagement and abstinence among Latinos than it does for clients of other ethnicities (Fiorentine and Hillh ouse 1999). Client -program matching : Matching clients to ethnicity -specific programs appears to improve outcomes for Latinos. Takeuchi et al. (1995) found that only 68 percent of Mexican American clients in programs that had a majority of White American clients returned after the first session compared with 97 per- cent in those programs where the majority of clients were Mexican American. Theoretical Approaches and Treatment Interventions Overall, research evaluating cultural ad option of promising or evide nce-based practices in 134 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups treatment specifically for Latinos is scarce (Carvajal and Young 2009). For instance, empirical literature evaluating CBT specifical- ly for substance abuse and substance use dis-orders in Latinos is quite limited. Still, a number of authors recommend CBT for Latinos in mental health and substance abuse treatment settings because it is action oriented, problem focused, and didactic (Alvarez and Ruiz 2001; Organista 2006; Organista CBT 's didactic component can educate Latinos about disorders and frame therapy as an educational (and hence less shameful) experience. However, Organista 's (2006) review of available research on CBT for mental disorders among Latinos suggests that this approach is not always as effective with Latinos as it is with other populations. Other effective interventions include contin-gency management and motivational inter-viewing; see the review by Amaro et al. (2006) for more on these interventions. Methadone maintenance, too, has been associated with long-term reductions in the use of alcohol as well as heroin and other illicit drug s among Mexican Americans with opioid use disorders, although 33 percent of the original cohort died before the 22 -year longitudinal study concluded (Goldstein and Herrera 1995). Another therapeutic intervention that can improve outcomes for Latino clients is node-link mapping (visual representation using information diagrams, fill -in-the blank graph- ic tools, and client -generated dia grams or visual maps), which has been associated with lower levels of opioid and cocaine use, better treatment attendance, and higher counselor ratings of motivation and confidence for Latinos in methadone maintenance treatment (Dansereau et al. 1996; Dansereau and Simp-son 2009). For a review of L atino outcome studies in health, substance abuse, and mental health in social work, refer to Jani and col- leagues (2009). Family therapy Family therapy is often recommended for treating Latinos with substance use disorders (Amaro et al. 2006; Bar\u00f3n 2000; He rnandez 2000). Although there is little research evalu-ating the effectiveness of family therapy for adults, both multidimensional family therapy (Liddle 2010) and brief strategic family thera-py (Santisteban et al. 1997 ; Santisteban et al. 2003; Szapocznik and Williams 2000) have been found to reduce substance use and im-prove psychological functioning among Latino youth. The term familismo refers to the cen- trality of the family in Latino culture and can include valuing and protecting children, re-specting the elderly, preserving the family name, and consulting with one another before making important decisions. As highlighted in the case study of a Puerto Rican client on the next page , counselors must consider the poten- tially pivotal ro les families can play in support- ing treatment and recovery. Latino families are likely to have a strong sense of obligation a nd commitment to helping their members, in-cluding those who have substance use disor-ders. Even so, the level of family support for people who have substance use or mental disor ders varies among Latinos depending on country of origin, level of acculturation, degree of family cohesion, socioeconomic status, and factors related to substance use (Alegria et al. 2012). For example, Reynoso -Vallejo et al. (2008) concluded that significantly higher rates of homelessness found among people from Central American countries who inject- ed heroin compared with other Latinos could stem from lower levels of tolerance for in jec- tion drug use among their families. For counselors who lack cultural understand-ing, it can be easy to simply label and judge families ' behavior as enabling or codependent. Instead, counselors should move away from labeling the behavior and focus more o n help- ing families recognize how their behavior can 135 Improving Cultural Competence affect one member 's substance abuse and how best to handle it. The advice box on the next page provides general therapeutic guidelines for working with Latino families. Group therapy Little information is available concerning Latinos ' preferences in behavioral health services, but a study evaluating mental health treatment preferences for women in the Unit-ed States found that Latinas were significantly more likely to prefer group treatment (Nadeem et al. 2008). According to Paniagua (1998), the use of group therapy with Latino clients should emphasize a prob lem-focused approach. Group leaders should allow mem-bers to learn from each other and resist func-tioning as a content expert or a representative of the rules of the system. Otherwise, mem-bers could see group therapy as oppressive. Facilitators in groups co nsisting mostly of Latino clients must establish trust, responsibil- ity, and loyalty among members. In addition, acculturation levels and language preference s should be assessed when forming groups so that culturally specific or Spanish -speaking groups can be made available if needed . Mutual-help groups Findings on the usefulness of 12 -Step groups for Latino clients are inconsistent. Member-ship surveys of AA indicate that Latinos comprise about 5 percent of AA membership (AAWS 2012). Latinos who received in patient treatment were less likely to attend AA than White Americans (Arroyo et al. 1998). Rates Case Study: A Puerto Rican Client Anna is a 27- year- old woman who was born in New York and self- identifies as Puerto Rican. She has a 12th- grade education, is unemployed, and lives with her parents, her 4 -year-old daughter, and a nephew. Anna is separated from her partner, who is also her daughter 's father. She entered treat- ment as a result of feeling depressed ever since her partner physically as saulted her because she refused to use heroin (the even t that sparked their separation). She states, \"I want to be clean and take care of my family.\" At intake, she had just undergone detoxification and had stopped using alcohol, crack cocaine, and heroin. Anna states that she feels guilty about her drug use and the way it caused her to neglect her family. She has been having serious problems with her mother, who is critical of her substance use, but believes that her mother is important in her recovery because of the structure she provides at home. She describes her father as a very important figure with whom she enjoys spending time. Her father had stopped drinking 9 years before and is very supportive of her abstinence. He is willing to help in any way he can but has been very sick lately and was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Her father had never received treatment for his drinking problem, and her mother believes that Anna should be able to stop just like her father did. As she describes her situation in treatment, Anna 's verg\u00fcenza (shame) and sense of hopelessness is very evident. She fears her father 's death and her mother 's subsequent rejection of her for not helping out. Anna 's treatment includes family therapy to restructure communication patterns, rules, expecta - tions, and roles. For family sessions, either her mother or both parents participate, depending on her father' s physical condition. Initially, her parents displayed a tend ency to focus on the prob lems of the past, but the counselor directed them to focus on changes needed to help Anna 's recove ry. The counselor has also worked with other family members to rally support and use their strengths while also clarifying perceptions, feelings, and behaviors that will help them function as a family unit. Anna 's counselor recognizes that, within the context of her culture, her reliance on her family can be used to aid her recovery and that her family, as defined by Anna, can be used as a support system.

Use family therapy as a primary method of treatment. Assess cultural identity and acculturation level for each family member. Determine the family 's level of belief in traditional and com plementary healing practices; integrate these as appropriate. Discuss the family 's beliefs, history, and experiences with standard American be-havioral health services. Explore migration and immigration experi-ences, if appropriate. Provide additional respect to the father or father figure in the family. Interview family members or groups of family members (e.g., children) separately to allow them to voice concerns. Generate solutions with the family. Do not force changes in family relationships. Provide specific, concrete suggestions for change that can be quickly implemented. Focus on engaging the family in the first session usin g warmth and personalismo. Sources: Bean et al. 2001; Hernandez 2005; Lynch and Hanson 2011 . of mutual -help participation among people with drug use disorders are also lower for Latinos (Perron et al. 2009). Language can present a barrier to mutual -help group partici- pation for Spanish -speaking Latinos; however, Spanish -language meetings are held in some locations. Counselors should consider the appropriateness of 12 -Step participation on a case-by-case basis (Alvarez and Ruiz 2001). For example, Mexican American men who identify with attitudes of machismo can feel uncomfortable with the 12 -Step approach. Concern about divulging family issues in public can cause hesitation to address substance - related problems in public meetings. For Latinos who do partici pate in 12 -Step programs, findings suggest higher rate s of abstinence, degree of commitment, and level of engagement than for White American participants (Hoffman 1994; Tonigan et al. 1998). For some Latinos, 12- Step groups can appeal to religious and spiritual beliefs. Her-nandez (2000) suggests that mutual -help groups composed solely of Latinos make it easier for participants to address the cultural context of substance abuse. Some Latino 12 - Step groups do not hold that substance abuse is a biopsychosocial problem, instead concep- tualizing the disorder as a weakness of charac-ter that must be corrected. Hoffman (1994) studied Latino 12 -Step groups in Los Angeles and observed that , in addition to a more traditional form of AA, there were groups that practiced terapia dura (i.e., rough therapy), which often uses a confrontational approach and endorses family values related to machismo (e.g., by reinforcing that overcoming substance abuse rather than drinking is manly). Howev-er, these groups were not overly welco ming of female members and gay men. In such cases, gay Latino men and Latinas can benefit from attending 12 -Step groups that are not cultur- ally specific or that do not use terapia dura . Traditional healing and complementary methods In a study of the use of alternative and com- plementary medical therapies, Latinos were less likely to use medical alternatives than were White Americans (Graham et al. 2005). However, those who did use such approaches were more likely to do so because they could not afford standa rd medical care (Alegria et al. 2012). As in other areas, the use of comple-mentary and traditional medicine likely varies according to acculturation level and country of origin. For instance, the use of faith and reli-gious practices to cope with mental and emo- tional problems is significantly more common among foreign -born Latinos than among those born in the United States (Nadeem et al. 2008; Vega et al. 2001). 137 Improving Cultural Competence Many Latinos place great importance on the practice of Roman Catholicism. Yamamoto and Acosta (1982) describe the central tenets of Latino Catholicism as sacrifice, charity, and forgiveness. These beliefs can hinder assertive- ness in some Latinos, but they can also be a source of strength and recovery. Traditionally, Latin os have been Catholic, although several Protestant and evangelical groups have con-verted millions of Latinos to their religions since the 1970s. Some Latinos also believe in syncretistic religions (e.g., Santer \u00eda or Curanderismo) or practices derived from them and make use of a variety of traditional heal- ing practices and rituals to heal mental and spiritual ailments (Lefley et al. 1998; Sandoval 1979). Among Puerto Ricans, espiritismo (spirit ualism) is a popular t raditional healing system successfully used to address mental health issues (Lynch and Hanson 2011; Moli-na 2001). Some Mexican Americans rely on curanderos , folk healers who address problems that might be framed as psychological (Falicov 2005, 2012). For a review of culturally respon- sive interventions with Latinos, refer to Gallardo and Curry (2009). Relapse prevention and recovery There are no substantial studies evaluating the use of relapse prevention and recovery promo-tion with Latinos, yet literature s uggests that they would be appropriate and effective for this population (Blume et al. 2005; Castro et al. 2007). Overall, Latinos can face somewhat different triggers for relapse relating to accul-turative stress or the need to uphold particular cultural values (e.g., personalismo, machismo ; Castro et al. 2007), which can lead to higher rates of relapse among some Latino clients. For example, in a study of relapse patterns among White American and Latino individu-als who used methamphetamine , Brecht et al. (2000) found that Latino participants relapsed more quickly than White American participants. Data are lacking on long -term recovery for Latinos. Given the many obstacles that block accessibility to treatment for Latinos, continu-ing care planning can benefi t from greater use of informal or peer supports. For example, White and Sanders (2004) recommend the use of a recovery management approach with Latinos. They point to an early example of the East Harlem Protestant Parish 's work, which helped Puerto Rican individuals recovering from heroin dependence connect to social clubs and religious communities that sup- ported recovery. Latinos use community and family support in addition to spirituality to address mental disorders (Lynch and Hanson 2011; Molina 2001). Castro et al. (2007) also note that family support systems can be espe-cially important for Latinos in recovery. Counseling for Native Americans There are 566 federally recognized American Indian Tribes, and their members speak more than 150 languages ( U.S. Department of the Interior, Indian Affairs 2013a ); there are numerous other Tribes recognized only by states and others that still go unrecognized by government agencies of any sort. According to the 2010 U.S. Census (Norris et al. 2012), the majority (78 percent) of people who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native, either alone or in combination with one or more other races, lived outside of American Indian and Alaska Native areas. Approximately 60 percent of the 5.2 million people who identi-fied as American Indian or Alaska Native, alone or in combination with one or more other races, reside in urban areas (Norris et al. 2012). The category of Alaska Natives in-cludes four recognized Tribal groups \u2014 Alaskan Athabascan, Aleut, communities (Ogunwole 2006). 138 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups Native Americans who belong to federally recognized Tribes and communities are mem-bers of sovereign Indian nations that exist within the United States. On lands belonging to these Tribes and communities, Native Americans are able to govern themselves to a large extent and are not subject to most state laws\u2014only to f ederal legislation that is specif- ically designated as applying to them (Henson 2008). Although health care (including sub- stance abuse treatment) is provided to many Native Americans by Indian Health Services (IHS), Tribal governments do have the option of taking over those services. Counselors working with these populations should re-member that Native Americans, by virtue of their membership in sovereign Tribal entities, have rights that are different from those of other Americans; this distinguishes them from members of other ethnic/racial groups. American Indians live in all 50 s tates; the states with the largest populations of Ameri- can Indians are Oklahoma, California, and Arizona. The 2000 Census allowed people to identify, for the first time, as a member of more than one race. Of persons who checked two or more race s, nearly one in five indicated that they were part American Indian or Alaska Native (U .S. Census Bureau 2001 a,b). Behavioral health service providers should recognize that Native American Tribes repre- sent a wide variety of cultural groups that differ fro m one another in many ways (Duran et al. 2007). Alaska Natives who live in coastal areas have very different customs from those inhabiting interior areas (Attneave 1982). The diversity of Native American Tribes notwith-standing, they also share a common bon d of respect for their cultural heritage s, histories, and spiritual beliefs, which are different from those of mainstream American culture.

Beliefs About and Traditions Involving Substance Use Few American Indian Tribes and no Alaska Natives consumed alcoholic beverages prior to contact with non -Native people, and those who did used alcohol primarily for special occasions and ceremonies. Most Tribes first encountered the use of alcohol when they encountered European settlers and traders. Because of this lack of experience with alco-hol, fe w Native Americans had a context for drinking besides what they learned from these non- Natives, who at the time drank in large quantities and often engaged in binge drink-ing. Although patterns of alcohol consump- tion in the mainstream population of the United States changed over time, they re- mained relatively the same in the more isolat-ed Native American communities. According to an NSDUH report on Ame rican Indian and Alaska Native adults, binge drinking continues to be a significant problem for these populations . Both binge drinking and illicit drug use is higher among Native Americans than the national average (30. 2 percent versus 23 percent and 12.7 percent versus 9.2 percent, respectively; SAMHSA 2013d ). American Indian drinking patterns vary a great deal by Tribe. Tribal attitudes toward alcohol influence consumption in complicated ways. For example, in Navajo communities, excessive drinking was acceptable if done in a group or during a social activity. However, solitary drinking (even in lesser amounts) was considered to be deviant (Kunitz et al. 1994). Kunitz et a l. (1994) observed that during the 1960s, binge drinking was acceptable among the Navajo during public celebrations, whereas any drinking was considered unacceptable among the neighboring Hopi population, 139 Improving Cultural Competence wherein regular drinkers were shunned or, in some cases, expelled from the community. Hopi individuals who did drink tended to do so alone or moved off the reservation to bor- der towns where heavy alcohol use was com-mon. The ostracism of H opi drinkers seemed to lead to even greater levels of abuse, given that there were much higher death rates from alcoholic cirrhosis among the Hopi than among the Navajo. Native American recovery movements have often viewed substance abuse as a result of cultural conflict between Native and Western cultures, seeing substances of abuse as weapons that have caused further loss of traditions (Coyhis and White 2006). To best treat this population, substance abuse treatment provid-ers need to expand their perspec tives regarding substance abuse and dependence and must embrace a broader view that explores the spiritual, cultural, and social ramifications of substance abuse (Brady 1995; Duran 2006; Jilek 1994). Substance Use and Substance Use Disorders According to 2 012 NSDUH data, American Indian and Alaska Native peoples have the highest rates of substance use disorders and binge drinking (SAMHSA 201 3d). Although rates of substance abuse are high among Native Americans, so too are rates of absti- nence. American India ns and Alaska Natives are more likely to report no alcohol use in the past year than are members of all other major racial and ethnic groups (OAS 2007). The American Indian Services Utilization and Psychiatric Epidemiology Risk and Protective Factors Proje ct (AI-SUPER PFP) also found that rates of lifetime abstinence from alcohol for American Indians in the study were signif-icantly higher than lifetime abstinence rates among the general population (Beals et al. 2003). Data on alcohol consumption also show t hat Alaska Natives are significantly more likely to abstain than are other Alaskans (Wells 2004). The most common pattern of abusive drink-ing among American Indians appears to be binge drinking followed by long periods of abstinence (French 2000; May and G ossage 2001). A similar pattern is seen among Alaska Natives (Seale et al. 2006; Wells 2004). As an example, the Urban Indian Health Institute (2008) found that binge drinking was signifi-cantly more common among the Native American population (with 21.3 percent engaging in binge drinking in the prior 30 days compared with 15.8 percent of non - Native Americans) and that, among those who drank, 40.7 percent of Native American par-ticipants engaged in binge drinking compared with 26.9 percent of non -Natives. There are a number of historical reasons for the development of binge drinking among Native Americans. The existence of dry reser-vations (which can limit the times when indi-viduals are able to get alcohol), high levels of poverty, lack of availability (e.g., in remote Alaska Native villages), a history of trauma, and the loss of cultural traditions can all con-tribute to the development and continuation of this pattern of drinking. Native Americans are also more likely than members of other major racial/ethnic groups to have had their first drink before the age of 21 or before the age of 16, which also may shape drinking patterns (SAMHSA 2011c ). However, data on heavy and binge drinking do not reflect the same pattern of alcohol con- sumption for all Native Americ an Tribes. One analysis of alcohol dependence among mem-bers of seven different Tribes found rates of dependence varying from 56 percent of men and 30 percent of women in one Tribe to 1 percent of men and 2 percent of women in another (Koss et al. 2003). Ot her research 140 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups confirms significant differences in alcohol use among diverse Native American communities (O'Connell et al. 2005; Whitesell et al. 2006). In addition to alcohol, methamphetamine and inhalant abuse are major concerns for a num-ber of Native American communities. None-theless, there are considerable regional differences in patterns and prevalence of drug use (Miller et al. 2012). According to th e National Congress of American Indians (2006), 74 percent of Tribal police forces ranked methamphetamine as the drug causing the most problems in their communities. Methamphetamine abuse can be even more serious for Native Americans living in rural areas than for those in urban areas , but it is also a serious problem for growing numbers of American Indians, especially women, entering treatment in urban areas (Spear et al. 2007). American Indians and Alaska Natives are more likely to report having used inh alants at some time during their lives, but use tends to peak in 8th grade and then decrease (Miller et al. 2012). In some Native American communi-ties ( e.g., on the Kickapoo reservation in Tex- as), inhalants have been a major drug of abuse for adults as wel l as youth. During the early 1990s, about 46 percent of the adult popula-tion on that reservation were thought to abuse inhalants (Fredlund 1994). Although more recent data are not available, reports from the area suggest that inhalant abuse remains a signi ficant problem (Morning Star 2005). Rates of substance use disorders appear to be higher in individuals who consider themselves exclusively Native American than for those who identify as more than one race/ethnicity, but even when surveys ask whether peopl e are of mixed race, those who report themselves to be partially Native American still have high rates of substance use disorders (OAS 2007). Native Americans are about 1.4 times more likely than White Americans to have a lifetime diagnosis of an alcohol u se disorder (Gilman et al. 2008). Illicit drug use is also more com-mon for Native Americans than for members of other major racial/ethnic groups. Among Native Americans entering treatment in 2010, alcohol use disorders alone or in conjunction with drug use disorders were the most pressing substance -related problem, with cannabis and opioids other than heroin being the next most common primary substances of abuse. One of the largest studies on American Indian substance use and abuse to date, the AI-SUPER PFP , found that 31.2 percent of American Indians met criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of a substance use disorder , and 13.4 percent met criteria for a past -year diagnosis (Beals et al. 2003). The study found that rates of alcohol use disorders were high among men from the three Tribes represented but varied to a greater degree among women across Tribes (Mitchell et al. 2003). American Indians have high rates of certain diseases and conditions. In particular, the incidence of diabetes is increasing among Native Americans , and approximately 38 percent of elder Native Americans have diabe- tes (Moulton et al 2005). Diabetes is also associated with both substance use disorders and depression in this population (Tann et al. 2007). Other health problems associated with alcohol use include fetal alcohol syndrome, cirrhosis, and depression. Mental and Co -Occurring Disorders According to the 201 2 NSDUH, 28.3 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives report having a mental illness, with approxi- mately 8.5 percent indicating serious mental illness in the past year (SAMHSA 201 3c). Native Americans were nearly twice as likely to have serious thoughts of suicide as members of other racial/ethnic populations, and more 141 Improving Cultural Competence than 10 percent reported a major depressive episode in the past year. Common disorders include depression, anxiety, and substance use. As with other groups, substance use disorders among Native Americans have been associated with increased rates of a variety of different mental disorders (Beals et al. 2002 ; Tann et al. 2007; Westermeyer 2001). The 2012 NSDUH revealed that 14 percent of Native Americans report ed both past-year substance use disor- ders and mental illness. Among those who report ed mental illness, nearly 5 percent re- ported several mental illnesses co -occurring with substance use disorders (SAMHSA 2013c ). Native American communities have experi-enced severe historical trauma and discrimina-tion (Brave Heart and DeBruyn 1998; Burgess et al. 2008). Studies suggest that many Native Americans suffer from elevated exposure to specific traumas (Beals et al. 2005; Ehlers et al. 2006; Manson 1996; Manson et al. 2005), and they may be more likely to develop PTSD as a result of this exposure than members of other ethnic/racial groups. PTSD comparison rates taken from the AI -SUPER PFP study and the National Comorbidity Study show that 12.8 percent of the Southwest Tribe sample and 11.5 percent of the Northern Plains Tribe sample met criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD compared with 4.3 percent of the general population (Beals et al. 2005). Trauma histories and PTSD are so prevalent among Native Americans in substance abuse treat-ment that Edwards (2003) recommends that assessment and treatment of trauma should be a standard procedure for behavioral health programs serving this population. For exam- ple, Native American veterans with substance use disorders are significantly more likely to have co -occurring PTSD than the general population of veterans with substance use disorders (Friedman et al. 1997). Treatm ent Patterns Despite a number of potential barriers to treatment (Venner et al. 2012), Native Ameri-cans a re about as likely as members of other racial/ethnic groups to enter behavioral health programs. According to data from the 2003 and 2011 NSDUH (SAMHSA , CBHSQ 2012), Native Americans were more likely to have received substance use treatment in the past year than persons from other racial/ethnic groups (15.0 percent versus 10.2 percent). Other studies indicate that about one -third of Native Americans wit h a current substance use disorder had received treatment in the prior year (Beals et al. 2006; Herman -Stahl and Chong 2002). The 2012 NSDUH reported that approximately 15 percent of Native Americans received mental health treatment (SAMHSA 2013c ). Native Americans were least likely of all major ethnic/racial groups to state that they could not find the type of program they needed and were the next least likely after Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders to state that they did not know where to go or that their insurance did not cover needed treatment. Among Native Americans who identified a need for treat-ment in the prior year but did not enter treat-ment, the most commonly cited reas ons for not attending were lack of transportation, lack of time , and concerns about what one 's neigh- bors might think (SAMHSA 2011c ). Many Native Americans, especially those residing on reservations or other Tribal lands, seek mental health and substance abuse treat-ment through Tribal service providers or IHS (Jones -Saumty 2002; McFarland et al. 2006). However, an analysis using multiple sources found that 67 percent of Native Americans entering substance abuse treatment over the course of a year did so in urban areas, and the majority of those urban -based programs were not operated by IHS (McFarland et al. 2006). 142 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups The same research also found that Native Americans were somewhat more likely than the general treatment -seeking population to enter residential programs. Native Americans were more likely to enter treatment as a result of criminal justice refer- rals than were White Americans or African Americans: 47.9 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives entering public treatment programs in 2010 were court -ordered to treatment compared with 36.6 percent of White Americans and 36.4 pe rcent of African Americans ( SAMHSA, CBHSQ 2012). The lack of recognition of special needs and knowledge of Native American cultures within behavioral health programs may be the main reasons for low treatment retention and un-deruse of help -seeking behaviors among Native Americans (LaFromboise 1993; Sue and Sue 2013e ). Beliefs and Attitudes About Treatment Duran et al. (2005) evaluated obstacles to treatment entry among American Indians on three different reservations; most frequent ly mentioned were the perception that good - quality or suitable services were un available and the perceived need for individuals to be self-reliant. They also found social relation- ships to be extremely important in overcoming these barriers. Jumper -Thurman and Plested (1998) reported that focus groups of American Indian women listed mistrust as one of the primary barriers for seeking treatment. This is due, in part, to the women 's belief that they would encounter people they knew among treatment agency staff; they also doubted the confidentiality of the treatment program. Treatment Issues and Considerations Each Tribe and community will likely have different customs, healing tra ditions, and beliefs about treatment providers that can influence not only willingness to participate in treatment services, but also the level of trust clients have for providers. Counselors and other behavioral health workers must develop ongoing relationships within local Native American communit ies to gain knowledge of the unique attributes of each community, to show investment in the community, and to learn about community resources ( Exhibit 5 - 3). Identifying and developing resources with-in Native communit ies can help promote culturally congruent relationships. Exhibit 5 -3: Native Americans and Community Many Native A mericans believe that recovery cannot happen for individuals alone and that their en tire community has become sick. Coyhis calls this the \"healing forest\" model : one cannot take a sick tree from a sick forest, heal it, and put it back in the same environ- ment expecting that it will thrive. Instead, the community must embrace recovery. Today, community development models are being implemented in American Indian and Alaska Native communities to address preven-tion and treatment issues for men tal and sub- stance use disorders as well as related issues , such as suicide prevention (Edwards and Egbert- Edwards 1998; HHS 2010; May et al. 2005). Using these models, communities move toward greater commitment to social problem - solving and the development of effective, culturally congruent strategies relevant to their Tribes or villages. According to Edwards et al. (1995), community approaches often lead to: A reduction of substance use. Breaking intergenerational cycles of alco-hol abuse. Increased community support. The strengthening of individual and group cultural identity. Leadership development. Increased interpersonal and inter -Tribal problem -solving skills and solidarity. For an example, see Jumper- Thurman et al. (2001). 143 Improving Cultural Competence To provide cu lturally responsive treatment, providers need to understand the Native American client 's Tribe; its history, traditions, worldview, and beliefs; the dimensions of its substance abuse problem and other communi-ty problems; the incidence of trauma and abuse among its members; its traditional healing practices; and its intrinsic strengths . Providers who work with Native Americans but do not have an understanding of their cultural identity and acculturation patterns are at a distinct disadvantage (Ponterotto et al. 2000). Before beginning any treatment, pro-viders should routinely seek consultation with knowledgeable professionals who are experi-enced in working with the specific Tribal group in question (Duran 2006; Edwards and Egbert -Edwards 1998; Straits et al. 2012) and should conduct thorough client assessments that evaluate cultural identity ( see Appendix F and Ch apter 2 for resources). Some Native American persons have a strong connection to their cultures and others do not; some identify with a blend of Amer ican Indian cultural groups called pan -Indianism or inter -Tribal identity. Still others are comfortable with a dual ide ntity that embraces both Native and non- Native cultural groups. Native Americans often approach the begin-ning of a relationship in a calm , unhurried manner, and they may need more time to develop trust with providers. C oncerns about confidentiality can be an important issue to address with Native American clients, espe-cially for those in small, tightly -knit commu- nities. For providers, it is very important to make clear to clients that what they say to the counselor will be held in confidence, except when there is an ethical duty to report. Native American cultural groups generally believe that health is nurtured through balance and living in harmony with nature and the community (Duran 2006; Garrett et al. 2012). They also, for the most part, have a holistic view of health that incorporates physical, emotional, and spiritual elements (Calabrese 2008), individual and community healing (Duran 2006; McDonald and Gonzalez 2006), and prevention and treatment activities (Johnston 2002). For many, culture is the path to prevention and treatment. However, not all Native Americans have a need to develop stronger connections to their communities and cultural groups. As Brady (1995) cautions, culture is complex and chang-ing, and a return to the values of a traditional culture is not always desired. An initial inquiry into each client 's connection with his or her culture, cultural identity, and desire to incor-porate cultural beliefs and practices into treatm ent is an essential step in culturally competent practice . When appropriate, pro- viders can help facilitate the client 's reconnec- tion with his or her community and cultural values as an integral part of the treatment plan. In addition, treatment providers need to adapt services to be culturally responsive. In doing so, outcomes are likely to improv e not only for Native American clients, but for all clients within the program. Fisher et al. (1996) modified a therapeutic community in Alaska to incorporate Alaska Native spiritual and cultural practices and found that retention rates improved for White and African Ameri-can clients as well as Alaska Native clients participating in the program. In working with Native American clients, providers should be prepared to address spirit-uality and to help clients access traditional healing practices. Culturally responsive treat-ment should involve community events, group activities, and the ability to participate in ceremonies to help clients achieve balance and find new insight (Calabrese 2008). Stronger attachment to Native American cultural groups protects against substance use and 144 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups abuse; therefore, strengthening this connection is important in substance abuse treatment (Duran 2006; Moss et al. 2003; Spicer 2001; Stone et al. 2006). Theoretical Approaches and Treatment Interventions Some clinicians caution that a model of coun- seling that requires self -disclosure to relative strangers can be counterproductive with Native American clients. Other authors recommend CBT and social learning approaches for Native American clients, as such approaches typically have less cultural bias, focus on prob-lem-solving and skill development, emphasize client strengths and empowerment, recognize the need to accept personal responsibility for change, and make use of learning styles that many Native Americans find culturally ap-propriate (Heilbron and Guttman 2000; McDonald and Gonzalez 20 06). Motivational interviewing is also recommended for Native American clients. In a small study, Villanueva et al. (2007) found that all treatment modali-ties resulted in improvements at 15 -month follow -up, but clients who received motiva- tional enhancement therapy reported signifi- cantly fewer drinks per drinking day during the 10 - to 15 -month posttreatment follow -up period. Venner et al. (2006) wrote a manual for motivational interviewing with Native American clients. Family therapy Family involvement in treatment leads to better outcomes for Native Americans at the time of discharge from treatment (Chong and Lopez 2005). Research also suggests that family and community support can have a significant effect on recovery from substance use disorders for this population ( Jones - Saumty 2002; Paniagua 1998). Family therapy can be quite helpful and perhaps even essential for American Indian clients (Coyhis 2000), especially when other social supports are lacking ( Jones -Saumty 2002) . American Indians place high va lue on family and exte nded family networks; restoring or healing family bonds can be therapeutic for clients with substance use disorders. Moreo-ver, Native American clients are sometimes less motivated to engage in \"talk therapy \" and more willing to partic ipate in therapeutic activities that involve social and family rela-tionships ( Joe and Mal ach 2011). Treatment approaches should remain flexible and in- clude clients ' famil ies when appropriate. Counselors should be able to recognize what constitutes famil y, family constellations, and Advice to Counselors: Counseling Native Americans When working with Native American clients, providers should: Use active listening and reflective re-sponses. Avoid interrupting the client. Refrain from asking about family or per-sonal matters unrelated to substance abuse without first asking the client 's permission to inquire about these areas. Avoid extensive note- taking or excessive questioning. Pay attention to the client 's stories, experi- ences, dreams, and rituals and their rele-vance to the client. Recogn ize the importance of listening and focus on this skill during sessions . Accept extended periods of silence during session s. Allow time during sessions for the client to process information. Greet the client w ith a gentle (rather than firm) handshake and show hospitality (e.g., by offering food and/or beverages). Give the client ample time to adjust to the setting at the beginning of each session. Keep promises. Offer suggestions instead of directions (preferably more than one to allow for cli-ent choice).

The Native American concept of family can include elders, others from the same clan, or individuals who are not biologically related. In many Tribes, all mem-bers are considered relatives. Families can be matrilineal (i.e., kinship is traced through the female line) and/or matrilocal (i.e., married couples live with wife 's parents). When families do enter treatment, they may initially prefer to focus on a concrete problem, but not necessarily on the most si gnificant family issue. Discussion of a clearly defined presenting problem enables families to assess the therapeutic process and better understand what is expected of them in treatment. Provid-ers should be aware that the entire clan and/or Tribe could know about a given client 's treat- ment and progress. Family therapy models such as network therapy, which makes use of support structures outside the immediate family and which were originally developed for Native American families living in urban communities, can be particularly effective with Native clients, especially when they have been cut off from their home communities because of substance abuse or other issues. For more information on network therapy and similar approaches, see TIP 39, Substance Abuse Treatment and Family Therapy (CSAT 2004b ). Group therapy Although researchers and providers once viewed group therapy as ineffective for Ameri-can Indian clients (Paniagua 1998), opinion has shifted to recognize that, when appropri-ately structured, group therapy can be a pow-erful treatment component (Garrett 2004; Garrett et al. 2001; Trimble and Jumper - Thurman 2002). Garrett (2004) notes that many Native American Tribes have traditional healing practices that involve groups; for many of these cultural groups, healing needs to occur within the context of the group or community (e.g., in talking circles). Thus, if properly adapted, group therapy can be very beneficial and culturally congruent. It is important, howev er, to determine Native American client s' level of acculturation before recommending Western models of group therapy, as less acculturated Native clients are likely to be less comfortable with group talk therapy (Mail and Shelton 2002). Group therapy for Alaska Natives should also be nonconfrontational and focus on clients' strengths. Group therapy can incorporate Native American traditions and rituals to make it more culturally suitable. For example, the talking circle is a Native tradition easily adapted for behavioral health treatment. In this tradition, the members of the group sit in a circle. An eagle feather, stone, or other sym- bolic item is passed around, and each person speaks when he or she is handed the item. Based on a review of the literature, Paniagua (1998) recommends that providers using group therapy with Native American clients: Earn suppo rt or permission from Tribal authorities before organizing group therapy. Consult with Native professionals. If group members consent, invite respected Tribal members (e.g., traditional healers or elders) to participate in sessions. Mutual-help groups Native American peoples have a long history of involvement in mutual -help activities that predates the 12 -Step movement (Coyhis and White 2006). Depending on acculturation, availability of a community support network, and the nature of their presenting problems, Native American client s may be more likely to solicit help from significant others, extended family members, and community members. Contemporary manifestations of Native American mutual -help efforts include a dapta- tions of the 12 Steps ( Exhibit 5 -4) and of 12 - Step meeting rituals and practices (Coyhis and White 2006). Another modified element of 146 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups the 12 Steps is use of a circular, rather than a linear, path to healing. The circle is important to American Indian philosophy, which sees the great forces of life and nature as circular (Coyhis 2000). In addition, staff members of the White Bison program have also rewr itten the AA \"Big Book \" from a Native American perspective (Coyhis and Simonelli 2005). The principles of the 12 Steps, which involve using the group or community to provide support and motivation while emphasizing spiritual reconnection, appeal to many Native Ameri-cans who see treatment as social in nature and who view addiction as a spiritual problem. The Native American Wellbriety movement is a modern, indigenous mutual -help program that has its roots in 12 -Step groups but incor- porates Native American sp iritual beliefs and cultural practices and Simonelli 2005; Coyhis http:// www.whitebison.org ). Although the Wellbriety movement is popular with many Native Am ericans in recovery, a considerable number also continue to partici-pate in traditional 12 -Step groups. In the AI - SUPER -PFP , 47 percent of Northern Plains Tribe respondents and 28.8 percent of South-west Tribe respondents with a past -year sub- stance use disor der reported 12 -Step group attendance in the prior year (Beals et al. 2006). Mohatt et al. (2008b ) found that more Alaska Natives in recovery reported participation in 12-Step groups than in substance abuse treat- ment. In Venner and Feldstein 's (2006) re- search with American Indians in recovery, 84 percent of respondents had attended some mutual- help meetings. Traditional healing and complementary methods Native American peoples have a range of be- liefs about health care \u2014from traditional beliefs to strong support for modern science \u2014and may use a number of strategies when address-ing health problems. Traditional healing prac- tices are often used in conjunction with modern medicine. For example, American Indians Exhibit 5 -4: The Lakota Version of the 12 Steps The Lakota Tribe has adapted the 12 Steps to suit its particular belief system as follows: 1. I admit th at because of my dependence on alcohol , I have been unable to care for myself and my family. 2. I believe that the Great Spirit can help me to regain my responsibilities and model the life of my forefathers (ancestors). 3. I rely totally on the ability of the Gr eat Spirit to watch over me. 4. I strive every day to get to know myself and my position within the nature of things. 5. I admit to the Great Spirit and to my Indian brothers and sisters the weaknesses of my life. 6. I am willing to let the Great Spirit help me correct my weaknesses. 7. I pray daily to the Great Spirit to help me correct my weaknesses. 8. I make an effort to remember all those that I have caused harm to and, with the help of the Great Spirit, achieve the strength to try to make amends. 9. I do make amends to all those Indian brothers and sisters that I have caused harm to whenever possible through the guidance of the Great Spirit. 10. I do admit when I have done wrong to myself, those around me, and the Great Spirit. 11. I seek through purification, prayer, and meditation to communicate with the Great Spirit as a child to a father in the Indian way. 12. Having a ddressed those steps, I carry this brotherhood and steps to sobriety to all my Indian brothers and sisters with alcohol problems and together we share all these principles in all our daily lives.

Cultural groups are complex systems; removing pieces of them for implementation as part of a treatment program can be a disservice to the culture as well as the clients (Kunitz et al. 1994; Moss et al. 2003); a breach of custom s and traditions; and a sign of disrespect for the community and Tribe, Tribal lead - ership, and Native American practices. It is important to take the time to build relation ships and seek consultation with Tribal elders, and other Tribal leaders to ensure that the best and most appropriate steps are taken in creating a culturally relevant and responsive treatment model and program. traditionally view all things as deeply inter- connect ed. Disruption of the physical, mental, spiritual, or emotional sides of a person can result in illness. A Native American client may consult a medical doctor to address part of the problem and a traditional healer to help regain balance and harmony. The u se of traditional healing for substance abuse and mental health problems is fairly common among Native Americans (Herman - Stahl and Chong 2002; Herman -Stahl et al. 2003). For example, among Native American individuals who reported a substance use disorder in the past year, 57.4 percent of those from a Southwest Tribe and 31.7 percent from a Northern Plains Tribe used traditional heal-ers or healing practices ( Beals et al. 2006). In a survey of American Indians from three differ-ent Arizona Tribes, 27.4 percent stated that they had used traditional healers and/or heal-ing practices to help with mental health prob-lems (Herman -Stahl and Chong 2002). Overall, many Native Americans believe that culture is the primary avenue of healing and that connecting with one 's culture is not only a means of prevention, but also a healing treat-ment (Bassett et al. 2012) Each Native American culture has its own specific healing prac tices, and not all of those practices are necessarily appropriate to adapt to behavioral health treatment settings. How-ever, many traditional healing activities and ceremonies have been made accessible during treatment or effectively integrated into treat-ment settings (Castro et al. 1999 b; Coyhis 2000; Coyhis and White 2006; Mail and Shelton 2002; Sue 2001; White 2000). These practices include sacred dances (such as the Plains Indians ' sun dance and the Kiowa 's gourd dance), the four circles (a model for conceptualizing a harmonious life), the talking circle, sweat lodges, and other purification practices (Cohen 2003; Mail and Shelton 2002; White 2000). The sweat lodge, in par-ticular, is frequently used in substance abuse treatment settings (Bezdek and Spicer 2006; Schiff and Moore 2006). Alaskan behavioral health programs have developed recovery camps to provide a treat- ment setting that incorporates Native beliefs and seasonal practices (e.g., Old Minto Family Recover y Recovery camps are based on the mod- el of tradition al Native Alaskan fishing camps and provide a context in wh ich clients can learn about traditional practices , such as suste- nance activities. Another program, the Village Sobriety Project, incorporates traditional Yup'ik and Cup 'ik Eskimo traditions of hunt- ing, chopping wood, berry picking, and taking tundra walks (Mills 2003). S ee Niven (2010) for a review of client -centered, culturally responsive behavioral health techniques for use with Alaska Natives. It is difficult to measure the effectiveness of Native American healing practices using 148 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups Western standards and practices. Limited or inconsistent funding, migration patterns, culturally incompetent or incongruent evalua-tion practices, and abuses incurred during or after data collection are major confounding variables that ha ve limited knowledge on the effectiveness of incorporating traditional practices in to Western approaches to the treatment of substance abuse and mental illness. Nonetheless, Mail and Shelton (2002) reviewed earlier literature on the use of \"indig- enous ther apeutic interventions \" for alcohol abuse and dependence and suggest that a number of these interventions have been of value to Native Americans with substance use disorders. Other authors have concurred (Coyhis and White 2006; Sabin et al. 2004). Regardles s of whether a program adapts spe- cific Native American healing practices, pro-viders working with this population should recognize that spirituality is central to its values and is perceived as an integral part of life itself. It is through spiritual experi ences that Native Americans believe they will find meaning in life. Some Native languages have words that refer to spirituality as \"walking around \" or \"living the path. \" In many cases, the spiritual traditions of Native Americans are not (and have never be en) conceived of as a religion, but rather as a set of beliefs and practices that pervades every aspect of daily life (De loria 1973). Despite religion and spirituality often playing important role s in recovery from mental and substance use disorders for N ative Americans, providers should not assume that only indige-nous spirituality is relevant. The majority of Native Americans do not practice their tradi-tional spirituality exclusively, and Christian religious institutions like the Native American Church an d Pentecostal churches have been instrumental in helping many Native Ameri-cans overcome substance use disorders (Garrity 2000). In 2001, rough ly 20 percent of American Indians identified as Baptist, 17 percent as Catholic, 17 percent as having no religious preference, and 3 percent as following a Tribal religion (Kosmin et al. 2001). The relative importance of religion can also vary among diverse Native American commu- nities. Before pursuing traditional methods, assessment of clients' spiritual orientation is important. Spirituality is a personal issue that treatment provider s must respect; clients should choose which spiritual and cultural methods to incorporate into treatment. Pro- viders should also be wary of an obsession with their clients' cultural activ ities, which may be considered intrusive (LaFromboise et al. 1993). Checking with community resources on the subject and asking the client \"What feels right for you? \" are appropriate steps to take in identifying whether traditional healing practices will h ave therapeutic value. P roviders should consult with Native healers or Tribal leaders about the appropriateness of using a particular practice as part of behavioral health services. Rather than using traditional healing methods themselves, counselors may wish to refer clients to a Native American healer in the community or in the treatment program. Relapse prevention and recovery Despite limited data on long -term recovery for Native Americans who have substance use disorders, a few studies have found high rates of relapse following substance abuse treatment (see review in Chong and Herman -Stahl 2003). White and Sanders (2004) recommend that long -term recovery plans for Native Americans make use of a recovery manage-ment rather than a traditional continuing care approach. Such an approach emphasizes the use of informal recovery communities and traditional healing approaches to provide extended monit oring and support for Native Americans leaving treatment. 149 Improving Cultural Competence Researchers have conducted interviews with both American Indians (Bezdek and Spicer 2006) and Alaska Natives (Hazel and Mohatt 2001; Mohatt et al. 2008; People Awakening Project 2004) who have achie ved extended periods of recovery. Bezdek and Spicer (2006) identifie d two key tasks for American Indians enter ing recovery. First, they need to learn how to respond to family and friends who drank with them and to those who s upport ed their recovery. Next, they have to find new ways to deal with boredom and negative feelings. By accomplishing these tasks, Native clients can build new social support systems, develop effective coping strategies for negative feelings, and achieve long -term recovery. The People Awakening Project found that, among Alaska Natives who had a substantial period of recov- ery, the development of active, culturally ap- propriate coping strategies was essential (e.g., distancing themselves from friends or family who drank heavily, getting involved in church, doing community service, praying; Hazel and Mohatt 2001; Mohatt et al. 2008; People Awakening Project 2004). Counseling for White Americans According to the 2010 U.S. Census definition, White Americans are people whose ancestors are among those ethnic groups believed to be the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa (Humes et al. 2011). The racial category of White Americans includes people of various ethnicities, such as Arab Americans, Italian Americans, Polish Ameri cans, and Anglo Americans (i.e., people with origins in England), among others. Many Latinos will also identify racially (if not ethni-cally) as White American. Non -Latino White Americans constitute the largest racial group in the United States (making up 6 3.7 percent of the population in the 2010 Census; Mather et al. 2011). White Americans, like other large ethnic and cultural groups, are extremely heterogeneous in historical, social, economic, and personal features, with many (often subtle) distinctions among subgroups. Perhaps because White Americans have been the majority in the United States, it is sometimes forgotten how historically important certain distinctions between diverse White American ethnic heritages have been (and continue to be, for some) . Conversely , many White American people prefer not to see themselves as such and instead identify according to their specific ethnic background (e.g., as Irish American). For similar reasons, certain cross- cutting cultural issues ( see Chapter 1) like geographic location, sexual orientation, and religious affiliation are important in defining the cul-tural orientations of many White Americans. Beliefs About and Traditions Involving Substance Use Historically, use of alcohol was accepted among White/European cultural groups because it provided an easy way to preserve fruit and grains and did not contain bacteria that might be found in water. Over time, the production and consump tion of alcohol be- came an often -integral part of cultural activi- ties, which can be seen in the way some White cultural groups take particular pride in nation-al brands of alcoholic beverages (e.g., Scotch whisky, French wine; Abbott 2001; Huda k 2000). A number of European cultural groups (e.g., French, Italian) traditionally believed that daily alcohol use was healthy for both mind and body (Abbott 2001; Marinangeli 2001), and for others (e.g., English, Irish), the bar or pub was the traditional center of com-munity life (O 'Dwyer 2001). Despite some variations in cultural attitudes toward appro-priate drinking practices , alcohol has been and 150 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups remains the primary recreational substance for Whites in the United States . Predominant attitudes toward drinking in the United States more closely reflect those of Northern Europe; alcohol use is generally accepted during cele-brations and recreational events, and, at such times, excessive consumption is more likely to be acceptable. Typically, White European cultural groups accept alcohol use as long as it does not inter-fere with responsibilities, such as work or family, or result in public drunkenness (Hamid 1998). However, among cer tain groups of White Americans (usually defined by religious beliefs), the use of alcohol or any other intoxi-cant is considered immoral (van Wormer 2001). These religious beliefs, combined with concerns about the effects of problematic drinking patterns (especially among men in the frontier; White 1998), bec ame the impetus for the early 19th -century creation of the Temperance Movement and culminated in the passing of the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which enacted Prohibition . Although the Temperance Movement is no longer a major political force, belief in the moral and social value of abstinence continues to be strong among some segments of the White Ameri can population. Illicit drug use, on the other hand, has histori-cally been demonized by White American cultural groups and seen as an activity engaged in by people of color or undesirable subcul-tures (Bonnie and Whitebread 1970; Hamid 1998; Whitebread 1995). For example, White Americans typically link drug use to per- ceive d threat of crime\u2014 particularly crimes perpetrated by people of color (Hamid 1998; Whitebread 1995). A ttitudes have changed over time, but White American cultural groups continue to enforce strong cultural prohibitions against most types of illicit drug use. At the same time, White Americans are often more accepting of prescription medica- tion abuse and less likely to perceive prescrip- tion medications as potentially harmful (Hadjicostandi and Cheurprakobkit 2002). Despite illicit drug use now being as common among White Americans as people of color, White Americans still tend to perceive drug use as an activity that occurs outside their families and communities. In a 2001 survey, only 54 percent of White Americans ex-pressed concern that someone in their family might develop a drug abuse problem compared with 81 percent of African Americans (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2001). In the same survey, White Americans expressed less concern about drug abuse in their neighborhoods than did other racial and ethnic groups. However, in terms of seeing drugs as a national problem, White Amer icans and other racial and ethnic groups are in closer agreement. Perhaps as a result of this misper-ception about the prevalence of drug use in their homes and communities, White American parents are less likely to convey disapproval of drug use to their children than African American parents (National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse 2005) and much more likely than Latino or African American parents to think that their children have enough information about drugs (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2001). There are also differences in how White Amer- icans , Latinos , and African Americans perceive drug and alcohol addictions. White Americans are less likely than African Americans, but more likely than Latinos, to state that they believe a person can recover fully from addic-tion (Office of Communications 2008). How-ever, White Americans are more likely than African Americans to indicate that substance use disorders should be treated as diseases (Durant 2005). 151 Improving Cultural Competence Substance Use and Substance Use Disorders According to 2012 NSDUH data, rates of past-year substance use disorders were higher for White Americans than for Native Hawaiians, o ther Pacific Isl anders, and Asian Americans; rates of current alcohol use were higher than for every other major ethnic/racial group (SAMHSA 2013d ). Alcohol has tradi- tionally been the drug of ch oice among White Americans of European descent; however, not all European cultural groups have the same drinking patterns. Researchers typically con-trast a Northern/Eastern European pattern, i n which alcohol is consumed mostly on week- ends or during celebra tions, with that of Southern Europe, in which alcohol is con-sumed daily or almost daily but in smaller quantities and almost always with food. The Southern European pattern involves more regular use of alcohol, but it is also associated with less alcohol -related harm overall (after controlling for total consumption; Room et al. 2003). The pattern of White Americans typi-cally follows that of Northern and Eastern Europe, but individuals from some ethnic groups maintain the Southern European pattern. White Americans, on average, begin drinking and develop alcohol use disorders at a younger age than African Americans and Latinos (Reardon and Buka 2002). White Americans are more likely to have their first drink before the age of 21 and to have their first drink before the age of 16 than members of any other major racial/ethnic group except Native Americans (SAMHSA 2011 c). Some data suggest that White Americans begin using illicit drugs at an earlier age than African Americans (Watt 2008) and that the mean age for White Americans who inject heroin has decreased (Broz and Ouellet 2008). White Americans who use heroin are less likely than people who use heroin from all other major racial/ethnic groups except African Americans to have injected the drug (SAMHSA 2011c ). White Americans are also more likely than members of other major racial/ethnic groups, except Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (for whom esti-mates may not be accurate) , to have tried ecstasy. Except for Native Americans (some of whom may use the hallucinogen peyote for religious purposes), they are also more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to have tried hallucinogens (SAMHSA 2011 c). Research confirms that prescription drug misuse is more common among White Americans than African Americans or Latinos (Ford and Arrastia 2008; SAMHSA 2011c ), and they are more likely to have used prescription opioids in the past year and to use them on a regular basis. Comparative studies indicate that White Americans are more likely than all other major racial/ethnic groups except Native Americans to have an alcohol use disorder (Hasin et al. 2007; Perron et al. 2009; Schmidt et al. 2007). White Americans are at a greater risk of having severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms (such as delirium tremens) t han are African Americans or Latinos with alcohol use disorders (Chan et al. 2009). So too, White Americans are more likely than African Americans or Latinos to meet diagnostic criteria for a drug use disorder at some point during their lives (Perron et al. 2009). Overall, substance use disorders vary considerably across and within non-European White American cultural groups. For example, rates of substance abuse treatment admissions in Michigan from 2005 suggest that substance use disorders may be consider ably lower for Arab Americans than other White Americans (Arfken et al. 2007). 152 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups Mental and Co -Occurring Disorders About 20 percent of White Americans report- ed some form of mental illness in the past year, and they were more likely to have past -year serious psychological distress than other popu- lation groups excluding Native Americans (SAMHSA 2012a ). White Americans appear to be more likely than Latinos or Asian Americans to have CODs (Alegria et al. 2008a ; Vega et al. 2009) and more likely to have concurre nt serious psychological distress and substance use disor-ders (SAMHSA 2011c ). White Americans with CODs are also more likely to receive treatment for both their substance use and mental disorders than are African Americans with CODs (Alvidrez and Havassy 2 005; Hatzenbuehler et al. 2008), but they are per-haps less likely to receive treatment for their substance use disorder alone (Alvidrez and Havassy 2005). White Americans are more likely to receive family counseling and mental health services while in substance abuse treat-ment and less likely to have unmet treatment needs (Marsh et al. 2009; Wells et al. 2001). In addition, White Americans are significantly less likely than Latinos or African Americans to believe that antidepressants are addictive (Cooper e t al. 2003). The most common mental disorders among White Americans are mood disorders (par-ticularly major depression and bipolar I disor-der) and anxiety disorders (specifically phobias, including social phobia, and general- ized anxiety disorder; Grant et al. 2004b ). Among White Americans, these disorders are more prevalent than in any other ethnic/racial groups save Native Americans (Grant et al. 2005; Hasin et al. 2005). For examp le, rates of a lifetime diagnosis of generalized anxiety disor-der are about 40 percent lower for African Americans and Latinos than for White Americans and about 60 percent lower for Asian Americans (Grant et al. 2005). A simi-lar pattern exists for major depressive disorder (Hasin et al. 2005). Treatment Patterns White Americans are more likely to receive mental health treatment or counseling than other racial/ethnic groups (SAMHSA 2012b ). White Americans are more likely than African Americans to receive substance abuse treat-ment services from a private physician or other behavioral health or primary care profes- sional (Perron et al. 2009). Among White American clients entering substance abuse treatment programs in 2010, alcohol (alone or in conjunction with illicit drugs) was most often the primary substance of abuse, follo wed by heroin and cannabis. However, findings are inconsistent concerning the relative frequency with which White Americans enter substance abuse treatment. Some studies have found that White Americans are more likely to receive needed behavioral health services than both African Americans and Latinos (Marsh et al. 2009; Wells et al. 2001). In contrast, other studies have found that African Americans with an identified need are somewhat more likely to enter treatment for drug use disorders and about as like ly to receive treatment for alcohol use disorders when compared with White Americans (Hatzenbuehler et al. 2008; Perron et al. 2009; SAMHSA, CBHSQ 2012 ; Schmidt et al. 2006). Beliefs and Attitudes About Treatment White Americans appear to be generally accepting of behavioral health services. They have better access to health care and are more likely to use services than people of color, but this varies widely based on socioeconomic status and cultural affiliation. M ost treatment services have historically been developed for 153 Improving Cultural Competence White American populations, so it is not surprising that White Americans are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to be satisfied with treatment services (Tonigan 2003). Still, attitudes differ among certain cultural subgroups of White Americans. For example, Russian immigrants from the former Soviet Union have a longstanding distrust of mental health systems and hence may avoid substance abuse treatment (Kagan and Shafer 2001). Other groups who have a strong family orien-tation, s uch as Italian Americans or Scotch - Irish Americans, might avoid treatment that asks them to reveal family secrets (Giordano and McGoldrick 2005; Hudak 2000). According to 2010 NSDUH data regarding people who recognized a need for substance abuse treatment in the prior year but did not receive it, White Americans were more likely than members of other major racial/ethnic groups to state that it was because they had no time for treatment, that they were concerned what their neighbors might think, that they did not want others to know, and/or that they were concerned about how it might affect their job s (SAMHSA 2011c ). Other research confirms that White Americans are significant-ly more likely to avoid treatment due to fear of what others might think or because they are in denial (Grant 1997). White Americans may also have different attitudes toward recovery, at least regarding alcohol use disorders, than do members of other ethnic/racial groups. Ac-cording to NESARC data on people who met criteria for a diagnosi s of alcohol de- pendence at some point during their lives, White Americans were more likely than African Americans, Latinos, or other non - Latinos to have achieve d remission from that disorder but were also less likely than African Americans or other non -Latinos (but not Latinos) to currently abstain from drinking, as opposed to being in partial remission or drink-ing without symptoms of alcohol dependence (Dawson et al. 2005). Treatment Issues and Considerations Most major treatment interventions have been evaluated with a population that is largely or entirely White American, although the role of White American cultural groups is rarely considered in evaluating those interventions. For example, as Straussner (200 1) notes, \"the paradox of writing about substance abusers of European background is that they are a group that is believed to be the group for whom the traditional alcohol and other drug treatment models have been developed, and yet they are a group whose unique treatment needs and treatment approaches have rarely been ex-plored \" (p. 165). Very few evaluations of treatment strategies and interventions (wheth-er based on research or clinical observation) have taken into account ethnic and cultural differences among White American clients, and therefore it is generally not possible to make culturally responsive recommendations for specific subgroups of White Americans. Culturally responsive treatment for many White Americans will involve helping them rediscover their cultural backgrounds, which sometimes have been lost through acculturation and can be an important part of their long - term recovery. Giordano and McGoldrick (2005) note that ethnic identity and culture can be more important for some White Americans \"in times of stress or personal crisis, \" when they may want to \"return to familiar sources of comfort and help, which may differ from the dominant society 's norms\" (p. 503). Appendix B provides information on instruments for assessing cultural identifica-tion. For a n overview of challenges in main - taining mental health, access to health care, 154 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups and help -seeking among White Americans , see Downey and D 'Andrea (2012). Theoretical Approaches and Treatment Interventions Overall, the optimum treatment approach with White Ameri cans is a comprehensive one; the more tools in the toolkit, the greater the chance of success (McCaul et al. 2001). Within -group differences arise regarding education level, socioeconomic status, gender, and other factors, which must be considered . Providers can, however, assume that most well-accepted treatment approaches and inter- ventions (e.g., CBT, motivational interviewing, 12-Step facilitation, cont ingency management, pharmacotherapies) have been tested and evaluated with White American clients. Still, treatment is not uniformly appropriate even for White Americans . Approaches may need modification to suit class, ethnic, reli- gious, and other client traits. Providers should establish not only the client 's ethnic back- ground, but also how strongly the person identifies with that background. Few clinician s have made observations on best therapeutic approach es for members of particular White American cultural/ethnic subgroups. Family therapy In White American families, individuals are generally expected to be independent and self - reliant; as a result, families in therapy can have trouble adjusting to work that focuses more on communication processes than s pecific prob- lems or content (McGill and Pearce 2005). Van Wormer (2001) notes that many White Americans need help addressing communica-tion issues. In family therapy, useful approach-es include those that encourage open, direct, and nonthreatening communicat ion. There is no singular description that fits White American families within or across ethnic heritages, and there is no approach that is effective for all White Americans in family therapy (Hanson 2011). Hierarchical families, such as German American families, may expect the counselor to be authoritative, at least in the initial sessions (Winawer and Wetzel 2005), although a more egalitarian German American family might not respond well to such imperatives. In the same vein, one client of French background could readily accept direct and clear therapeutic assign-ments that contain measurable goals (Abbot 2001), whereas another French American client may value counseling that is more pro- cess oriented. Thus, it is imperative to assess the cultural identific ation of clients and their familie s, along with the treatment needs that best match their cultural worldview s. In some White American families, there is a longsta nding culture of drinking. A ttempts at abstinence can be perceived by family mem-bers as cultu rally inappropriate. In other fami- lies, there is deep denial about alcohol abuse or dependence, especially when talking about substance use to those outside the family. For example, some Polish American families can be resistant to the idea that drinking is the cause of family problems (Folwarski and Smolinski 2005) and sometimes believe that to admit an alcohol problem, especially to someone outside the family, signals weakness. Group therapy Standard group therapies developed for men-tal health and substan ce abuse treatment programs have generally been used and evalu-ated with White American populations. For details on group therapy in substance abuse treatment, see TIP 41, Substance Abuse Treat-ment: Group Therapy (CSAT 2005c ). Mutual-help groups Mutual -help groups, of which AA is the most prevalent, have a largely White American 155 Improving Cultural Competence membership ( AAWS 2008; Atkins and Hawdon 2007). In a 2011 survey, 87 percent of AA members in dicated their race as White (AAWS 2012). In research with largely White popula tions, AA participation has been found to be an effective strategy for promoting recovery from alcohol use disorders (Dawson et al. 2006; McCrady et al. 2002; Weisner al. 2003). Other mutual -help groups, such as Self-Management a nd Recovery Training , Secular Organizations for Sobriety/Save Our Selves, and Women for Sobriety, also have predominately White American membership and are based on Western ideas drawn from psychology (Atkins and Hawdon 2007; White 1998). The appeal of mutual -help groups among White Americans rests on the historical ori- gins of this model. The 12 -Step model was originally developed by White Americans based on European ideas of spirituality, faith , and group interaction. Although the model has been adopted worldwide by different cultural groups (White 1998), the 12 -Step model works especially well for White ethnic groups, including Irish Americans, Polish Americans, French Americans, and Scotch - Irish Americans, because it incorporates Western cultural traditions involving spiritual practice, public confession, and the use of anonymity to protect against humiliation (Abbott 2001; Gilbert and Langrod 2001; Hudak 2000; McGoldrick addition to mutual -help groups for sub- stance abuse, numerous recovery support groups, Internet resources, Web -based com- munities, and peer support programs are available to p romote mental health recovery. Many r esources are available through the National Alliance o n Mental Illness (http:// www.nami.org ). Traditional healing and complementary methods Only 12 percent of White Americans consider themselves atheist, agnostic, or secular without a religious affiliation, meaning that, as a group, White Americans ar e more religious than Asian Americans but less so than Latinos or African Americans (Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life 2008). As with other groups, White Americans belong to many different religions, although the vast majority belong to various Christi an denominations, with approx- imately 57 percent identifying as Protestant and 25.9 percent as Catholic (National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse , 2001). White Americans also make up 91 percent of practitioners of Judaism in the United States, 14 pe rcent of followers of Islam, and 32 per- cent of the American Buddhist population (Kosmin et al. 2001). For more religious White Americans, pastoral counseling or prayer can be useful aids in the treatment of substance use disorders. However, White Americans are significantly less likely to use prayer as a method of coping (Graham et al. 2005). White Americans are more likely than members of other major racial/ethnic groups to use complementary or alternative medical therapies , such as herbal medicine, acupun c- ture, chiropractors, massage therapy, yoga, and special diets (Graham et al. 2005). Relapse prevention and recovery Factors that promote recovery for White Americans include the learning and use of coping skills (Litt et al. 2003 ; Litt et al. 2005; Mais to et al. 2006). Even though some research suggests that White Americans are less likely to use coping skills than African Americans (Walton 2001) and have lower levels of self - efficacy upon leaving treatment (Warren et al. 2007), the development of the se skills and of self-efficacy is important in managing relapse risks and in maintaining recovery. C ounselors 156 Chapter 5 \u2014Behavioral Health Treatment for Major Racial and Ethnic Groups may offer psychoeducation on the value of coping strategies, specific skills to manage stressful situations or environments, and op-portunities to pra ctice these skills during treatment. Some coping skills or strategies may be more important than others in manag- ing high -risk situations, but research suggests that greater use of a variety of coping strate-gies is more important than the use of any one speci fic skill (Gossop et al. 2002). Social and family support s are also important in maintaining recovery and preventing re-lapse among White Americans (Laudet et al. 2002; McIntosh and McKeganey 2000 ; Rumpf et al. 2002). Other important factors include continuing care, the development of substitute behavior s (i.e., reliance on healthy or positive activities in lieu of substance use), the creation of new caring relationships that do not involve substance use, and increased spirituality (Valliant 1983). Valliant (1983) and others (e .g., Laudet et al. 2002; McCrady et al. 2004; Moos and Moos 2006) conclude, based on research with mostly White partici- pants, that mutual -help groups often play an important role in maintaining recovery .

The Role of Drug Cultures in Substance Abuse Treatment 159 Lisa is a 19 -year-old White college student living in San Diego, CA, who was sent to treatment by her parents after failing her college classes and being placed on academic probation. While home on break earlier that year, her parents found pills in her ro om but let her return to school after she promised to stop using. The academic probation is only part of the reason her parents sent her to treatment. They were also concerned about her recent weight loss, as her older sister had previously struggled with bulimia. Lisa began using marijuana at age 15 with a cousin. In her first year of high school , she had difficulty fitting in. However, the next year, she became friendly with an electronic dance music clique that helped her define an identity for herself and introduced her to ecsta-sy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA ), metham- phetamine, and various hallucinogens, along with new ideas about politics, music, and art. She has since found similar friends at college and keeps in touch with several members of her high school clique. In treatment, Lisa tells her counselor that she has long felt neglect-ed by her parents, who are too interested in material things. She sees her drug use and that of her friends as a rebellion against the materialistic attitud es of their parents. She also dismisses her fami- ly's cultural heritage, insisting that her parents only identify as Americans even though they are first -generation Americans with European backgrounds. She talks at length about ways to acquire and prepare relatively unknown hallucinogens, the best music to listen to while using, and how to evaluate the quality of marijuana. Lisa says that she doesn 't believe she has a problem. She thinks that her failing grades reflect her lack of interest in college, which she says she is attending only because people expect it of her . When asked what she would rather be doing, she says she does not have any clearly defined goals and just wants to do \"so mething with ar t Improving Cultural Competence or music. \" Lisa points out that, unlike most of her classmates, she doesn 't drink and has stopped doing addictive drugs like ecstasy and methamphetamine, which were responsible for her weight loss. She is convinced that she can continue to smoke pot and Salvia divinorum , which she notes \"isn't even illegal, \" and take other botanical hallucinogens. She is adamant about keeping her friends, who she says have been supportive of her and are not materialis-tic \"sellouts\" like her parents. Her counselor places a priority on connecting Lisa with other people her age who are in recovery. She asks a client who graduated from the program and is only a year older than Lisa to accompany her to Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings attended mostly by younger people in recovery. The counselor also encour-ages Lisa 's friendships with other young peo- ple in the program. When Lisa complains about her parents ' materialism and the materi- alism of mainstream culture, her counselor brings up the spiritual elements of mutual - help recovery groups and how they provide an Multidimensional Model for Developing Cultural Competenc e: Drug Culture s This Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) emphasizes the concept that many subcultures exist within and across diverse ethnic and racial populations and cultures. Drug cultures are a formidable example \u2014 these are cultures that can influence the presentation of mental, substance use, and co -occurring disorders as well as prevention and treatment strategies and outcomes. 160 Chapter 6 \u2014Drug Cultures and the Culture of Recovery alternative model for interacting with others. The counselor begins to help Lisa explore how her drug use may be an attempt to fill her unmet emotional and social needs and may hinder the develop ment of her own interests, identity, and goals. Treatment providers should consider how cultural aspects of substance use reinforce substance use, substance use disorders, and relapses. Factors to note include clients' possi- ble self-medication of psychological distress or mental disorders. Beyond specific biopsycho-social issues that co ntribute to the risk of substance -related disorders and the initiation and progression of use, counselors and treat-ment organizations must continually acquire knowledge about the ever -changing, diverse drug cultures in which client populations may particip ate and which reinforce the use of drugs and alcohol. Moreover, behavioral health service providers and program administrators need to translate this knowledge into clinical and administrative practices that address and counter the influence of these cultures within the treatment environment (e.g., by instituting policies that ban styles of dress that indicate affiliation with a particular drug culture) . Adopting Sue 's multidimensional model (2001) for developing cultural competence, this chap-ter identifie s drug cultures as a domain that requires proficiency in clinical skills, program-matic development, and administrative practic-es. It explores the concept of drug cultures , the relationship between drug cultures and main- stream culture, the values and rituals of drug cultures, and how and why people value their participation in drug culture s. This chapter describes how counselors can determine a client 's level of involvement in a drug culture, how they can help clients identify and develop alternatives to the drug cultures in which they participate , and the importance of assisting clients in developing a culture of recovery. What Are Drug Cultures? Up to this point, this TIP has focused on cultures based on ethnicity, race, language, and national origin. The TIP looks primarily at those cultural groups because they are the major cultural forces that shape an individual 's life and worldview. However, there are other types of cultural groups (sometimes referred to as subcultures) that are also organized around shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions; these cultural groups can have, as their core organizing theme, such factors as sexuality, musical styles, political ideologies, and so on. For most clients in treatment for s ubstance use disorders (including those who have a co - occurring mental disorder) , the drug subcul- ture will likely have affected their substance use and can affect their recovery; that is the primary rationale for the development of this unique chapter. R esearch literature in this topic ar ea is considerably limited . Some people question whether a given drug culture is in fact a subculture, but many seem to have all the elements ascribed to a culture (see Chapter 1). A drug culture has its own history (pertaining to drug use) that is usuall y orally transmitted. It has certain shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions, and it has its own rituals and behaviors that evolve over time. Members of a drug culture often share similar ways of dressing, socialization patterns, language, and style of communication. Some even develop a social hierarchy that gives different status to different members of the culture based on their roles within that culture ( Jenkot 2008). As with other cultures, drug cultures are localized to some extent. For exam-ple, people who use methamphetamines in Hawaii and Missouri could share certain atti-tudes, but they will also exhibit regional differ-ences. The text boxes in this chapter offer examples of the distinct values, languages, 161 Improving Cultural Competence rituals, and types of artistic expression associ- ated with particular drug cultures. Many subcultures exist outside mainstream society and thus are prone to fragmentation. A single subculture can split into three or four related subcultures over time. This is especially true of drug cultures, in which people use different substances, are from different locales, or have different socioeconomic statuses; they may also have very different cultural attitudes related to the use of substances. B ourgois and Schonberg (2007) described how ethnic and racial differences can affect the drug cultures of users of the same drugs to the point that even such things as injection practices can differ between Black and White heroin users in the same city. Exhibit 6 -1 lists of some of the ways in which drug cultures can differ from one another. Differences in the physiological and psycho-logical effects of drugs account for some dif-ferences among drug cultures. For example, the drug culture of people who use heroin is typically less frenetic than the drug culture involving methamphetamine use. However, other differences seem to be more clearly related to the historical development of the culture itself or to the effects of larger social forces. Cultural and socioeconomic compo-nents contributed to the rise in methamphet-amine use among gay men on the West Coast (Reback 1997) and among Whites of lower socioeconomic status in rural Missouri (Topolski and Anderson -Harper 2004). How- ever, in these two cases, the details of those change factors are quite different. In Missouri, the low cost and easy production of the drug influenced development of a methampheta- mine drug culture. Missouri leads the nation in the number of methamphetamine labs seized by polic e; a disproportionately large number of seizures occur in rural areas (Carbon e-Lopez et al. 2012; Topolski and Anderson -Harper 2004). The popularity of the drug among How To Identify Key Characteristics of a Drug Culture Counselors and clinical supervisors must acquire knowledge about drug cultures represented within the client population. Drug cultures can change rapidly and vary across racial and ethnic groups, geographic areas, socioeconomic levels, and generations, so staying informed is challenging . Besides needing an understanding of current drug cultures (to help prevent infiltration of related behaviors and attitudes within the treatment environment), counselors also need to help clients understand how such cultures support use and pose dynamic relapse risk s. (Continued on the next page.) Exhibit 6 -1: How Drug Cultures Differ There is overlap among members, but drug cultures differ based on substance used \u2014 even among people from similar ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. The drug cul-ture of heroin use (McCoy et al. 2005; Pierce 1999; Spunt 2003) differs from the drug culture of ecstasy use (Reynolds 1998). Drug cultures differ according to geo-graphic area; people who use heroin in the Northeast United States are more likely to inhale than inject the drug, whe reas the opposite is true among people in the Western United States who use heroin (Office of Applied Studies [OAS] 2004). Drug cultures can differ according to other social factors, such as socioeconomic status. The drug culture of young, affluent people who use heroin can occasionally mirror the drug culture of the street user, but it will al-so have notable differences (McCoy et al. 2005; Pierce 1999; Spunt 2003). Drug cultures (even involving the same drugs and the same locales) change over time; older people from New York who use heroin and who entered the drug culture in the 1950s or 1960s feel marginalized w ithin the current drug scene, which they see as promoting a different set of values (Anderson and Levy 2003). 162 Chapter 6 \u2014Drug Cultures and the Culture of Recovery How To Identify and Discuss Key Characteristics of a Drug Culture (continued) Counselors can use this exercise to begin to educate clients about the influence of drug cultures and help them identify the specific behaviors, values, and attitudes that constitute their experience of using alcohol and drugs. It can be a helpful tool in improving clients ' understanding of the reinforcing as- pects of alcohol and drug use beyond physiological effects. In addition, this exercise can be used as a training tool in clinical supervision to help counselors understand the influence and potential reinforc-ing qualities of a drug culture among clients and within the treatment milieu. Materials needed: Diagram handout and pencils. Instructions: Determine whether this exercise is more appropriate as an individual or group exercise. Assess the newness and variability of recovery within the group constellation. If several group members support recov ery-related behavior, conducting this exercise may be a beneficial educational tool and means of intervention with clients who continue to identify mainly with their drug culture. Conversely, if most group members are new or have had difficulty accepting t reatment or treatment guidelines, this exercise may be more aptly used as an individual tool. Attention: In group settings, strict parameters need to be established at the beginning of the session to ensure that the discussion remains centered on attitudes, values, and behaviors sur-rounding drug and alcohol use \u2014not on specific techniques or procedures for using drugs or rit- uals surrounding intake or injection. Start the discussion by first presenting the idea that drug cultures exist \u2014describing the main elements that constitute culture (refer to Chapter 1 or the categories identified in the \"Drug Culture\" diagram below). Next, provide examples of how drug culture can support continued use and relapse. Keep in mind that not all clients are engaged in a drug culture. Following the general introduction, review each block in the diagram and ask clients to provide examples related to their own use and involvement with drugs and alcohol. After discussing their examples, ask them to identify the most significant b ehaviors, attitudes, and values that re- inforce their use (e.g., a feeling of acceptance or camaraderie). Counselors can redirect this general discussion to related topics \u2014for example, by identifying behaviors, values, and attitudes likely to support recov ery or by shifting from discussion to role - plays that will help clients address relapse risks associated with their drug culture and practice coping skills (e.g., assertiveness or refusal skills to counter the influence of others once they are discharged f rom the program or to address situations that arise during the course of treatment). Drug Culture Establishing Trust and Credibility How do you go about establishing credibility? Socialization How were you introduced to the culture? Values What values are upheld or devalued in the group? Status In what ways can you obtain status or be seen as a success? Rules Are there spoken and unspoken rules or norms? Gender Roles and Relationships What gender expectations exist surrounding drug use? Concepts of Sanction, Punishment, and Conflict Mediation How does the group deal with in-group conflicts? Symbols and Images Are there symbols that represent a particular association with a group or substance? Dress Are there specific ways to dress that show allegiance to a specific substance or group? View of Past, Present, and Future Are there specific beliefs about the past, present, and/or future? Language & Communication Are there special verbal or nonverbal ways to communicate about substance - related activities? Attitudes What are common attitudes toward others (nonusers, police, etc.)? 163 Improving Cultural Competence Whites could be linked to the historical de- velopment of the methamphetamine trade by White motorcycle gangs (Morgan and Beck 1997). On the other hand, most gay men who use the drug report having first used it at parties with the expectation of involvement in sexual activity (Hunt et al. 2006). In studies of gay men who used methamphetamine, the main reason for use was to heighten sexual experience (Halkitis et al. 2005; Kurtz 2005; Reback 1997). Morgan and Beck (1997) found that increased sexual activity was one reason why certain women and heterosexual men used methamphetamine, but it was not as important a reason as it was for gay men. This chapter aims to explain that people who use drugs participate in a drug culture, and further, that they value this participation. However, not all people who abuse substances are part of a drug culture. White (19 96) draws attention to a set of individuals whom he calls \"acultural addicts. \" These people initiate and sustain their substance use in relative isolation from other people who use drugs. Examples of acultural addicts include the medical profes-sional who does not have to use illegal drug networks to abuse prescription medication , or the older, middle- class individual who \"pill shops \" from multiple doctors and procures drugs for misuse from pharmacies. Although drug cultures typically play a greater role in the lives of people who use illicit drugs, people who use legal substances \u2014such as alcohol\u2014 are also likely to participate in such a culture (Gordon et al. 2012). Drinking cultures can develop among heavy drinkers at a bar or a college fraternity or sorority house that works to encourage new people to use, supports high levels of continued or binge use, reinforces denial, and develops rituals and customary behaviors surrounding drinking . In this chap- ter, drug culture refers to cultures that evolve from drug and alcohol use. The Relationship Between Drug Cultures and Mainstream Culture To some extent, subcultures define themselves in opposition to the mainstream culture. Sub-cultures may reject some, if not all, of the values and beliefs of the mainstream culture in favor of their own, and they will often adapt some elements of that culture in ways quite different from those originally intended (Hebdige 1991; Issitt 2009; Exhibit 6 -2). Ind ividuals with subcultures \u2014such as drug cul- t ures\u2014because they feel excluded from or Exhibit 6 -2: The Language of a Drug Culture One of the defining features of any culture is the language it uses; this need not be an entire lan- guage, and may simply comprise certain jargon or slang and a particular style of communication. The use of slang regarding drugs and drug activity is a well -recognized aspect of drug culture. Not as well-known is the diversity of that language and how it varies across time and place. Rather than coining new words, the language of drug culture often borrows words from mainstream culture and adapts them to new purposes. For example, Williams (1992) examined the use of Star Trek term inology among people who used crack cocaine in New York during the 1980s. They adopted the persona of members of the Star Trek Enterprise crew in their use of language \u2014such as \"going on a mission\" when they went looking for cocaine; \"beam me up, Scotty\" wh en they wanted to get high; and referring to crack cocaine itself as \"Scotty.\" Crack cocaine users even created an imaginary book entitled The Book of Tech that they referred to as if it contained important information for people who use and sell crack coc aine (e.g., how to cook freebase cocaine from cocaine hydrochloride). This language (and other terms derived from other sources) helped members of this drug culture recognize other members. People who did not understand the terms used were typically taken advantage of during drug transactions. 164 Chapter 6 \u2014Drug Cultures and the Culture of Recovery unable to participate in mainstream society. The subculture provides an alternative source of social support and cultural activities, but those activities can run counter to the best interests of the individual. Many subcultures are neither harmful nor antisocial, but their focus is on the substance(s) of abuse, not on the people who participate in the culture or their well- being. Mainstream culture in the Unit ed States has historically frowned on most substance use and certainly substance abuse (Corrigan et al. 2009; White 1979, 1998). This can extend to legal substances such as alcohol or tobacco (including, in recent years, the increased pro-hibition against c igarette smoking in public spaces and its growing social unacceptability in private spaces). As a result, mainstream culture does not \u2014for the most part\u2014have an accepted role for most types of substance use, unlike many older cultures, which may accept use, for example , as part of specific religious rituals. Thus, people who experiment with drugs in the United States usually do so in highly marginalized social settings, which can contribute to the development of substance use disorders (Wilcox 1998). Individuals who are curious about substance use, particularly young people, are therefore more likely to become involved in a drug culture that en-courages excessive use and experimentation with other, often stronger, substances (for a review of intervention strategies to reduce discrimination related to substance use disor-ders, see Livingston et al. 2012). When people who abuse substances are mar-ginalized, they tend not to seek access to mainstream institutions that typically provide sociocultural support (Myers et al. 2009). This can result in even stronger bonding with the drug culture. A marginalized person 's behavior is seen as abnormal even if he or she attempts to act differently, thus further reducing the chances of any attempt to change behavior (Cohen 1992). The drug culture enables its members to view substance use disorders as normal or even a s status symbols. The disorder becomes a source of pride, and people may celebrate their drug -related identity with other members of the culture (Pearson and Bourgoi s 1995; White 1996). Social stigma also aids in the formation of oppositional values and beliefs that can promote unity among mem-bers of the drug culture (Exhibit 6 -3). When people with substance use disorders experience discrimination, they are likely to delay entering treatment and can have less positive treatment outcomes (Fortney et al. 2004; Link et al. 1997; Semple et al. 2005). Discrimination can also increase denia l and step up the individual 's attempts to hide sub- stance use (Mateu -Gelabert et al. 2005). The immorality that mainstream society attaches to substance use and abuse can unintentionally serve to strengthen individuals ' ties with the drug culture and decrease the likelihood that they will seek treatment. The relationship between the drug and main-stream cultures is not unidirectional. Since the beginning of a definable drug culture, that culture has had an effect on mainstream cul-tural institutions, particularly through music (Exhibit 6- 4), art, and literature. These con- nections can add significantly to the attraction a drug culture holds for some individuals (especially the young and those who pride themselves on being nonconformists) and create a greater ri sk for substance use escalat- ing to abuse and relapse. Understanding Why People Are Attracted to Drug Cultures To understand what an individual gains from participating in a drug culture, it is important first to examine some of the factors involved 165 Improving Cultural Competence Exhibit 6 -3: The Values and Beliefs of a Heroin Culture Many core values of illicit drug cultures involve rejecting mainstream society and its cultural values. Steph ens (1991) analyzed value statements from people addicted to heroin and extracted the core tenets of this drug culture 's value system. They are: Antisocial viewpoint \u2014Members of this drug culture share a viewpoint that sees all people as basically dishonest and egocentric; they are especially distrustful of those who do not use heroin. Rejection of middle- class values \u2014Members denigrate values such as the need for hard work, security, and honesty. Excitement/ hedonism \u2014Members value immediate gratification and the intense pursuit of pleas- ure over more stable and lasting values. Importance of outward appearances \u2014As much as members of the drug culture may complain about the mainstream culture' s shallowness, they strongly believe in conspicuous consumption and the importance of owning things that give an image of prosperity. Valence of street addict subcultures \u2014Members of this drug culture value the continued partici- pation of others in the culture, even to the point of expecting individuals who have stopped us- ing to continue to participate in the culture. Emotional detachment \u2014People involved in this drug culture value emotional aloofness and see emotional involvement with others as a weakness. These core values (initially examined by Stephens et al. 1976) were taken from a specific drug culture (heroin), but they can be found in many other drug cultures that center on the use of illicit drugs. However, these same values will not be upheld in every drug culture. For instance, the drug culture of people who use MDMA doe s not appear to value emotional aloofness, but rather to appreciate the drug 's ability to create a feeling of emotional intimacy among those who use it (Gourley 2004; Reynolds 1998). Drug cultures involving legal substances (notably alcohol) are less likely to reject the core values of mainstream society and are less likely to be rejected by that society. They will, h owev- er, still value excitement/ hedonism and the participation of others in the subculture. Exhibit 6 -4: Music and Drug Cultures Since the 1920s, when marijuana use became associated with jazz musicians, there has been a con-nection between certain music subcultures and particular types of substance use (Blake 2007; Gahlinger 2001). As Blackman (1996) notes, \" Before the emergence of post -war youth culture, there was a direct connection between the development of the popular music \u2014jazz \u2014and the use of illicit drugs in terms of musicians who used drugs, including heroin, cocaine, and cannabis and their narra- tives about these drugs through songs\" (p. 137). Early Federal legislation criminalizing marijuana was motivated, in part, by use of the drug by jazz musicians and fear that their example would influence youth (Whitebread 1995). In recent years, the link between drug culture and music has been exemplified by the importance of MDMA in the rave music scene (Kotarba 2007; Murguia et al. 2007). Reynolds (1998) credits the development of rave music to MDMA 's ability to create a feeling of intimacy among r elative strangers and the way in which people who use it respond to repetitive, up -tempo music. Con - versely, Adlaf and Smart (1997) found that adolescents in Canada typically became involved in the rave music scene after starting to use MDMA and other drugs. Regardless of how the relationship developed, MDMA and rave music are so closely linked that it is hard to tell where the music culture ends and the drug culture begins. Blackman (1996) states that drug use has become an essential element of youth cult ure mainly through its association with musical artists. Similarly, Knutagard (1996) observes how different youth cultures, each defined in part by its members' choices in music and substance use, have made some types of substance use acceptable to many yo ung people. Esan (2007) notes that urban music and drug 166 Chapter 6 \u2014Drug Cultures and the Culture of Recovery in substance use and the development of substance use disorders. Despite having dif fer- ing theories about the root causes of substance use disorders, most researchers would agree that substance abuse is, to some extent, a learned behavior. Beginning with Becker 's (1953) seminal work, research has shown that many commonly abused substances are not automatically experienced as pleasurable by people who use them for the first time (Fekjaer 1994). For instance, many people find the taste of alcoholic beverages disagreeable during their first experience with them, and they only learn to experience these effects as pleasurable over time. Expectations can also be important among people who use drugs; those who have greater expectancies of pleasure typically have a more intense and pleasurable experience. These expectancies may play a part in the d evelopment of substance use disorders (Fekjaer 1994; Leventhal and Schmitz 2006). Additionally, drug -seeking and other behav- iors associated with substance use have a reinforcing effect beyond that of the actual drugs. Activities such as rituals of use (Exhibit 6-5), which make up part of the drug culture, provide a focus for those who use drugs when the drugs themselves are unavailable and help them shift attention away from problems they might otherwise need to face (Lende 2005). Drug cultures serve as an initiating force as well as a sustaining force for substance use and abuse (White 1996). As an initiating force, the culture provides a way for people new to drug use to learn what to expect and how to appre-ciate the experience of getting high. As White (1996) notes, the drug culture teaches the new user \"how to recognize and enjoy drug effects\" (p. 46). There are also practical matters involved in using substances (e.g., how much to take, how to ingest the substance for strongest effect) that people new to drug use may not know when they first begin to experiment with drugs. The skills needed to use some drugs can be quite complicated, as shown in Exhibit 6-6. The drug culture has an appeal all its own that promotes initiation into drug use. Stephens (1991) uses examples from a number of ethno-graphic studies to show how people can be as taken by the excitement of the drug culture as they are by the drug itself. Media portrayals, along with singer or music group autobiog-raphies, that glamorize the drug lifestyle may increase its lure (Manning 2007; Oksanen 2012). In buying (and perhaps se lling) drugs, individuals can find excitement that is missing in their lives. They can likewise find a sense of purpose they otherwise lack in the daily need to seek out and acquire drugs. In successfully navigating the difficulties of living as a person Exhibit 6 -4: Music and Drug Cultures (continu ed) culture have a shared appeal to young people based on their apparently antagonistic relationship to mainstream culture. Since the 1990s, rock group confessional memoirs have become increasingly popular, often depicting a lifestyle and culture of excess and providing explicit details of drug use and methods; consumption- driven, high- risk, or excessive b ehaviors; tragic consequences of use; and, sometimes, the author 's participation in rehabilitation (Oksanen 2012). Certain drugs and the drug -dealing lif estyle are featured prominently in different types of music, including hip hop (Esan 2007; Schensul et al. 2000) or narcocorridos (a popular form of Mexican and Mexican American border music that tells of the lives of drug traffickers [Edberg 2004]). Howev er, even music that is not overtly concerned with drug use can become connected to a drug culture or to substance use in an individual 's mind. Acco rding to White (1996), links between particular songs and the recall of euphoric drug experiences are especia lly common and may need to be addressed ex- plicitly in treatment. Hearing these songs can act as a trigger for drug use and can, therefore, be a potential cause of relapse. 167 Improving Cultural Competence Exhibit 6 -5: The Rituals of Drug Cultures Several authors have noted that illicit drug use and alcohol use typically involve ritualized behaviors (Alverson 200 5; Carlson 2006; Carnes et al. 2004; Grund 1993; White 1996). The rituals of substance use affect where, when, and how substances are used. Substance- related rituals serve both instru- mental and social functions. Instrumental functions include maximizing drug effects, minimizing negative effects of drug use, and preventing secondary problems. Socially, the rituals display one' s affiliation with the drug culture to other people and help create a sense of community within the culture. Obviously, the social fun ction is more central to group activities than to solitary rituals. Most drug -related social rituals involve sharing substances or sharing the experience of intoxication. Some drug cultures (e.g., marijuana) encourage the sharing of substances, but even when they are not shared, drugs are often used with other people who use, such as in crack houses and shooting galleries (Bourgois 1998; Grund 1993; Williams 1992). Rituals involving shared substance use and public substance use strengthen the bonds between members of a drug culture and sustain the drug culture. Some social rituals are so important to members of the drug culture that they participate in them even when they have no drugs, such as when marijuana smokers smoke an inert substance (e.g., horse manure, banana peels) together when they have no marijuana (White 1996). Drug use can also be incorporated into other ritualized behaviors, such as sexual activity (Carnes et al. 2004). Individuals develop their own drug -related rituals through the influence of other members of the culture and also through trial and error. This allows them to determine what works best for them to maximize the drug 's effect and minimize related problems. For example, Grund (1993) found, through observing the rituals surrounding the injection of cocaine and heroin among people in the Netherlands, that specific rituals governed the timing and administration of the drugs so that heroin lessened the unpleasant side effects of the cocaine. Other recent examples are the combination of energy drinks with alcohol to delay the normal onset of sleepiness (Howland and Rohsenow 2013; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA] 2013c) and th e combination of methylphenidate with alcohol to intensify euphoric effects (for review of central nervous system stimulant use and emergency room information, see SAMHSA 2013b ). Exhibit 6 -6: Questions Regarding Knowledge and Skill Demands of Heroin Use If first use is by snorting, how is it done (assuming the person has never taken a drug intranasal-ly)? Is there a special technique for using heroin this way? If first use is by injection, is it best to inject the drug under the skin (skin- popping) or into a vein? What equipment is required? If one doesn't have a hypodermic syringe, what other equipment can be substituted to make up a set of \"works\" or an \"outfit\"? How is heroin pr epared (cooked) for injection? What techniques or procedures are used to inject the drug? What does one do if the needle clogs? Is there any way to test the purity of the drug? How much of the drug constitutes a desirable dose? If more than one person is using and an outfit is being shared, who uses it first? If sharing, how can the works be cleaned to prevent the transmission of disease? How does one know if he or she has injected too much? Are there any unpleasant side effects one should anticipate? How long will the effects of the drug last? Is there any way to maximize the drug's effects? Is there anything one should not do while high on the drug? How much time must pass before the drug can be used again? If a bruise or an abscess develops at the injection site, how can it be hidden and treated (without seeing a physician)?

In some communities, participation in the drug trade \u2014an aspect of a drug culture \u2014is simply one of the few economic opportunities available and is a means of gaining the admi-ration and respect of peers (Bourgois 2003; Simon and Burns 1997). However, drug deal-ing as a source of status is not limited to eco-nomically deprived communities. In studying drug dealing among relatively affluent college students at a private college, Mohamed and Fritsvold (2006) found that the most im- portant motives for dealing were ego gratifica-tion, status, and the desire to assume an outlaw image. Marginalized adolescents and young adults find drug cultures particularly appealing. Many individual, family, and social risk factors associated with adolescent substance abuse are also risk factors for youth involvement with a drug culture. Individual factors \u2014such as feelings of alienation from society and a strong rejection of authority \u2014can cause youth to look outside the traditional cultural inst itu- tions available to them (family, church, school, etc.) and instead seek acceptance in a subcul-ture, such as a drug culture (Hebdige 19 91; Moshier et al. 2012). Individual traits like sensation -seeking and poor impulse control, which can interfere with f unctioning in main- stream society, are often tolerated or can be freely expressed in a drug culture. Family involvement with drugs is a significant risk factor due to additional exposure to the drug lifestyle, as well as early learning of the values and beh aviors (e.g., lying to cover for parents ' illicit activities) associated with it (Haight et al. 2005). Social risk factors (e.g., rejection by peers, poverty, failure in school) can also in-crease young people 's alienation from tradi- tional cultural institutions. The need for social acceptance is a major reason many young people begin to use drugs, as social acceptance can be found with less effort within the drug culture. In addition to helping initiate drug use, drug cultur es serve as sustaining forces. T hey sup- port continued use and reinforce denial that a problem with alcohol or drugs exists. The importance of the drug culture to the person using drugs often increases with time as the person 's association with it deepens (Moshier et al. 2012). White (1996) notes that as a person progresses from experimentation to abuse and/or dependence, he or she develops a more intense need to \"seek for supports to sustain the drug relationship \" (p. 9). In addi- tion to gaining social sanction for their sub-stance use, participants in the drug culture learn many skills that can help them avoid the pitfalls of the substance -abusing lifestyle and thus continue their use. They learn how to avoid arrest, how to get money to support their habit, and how to find a new supplier when necessary. The more an individual 's needs are met within a drug culture, the harder it will be to leave that culture behind. White (1996) gives an example of a person who was initially attracted in youth to a drug culture because of a desire for social acceptance and then grew up within that culture. Through involvement in the drug culture, he was able to gain a measure of self - esteem, change his family dynamic, explore his sexuality, develop lasting friendships, and find a career path (albeit a criminal o ne). For this individual, who had so much of his life invest-ed in the drug culture, it was as difficult to conceive of leaving that culture as it was to conceive of stopping his substance use. Online Drug Cultures One major change that has occurred in drug cultures in recent years is the development of 169 Improving Cultural Competence How To Lead an Exercise Examining Benefits, Losses , and the Future Counselors and clinical supervisors can help clients identify reinforcing aspects (besides physiologi- cal effects) of their drug and alcohol use and the losses associated with use, including unmet goals and dreams. The physiological, social, and emotional gains and losses that have transpired during their use (whether or not they associate these losses with their use) can serve as risks for relapse. This exercise works well as an interactive psychoeducational lecture for clients, as a training tool for counselors, and as a group counseling exercise. It can also be adapted for individual sessions. Materials needed: Group room with sufficient space to move around. Instructions: Select an amenable client aware of the losses and consequences associated with his/her use. Later in the exercise, select other clients to give other group members a more direct experience. Divide the group in two. For large groups, select only 6 to 8 people for each side. Have each subgroup stand on opposite sides of the room facing each other. One group will represent t he benefits of use; the other, losses associated with use (see diagram for room set -up). Rather than using the client's personal benefits and losses (at least initially), ask group members to brainstorm about their experiences that represent each side. Begin with the side of the room that represents \"benefits of use\" and ask everyone in the room to name some benefits. Then, assign a specific benefit to each person in the \"benefits of use\" group and create a one- line message for each (a first -person statemen t describing the benefit), asking the representative cli- ent to remember the line. For example, if the group named a benefit of use as immediate ac-ceptance from others who use, assign this benefit to one person and create a message to capture it: \"I make you feel like you belong,\" or \"We are family now.\" Continue brainstorming until you have assigned six or more benefits. Next, go to the opposite group that represents the losses associated with use and begin to solicit losses from everyone in the room. Assig n a loss to each person in the \"loss\" group, create a one -line message that coincides with each loss, and then ask an individual to remember each loss message (e.g., \"I am the loss of your children,\" \"I am the loss of your self -respect,\" \"I am the loss of your health\"). In addition, ask the group to name future goals and plans that were curtailed because of use. Assign these losses as well, following the same format (e.g., \"I am the loss of a college degree,\" \"I am the loss of intimate relationships,\" \"I am the loss of belief in the future\"). Note: If you run out of people, you can assign two roles to one person. At this point, the exercise can already be a powerful experience for many clients. Now, have the person who was originally selected as the client stand facing the \"benefits of use\" group. Have the client process what it is like to see the benefits of use. You can also have each person in the \"benefits of use\" group state his or her one- line message to help facilitate this process. Stand with the clie nt as he or she moves to the \"loss\" group. Again, have the client stand and face this group while asking him or her what it is like to see the losses, including the losses related to goals and the future. Note: It is not important as an exercise to have benefits or losses specific only to this client. It is far better to gain a sample from the entire group so that everyone is in-volved and to maximize the exercise's effectiveness as a psychoeducational tool. After the client has stoo d in fr ont of both groups, ask him or her to move back and forth be- tween each group several times to see what emotional changes occur in experiencing each group. It is important to process this exp erience as a group. You can invite other members to switch out of their roles and st and in as client s to experience this exercise more directly. Clients are likely to see how seductive the \"benefits of use\" group can be and how this attraction c an lead back to relapse. T his exercise may also help clients connect with the losses associated with their use. At times, clients may gain awareness that the very losses associated with their use can also serve as a trigger for use as a means of self- medicating feelings. (Continued on the next page.) 170 Chapter 6 \u2014Drug Cultures and the Culture of Recovery Internet communities organized around drug use (Gatson 2007a ; Murguia et al. 2007) and drug use facilitation, including information on use, production, and sales (Bowker 2011; U.S. Department of Justice 2002). Such communi-ties develop around Web sites or d iscussion boards where individuals can describe their drug-related experiences, find information on acquiring and using drugs, and discuss related issues ranging from musical interests to legal problems. Many of the Web sites where these online communities develop are originally created to lessen the negative consequences of substance use by informing people about vari-ous related legal and medical issues (Gatson 2007b ; Murguia et al. 2007). As in other drug cultures, users of these Web sites and discus-sion boards develop their own language and values relating to drug use. Club drugs and hallucinogenics are the most often -discussed types of drugs, but online communities involve the discussion of all types of licit and illicit substances, including stimulants and opioids (Gatson 2007a Murguia et al. 2007; Tackett - Gibson 2007). Murguia et al. (2007) report ed on a survey of adult (age s 18 and older) participants in one online community. The self -selected survey sample included 1,038 respondents, 80 percent of wh om were from the United States. Re- spondents were likely to be young (90 percent were under 30), male (76 percent), White (92 percent), relatively affluent (58 percent had household incomes of $45,000 or more), employed (41 percent were employed full time; another 28 percent , part time), and/or in school (57 percent were attending school full or part time). According to the 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approxi-mately 0.3 percent of individuals 12 years of age or older purchase prescription drugs through the Internet (SAMHSA, 2012 b). The Role of Drug Cultures in Substance Abuse Treatment Most people seek some kind of social affilia- tion; it is one aspect of life that gives meaning to day -to-day existence. Behavioral health service providers can b etter understand and help their clients if they have an understand-ing of the culture(s) with which they identify. This understanding can be even more im-portant when addressing the role of drug culture in a client 's life because, of all cultural affiliation s, it is likely to be the one most intimately connected with his or her substance How To Lead an Exercise Examining Benefits, Losses, and the Future (continued) Allot sufficient time for this psychoeducational lecture \u2014not only to demonstrate the benefits and losses associated with use, but also to enable the group to process their thoughts and feelings. Group Room Setup 171 Improving Cultural Competence abuse. The drug culture is likely to have had a considerable influence on the client 's behav- iors related to substance use. Drug Cultures in Assessment and Engagement The first step in understanding the role a drug culture plays in a client 's life is to assess which drug culture(s) the client has been involved with and his or her level of involvement. There are no textbooks that can inform providers about the drug cultures in their areas, but counselors probably know quite a bit about them already, as they learn much about drug cultures through talking with their clients. Counselors who are themselves in recovery may be familiar with some clients' substance - using lifestyles and social environments or will have insight into how to explore the issue with clients. They can also educate their colleagues. Providers who have never personally abus ed substances can learn from recovered counse-lors as well as from their clients. However, asking a client point -blank about his or her involvement in a drug culture is likely to be answered with a blank stare. Instead, talking to clients about their relati onships, daily activities and habits relating to substance use, values, and views of other people and the world can allow provider s to develop a good sense of the meanings drug cultures hold for clients. To engage a client in treatment, understanding his or her relationship with a drug culture may be as important as understanding elements of that client 's racial or ethnic identity. Clients are unlikely to self -identify as members of the drug culture in the same way that they would identify as an African American or Asian American, for example, but they can still be offended or distrustful if they think the provid- er or program does not understand how their lifestyle relates to their substance use. Affilia- tion with a drug culture is a source of client identit y; the client 's place in the drug culture can be important to his or her self -esteem. After the assessment and engagement stage, the provider 's attitude toward the client 's participation in a drug culture will be signifi-cantly different from his or her attitude to-ward the client 's other cultural affiliations. As most providers already know (even if they do not use the term drug culture), if a client How To Learn About Clients' Daily Routines and Rituals One way to gain an understanding of a client 's involvement in a specific drug culture is to learn about his or her daily routines and rituals. Keep in mind that there can be different routines on weekends or specific days of the week; ask about exceptions to the typical daily schedule. Materials needed: Weekly calenda r. Instructions: To elicit information about the client 's daily activities, use a cue or anchor to initiate this explora- tion, such as a calendar highlighting each day of a week \u2014Monday through Sunday. Placing the calendar in front of the client, ask him or her to describe a typical day , beginning with the time that he or she generally wakes up and building on the morning routines (e.g., \"What does an average morning look like for you?\"). Encourage the client to provide a specific account of his or her routine rather than a general response. Important information can be obtained by asking the client about feelings or reactions to daily activities as they unfold in the session. After completing an example of an entire day, ask the client if there are excepti ons to this schedule that routinely occur on another day of the week or during the weekend. Once these are processed, it can be beneficial to ask what it was like for him or her to talk about these daily routines. 172 Chapter 6 \u2014Drug Cultures and the Culture of Recovery continues to be closely affiliated with the drug-using life, then he or she is more likely to relapse. The people, places, things, tho ughts, and attitudes related to drug and/or alcohol use act as triggers to resume use of substances. Behavioral health service providers need to help their clients weaken and eventually elim-inate their connections to the drug culture. White (1996) identifi es an important issue to address during transitio n from engagement to treatment\u2014in the process of engaging clients, provider s help them identify how their con- nections to the drug culture prevent them from reaching their goals and how the loss of these conn ections would affect them if they chose to cut ties with the drug culture. Finding Alternatives to Drug Cultures A client can meet the psychosocial needs previ- ously satisfied by the drug culture in a number of ways. S trengthening cultural identity can be a positive action for the client; in some cases, the client 's family or cultural peers can serve as a replacement for involvement in the drug culture. This option is particularly helpful when the client 's connection to a drug culture is relatively weak and his or her traditional culture is relatively strong. However, when this option is unavailable or insufficient, clinicians must focus on replacing the client 's ties with the drug culture (or the culture of addiction) with new ties to a culture of recovery. To help clients break ties with drug cultures, programs need to challenge clients' continued involvement with elements of those cultures (e.g., style of dress, music, language, or com-munication patterns). This can occur through two basic processes: replacing the element with something new that is positively associat-ed with a culture of recovery (e.g., replacing a marijuana leaf keychain with an NA key-chain), and reframing something so that it is no longer associated with drug use or the drug culture (e.g., listening to music that was asso- ciated with the drug culture at a sober dance with others in recovery; White 1996). The process will depend on the nature of the cul- tural element. Developing a Culture of Recovery Just as people who are actively using or abus-ing substances bond over that common experi-ence to create a drug culture that supports their continued substance use, people in recov-ery can participate in activities with others who are having similar experiences to build a culture of recovery. There is no single drug culture; likewise, there is no single culture of recovery. However, large international mutual - help organizations like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) do represent the culture of recovery for many individuals (Exhibit 6 -7). Even within such organizations, though, there is some cultural diversity; regional differences exist, for example , in meeting -related rituals or attitudes toward certain issues (e.g., use of presc ribed psychotropic medication, approaches to spirituality). The planned TIP, Relapse Prevention and Recovery Promotion in Behavioral Health Services (SAMHSA planned e), provides more information on using mutual- help groups in \"The culture of recovery is an informal social network in which group norms (pre- scribed patterns of perceiving, thinking, feeling, and behaving) reinforce sobriety and lo ng-term recovery from addiction.\" (White 1996, p. 222) Recover y from mental and substance use disorders is a process of change through which people improve their health and wellness, live in a self -directed manner, and work toward achieving their full potential. (SAMHSA 2011b) 173 Improving Cultural Competence treatment settings and in long-term recovery. It contains detailed information about poten- tial recovery supports that behavioral health programs can use to foster cultures of recovery among clients and program graduates. Most treatment programs try to foster a culture of recovery for their clients. Some modalities, with therapeutic com munities being the lead example, focus on this issue as a primary treat- ment strategy. Even one- on-one outpatient treatment programs typically encourage attend-ance a t mutual- help groups, such as AA , to meet socio cultural recovery needs. Most pro- viders also recognize that clients need to replace the activities, beliefs, people, places, and things associated with substance abuse with new recovery- related associations \u2014the central purpose of creating a culture of recover y. Even programs that already recognize the need to create a culture of recovery for their clients can make doing so more of a focus in treatment. White (1996) explores ways to do this, inclu ding: Teaching clients about the existence of drug cultures and their potential influence in clients ' lives. Teaching clients about cultures of recovery and discussing how elements of the drug Exhibit 6 -7: 12- Step Group Values and the Culture of Recovery For historical reasons, cultures of recovery (like the recovery process in general) in the United States have been greatly influenced by 12- Step groups such as AA and NA (White 1998). These groups provide a clearly defined culture of recovery for a great many people. They provide members with a set of rituals, daily activities, customs, traditions, val ues, and beliefs. The 12 Steps and 12 Traditions represent the core principles, values, and beliefs of such groups. Wilcox (1998) defines these values as surrender; faith; acceptance, tolerance, and patience; honesty, openness, and willingness; humility; willingness to examine character defects; taking life one day at a time; and keeping things simple. As seen by comparing these values with those common to the heroin culture described in the \"The Values and Beliefs of a Heroin Culture\" box earlier in this c hap- ter, one of the ways in which 12- Step groups work is by instilling a set of values contrary to those found in drug cultures. However, they also provide members with a new set of values that are in some ways distinct from the values of the mainstream cul ture that were rejected when the individual began his or her involvement in the drug culture (Wilcox 1998). Many of the values of AA and other 12- Step groups are embodied in rituals that take place in meet- ings and in members' daily lives. White (1998) list s four ritual categories: Centering rituals help members stay focused on recovery by reading recovery literature, han- dling recovery tokens or symbols, and taking regular self- assessments or personal inventories each day. Mirroring rituals keep members in contact with one another and help them practice sober living together. Attending meetings, telling one 's story, speaking regularly by phone, and using slo- gans (e.g., \"keep it simple,\" \"pass it on\"), among others, are mirroring activities. Acts of personal responsibility include being honest and becoming time- conscious and punctu- al. Activities include the creation of new rituals of daily living related to sleeping, hygiene, and other areas of self- care while also being reliable and courteous. Acts of service involve performing rituals to help others in recovery. These acts are related to the Twelfth Step, which directs members to carry the message of their spiritual awakening to others who abuse alcohol or are dependent on it, thereby encouraging them to practice the 12 Steps. Acts of service recognize that people in recovery have something of value to offer those still abusing alcohol. These rituals aid the processes of personal transformation and integration into a new cultural group. 174 Ch apter 6 \u2014Drug Cultures and the Culture of Recovery culture can be replaced by elements of a culture of recovery. Establishing clear boundaries for appro- priate behavior (e.g., behavior that does not reflect drug cultures) in the program and consistently correcting behaviors that violate boundaries (e.g., wearing shirts de- picting pot leaves ; displaying gang - affiliated symbols, gestures, and tattoos). Working to shape a peer culture within the program so that longer -term clients and staff members can socialize new clients to a culture of recovery. Having regular assessments of clients and the entire program in which sta ff members and clients determine areas where work is needed to minimize cultural attitudes that can undermine treatment. Involving clients ' families (when appropri- ate) in the treatment process so they can support clients' recovery as well as partici- pate in their own healing process. White (1996) suggests that programs build linkages with mutual -help groups; include mutual -help meetings in their programs or provide access to community mutual -help meetings; and include mutual -help rituals, symbols, language, and values in treatment processes. Other activities that can improve integration into a recovery culture include SAMHSA 's Recovery Community Services Program (http://www.samhsa.gov/grants/2011/ti_11_004.aspx ), which was develo pe d to pro vide and evaluate peer -based recovery support services, and Recovery Community Centers, which provide space for recovering people to social-ize, organize, and develop a recovery culture (White and Kurtz 2006). D eveloping a culture of recovery involves connecting individuals back to the larger community and to their cultures of origin (Davidson et al. 2008). This can require efforts to educate the community about recovery as well (e.g., by promoting a recovery month in the community, hosting recove ry walks or similar events, or offering outreach to community groups, such as churches or fraternal/benevolent societies). Programs that do not have a plan for creating a culture of recovery among clients risk their clients returning to the drug culture or hold- ing on to elements of that culture because it meets their basic and social needs. In the worst case scenario, clients will recreate a drug cul-ture among themselves within the program. In the best case, staff members will have a plan for creating a culture of recovery within their treatment population. SAMHSA 's Guiding Principles of Recovery Recovery emerges from hope. Reco very is person driven. Recovery occurs via many pathways. Recovery is holistic. Recovery is supported by peers and allies. Recovery is supported through relationship and social networks. Recovery is culturally based and influenced. Recovery is supported by addressingtrauma. Recovery involves individual, family, a nd community strengths and responsibility. Recovery is based on respect. More information on the Guiding Principles of Recovery is available a t the SAMHSA Abbott, A.A. treatment with clients of French background. In: Straussner, S.L.A., ed.

New York: Routledge, 1998. 252 Appendix B \u2014Instruments To Measure Identity and Acculturation Some researchers have tested the usefulness of acculturation and identity models with people who abuse substances. For example, Pe\u00f1a and colleagues' racial identity attitude scale was found, in a study of African American men in treatment for cocaine dependence, to help counselors better understand the roles that ethnic and cultural identity play in client s' substance abuse issues (Pe\u00f1a et al. 2000). In 1980, Cuellar and colleagues published their acculturation rating scale for Mexican Americans , which conceptualized accultura- tion as progressing across a 5 -point continu- um ranging from Mexican or low acculturated (level 1) to American or high acculturated (level 5). The mid -level designation of bicul- tural (level 3) was set as the midpoint between the two extremes, although various investiga- tors have questioned this assumption (Oetting and Beauvais 1990; Sayegh and Lasry 1993). Since then, scholars have devel-oped new ways to conceptualize identity and acculturation, ranging from simple scales to comp lex multidimensional models (Skinner 2001). The table that begins on the next page summarizes the instruments available to measure acculturation and ethnic identity. (See also the Center of Excellence for Cultural Competence for additional resources at http:// nyculturalcompetence.org ). Other scales have been developed to examine specific culture- related variables, including machismo (Cuellar et al. 1995; Fragoso and Kashubeck 2000), simpat\u00eda (Griffith et al. o (Sabogal et al. 1987), tradi- tionalism -modernism (Ramirez 1999), and family traditionalism and rural preferences (Castro and Gutierres 1997). Counselors can use acculturation scales to help match patients to providers, to make treatment plans, and to identify the role of identity in substance abuse. Although these instruments can be helpful, the counselor must not rely solely on them to determine the client 's identity or level of acculturation. 253 Improving Cultural Competence Acculturation and Ethnic Identity Measures Instrument Description Cultural Group African American Accul- turation Scale -Revised (Klonoff and Landrine 2000) This scale measures eight dimensions of African American culture: (1) traditional beliefs and prac- tices, (2) traditional family structure and practices, (3) traditional socialization, (4) preparation and consumption of traditional foods, (5) preference for African American things, (6) interracial atti- tudes, (7) superstitions, and (8) traditional health beliefs and practices. African Americans Black Racial Identity Attitude Scale \u2014Form B (Helms 1990) This scale measures beliefs or attitudes of Blacks toward both Blacks and Whites using 5 -point scales. It is available in short and long forms. African Americans Cross Racial Identity Scale (Worrell et al. 2001) This scale measures six identity clusters associated with four stages of racial identity development. African Americans Multidimensional Inven- tory of Black Identity (MIBI; Sellers et al. 1997) The MIBI mea sures centrality of Black identity, ideology, and regard for a Black identity. It is available online at http://sitemaker.umich.edu/aaril/files/mibiscaleand scoring.pdf . African Americans Scale To Assess African American Acculturation (Snowden and Hines 1999) This is a 10 -item scale that assesses media prefer- ences, racial bias in relationships, race -related attitudes, and comfort in interacting with other races. African Americans African Self - Consciousness Scale (Baldwin and Bell 1985) This scale measures within -group variability in the level of acculturation/cultural identity continuum (Baldwin and Bell 1985) based on degree of Afrocentricity or Nigrescence (White and Parham 1996). It indicates a client' s level of involvement in traditional African American culture or the core African -oriented culture. African Americans/African Immigrants Native American Accul- turation Scale (Garrett and Pichette 2000) The Native American Acculturation scale asks 20 questions to ascertain a client 's level of involve- ment with Native American culture. Native Americans Rosebud Personal Opinion Survey (Hoffman n et al. 1985) This assessment evaluates components of accul- turation, including language use, values, social behaviors, social networks, religious affiliation and practice, home community, education, ancestry, and cultural identification. Native Americans Asian American Multi- dimensional Accultura- tion Scale (AAMAS; Gim Chung et al. 2004) The AAMAS was developed to be easy to use with a variety of Asian American ethnic groups. It includes questions relating to cultural identity, language use, cultural knowledge, and food preferences. Asian Americans (Continued on the next page.) 254 Appendix B \u2014Instruments To Measure Identity and Acculturation Acculturation and Ethnic Identity Measures (continued) Instrument Description Cultural Group Cultural Adjustment Difficulties Checklist (CADC; Sodowsky and Lai 1997) The CADC helps avoid potential problems relating to acculturation by asking about language use, social customs, family interactions, perceptions of prejudice, friendship networks, and cultural ad- justment. Asian Americans (East Asians) East Asian Acculturation Measure (Barry 2001) This instrument includes 29 items that assess assimilation, level of separation from other Asians, integration, and marginalization. Asian Americans (East Asians) General Ethnicity Ques- tionnaire (GEQ; Tsai et al. 2000) The GEQ is an instrument designed to be used with minor modifications for assessin g cultural orientation with different cultural groups. There are original and abridged versions. The original includes 75 items asking about language use, social affiliations, cultural practices, and cultural identification. Asian Americans (although desig ned to be multicultural in orientation) Suinn -Lew Asian Self - Identity Acculturation Scale (Suinn et al. 1992) This instrument was modeled after the Accultura- tion Rating Scale for Mexican Americans, and research indicates it has high reliability. Asian Ame ricans Ethnocultural Identity Behavioral Index (Yama- da et al. 1998) This is a 19 -item self -report assessment with high validity. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Internal -External Ethnic Identity Measure (Kwan 1997) The instrument evaluates ethnic friendships and affiliation, ethno communal expression, ethnic food orientation, and family collectivism, in order to differentiate three Chinese American identity groups: (1) internal, (2) external, and (3) internal - external undifferentiated. Chinese Ameri cans Mar\u00edn and Mar\u00edn Accul- turation Scale (Mar\u00edn et al. 1987) This scale is a 12 -item instrument that assesses three domains: (1) language use, (2) media prefer- ences, and (3) ethnic diversity of social relations. It is available online at http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ssw/projects/pmap/ docs/gupta_acculturation.pdf Chinese Americans Behavioral Acculturation Scale and Value Accul- turation Scale (Szapocz- nik et al. 1978) These two scales, used in conjunction with one another, ask individuals about behaviors and values in order to determine acculturation. If used singly, the behavioral scale is the superior measure for acculturation. Cuban Americans Na Mea Hawai 'i (Hawaiian Ways), A Hawaiian Acculturation Scale (Rezentes 1993) This is a 34 -item scale. An adolescent version is available (Hishinuma et al. 2000). Native Hawaiians (Continued on the next page.) 255 Improving Cultural Competence Acculturation and Ethnic Identity Measures (continued ) Instrument Description Cultural Group Abbreviated Multi- dimensional Accul- turation (AMAS -ZABB; -ZABB is a multidimensional, bilinear, 42 - item scale that evaluates identity, language compe- tence, and cultural competence. Latinos Acculturation Scale (Marin et al. 1987) This 12 -item acculturation scale, available in English and Spanish, evaluates language use, media prefer- ences, and social activities. It is available online at http://casaa.unm.edu/inst/MARIN%20Short%20Scale. pdf Latinos Bicultural Involve- ment Questionnaire (BIQ; Szapocznik et al. 1980) The BIQ assesses language use and involvement in both Latino and mainstream American activities. It relates two sets of scores to derive a measure of bicultural involvement, with individuals who are highly involved in both cultures scoring highest on the scale. Latinos The Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Hisp anics (Marin and Gamba 1996) This 24 -item scale asks questions about language use, language proficiency, and media preferences. Latinos Brief Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (Norris et al. 1996) This scale has only four items, but scores on the scale have been correlated highly with generation, nativity, length of time in the United States, language prefer- ences, and subjective perceptions of acculturation. Latinos Multidimensional Measure of Cultural Identity for Latinos (Felix -Ortiz et al. 1994) This measure places adolescents in one of four cate- gories based on language, behavior/familiarity, and values/attitudes: (1) bicultural, (2) Latino -identified, and low -level bicultural. Mexica n -I; Cuellar et al. 1980) The ARSMA -I differentiates between 5 levels of accul- turation: (1) Very Mexican, (2) Mexican -Oriented Bicultural, (3) True Bicultural, (4) Anglo -Oriented Bicultural, and (5) Very Anglicized. Established validity. Mexican Americans Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans -II (Cuellar et al. 1995) This scale is like the ARSMA -I, except that it includes separate subscales to measure multidimensional aspects of cultural orientation toward Mexican and Anglo cu ltures independently. Mexican Americans Cultural Life Style Inventory (Mendoza 1989) This self -report instrument, available in Spanish and English, evaluates five dimensions of acculturation: intrafamily language use, extrafamily language use, social acti vities and affiliations, cultural knowledge and activities, and cultural identification and pride. Mexican Americans (Continued on the next page.) 256 Appendix B \u2014Instruments To Measure Identity and Acculturation Acculturation and Ethnic Identity Measures (continued) Instrument Description Cultural Group Cultural Life Style Inventory (Mendoza 1989) This self -report instrument, available in Spanish and English, evaluates acculturation on five dimensions: intrafamily language use, extrafamily language use, social activities and affiliations, cultural knowledge and activities, and cultural identification and pride. Mexican Americans Mexican American Acculturation Scale (Montgomery 1992) This 28 -item scale evaluates cultural orientation and comfort with ethnic identity. Items ask about language use, media preferences, cultural activities/traditions, and self -perceived ethnic identity. Mexican Americans Padilla 's Acculturation Scale (Padilla 1980) Padilla 's a 155 -item question- naire that assesses cultural knowledge and ethnic loyalties. Mexican Americans Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (Mar\u00edn and Gamba 1996) This scale measures evaluates two major dimensions of acculturation (Hispanic and non -Hispanic) using 12 items measuring 3 language- related areas. It has been found to have high consistency and validity. Mexican Americans and Central Americans Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale (Stephenson 2000) This is a 32 -item instrument that evaluates immersion in both culture of origin and the dominant culture of the society. Multicultural Vancouver Index of Acculturation (Ryder et al. 2000) This instrument includes 20 questions that assess interest/participation in one' s \"heritage culture\" Scale (Cort\u00e9s and Rogler 1994) Developed for use with first - and second -generation Puerto Rican adults, this scale measures involvement in American culture and Puerto Rican culture, but it has limited evidence of validity and reliabili ty. Puerto Rican Americans Psychological Acculturation Scale (Tropp et al. 1999) The items on this scale pertain to the client 's sense of psychological attachment to and belonging within Anglo American and Hispanic/Latino cultures. Puerto Ricans on the U. S. main- land Acculturation Scale for Southeast Asians (Anderson et al. 1993) This 13 -item scale evaluates languages proficiency and preferences regarding social interactions, cultural activities, and food. It includes two subscales for proficiency in languages, as well as language, social, and food preferences. Cambodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese Americans White Racial Identity Attitude Scale (Helms and Carter 1990) This 50 -item instrument rates items on a 5 -point scale to measure attitudes associated with Helms 's stages of racial identity development for Caucasians. White Americans 257 Appendix C \u2014Tools for Assessing Cultural Competence There are numerous assessment tools available for evaluating cultural competenc e in clinical, training, and organizational settings. These tools are not specific to behavioral health treatment. Though more work is needed in developing empirically supported instruments to measure cul- tural competenc e, there is a wealt h of multicultural counseling and healthcare assessment tools that can provide guidance in identifying areas for improvement of cultural competenc e. This appendix examines three resource areas: counselor self -assessment tools, guidelines and assess- ment too ls to implement and evaluate culturally responsive services within treatment programs and organizations, and forms addressing client satisfaction with and feedback about culturally responsive services. Though not an exhaustive review of available tools, this appendix does pro-vide samples of tools that are within the public domain.

Ethnic- Sensitive Inventory (ESI; Ho 1991 , reproduced with permission) Here are some statements made by some practitioners wi th ethnic minority clients. How often do you feel this way when you work with ethnic minority clients? Every statement should be answered by circling one number ranging from 5 (always) to 4 (frequently), 3 (occasionally), 2 (seldom), and 1 (never). In work ing with ethnic minority clients, I . . . A.

This section is reproduced from material in the public domain. Note that the Centers for Medi care and Medicaid Services (CMS ) have also developed tools to assess linguistic competence and interpreter services as well as guidelines for planning culturally responsive services (see the CMS Web s ite at http://www.cms.gov ). The National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services ( CLAS ) are meant to advance health equity, improve quality, and help elimi- nate health disparities by establishing a blueprint for health and health care organizations to: Principal standard 1. Provide effective, equitable, understandable, and respectful quality care and services that are responsive to diverse cultural health beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy, and other communication needs. Governance, leadership, and workforce 2. Advance and sustain organizational governance and leadership that promotes CLAS and health equity through policy, practices, and allocated resources. 3. Recruit, promote, and support a culturally and linguistically diverse governance, leadership, and workforce that are responsive to the population in the service area. 4. Educate and train governance, leadership, and workforce in culturally and linguistically ap-propriate policies and practices on an ongoing basis. Communication and language assistance 5. Offer language assistance to individuals who have limited English proficiency and/or other communication needs, at no cost to them, to facilitate timely access to all health care and services. 6. Inform all individuals of the availability of language assistance services clearly and in their preferred language, verbally and in writing. 7. Ensure the competence of individuals providing language assistance, recognizing that the use of untrained individu als and/or minors as interpreters should be avoided. 265 Improving Cultural Competence 8. Provide easy -to-understand print and multimedia materials and signage in the languages commonly used by the populations in the service area. Engagement, continuous improvement, and accountability 9. Establish culturally and linguistically appropriate goals, policies, and management accounta- bility, and infuse them throughout the organization 's planning and operations. 10. Conduct ongoing assessments of the organization 's CLAS -related activities and integrate CLAS -related measures into measurement and continuous quality improvement activities. 11. Collect and maintain accurate and reliable demographic data to monitor and evaluate the impact of CLAS on health equity and outcomes and to inform service delivery. 12. Conduct regular assessments of community health assets and needs and use the results to plan and implement services that respond to the cultural and linguistic diversity of popula-tions in the service area. 13. Partner with the community to design, implement, and evaluate policies, practices, and services to ensure cultural and linguistic appropriateness. 14. Create conflict and grievance resolution processes that are culturally and linguistically appro-priate to identify, prevent, and resolve conflicts or complaints. 15. Communicate the organization 's progress in implementing and sustaining CLAS to all stakeholders, constituents, and the general public. The Organizational Cultural Competence Assessment Profile The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) developed the Organizational Cultural Competence Assessment Profile from the cultural competence literature, guided by a team of experts. The profile was used during site visits to a variety of healthcare settings. It is an organizing framework and set of specific indicators to assist in examining, demonstrating, and documenting cultural responsiveness in organizations involved in the direct delivery of health care and services. The profile is not intended to be prescriptive; rather, it is designed to be adapted, modified, or applied in ways that best fit within an organization 's con text. The profile is presented as a matrix that classifies indicators by critical domains of organizational functioning and by whether the indicators relate to the structures, processes, outputs, or outcomes of the organization. The indicators suggest that assessment of cultural competence should encompass both qualitative and quantitative data and evaluate progress toward achieving results, not just the end results. Alt-hough the profile can be used in whole or in part, the full application enables an organ ization to assess its level of cultural competence comprehensively. Adapted here from material in the public domain are the matrices for process and capacity/structure measures. For more information, see http:// www.hrsa.gov/culturalcompetence/ healthdlvr.pdf .

The following cultural formulation adopted by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, F ifth Edition (DSM -5; 2013, pp. 749 -759) provides a systematic outline for incorporating culturally relevant information when conducting a multi-axial diagnostic assessment. Whether or not they are credentialed to diagnose disorders, counselors and other clinical staff can use the main content areas listed below to guide the interview, initial intake, and treatment planning processes. (For review, see Mezzich and Caracci 2008; for Native American application, specifi-cally Lakota, refer to Brave Heart 2001. ) 1. Cultural identity of the person . Note the person 's ethnic or cultural reference groups. For immigrants and ethnic minorities, also note degree of involvement with culture of origin and host culture (where applicable). Also note language ability, use, and preference (including multilingualism). 2. Cultural explanations of the person 's illness . Identify the following: the predomi-nant idioms of distress through which symp- toms or the need for social support are com-municated (e.g., \"nerves,\" possessing spi rits, somatic complaints, inexplicable misfortune), the meaning and perceived severity of the individual 's symptoms in relation to norms of the cultural reference group, any local illness category used by the individual 's family and community to identify a condition (see the \"Cultur al Concepts of Distress\" section of this appendix), the perceived causes or explanatory models that the individual and the reference group use to explain the illness, and current preferences for and past experiences with professi onal and popular sources of care. 3. Cultural factors related to psychosocial environment and level of functioning . Note culturally relevant interpretations of social stressors, available social supports, and levels of functioning and disability, including stresses in the local social environment and the role of religion and kin networks in providing emo-tional, instrumental, and informational support. 4. Cultural elements of the relationship between client and clinician . Indicate differ- ences in culture and social status between client and clinician, as well as any problems these differences may cause in diagnosis and 283 Improving Cultural Competence treatment (e.g., difficulty communicating in the client 's first language, eliciting symptoms or understanding their cultural significance, nego tiating an appropriate relationship or level of intimacy, determining whether a behavior is normative or pathological). 5. Overall cultural assessment for diagnosis and care . Conclude cultural formulation by discussing how cultural considerations specifi- cally influence comprehensive diagnosis and care. Cultural Concepts of Distress Just as standard screening instruments can sometimes be of limited use with culturally diverse popul ations , so too are standard diag- noses. Expressions of psychological problems are, in part, culturally specific, and behavior that is aberrant in one culture can be standard in another. For example, seemingly paranoid thoughts are to be expected in clients who have migrated from countries with oppressive governments. Culture plays a large role in understanding phenomena that might be construed as mental illnesses in Western medicine. These cultur al concepts of distress may or may not be linked to particular DSM - 5 diagnostic criteria (APA 20 13). The table that follows lists DSM -5 cultur al concepts of distress; other concepts exist that are not recognized in DSM -5. DSM -5 Cultural Concepts of Distress Syndrome Description Populations Ataque de nervios Commonly reported symptoms include uncontrollable shouting, attacks of crying, trembling, heat in the chest rising into the head, and verbal or physical aggression. Dissociative experiences, sei- zurelike or fainting episodes, and suicidal gestures are prominent in some attacks but absent in others. A general feature of an ataque de nervios is a sense of being out of control. Ataques de nervios frequently occur as a direct result of a stressful event relating to the family (e.g., death of a close relative, separation or divorce from a spouse, conflict with spouse or children, or witnessing an accident involving a family member). People can experience amnesia for what occurred during the ataque de nervios, but they otherwise return rapidly to their usual level of functioning. Although descrip- tions of some ataques de nervios most closely fit with the DSM -IV description of panic attacks, the association of most ataques with a precipitating event and the frequent absence of the hallmark symp- toms of acute fear or ap prehension distinguish them from panic disorder. Ataques range from normal expressions of distress not associated with a mental disorder to symptom presentations associ- ated with anxiety, mood dissociative, or somatoform disorders. Caribbean, Latin American , Latin Mediterranean Dhat (jiryan in India, skra prameha in Sri Lanka, shen -k'uei in China) A folk diagnosis for severe anxiety and hypochondriacal concerns associated with the discharge of semen, whitish discoloration of the urine, weakness, and exhaustion. Asian Indian (Continued on the next page.) 284 Appendix E \u2014Cultural Formulation in Diagnosis and Cultural Concepts of Distress DSM -5 Cultural Concepts of Distress (continued) Nervios Refers both to a general state of vulnerability to stress and to a syndrome evoked by difficult life circumstances. Nervios includes a wide range of symptoms of emotional distress, somatic disturb- ance, and inability to function. Common symptoms include head- aches and \"brain aches,\" irritability, stomach disturbances, sleep difficulties, nervousness, tearfulness, inability to co ncentrate, trembling, Nervios tends to be an ongoing problem, although it is variable in the degree of disability mani- fested. Nervios is a broad syndrome that ranges from cases free of a mental disorder to presentations resembling adjustment, anxie- ty, depressive, dissociative, somatoform, or psychotic disorders. Differential diagnosis depends on the constellation of symptoms, the kind of social events associated with ons et and progress, and the level of disability experienced. Latin American Shenjing shuairuo A condition characterized by physical and mental fatigue, head- aches, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, sleep disturbance, and memory loss. Other symptoms include gastrointestinal problems, sexual dysfunction, irritability, excitability, and autonomic del alma , or chibih ) An illness attributed to a frightening event that causes the soul to leave the body and results in unhappiness and sickness. Individuals with susto also experience significant strains in key social roles. Symptoms can appear days or years after the fright is experi- enced. In extreme cases, susto can result in death. Typi cal symp- toms include appetite disturbances, inadequate or excessive sleep, troubled sleep or dreams, sadness, lack of motivation, and feelings of low self- worth or dirtiness. Somatic symptoms accom- panying susto include muscle aches and pains, headache, sto m- achache, and diarrhea. Ritual healings focus on calling the soul back to the body and cleansing the person to restore bodily and spiritual balance. Susto can be related to major depressive disor- der, posttraumatic stress disorder, and somatoform disorders. Similar etiological beliefs and symptom configurations are found in many parts of the world. Latino American, Mexican, Central and South American Taijin kyofusho This syndrome refers to an individual 's intense fear that his or her body, its parts, or its functions displease, embarrass, or are offen- sive to other people in appearance, odor, facial expressions, or movement. This syndrome is included in the official Japanese diagnostic system for mental disorders. Japanese Source: APA 2013.

American Indian and Alaska Native people include those \"having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who main-tain tribal affiliatio n or community attach- ment\" (Grieco and Cassidy 2001, p. 2). Asians are defined in the United States (U.S.) Census as \"people having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent ,\" including , for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam (Grieco and Cassidy 2001, p. 2). Biculturalism is \"a well- developed capacity to function effectively within two distinct cul-tures based on the acquisit ion of the norms, values, and behavioral routines of the domi-nant culture\" and one 's own culture (Castro and Garfinkle 2003, p. 1385). Biracial individuals have two distinct racial heritages, either one from each parent or as a result of racial blending in an earlier genera- tion (Root 1992). Blacks/African Americans are, according to the U.S. Census Bureau (2000) definition, people whose origins are \"in any of the black racial groups of Africa\" (p. A -3). The term includes descendants of African slaves brough t to this country against their will and more recent immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean , and South or Central America (many individ-uals from these latter regions, if they come from Spanish -speaking cultural groups, iden- tify or are identified primarily as Latino). The term Black is often used interchangeably with African American, although for some, the term African American is used specifically to describe those individuals whose families have been in this country since at least the 19th century and thu s have developed distinctly African American cultural groups. Black can be a more inclusive term describing African Americans as well as for more recent immi-grants with distinct cultural backgrounds. Confianza means trust or confidence in the benevolence o f the other person. Conformity in Helms' s model of racial iden- tity development refers to the tendency of members of a racial group to behave in con-gruence with the values, beliefs, and attitudes of their own culture to which they have been exclusively expo sed. Cultural competence is \"a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that . . . ena-ble a system, agency, or group of professionals to work effectively in cross- cultural situations\" 295 Improving Cultural Competence (Cross et al. 1989, p. 13). It refers to the ability to hono r and respect the beliefs, lan- guage s, interpersonal styles, and behaviors of individuals and families receiving services, as well as staff members who are providing such services. \"Cultural competence is a dynamic, ongoing developmental process that requir es a long-term commitment and is achieved over time\" (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] 2003a , p. 12). Cultural competence plans are strategic plans that outline a systematic organizational approach to provid ing culturally responsive services to individuals and to increasing cul- tural competence among staff at each level of the organization. Cultural diffusion is the process of cultural intermingling. Cultural humility \"incorporates a lifelong commitment to self -evaluation and critique\" (Tervalon and Murray -Garc\u00eda 1998, p. 123) to redress the power imbalances in counselor - client relationships. Cultural norms are the spoken or unspoken rules or standards for a cultural g roup that indicate whether a certain social event or behavior is considered appropriate or inappro-priate. Cultural proficiency involves a deep and rich knowledge of a culture\u2014 an insider 's view\u2014 that allows the counselor to accurately inter-pret the subtle meanings of cultural behavior (Kim et al. 1992). Culture is the conceptual system that struc- tures the way people view the world \u2014it is the particular set of beliefs, norms, and values that influence ideas about the nature of relation-ships, the way people live their lives, and the way people organize their world. Ethnicity refers to the social identity and mutual belongingness that defines a group of people on the basis of common origins, shared beliefs, and shared standards of behavior (culture). Ethnocentrism is \"the tendency to view one's own culture as best and to judge the behavior and beliefs of culturally different people by one's own standards\" (Kottak 1991, p. 47). Health disparit y is a particular type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage. Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group; religion; socioeconomic status; gender; age; mental health; disability; sexual orienta-tion or gender identity; geographic location; or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion (HHS 2011a ). Hembrismo refers to female strength, endur- ance, courage, perseverance, and bravery (Falicov 1998). Latinos are those who identify themselves in one of the specific Hispanic or Latino Census categories \u2014Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban \u2014as well as those who indicate that they are \"other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino.\" Origin can be viewed as the heritage, nation-ality, group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person 's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. Immersion -emersion is a stage in the identi- ty development models of both Cross and Helms during which a transition takes place from satisfaction with the old self to commit-ment to personal change: from immersion in one's old identity to emerging with a more mature view of one's identity (Cross 1995 b). Indige nous peoples are those people native to a particular country or region. In the case of the United States and its territories, this 296 Appendix G \u2014Glossary includes Native Hawaiians, Alaska Natives, Pacific Islanders, and American Indians. Institutional racism generally \"refers to the policies, practices, an d norms that incidentally but inevitably perpetuate inequality, \" resulting in \"significant economic, legal, political and social restrictions\" (Thompson and Neville 1999, p. 167). Language is a culture's communication sys- tem and the vehicle through which aspects of race, ethnicity, and culture are communicated. Ma chismo is the traditional sense of responsi- bility Latino men feel for the welfare and protection of their families. Marianismo is the traditional belief that Latinas sho uld be self -sacrificing, endure suffering for the sake of their families, and defer to their husbands in all matters. The Virgin Mary is held up as the model to which all women should aspire. Motivational interviewing is a counseling style characterized by the strategic therapeutic activities of expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, avoiding argument, rolling with resistance, and supporting self -efficacy. In motivational interviewing, t he counselor 's major tool is reflective listening. Multiracial individuals are any racially mixed people and include biracial people, a s well as those with more than two distinct racial herit-ages (Root 1992). Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Is- landers include those with \"origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii , Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands\" (Grieco and Cassidy 2001, p. 2). Other Pacific Islanders include Tahitians ; Northern Mariana Islanders; Palauans; Fijians ; like Melanesians, Micronesians, or Polynesians. Nguzo saba are the seven African American principles celebrated during Kwanzaa: Umoja is unity with family, community, nation, and race. Kujichagulia means self-determination to define collective selves, create for collective selves, and speak for collective selves. Ujima refers to collective responsibility to build and maintain community and solve problems together. Ujamaa refers to cooperative economics to build and maintain businesses and to prof-it from them together. Nia is a sense of purpose to collectively build and develop community to restore people to their traditional greatness. Kuumba is creativity to always do as much as possible to leave the community more beautiful and beneficial than it was. Imani refers to belief in the community's parents, teachers, and leaders and in the righteousness and victory of the struggle. Organizational cultural competence and responsiveness refers to a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that enable a system, agency, or group of professionals to work effectively in cross- cultural situations (Cross et al. 1989). It is a dynamic, ongoing process. Orgullo means pride and dignity. Personalismo is the use of positive personal qualities to accomplish a task. Race is a social construct that describes people with shared physical cha racteristics. Racism is an attitude or belief that people with certain shared physical characteristics are better than others. Reculturation occurs when individuals return to their countr ies of origin after a prolonged period in other countries and readapt to the dominant culture. 297 Improving Cultural Competence Respeto can be translated as respect but also includes elements of both emotional depend- ence and dutifulness (Bar\u00f3n 2000). Selective perception is, in Helms's model of racial identity development , the tendency of people early in the process to observe their environment in ways that generally confirm their pre -existing beliefs. Simpat \u00eda is an approach to social interaction that avoids conflict and confrontation. One who is simp \u00e1tico is agreeable and strives to maintain harmony within the group. Syncretism is the result of combining differ- ing systems, such as traditional and introduced cultural traits. Transculturation is the acceptance of a part or a trait of one culture into another culture. White privilege is a form of ethnocentrism and refers to a position of entitlement based on a presumed culturally superior status. Whites/Caucasians are people \"having ori- gins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. \" This category includes peo ple who indicate their race as White or report entries \"such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish\" (Grieco and Cassidy 2001, p. 2). 298 Appendix H\u2014 Resource Panel Note: Information given indicates each participant 's affiliation during the time the panel was convened and may no longer reflect the individual's current affiliation.

Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs) are the products of a systematic and innovative process that brings together clinicians, researchers, program managers, policymakers, and other federal and non -federal experts to reach consensus on state -of-the-art treatment practices. TIPs are developed under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA 's) Knowledg e Application Program (KAP) to improve the treatment capabilities of the Nation's alcohol and drug abuse treatment service system. What Is a Quick Guide? A Quick Guide clearly and concisely presents the primary information from a TIP in a pocket -sized book let. Each Quick Guide is divided into sections to help readers quickly locate relevant material. Some contain glossaries of terms or lists of resources. Page numbers from the original TIP are referenced so pro- viders can refer back to the source document fo r more information. What Are KAP Keys? Also based on TIPs, KAP Keys are handy, durable tools. Keys may include assessment or screening in- struments, checklists, and summaries of treatment phases. Printed on coated paper, each KAP Keys set is fastened togeth er with a key ring and can be kept within a treatment provider's reach and consulted fre- quently. The Keys allow you, the busy clinician or program administrator, to locate information easily and to use this information to enhance treatment services.
