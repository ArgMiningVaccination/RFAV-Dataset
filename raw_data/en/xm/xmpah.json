Of these 199 are classified as research universities, based on their award of doctorates and the receipt of significant research support. In 2003, the top 100 performed 79.6 percent of the total of academic research. The top 20 were re- sponsible for 29.6 percent of the total; of these, 12 were state supported (includ - ing UCSD, which ranked sixth) and 8 private. These research universities have played a critical role in the nation's rise to global prominence in science and tech- nology. Whether the U.S. will continue to enjoy its overall preeminence, in an in- creasingly competitive environment, will depend on how well the research univer - sities - and the government, industries, and private donors and foundations on which they depend - meet the challenges the universities now face. World War II as the Watershed: The Bush Report Until W orld War II, private univer - sities obtained research support from their endowments and from non-profit foundations, and state universities, from state governments. The war brought significant change. On June 12, 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order creating a National Defence Research Council. The NDRC was chaired by Vannevar Bush, formerly Dean of Engineering at MIT and then President of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. In 1941, FDR set up the Office of Scientific Re- search and Develop - ment (OSRD) in the Executive Office, giving Bush more authority to organize the nation's scientific resources in preparation for what was considered Amer - ica's inevitable entry into the war in Europe. OSRD sought to enable scientists and engineers to serve the war effort in settings as close as pos- sible to their accustomed venues, which often meant universities. Even when it was necessary to create new, secret re- search facilities, the R&D at these facili - ties was often placed under the manage - ment of universities. As the war was drawing to a close, FDR asked Bush for advice on what les- sons should be drawn from the wartime experience. Bush appointed committees and summarized the findings in a report entitled Science - the Endless Frontier . The Bush report stressed four conclusions that became the basis of the nation's sci- ence policy: 1. Except for national defense, the proper concern of science policy should be support rather than utilization of re- search. 2. Again with the exception of na- tional defense, the principal focus of fed- eral support for science should be basic research. 3. The mechanisms for the support of research should be consistent with the norms of the practitioners (which ef- fectively meant it should be given in the form of grants allowing the researchers more flexibility rather than contracts set- ting rigid requirements). 4. Less explicitly stated than the first conclusions but logically implied by them was the proposition that because of the primacy of basic research, the nation's universities should be the seedbed of the national research system. By Richard C. Atkinson and William A. BlanpiedUCSD Emeriti AssociationPage 2 April 2007 v Chronicles The T wo Formative Periods It is no exaggeration to say that the implementation of the Bush Report in subsequent decades enabled the research universities to achieve their present sta- tus. T o appreciate how the research uni- versities have become core contributors to the nation's science and technology, it is important to note the changes that occurred in two formative periods, from 1950 to 1975 and 1975 to 2000. 1950-1975. In this period, the research universities flowered. In the 1950s, universities' share of the nation's total R&D effort stood at 5.3 percent. By 1975 it had risen to 10 percent. In 2004 it reached 13.6 percent. It was widely accepted that investments in research, including the basic research carried out mainly at universities, was a significant factor in promoting economic growth. Other intangible measures testify to the importance of the research university in this critical quarter-century. Between 1950 and 1975, all 26 of the Nobel Prizes in physics were either won outright or shared by Americans; the comparable figures in chemistry and physiology-med - icine were 18 out of 26 and 26 out of 26, respectively. With few exceptions, the laureates were on the faculty of Ameri - can universities. During the same period, large numbers of foreign students sought admission to U.S. graduate schools. 1975-2000 . In these years, private in- dustry stepped up support for academic re- search. In the 1950s, while federal support seemed almost limitless, university research - ers ignored industrial funding. By 1975 it stood at only 3.3 percent of all university funds for research. As federal support began to dry up, and as the federal government sought to encourage cooperation by such legislation as the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, industrial support rose in the 1990s to about 7 percent, where it has since remained. Overall, the profile of U.S. research support changed significantly in this period. In 1975, the federal government accounted for about 45 percent of total national R&D expendi - tures, while industry accounted for 42 per- cent. By 2000, the federal contribution had declined to 24 percent, while the industrial share had risen to close to 70 percent.Current Challenges Although the momentum of growth is well established, and there are indi- cators of positive progress, the research university faces a number of critical chal- lenges - nine in particular - in this first decade of the present century: 1. Increased funding for academic research continues to be skewed to - wards only a few fields. Between 1973 and 2003, support for medical sciences (measured in constant, inflation-adjusted dollars) rose from approximately $3 bil- lion to $12 billion, that for biological sci- ences from slightly less than $3 billion to $7 billion, while support for engineering research rose from $1 billion in 1973 to $5.6 billion in 2003. In contrast, support for most other disciplines, including the physical sciences, earth, atmospheric and ocean sciences, and all the social scienc - es, increased only from $1 billion in 1973 to about $2 billion in 2003. The skewing of research funds has been exacerbated by the notorious practice of \"earmarking\" - whereby members of Congress feather the nests of their constituents and sup- porters. In the case of academic research, the earmarks set up research projects that circumvent the process of peer review. 2. The project system forces uni - versity faculty, especially new faculty, to spend an inordinate amount of time on proposal preparation. In fields where research funding has not increased sig- nificantly, competition has become more formidable, especially for newly minted Ph.D.s. The overall success rate for pro- posals submitted to the National Science Foundation is about 30 percent; for new Ph.D.s it is 20 percent. This is a problem because unless younger faculty can suc- ceed in showing they can produce accept - able research, they are forced to accept positions at less prestigious universities and colleges. In an effort to compete better, faculty researchers are tempted to submit proposals for safe rather than more risky cutting-edge projects. 3. T alented young people are being deterred from opting for careers in sci - ence by the time needed to develop their careers. It takes a minimum of five years - seven is the norm - for students in the natural sciences and engineering to obtain their PhDs, and they are then required to obtain one or even two three-year post- doctoral appointments before they can be considered for tenure track appointments. Y oung scientists are typically in their mid- 30s before their independent scientific ca- reers can begin. This puts them in a less than enviable position vis a vis their col- lege classmates who gain secure and pro- ductive positions in other professions, not to mention higher salaries. 4. America's rise to global promi - nence has been made possible, to a significant degree, by the influx of for - eign students, but there is no reason to believe that the numbers of this indis - pensable element in past success will continue to increase indefinitely. In 1998, Asian institutions of higher educa - tion awarded 20,000 PhDs, on a par with the number awarded to Asian students in the U.S. Since 1995, a growing num- ber of Chinese, Korean, and T aiwanese students have been obtaining their doc- torates in their home countries. In view of the determination of Asian countries to move their universities into the front ranks, U.S. universities would be ill ad- vised to count on attracting more, or even as many, of these students as they have been accustomed to getting. 5. The advance of knowledge has led to the fragmentation of disciplines, with the result that many departments have been split into independent de - partments devoted to sub-specialties. While this is a good development in some respects, because it reflects and promotes progress in specialized research, it is bad insofar as it weakens communication and makes the integration of new knowledge more difficult. Moreover, many universi - ties that once had a core college of arts and sciences plus a few professional schools such as law and medicine now in- clude less \"academic\" schools devoted to what are considered more practical cur- ricula, further fragmenting the research university. 6. Because of the increased focus on research and graduate education in the research universities, faculty ad - vancement depends primarily on the UCSD Emeriti AssociationPage 3 Chronicles v April 2007 production of highly regarded research, and undergraduate instruction suffered because it is considered peripheral. Undergraduate courses are often made up of two lectures a week to a large class by a senior professor, supplemented by recitation sections conducted by gradu - ate students or post-docs with no train - ing in teaching and in many cases with halting English and no understanding of the give-and-take between teachers and faculty that is commonplace in American universities. Indeed, it is worth noting that a larger proportion of undergradu - ates who attend high quality four-year colleges go on to graduate school than do those who are undergraduates at the country's leading research universities. 7. In many research universities, senior faculty design their courses to prepare undergraduates for graduate school, thereby doing a disservice to the many students who take these courses as preparation for careers in medicine or to gain an insight into the history and current status of knowledge in one or more scientific disciplines. These students need a broad oversight of the fields rather than the narrower, special - ized preparation designed for prospec - tive graduate students in the fields of research. 8. Despite major efforts mounted by the NSF and other federal agencies as well as professional societies to en - courage women and ethnic minorities to seek careers in science and engineer - ing, the results have been disappoint - ing. There has been a noticeable increase in female engineers and slight increases in the number of females who elect to earn Ph.D.s in the physical sciences, but there is indisputable evidence that these talented young female Ph.D.s continue to bump up against the \"glass ceiling\" as they attempt to advance in conservative academic hierarchies. 9. A problem unique to the state universities that qualify as research uni - versities is that their budgets depend on uncertain whims of state governments and legislatures. Although most of the large state universities derive the bulk of their budgets from overhead on federal research grants, funding from state gov- ernments remains the bedrock of their re- search programs. As state budgets become tight, politicians are tempted to suppose that significant reductions in university budgets can do little harm in the short run - failing to understand that reconstituting a diminished educational institution takes many years to accomplish. Overall, an examination of the his- tory of research universities in the U.S. reveals that as elsewhere, they are fun- damentally conservative institutions. When they do change, they most often do so slowly and deliberately. From the 11th century through the mid 19th cen- tury, universities were predominantly teaching institutions, with their distin - guished faculties expected to earn their non-academic rewards separate from the institutions themselves. The evolution of Meetings of the Council of UC Emeriti Associations (CUCEA) give us a chance to hear directly from the managers of our retirement system (UCRS) and health plan negotiators. At the recent meeting in Berkeley we learned of some important developments on both scores: The annual UC payroll currently totals $6.7 billion. $1 billion of this (16%) is transferred to UCRS, but actuaries tell us that this sum will soon not be sufficient to keep the plan fully funded. Last year, the portfolio managers achieved a 6.1% gain on the $43 billion they invest, enough to keep us at 104% funding, according to the set of assumptions customarily made for projected faculty and staff retire - ment. But that level of funding has been gradually falling after reaching 174% in 1990 - a circumstance that prompted three very early retirement incentive (VERIP) offers and the termination of employee contributions to UCRS. T o deal with the decline, the advisors to UCRS are currently urging that con- tributions by faculty and staff be resumed. Understandably, both faculty and staff and the labor unions that represent some of them are balking. Negotiations are currently underway. Meanwhile, the current Defined Contribution Plan (DCP) payment will be transferred to the UCRS portfolio instead of being accounted for separately. CUCEA has forwarded its own letter to President Dynes and to the Regents urging prompt resumption of employee contributions. CUCEA believes that the opposition is short-sighted because full funding is in the best long term interest of UC employees and annuitants alike. Because the newspapers bring frequent word of under-funded pensions and corporate conversions from defined benefit plans (DBP) to defined contribution plans (DCP), questions were asked about the Regents' commitment to the cur- rent DBP form of retirement compensation. CUCEA representatives were told that no change is being considered for current annuitants, or for current fac- ulty, or even for current UC staff. What about new hires, someone asked? What President's LetterAmerican colleges into research universi - ties proceeded slowly following the Civil War. Only during the past 60 years have those universities flourished and become the core of the U.S. science and technol - ogy system and widely acknowledged as the best in the world. The record of the last 60 years suggests that U.S. universi - ties will continue to compete successfully in the world market for knowledge. But they can do so only if they understand the challenges they face and are prepared to adapt to them.

Aggravated bumps shadowing the server's arms are no concern to anyone yet called to our attention show a strain, a fearsomeness hard to conceal. The times are never right.

UCSD Emeriti AssociationPage 4 April 2007 v Chronicles we learned is that new hires at the weapons laboratories are presently offered only a DCP , not the tradi - tional DBP . Accept this news for whatever it might foreshadow in the not too distant future. With respect to health insurance plans, we were reminded that health benefits are paid from a pot entirely distinct from UCRS and have never been guaranteed. However, there is no historical precedent for withholding health benefits from annuitants. The current bill for UC health costs - in- cluding annuitants, active faculty, and all staff - is $622 million, with an an- ticipated growth to $699 by 2009. Ne- gotiations with contractors this past year resulted in a reduction of average proposed premium increments from 22% to 11% without significant limi- tation of benefits. Next year, the Re- gents will place all existing contracts out to open bid. The issue that looms on the horizon is compliance with a new law requiring that all future health cost obligations be publicly reported along with projected means of fi- nancing them. These obligations presently amount to $6 billion, to rise to $8 billion by 2009. For the first time, this debit must appear on the Regents' balance sheet, together with a plan to account for its man- agement over a 30-year time span. Fortunately, we employ expert minds losing sleep over this fiduciary issue so that we may continue to enjoy a full night's rest. - Jack C.

Penner, Distinguished Professor of Engineering Physics Emeritus Q. You have been saying for some time that the world is not running out of oil - a view recently confirmed by other experts and officials - but there is evidently a big dis - agreement about the source of the oil and gas in the earth. Please explain the difference between the \"Western model\" and the \"Rus - sian/Ukrainian\" model of how all that black gold gets created. A. There remain large amounts of fossil-fuel resources which are well cate- gorized and are of the type that has been used to fuel the world economies for more than a century. Of these resources, coals are the hardest to use cleanly and the most abundant. Petroleum, in the form of accessible oil, unconventional oil such as oil recovered from tar sands (as in Al- berta, Canada, for some years), shale oil (not in the present market on a substan - tial scale because of the ready availability of conventional oil at lower costs), etc., are known to be sufficiently abundant in total to last for about another 500 years at projected levels of population growth and with the hope that reasonable reduc - tions in per capita use will be achievable with world human populations stabi- lized around 10 billion beginning around 2050. The picture of conventional oil re- sources and reserves (i.e., the readily available component at competitive pric- es with current recovery technologies) is greatly confused as the result of the Rus- sian-Ukrainian (R-U) assertion that oil is not a fossil fuel but is instead formed by direct reactions in the earth mantle at depths that are inaccessible with current drilling technologies. Direct reactions re- quire only the presence of water and car - bon-containing rock strata at high pres- sures and temperatures as in the mantle. These ideas were popularized in the W est by Thomas Gold in his book The Hot Deep Earth (which the Russians refer to as an unprecedented example of pla- giarism). There are two important publi - cations in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) dealing with this topic. The first of these was published by J. F . Kenney et al. in August 2002 and contains a proof that the methane formed by direct reactions between wa- ter and carbon-containing rocks is con- verted to higher hydrocarbons simulating major oil components in accord with the Second Law of Thermodynamics (a pillar of 19th century science from which no deviation is known). The second paper was published in 2004 by D. R. Hersch - bach (Nobel Laureate in Chemistry) and his associates at Harvard and contains experimental studies under mantle con- ditions verifying that oil-like components are formed and that plant fossil remnants are not required to produce petroleum- like mixtures. Disagreements remain between the R-U and W estern views which have en- tered the comic circle with the R-U as- sertion that the joy of finding similar chemicals in plants and oil mixtures has as much force in settling the question as the assertion that ivory keys in pia- nos verify the descent of elephants from pianos. The discussions continue. I am unaware of major accessible oil resource discoveries resulting from direct use of the R-U model, although it is certain that hydrocarbons have been found in ar- cheozoic rocks (dating to approximately 2.3 billion years ago) which antedate the formation of plant life on earth. It is also certain that hydrocarbons are observed in extra-terrestrial bodies (e.g., meteors, outer planets, etc.) that could not pos- sibly be the results of plant debris. With the R-U model, petroleum becomes a renewable resource which will always be available on our planet. These discussions have led to spe- cial interest for deeper drilling in order to search for oil. A test in Sweden moti-vated by Gold led to ambiguous results: oil was found at a depth of about 14,000 feet but not in large enough amounts to lead to commercial viability. Those of us who regard the Second Law as the pil- lar of knowledge it surely is, are more inclined to accept the R-U model than the fossil-fuel idea supported by most of the petroleum specialists in the W est. Scientific verification of the W estern model requires experimental verification that methane will form higher hydrocar - bons under near-surface conditions (e.g., with the help of bacteria or some similar magic) without demonstrating that dur- ing the long times that plants have grown on earth, periodic upheavals turned the surface into near-mantle conditions. Q. What can we do to reduce our dependency on imported and increasingly expensive oil especially now that there is growing evidence that the burning of car - bon-based fuels is causing dangerous climate change? Is conservation the best immediate answer? If so, what would it require that we are not already doing? A. This is the type of question which was extensively examined during the Carter administration following the Arab oil embargo. Then as now, energy conservation was easily identified as the cheapest and best way to go. As an ex- ample, consider the transportation sector alone. It is responsible for about 25% of total energy use. By replacing conven - tional engines with (optimistically) a performance of 25 miles per gallon by hy- brids (my 2002 Prius still gives me about 50 miles per gallon when I drive it care- fully), we save about 13% of total energy consumption (this number is almost 50% larger than the U.S. reduction of carbon dioxide emissions required by the Kyoto protocol). Of course, there remain many other opportunities for reducing energy consumption by building more efficient systems, reducing energy losses from UCSD Emeriti AssociationPage 6 April 2007 v Chronicles homes, using roof-top solar collectors in sunny climates to produce hot water for home use as was done in Florida more than 80 years ago, etc. Of the much heralded \"new technol - ogies\" for energy conservation, limited use of wind energy makes sense in some locations. Unfortunately, photovoltaic power conversion remains excessively costly, hydroelectric power conversion is limited by resource availability as is also geothermal energy production. Wave en- ergy is competitive in only very few lo- cations as in the Bay of Fundy. It is no accident that after about 30 years of the many renewable initiatives proposed dur- ing the Carter presidency and periodical - ly supported with government grants, the current mix contains only a few percent contribution from the total collection of these soft technologies. Subsidies for non-commercial ventures have a way of evaporating and contributing little after the subsidies are gone. Biomass as a fuel source sounds interesting but large-scale use will interfere with the world food supply which will probably always have greater priority than energy production. Recent price increases for corn are an early example of the effects of crop diver - sion for energy production. It is, of course, clear that the develop - ment and implementation of Generation 4 nuclear reactors (which will require at least two decades before substantial contribu - tions to world-wide energy supplies can be achieved) will provide the beginnings of a total solution (with breeder technologies) using passively safe systems in order to elim- inate the possibility of calamities caused by human errors, proliferation-resistant tech- nologies to remove the contributions of nuclear energy use to wider applications of nuclear weapons, disposal of radioactive wastes in stable rock strata, etc. Success in building fusion reactors (still nearly 40 years in the future according to insider esti- mates) should offer the same opportunities. These nuclear solutions merit separate de- tailed discussions because successful appli- cations will not be resource limited during the likely planetary occupancy by the types of species we see now or their surviving de- scendants.Strategic Defense in the Nuclear Age . By Sanford Lakoff. With an appendix by Richard L.Garwin. W estwood, Conn.: Praeger International Security Studies (2007). Pp. 238. In 1989, when Herb York and I collaborated on A Shield in Space: T ech - nology, Politics, and the Strategic De - fense Initiative (UC Press), it seemed as though Ronald Reagan 's \"Star Wars\" program would ride off into the sunset with him. Reagan's supposition that it would make nuclear weapons \"impotent and obsolete\" was the latest example of what Herb called \"the fallacy of the last move\" - the notion that one side could gain victory in an arms race by adopting a radically new weapons system, when experience showed that a capable adver - sary would figure out how to neutralize, copy, or defeat it. But as the end of the Cold War was followed by renewed fears of nuclear pro- liferation to \"rogue states,\" the program not only survived but has reached limited implementation in the form of midcourse ground-based interceptors now being deployed in Alaska and California and possibly in Europe. Against such poten - tial adversaries as China, Pakistan, Iran, and North Korea, even Senator Sam Nunn , the Democrats' national security bellwether, agreed that a limited defense could be highly effective. In addition, SDI had acquired a significant politi - cal constituency. As one defense analyst noted, \"Every company is on notice that if they want to be a long-term player, they can't let SDI get away.\" Under these in- fluences, moderate Republicans crafted a compromise with the Democrats called the Missile Defense Act, under which 100 ground-based interceptors would be deployed at a single site, as allowed by the ABM T reaty. When Bill Clinton took office, he wanted to put the program out of its mis- ery altogether. When the Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994, he pulled the rug out from under them by cleverly offering to keep the research go- ing so that if it proved feasible, it could be implemented in short order - expecting it would simply remain a research program, at least on his watch. But when George W . Bush became president in 2000, he ordered rapid deployment on the ground that the U.S. could not rely solely on de- terrence against the \"axis of evil.\" As a result, testing was undertaken and a lim- ited, ground-based system began to be deployed on the west coast. Because of these developments, when a publisher of a series on defense policy asked me to do a reprise of the issue, I agreed. This new book reviews the earlier program, taking advantage of information and studies that appeared in the intervening years, and brings the story up to date. In it I conclude that the current plan for deployment of midcourse defenses is unreliable, for reasons best explained by Richard L. Garwin , the preeminent authority on defense tech- nology, in a Scientific American article re- printed as an appendix. I also point out that the single greatest lesson of the Cold War is not just that the threat of mutual destruction kept the peace, but also that diplomacy, buttressed by economic chal- lenges and inducements, was critical in stabilizing the superpower arms race and ultimately bringing it to an end. Strategic defenses, moreover, cannot serve to address the problems now posed by the threat of terrorism. T errorists can do significant damage, as became evident on 9/11, using only conventional weap - ons, indeed by turning nonweapons like high-jacked aircraft into lethal bombs. If they should acquire WMD, they are not likely to use them in ICBMs. Strategic de- fense must therefore be considered as one among a variety of policy options rather than as one that stands alone or can pro- vide a simple or permanent technological fix. T o the extent that a strategic defense becomes feasible, it may be necessary, but it is hardly sufficient in itself to guarantee security or maintain peace. \"Star Wars:\" The Sequel v vUCSD Emeriti AssociationPage 7 Chronicles v April 2007 Anecdotage By Sandy Lakoff \"T ake my car . . .\" The Times of Lon- don, a treasure trove of English eccentric - ity, recently reported the death in a high- way crash of a rather unusual car thief. A \"contract cleaner\" by vocation, he was no- torious for going into showrooms, posing as a potential buyer, and driving off with an expensive vehicle, which would later be found spotless at the side of the road with its keys still in the ignition. \"He would even take vehicles to the car wash or give them an extra polish before abandoning them.\" In 2004 he had been jailed for six years for making off with 36 new cars from garages across Sheffield. Altogether he amassed 155 convictions. He was once described by a judge as \"the kind of thief you would want to steal your car.\" His wife finally gave up on him after his last court hearing, say- ing, \"He looked after the cars he stole bet- ter than me.\" The House of Windsor : In the County Recorder's office to do research on her own palatial digs on Ludington Lane, Connie Mullin Branscomb struck up a conver - sation with a man at the next microfiche reader.
