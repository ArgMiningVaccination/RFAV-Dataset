Healing Spirit Herb Farm and Education Center The 30 acre farm is located in the hamlet of Wallace, near Avoca, in the beautiful Finger Lakes of western New York. The farm is a dream come true for owners Andrea and Matthias Reisen as it has woods, a wonderful year-round trout stream,and is home to heron, fishers, weasels, hawks, deer, bear, coyotes and a multitude of other creatures. The resident bees are happy to pollinate their organically certified herbs and provide us with great tasting honey and beautiful beeswax. Their goal has always been to live a simple, gentle, fun-filled life on the land, raising a family in harmony with all of creation. They have been blessed to be caretakers of this land since 1982, raising their five children there, and now two of our grandchildren live here with their parents and Uncle Bill. They believe by working the land organically and biodynamically, being in rhythm with the land, they are able to harvest the very finest quality, high energy medicinal herbs. With these herbs they make teas, tinctures (extracts), salves, creams, infused oils, liniment and flower essences. They take care of the land and the land takes care of them. The plant world offers an abundant array of gifts allowing us to take ownership of our own healing. These gifts don't just apply to our physical selves however, the healing energy of plants also affects our emotional, mental, and spiritual selves. Plants have been used for centuries to enhance spirituality and our awareness of our connection to all life. Used properly herbs can become cherished travel companions as you walk your sacred path. All of their herbs are certified organically grown and ethically wild-crafted. All herbs are hand-picked, solar dried, and hand-processed here on the farm, which makes their product of the highest quality. "}
