Tamika is one of those people for me. As I was building my dream business, I struggled with confidence since I didn't have a college degree or any fancy certifications. Tamika was able to gently guide me and highlight my strengths, so I could get over my self-doubts that we're blocking me.\" \"As a Licensed Marriage Family Therapist and colleague of Tamika's, I have witnessed firsthand her passion for helping people, especially women. Tamika provides a high-quality level of support to all she comes in contact with and she is truly an inspirational and resilient woman.\" As a woman of color, it was extremely important to me to find someone who understood my day to day life experiences.
