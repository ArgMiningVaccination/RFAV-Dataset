EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Connecting Kids to Coverage HEALTHY KIDS American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) 2020 Outreach and Enrollment Cooperative Agreements program provides funding opportunities to increase the enrollment and retention of American Indian/Alaska Native ( AI/AN ) children who are eligible for, but not enrolled in, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ). This progra m is authorized under Section 2113 of the Social Security Act, as amended by Section 3004(a) of the Helping Ensure Access for Little Ones, Toddlers and Hopeful Youth by Keeping Insurance Del ivery Stable Act (referred to as the HEALTHY KIDS Act and included in Pub. L. 115-120) and by Section 50103 of the Advancing Chronic Care, Extenders, and Social Services Act (referred to as the ACCESS Act and included in Pub. L. 115-123). This announcement focuses on increasing the participation of eligible AI/AN children in Medicaid and CHIP because this population of children has the highest uninsurance rate compared to other U.S. populations.1 HHS Awarding Agency : Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) CMS Awarding Center: Center for Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Services Notice of Funding Opportunity Title: Connecting Kids to Coverage HEALTHY KIDS AI/AN 2020 Outreach and Enrollment Cooperative Agreements Focused on Increasing the Enrollment of Ame rican Indian/Alaska Native Children in Medicaid and CHIP Authorization: Section 2113 of the Social Security Act, amended by Section 3004(a) of the Helping Ensure Access for Little Ones, Toddlers and Hopeful Youth by Keeping Insurance Delivery Stable Act (referred to as the HEALTHY KIDS Act and included in Pub.

Indian Health Service (IHS) Providers b. Tribes and Tribal organizations operating a health program under a contract or compact with the Indian Health Service under the Indian Self - Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) (P.L. 93 - 638, as amended) c.Urban Indian organizations operating a health program under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA)(P.L. 94 -437, as amended)6 II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) seeks applications for the Connecting Kids to Coverage HEALTHY KIDS AI/AN 2020 Outreach and Enrollment Cooperative Agreement s Focused on Increasing Enrollment of American Indian/Alaska Native Children (HEALTHY KIDS AI/AN 2020 Cooperative A greements) . Eligibility for this NOFO is limited to applicants who are either Indian health care providers or tribal entities as defined in the chart above. These grants will support innovative outreach strategies aimed at increasin g the enrollment and retention of eligible AI/AN children in Medicaid and CHIP, emphasiz ing activities tailored to communities where AI/AN children and families r eside , and enlisting tribal and other community leaders and tribal health and social service s programs that serve eligible AI/AN children and families. Engagement with the tribal community is important because AI/AN families are sometimes reluctant to enroll in Medicaid and CHIP because they can receive healt h care directly from their local tribal hospitals and clinics. However, when AI/ AN families enroll in Medicaid and CHIP, the entire tribal community benefits fr om increased access to care. When AI/AN children and families sign up for Medicaid and CHIP, the Indian health hospitals and clinics can bill these programs for services provided. This brings money into the health care facility which is then used to hire more staff, pay for new equipment, and renovate buildings. When AI/AN children and families enroll in Medicaid and CHIP, they are not only helping themselves, but they are supporting their Indian heal th hospital and clinics. These cooperative agreements will also support outreach strategies similar to those conducted in previous Connecting Kids to Coverage (CKC) grant cycles, such as activities design ed to help families understand application procedures and health coverage opportunities in Medicaid and CHIP. All funded projects should incorporate both initial application and renewal assistance into their proposed activities. Bas ed on past experiences of successful enrollment of AI/AN families, applications should also incorporate providing one-on- one assi stance to families seeking to enroll their children in health coverage or linking families with groups or individuals in the community w ho are trained to provide such direct application assistance . As with previous rounds of cooperative agreements, grante es will also be required to participate in key outreach initiatives coordinated by the Connecting Kids to Coverage National Campaign (th e National Campaign). The National Campaign provides outreach training and support for grantees and other partners who are working to help enroll eligible children in Medicaid and CHIP.7 1. Purpose The HEALTHY KIDS Act provides $120 million for activities aimed at reducing the number of children who are eligible for , but not enrolled in, Medicaid and CHIP, and improving r etention of enrolled children for fiscal years 2018 -2023. Of the total $ 120 million in funding, 10 percent will be set aside for outreach to American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) children in accordance with section 2113(b)(3) of the Act, 10 percent will be set aside for the National Campaign in accordance with section 2113(h) of the Act, and the remainder will be awarded for outreach and enrollment of uninsured children and their parents. On November 30, 2018, CMS issued the Connecting Kids to Coverage HEAL THY KIDS 2019 Outreach and Enrollment Cooperative Agreement NOFO, which made available $48 million in cooperative agreements to states, local governments, Indian tribes, tribal consortium, urban Indian organizations receiving funds under title V of the Ind ian Health Care Improvement Act, federal health safety net organizations, community- based organizations, faith-based organizations, and schools for fiscal years 2024 -2027. These awards were announced in June 2019 . While the HEALTHY KIDS 2019 Outreach and Enrollment Cooperative Agreement NOFO broadly targeted the enrollment and retention of all eligible children in Medic aid and CHIP, this specific NOFO is focused on the en rollment and retention of eligible AI/AN children. This specific NOFO makes available $ 6 million in grants to Indian tribes, tribal coalitions , tribal organizations operating a health program under a contract or compact with IHS under ISDEAA, urban Indian organizations, and IHS providers for use during calendar years 2020-2022. The complete list of eligible entities can be found in the Executive Summa ry of this NOFO. This HEALTHY KIDS Act funding for outreach and enrollment grants will build upon successful strategies facilitated by previous Connecting Kids to Coverage (CKC) grant funding initiatives under the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-3), the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-148) , and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthoriza tion Act (MACRA) (Pub. L. the ACA , and MACRA provided the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) with funding to award $162 million to eligible entities to support the enrollment and retention of eligible children in Med icaid and CHIP. This funding has been disbursed through four cycles of grants that were broadly targeted to eligible but unenrolled children, and three rounds of grants that were specifically targeted to AI/AN children. In addition, as announced in June 2019, the HEALTHY KIDS Act made available $48 million to 39 eligible entities to broadly target the enrollment and retention of eligible children in Medicaid and CHIP. Since 2009, CKC enrollment grants have been awarded to over 269 community-8 based organizations, states, and tribal and local governments. Community- based organization awardees have included health care providers, schools, tribal organizations, and other types of nonprofits. Community- based organizations typically have access to and cr edibility with low -income families in their communities, making them indispensable partners for carrying out specialized strategies to target the hard -to-reach children who remain uninsured. Grantees implemented a variety of outreach and enrollment strategies aimed at educating families about the availability of Medicaid and CHIP, identifying children likely to be eligible for these programs, and directly assisting fa milies with the application and renewal process. For example, grantees used mobile e nrollment strategies to provide one-on- one direct assistance to families living in rural areas, and worked closely with partners, often leveraging partners' service sites, community relationships, and other resources to reach more children and families . Beginning in 2016, applicants were encouraged to include parents in outreach and enrollment efforts because a large body of research suggests this is effective i n increasing children's enrollment and access to care. Grantees also participated in key initiati ves coordinated by the National Campaign, such as back- to-school outreach efforts. The National Campaign also continues under the HEALTHY KIDS Act to provide resources for outreach training and support for grantees and partner organizations. The National Campaign , led by CMS, provides a full range of outreach and enrollment materials including customizable posters and flyers, as well as radio and TV public service announcements, videos featuring successful outreach strategies , and outreach strateg y guides that suggest effective ways to use the materials. Most materials are available in English and Spanish, and some are available in other languages as well. The National Campaign regularly conducts training webinars on key outreach and enrollment top ics and also augments media outreach in selected target markets. All materials produced by the National Campaign, including recordings of all past webinars along with information about previous grantees, are available at https://www.InsureKidsNow.gov The CMS Division of Tribal Affairs has additional outreach and education materials specifically designed for the AI/AN population that can be found at: http://go.cms.gov/AIAN- OutreachEducationResources . 2. Authority Sectio n 2113 of the Social Security Act, amended by Section 3004(a) of the Helping Ensure Access for Little Ones, Toddlers and Hopeful Youth by Keeping Insurance Delivery Stable Act (referred to as the HEALTHY KIDS Act and included in Pub. L. 115-120) and by Section 50103 of the Advancing Chronic Care, Extenders, and Social Services Act (referred to as the ACCESS Act and included in Pub. L. 115-123).9 3. Background Since 2009, the nation has made substantial progress on reducing the number of uninsured children and enrolling eligible children in Medicaid and CHIP. T he rate of uninsured children fell from 7.0 percent in 2013 to an all -time low of 4.3 percent in 2016, and just over 3.3 million children remain ed uninsured.2 The researchers attribute these achievements to the efforts states have made to streamline eligibility , verification , enrollment and renewal rules and procedures, and also to state and community -based outreach efforts. Since January 1, 2014, states have made significant changes to their Medicaid and CHIP eligibility determination policies, procedures and systems. Progress has been made to ensure that application and enrollment processes and systems are seamless across insurance affordability programs, including Medicaid, C HIP, and Qualified Health Plans (QHP) through the Exchanges . States have also improved the renewal process for Medicaid and CHIP enrollees by using a data -driven redetermination process . States must use available data sources to determine eligibility without contacting enrollees, if possible , in accordance with 42 CFR 435.916 and 457.343. If additional information is needed to determine eligibility, the state must send a renewal form pre-populated with information available to the agency . Other crucial components involve providing families and individuals applying for health insurance with reliable information and direct application assistance. While this progress is significant, an Urban Institute analysis shows that there are still approximately 1.9 million children eligible for Medicaid and CHIP but not enrolled.3 Recent improvements have narrowed gaps in coverage, yet coverage disparities persist. For example, AI/AN children continue to experience the highest uninsured rate compared to other U.S populations, 8.0 percent in 2016, as compared to the national average of 4.3 per cent. In addition, a recent analysis of data from the American Community Survey found that for the first time in a decade the uninsurance rate for children increased in 2017. The share of children without health insurance increased from 4.7 percent in 2016 to 5 percent in 2017. This translates to approximately 276,000 more children who were uninsured in 2017 than in the previous year.4 In short, there is more work to be done to reduce health coverage disparities and reach the remaining eligible uninsured children 2 Haley, Jennifer, Genevieve Kenney, Robin Wang, Clare Pan, Victoria Lynch, and Matthew Buettgens.

Georgetown University Health Policy Institute Center for Children and Families. https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2018/11/21/nations -progress -on-childrens -health -coverage -reverses -course/ 10 Thus, the outreach and enrollment activities of CKC grantees remain fundamental to enrolling and retaining eligible children in Medicaid and CHIP, especially AI/AN children who experience among the highest rates of uninsurance. 4. Program Requirements Planning Period All awardees will be given a 90 day planning period to ensure that needed pro ject leadership is engaged and the identified employees are fully trained and availab le to work on the cooperative agreement. CMS will allow grantees to u se cooperative agreement funds to employ individuals and begin operations during this time . However, full funding for the first year of the budget period will be restrict ed until the grantee demonstrates full staffing and readiness to begin operations. CMS will work with all awardees to evaluate their readiness and to provide full or conditional approval for further funding. CMS may waive or reduce the 90 day planning period, and the restriction of first year funding if the awardee's outreach and enrollment efforts, as specifi ed in this funding opportunity, and as detailed in the grantee's ap proved application, are well established with all project leadership, staffing , and support already in place. During this planning period, CMS will hold one initial program launch meeting for all grantee s. The date and time of this meeting will be annou nced after the awards are made. Applicants should budget for the project director and another key staff member to travel to Baltimore, Maryland , to participate in person for this one day meeting. See APPENDIX C: Guidance for Preparing a Budget Request an d Narrative for additional information. Project Activities Grants awarded under the cooperative agreement will fund activities /strategies aimed at educating families about the availability of free or low -cost health coverage under Medicaid and CHIP, identifying children likely to be eligible for these programs, and assisting families , including parents, to apply for coverage. Funds will also support efforts to assist families with the annual renewal proces s. Outreach must be targeted to settings wh ere eligible AI/AN children may be easily identified and their families assisted with the application and renewal process. Applicants are encouraged to consider any of the following outreach strategies (See Appendix A for more detailed information): oPartnering with tribal programs that work with children and families; oEngaging schools and other programs serving young people in outreach, enrollment and retention activities;11 oEstablishing and developing application assistance resources to provide high quality, reliable Medicaid/CHIP enrollment and renewal services in local and tribal communities ; and oUsing parent mentors to assist families with enrolling in Medicaid and CHIP, retain ing coverage and finding resources for addressing social determinants of health. Grantees will be required to participate in National Campai gn activities and adopt strategies promoted by the National Campaign that may includ e: oIncreasing awareness about children's health coverage under Medicaid and CHIP, with respect to eligibility and how families can enroll their children and teens and keep them enrolled for as long as they qualify ; oMotivating families and providing opportunities to enroll and renew coverage for their eligible children and teens in Medicaid and CHIP ; oDesigning and promoting outreach and enrollment activities that can be adapted for tribal and community settings ; and oIncreasing awareness about opportunities for parents to be covered under Medicaid. In particular , grantees will be required to work with the National Campaign on special initiatives designed to capitalize on key outreach opportunities such as the Back -to-School season each year , when families are thinking about enrollment in health insurance coverage. Other initiatives may include, but are not limited to, National Children's Dental Health Month (February), National Child Abuse Prevention Month (April), National Child Health Day (first Monday each October), National Rural Health Day (November 15) and National Native American Heritage Month in November. The National Campaign will make outreach materials available that can be customized for local use. It will also host a robust series of training webinars to help guide grantees and others who will be conducting activities locally. During these i nitiatives, grantees will have the flexibility to tailor activities to the needs of their communities and to build on what they have been doing throughout the cooperative agreement period. All materials produced by the National Campaign, including recordings of all past webinars along with information about previous grantees, are available at https://www.InsureKidsNow.gov . The CMS Division of Tribal Affairs has Medicaid and CHIP fact sheets that can be customized for use by grantees. For more information on how these fact sheets can be customized please visit : https://www.cms.gov/Outreach -and- Education/Ame rican -Indian- Alaska -Native/AIAN/Outreach -and- Education/pdf/DTA_FactSheet_Customization_Guide_6-21_508.pdf and for additional resources including culturally appropriate outreach and education 12 materials developed for AI/ANs of all ages please visit: http://go.cms.gov/AIAN - OutreachEducationResources . All a pplicants should take these additional factors into consideration when designing proposals: o To be most effective, outreach efforts should link families to direct (one-on- one) enrollment and renewal support. o Providing assistance with online applications and providing renewal support can make enrollment and re tention more efficient , effective , and consumer- friendly. o While the emphasis of the HEALTHY KIDS AI/AN 2020 Outreach and Enrollment Cooperative Agreements remains focused on enrolling eligible AI/AN children in Medicaid and CHIP, a large body of research finds that when eligible parents get enrolled in health insurance, their children are more likely to get enrolled and receive necessary preventive care.5 Appropriate messaging and strategies that help enroll eligible parents can also facilitate the enrollment of eligible children. o Families often seek health insurance for their children at times when they are most attuned to needing health services for them, such as when they are sick or injured, need physical exams to enroll in school or summer programs, or need routine preventive care, including immunizations, vision and hearing tests, or asthma and allergy screenings. Organizations and institutions that provide such services - such as hospitals, health clinics, departments of health, and schools - are in a good position to conduct outreach and help families get their eligible children enrolled. They may also be more likely to have the infrastructure to sustain and track progress of outreach and enrollment efforts. o The HEALTHY KIDS Act amended Section 2113(f) of the Act to expand the types of organizations eligible for cooperative agreement awards to include organizations that use parent mentors. Parents who have at least one Medicaid or CHIP -enrolled child can serve as mentors to parents of uninsured children during the application and renewal process. Parent mentors educate families with uninsured children about health insurance coverage, and assis t with completing and submitting applications for health insurance coverage. They can also provide guidance on identifying medical and dental homes and community pharmacies for children, provide assistance and referrals to successfully address social deter minants of children's health, and act as a liaison between the families and the state. One study showed 5 Hudson, Julie, Asako Moriya, \"Medicaid Expansion for Ad ults Had Measureable 'Welcome Mat' Effects on Their Children,\" Health Affairs, 36 no. 9 (September 2017), https://w ww.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0347 13 that the use of parent mentors was more effective than traditional methods in insuring children, achieving faster coverage, and renewing coverage.6 Applicant organizations may wish to work with parent mentors as a strategy to increase the partic ipation of eligible, particularly hard -to-reach, children in Medicaid and CHIP (Please see Appendix B for more information). Data and Reporting Requirements Grantees will be required to collect and report to CMS data related to their goal s and accomplishments for this funding opportunity. Such data will demonstrate the outcomes that result directly from this funding opportunity, and will also be used to help evaluate the success of outreach and enrollment strategies and identify areas that need improvement or mid-course corrections. All grantees wil l be responsible for collecting and reporting particular data elements (present ed below). All required data must be reported to CMS by adhering to a detailed data dictionary and uploading the required data to a web-based portal provided by CMS . If the grantees are unable to report the data according to the specifications indicated in the data dictionary, the data limitations must be described. Grantees will be provided with reporting tools for the submission of all required data and reporting elements. Grantees may also report additional data that illustrates their progress in increasing the participation of eligi ble children in Medicaid and CHIP . The required data that all grantees must report on a monthly basis include: o Number of AI/AN children for whom an application for health coverage has been submitted as a direct result of CKC funding o Number of AI/AN children verified to be newly enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP as a direct result of CKC funding o Number of AI/AN children for whom the grantee submitted a renewal form for Medicaid or CHIP coverage o Number of AI/AN children verified to be renewed in Medicaid o r CHIP as a direct result of CKC funding o The outreach and enrollment activities completed during the month The following data must be reported on a monthly basis only if the applicant proposes to target parents with CKC funds: o Number of parents for whom an application for health coverage has been submitted as a direct result of CKC funding o Number of parents verified to be newly enrolled in Medicaid as a 6 Flores G., Lin H., Walker C, et al. Parent Mentors and Insuring Uninsur ed Children: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Pediatrics. 2016; 137(4): e 0153519; Flores G., Lin H., Walker C, et al. Parent Mentorin g Program Increases Coverage Rates for Uninsured Latino Children. Health Affairs. 2018; 37(3); 403 -412. 14 direct result of CKC funding o Number of parents for whom the grantee submitted a renewal form for Medicaid coverage o Number of parents verified to be renewed in Medicaid as a direct result of CKC funding CMS may require the reporting of additional data elements over the course of the cooperative agreement in order to fully assess grantee performance. Grantees will be required to verify which children are enrolled or renewed in coverage as a result of CKC funding. To the extent possible, the best way to verify new enrollments and successful renewals is with the state or co unty Medicaid and/or CHIP agencies and applicants are encouraged to partner with one or more of these entities . This would typically require the establishment of a detailed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or other data- sharing agreement between the grantee and the relevant state or county Medicaid/CHIP agencies th at allow grantees to submit detailed identifying information about the people they have assisted and receive verifications in response. Applicants must describe their plans to secure an MOU or ot her data -sharing agreement with the state or county Medicaid/CHIP agencies within the 90 day planning period after the cooperative agreement is awarded. Although some tribal, urban and IHS health care providers have the ability to verify patient insurance status through partnerships with states and counties for verif ying enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP , that may not be the case in all states and counties. Because CMS recognizes that it may not always be possible to obtain data from state or count y sources , CMS will provide technical assistance and work with the grantee on alternative data verification options. If the applicant anticipates they will not be able to obtain a MOU, they should identify other alternative methods for verifying new enro llments and renewals that do not depend on cooperation by state or county agencies and that can be implemented with the requested funding. Successful grantees have employed a variety of alternative methods to validate the required data. In some cases, the grantee contacted the potential enrollee to verify if the potential enrollee was indeed enrolled or renewed into Medicaid or CHIP. In other cases, grantees utilized a state -maintained insurance database to verify insurance status of those they assisted. If the grantee does not obtain an MOU, or create and implement a well -designed and effective alternative data methodology after working with CMS during the 90 day planning period, CMS may terminate the award for fail ing to have a process in place to collect and report the required data elements . Please note, all applications, enrollments, and renewals reported should be directly attributable to this cooperative agreement. For example, if a CKC grantee 15 also receives funding from another source and such funds are used to support FTEs for enrollment and retention activities, only enrollment and renewal da ta attributed to this funding should be reported on the monthly progress reporting tool. The semi -annual report progress tool will allow grantees t o submit qualitative data on additional cooperative agreement outcomes, including enrollment and renewal data attributable to FTEs funded from other sources. CMS will work with grantees during the planning period to assure all grantees ar e able to meet the data and reporting requirements. III. FEDERAL AWARD INFORMATION 1. Total Funding The total amount of federal funds available is anticipated to be $6,000,000. 2. Award Amount The amount of each cooperative agreement award made to eligible applicants may range from $250,000 up to $750,000 for the three year period of performance , with the award amount commensurate with enrollment and renewal targets . 3. Anticipated Award Dates The anticipated award date may vary depending on agency circumstances but i s projected to be up to four months after the application deadline to allow for adequate application review and grantee selection. 4. Anticipated Period of Performance There will be a three year project period of performance for each Cooperative Agreement awarded. There will be three one-year budget periods for the period of performance from January 2, 2020 to December 31, 2022. 5. Number of Awards CMS has no way to know the actual number of applicants and quality of award submission at this time. However , based on previous grant experience we anticipate awarding approximately 8-10 cooperative agreements . 6. Type of Award These awards will be structured as Cooperative Agreements. Under t he Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq., and implementing regulations at 45 C.F.R. part 75, a cooperative agreement is an 16 alternative assistance instrument to be used in lieu of a grant whenever substantial federal involvement with the recipient during performance is anticipated. The difference between grants and cooperative agreements is the degree of Federal programmatic involvement rather than t he type of administrative requirements imposed. Therefore, statutes, regulations, policies, and the information containe d in the HHS Grants Policy Statement that are applicable to grants also apply to cooperative agreements, unless the award itself provides otherwise ( see also VII. 4. Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions). 7. Type of Competition There will be a competitive Funding Opportunity open to all eligible applicants identified below in section IV. 1. Eligible Applicants. IV. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION 1. Eligible Applicants This Funding Opportunity is open to the following individual eligible entities, or coalitions headed by eligible entities: a. Indian Health Service (IHS) Providers; b.

B. Administrative Requirements All equipment, staff, and other budgeted resources and expenses must be used exclusively for the projects identified in the Applicant's original cooperative agreement application or agreed upon subsequently with HHS, and may not be used for any prohibited uses. Consumers and other stakeholders must have meaningful input into the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the project. This award is subject to 45 CFR Part 75, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for HHS awards [available at http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi- bin/text -idx?node=pt45.1.75 ], which implements 2 CFR Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (\"Uniform Guidance\") effective December 26, 2014. See below for more information. C. Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements 35 Applicant and recipients should take particular note of the following information found in 45 CFR Part 75: Uniform Administrative Requirements In accordance with 45 CFR \u00a775.112, all award recipients receiving federal funding from CMS must establish and comply with the conflict of interest policy requirements outlined by CMS (available for Applicant upon request). In accordance with 45 CFR \u00a775.113, Mandatory Disclosures, the non- Federal entity or applicant for a Federal award must disclose, in a timely manner, in writing to the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity all violations of Federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the Federal award. Non -Federal entities that have received a Federal award including the term and condition outlined in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 are required to report certain civil, criminal, or administrative procee dings to SAM. Failure to make the required disclosures can result in the imposition of any of the remedies described in \u00a775.371, including suspension or debarment. (See also 2 CFR Parts 180 and 376, and 31 U.S.C. 3321). For specific information on reportin g such disclosures to CMS and HHS please see the Terms and Conditions below. D. Cost Principles CMS grant awards provide for reimbursement of actual, allowable costs incurred and are subject to the Federal cost principles. The cost principles establish standards for the allowability of costs, provide detailed guidance on the cost accounting treatment of costs as direct or indirect, and set forth allowability and allocability principles for selected items of cost. Applicability of a particular set of cost principles depends on the type of organization. Award recipients must comply with the cost principles set forth in HHS regulations at 45 CFR Part 75, Subpart E with the following exceptions: (1) hospitals must follow Appendix IX to part 75 and commercial (for-profit) organizations are subject to the cost principles located at 48 CFR subpart 31.2. As provided in the cost principles in 48 CFR subpart 31.2, allowable travel costs may not exceed those established by the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR). There is no universal rule for classifying certain costs as either direct or in direct (also known as Fac ilities & Administration (F&A) costs) under every accounting system. A cost may be direct with respect to some specific service or function, but indirect with respect to the Federal award or other final cost objective. Therefore, it is essential that each item of cost incurred for the same purpose is treated consistently in like circumstances either as a direct or F &A cost in order to avoid double- charging of Federal awards. Guidelines for determining direct and F&A costs charged to Federal awards are provi ded in 45 CFR \u00a7\u00a775.412 to 75.419. Requirements for development and submission of 36 indirect (F&A) cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans are contained in Appendices III -VII, and Appendix IX to Part 75. Indirect Costs HHS will reimburse indirect cost s to recipients under an award if (1) allowable under the governing statute, regulations, or HHS grants policy; (2) the recipient requests indirect costs; and (3) the recipient has a federally approved indirect cost rate agreement covering the grant suppor ted activities and period of performance or the non- federal entity has never received an indirect cost rate and elects to charge a de minimis rate of 10% of Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC). If the applicant entity has a current negotiated indirect cost rate agreement (NICRA) and is requesting indirect costs, a copy of the current NICRA must be submitted with the application. Any non- Federal entity that has never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, except for those non- Federal entities described i n Appendix VII(D)(1)(b) to 45 CFR part 75, may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10% of MTDC which may be used indefinitely. Commercial (For -Profit) Organizations: Indirect Costs are allowable under awards to for -profit organizations. The for-profit recipient must have a federally -approved indirect cost rate agreement covering the grant supported activities and period of perform ance. Indirect cost rates for for- profit entities are negotiated by DFAS in the Office of Acquisition Management and Policy, National Institutes of Health (if the preponderance of their federal awards are from HHS), available at http://oamp.od.nih.gov/dfas/indirect- cost-branch , or other Federal agency with cognizance for indirect cost rate negotiation. If there is no federally -approved ind irect cost rate for the specific period of performance and the for -profit recipient has never received an indirect cost rate, then the non- federal entity may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10% of MTDC. Cost Allocation In accordance with 45 CFR \u00a77 5.416 and Appendix V to Part 75 - State/Local Government- wide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans, each state/local government will submit a plan to the HHS Cost Allocation Services for each year in which it claims central service costs under Federal awa rds. Guidelines and illustrations of central service cost allocation plans are provided in a brochure published by the HHS entitled \"A Guide for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments: Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government.\" A copy of this brochure may be obtained from the HHS Cost Allocation Services at https://rates.psc.gov . A current, approved cost allocation plan must be provided to CMS if central service costs are claimed. 37 Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans Appendix VI to Part 75 - Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans, provides that state public assistance agencies will develop, document and implement, and the Federal Government will review, negotiate, and approve, public assistance cost allocation plans in accordance with Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95. The plan will include all programs administered by the state public assistance agency. Where a letter of approval or disapproval is transmitted to a state public assistance agency in accordance with Subpart E, the letter will apply to all Federal agencies and programs. This Appendix (except for the requirement for certificati on) summarizes the provisions of Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95. E. Audit Requirements The audit requirements in 45 CFR Part 75, Subpart F apply to each award recipient fiscal year that begins on or after December 26, 2014. A non- Federal entity that expen ds $750,000 or more during the non- Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards must have a single or program -specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of Subpart F, Audit Requirements. Commercial Organizations (including for-profit hospitals) have two options regarding audits, as outlined in 45 CFR \u00a775.501 (see also 45 CFR \u00a775.216). 3.

APPENDICES APPENDIX A: Inreach and Outreach Activities to Consider The IHS, Tribes and Urban Indian organizations might want to consider the following inreach and outreach strategies that based on your local tribal communities will help identif y and enroll uninsured AI/AN children and families. 1. Data -Driven Inreach Strategies: Leveraging internal data. Several successful grantees have relied on clinic appointment schedules, electronic health records and/ or health insurance and eligibility data received from external sources. Reviewing the da ily appointment schedule for uninsured patients and then targeting outreach and enrollment support to assist those patien ts has proved to be a particularly effective strategy. The targeted support can also provide additional opportunities to educate beneficiaries on how and where to access needed services for their families. 2. Building and Maintaining Partnerships : Engaging tribal programs that target children and families for outreach, enrollment and retention activities . Leveraging existing tribal programs and activities that provide social services or provide other assist ance to AI/AN children and families may benefit tribal grantees in achiev ing their goals . For instance, previous successful grantees have found greater success when assigning grantee staff to partner sites, rather than relying on partners for referrals of uninsured children or parents. Tribal applicants should explore whether any of the following programs serve their target population and could adopt an outreach strategy involving collaboration and partnership with these programs to help identify and enroll AI/AN children and families in Medic aid and CHIP: o Tribal T emporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program s https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/programs/tribal o Tribal programs focused on early child development (including Head Start ) and Tribal operated child support programs https://www.acf.hhs.gov/css/child-support- professionals/tribal -agencies o Tribal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Programs (LIHEAP) https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/programs/tribal- services The Administration for Children and F amilies (ACF) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provides funding for many of the pr ograms mentioned above in addition to other programs . The ACF, Adm inistration for Native Americans https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ana , may also have ongoing community- based project funding opportunities that may offer additional partnership opportunities. 45 3. Application Assistance: Esta blishing and developing application assistance resources to provide high quality, reliable Medicaid/CHIP enrollment and renewal serv ices in local communities. Substantial efforts to simplify Medicaid and CHIP eligibility rules and enrollment procedures have helped to boost the enrollment of eligible children and adults in Medicaid and CHIP. The broad use of online applications and verification systems that prec lude the need for applicants and beneficiaries to submit paper documentation are expected to remove even more barriers. Yet, even though the application process has been greatly simplified, many families still need help navigating the process and there still is a need for direct application assistance, either i n-person or through other channels, especially for individuals who face language and literacy challenges or who need help that is accessible to people with disabilities. Ensu ring that consumers have help from trusted sources will increase their confidence and mak e it more likely that they will apply for coverage easily and successfully. Connect ing Kids to Coverage funding can be used to create application assistance resources or net works of application assistance centers within community -based organizations, community action agencies, local health departments, community health centers, schools, or other appropriate venues. Grants can be used to build upon existing networks and enhance the knowledge, exp ertise and reach of application assistors. Application assistance centers may also provide ombudsman services to help consumers troubleshoot problems as they arise and help them understand and respond, if necessary, to eligibility decisions. Grantees must ensure that organizations and individuals providing application assistance under the cooperative agreement comply with any state or federal rules related to training, reporting and monitoring, and that they obtain any appropriate certification. Indian health care providers that have direct access to a state's Medicaid eligibility portal or have an eligibility or outreach worker onsite may be able to provide immediate enrollment assistance facilitating the application process and increasing applicant understanding and adoption of online tools. Outreach workers with portal access can help prospective, current, or renewing beneficiaries more easily navi gate the application and renewal process. Outreach workers can also help connect individuals to other needed support services they may be eligible for, in addition to Medicaid or CHIP, which can help forge trusting relationships between beneficiaries a nd organizations. For those IHS and Tribal programs located in states with real- time eligibility, another effective outreach strategy in remote Tribal communities may be for enrollment assisters and navigators to use mobile hotspots to assist families with applying for or renewing coverage in real time. 4. School-Based Outreach: Engaging schools in outreach, enrollment and retention activities. Schools are widely accepted as an important setting for conducting children' s health coverage outreach and enrollment activities. Proposals may include effor ts to develop and enhance systems to facilitate the identification of potentially eligible children (for example, through free and reduced-price school meals programs, data on emergency contact cards, or school registration cards) and offer families enrollment assistance. Proposals also may include efforts to engage principals, school athletic 46 directors and coaches, school nurses, school- based health clinics, and school social workers and counselors in outreach and enrollment activities. Efforts may also reach out to assist eligible parents in obtaining health coverage, given that research shows that covering parents helps to enroll eligible children and makes it more likely that they will get needed preventive care. See Appendix B for information on Parent Mentors 47 APPENDIX B: Using Parents of Medicaid or CHIP -enrolled Children as Mentors to P arents of Uninsured Children The HEALTHY KIDS Act amended Section 2113(f) of the Act to expand the types of organizations eligible for cooperative agreement awards to include organizations that use parent mentors. A parent mentor is an individual who is a parent or guardian of at least one chil d who is enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP and is trained to: Educat e families with uninsured children about health insurance coverage; Assist with completi ng and submitting applications for health insurance coverage; Provide guidance on identifying medical and dental homes and community pharmacies for children ; Provide assistance and referrals to successfully address social determinants of chil dren's healt h; and Act as a liaison between the families and the state. The HEALTHY KIDS Act also amended Section 1902(e) of the Act to clarify that parent mentor compensation is not considered countable income and must be excluded from a Medicaid or CHI P MAGI -based eligibility determination. Additional guidance on this area is forthcoming from CMS. Parent mentors have been shown to be an effective strategy for enrolling and reta ining children in Medicaid and CHIP. A randomized control trial evaluating the use of parent ment ors found that parent mentors were more effective than traditional methods in insuring chil dren, achieving faster coverage, and coverage renewal .9 In addition, children whose parents had parent me ntors were less likely to have no primary care provider, problems getting specialt y care, and unmet preventative or dental care needs. As noted in Section VI Application Review Criteria 1.a.iv., applicants are encourage d to include evidenced -based outreach and enrollment strategies in their applications. Given the resea rch supporting the use of parent mentors as a means of enrolling and retaining children i n Medicaid or CHIP, entities already using parent mentors and entities interested in developing a n ew parent mentor program are encouraged to apply. Please note, however, organizations that us e parent mentors that apply for this cooperative agreement must use an evidence-based approach that includes these key elements: In-depth training on obtaining and retaining Medicaid and CHIP and how to assist parents with enrolling their children in medical homes; On-going coaching and support by a program coordinator and staff; On-going performance monitoring and oversight of parent mentors; and 9 Flores G., Lin H., Walker C, et al.
