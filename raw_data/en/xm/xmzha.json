It is defined in different ways and may not necessarily constitute a single disease entity. The pathogenesis of AD is multifactorial , and barrier abnormalities of the skin and immunological factors play important roles. Atopic dermatitis is diagnosed on the bas is of clinical criteria (primarily those proposed by Hanifin and Rajka ). Various scores are commonly used for determining its severity, including SCORAD and EASI. Most cases involve mild forms that can be well controlled with simple measures and topical treatment. However , severe, recalcitrant forms also exist which can require costly and, in some cases, potentially burdensome systemic treatments. For these reasons, the relevant guidelines recommend staged treatments. Systemic treatments currently authorised in Switzerland are IL- 4/IL-13 receptor inhibitors, JAK inhibitors and Cyclosporine. SwissPAR 8 / 19 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 4 Quality Aspects Swissmedic has not assessed the primary data relating to quality aspects of this application and is adopting the results of the assessment of the foreign reference authority (see section 2.1 Applicant's Request / Work -sharing procedure). 5 Nonclinical Aspects 5.1 Pharmacology Abrocitinib is a selective inhibitor of kinase (JAK) 1. It showed biochemical selectivity other metabolites M1 and M2 were more potent against JAK1 (IC 50 of 43.4 nM and 17.9 or TYK2 (IC 50 of 3,190 nM and 1, 210 nM), and had little potency for JAK3 (IC 50 >10,000 nM for both metabolites). cellular abrocitinib was less potent against JAK1 -independent signalling pathways when compared to JAK1- dependent signalling pathways in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD34+ progenitor cells, as well as in whole blood. The compound showed activity against interleukin (IL) -4, IL- 13, IL- 22 and IL -31-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer s and activator s of transcription (STAT s) in whole blood, primary keratinocytes, primary intestinal epithelial cells, HT-29 cells and THP - 1 cells. M1 and M2 were more potent against cytokines that transduce their signals via IFN, IFN , IL-6, IL-10, IL- 15, IL -21 and IL- 27, than against cytokines that transduce their signals via JAK1- independent pathways, such as IL- 12, IL- 23 and EPO. Abrocitinib inhibited trombopoietin (TPO) TAT3 in megakaryocyte precursor cells and showed weak or little activity on the clearance of TPO by human platelets. These data correlate with the decrease in platelets observed in toxicity studies in rats. The anti -inflammatory effects of abrocitinib wer e investigated in a rat arthritis model after daily oral administration of up to 50 mg/kg for 7 days. Dose-dependent inhibition of paw swelling was observed, as well as inhibition of cytokine ( IL-6, IL- 21 and IFN) -dependent STAT phosphorylation in ex vivo stimulated whole blood. Studies on secondary pharmacodynamics showed that abrocitinib was an inhibitor of MAO -A, with an IC50 value 6.1- fold the unbound human C max, but not an inhibitor of MAO -B. Considering the low distribution of abrocitinib to the brai n, the safety factor of 6, as well as the reversibility of the inhibition, the risk of a potential inhibition of MAO -A by abrocitinib at clinically relevant levels is low. The applicant conducted safety pharmacology studies to investigate potential effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system (CNS). The IC 50 value for inhibition of the hERG channel was 94.7 M. Considering the levels of unbound drug at the clinical dose (1.3 \u00b5M), it is unlikely that abrocitinib affects heart repolarisation. In conscious telemetered monkeys administered abrocitinib at single oral doses of up to 150 mg/kg, increases in heart rate , decreases in respiratory rate consistent with heart rate changes and secondary decreases in PR -interv al and QT -interval were observed at 15 mg/kg. Diastolic blood pressure was increased at 150 mg/kg. The C max value at 15 mg/kg corresponded to 0.9 -fold the unbound human C max at the therapeutic dose. There was no indication of QT -prolongation. No prolongat ion in cardiac repolari sation was observed in a thorough QT/QTc clinical study. Regarding the CNS system, significant decreases in locomotor activity were observed at 75 mg/kg at a C max value 10- fold the unbound human C max. Headache and dizziness were observed clinically. Single oral doses of up to 600 mg/kg in rats did not exert any effects on respiratory function.

The PK profiles of the metabolites M1, M2 and M4 were studied in rats after repeated oral administration. Abrocitinib was rapidly absorbed in rats and monkeys following a single 3 mg/kg oral administration with T max reached at 0.5 hours . In humans, T max varied from 0.5 to 1 hour. The oral bioavailability differed consistently between rats (95.6%), monkeys (9.8%) and humans (60%). Volume of distribution was similar in rats, monkeys and humans , which suggests extensive distribution to the organs and tissues. T 1/2 in rats and monkeys (0.8 and 0.5 hours) was shorter than in humans (2 to 5 hours). Blood clearance was also higher in rats and monkeys ( 26.6 mL/min/kg and 30.8 mL/min/kg ) compared to humans ( 12.1 mL/min/kg ). In mouse, rat, rabbit and monkey repeat -dose toxicity studies, abrocitinib exposure (Cmax and AUC 24) increased with increasing dose. In mice, rats and monkeys, there were no sex -related differences or accumul ation. In a tissue distribution study with oral administration of 10 mg/kg 14C-abrocitinib to pigmented rats, extensive distribution of drug -derived radioactivity was observed in most tissues. The l iver, uveal tract, kidneys, adrenal glands and salivary glands had the highest concentrations of radioactivity. The drug- derived radioactivity present in the uveal tract shows an affinity for melanin; this association was slowly reversible. Abrocitinib showed limited distribution to the CNS . Abrocitinib plasma protein binding was similar in rats, monkeys and humans (62%, 63% and 64%, respectively), but higher in rabbits (81%) and lower in mice (45%) . The blood to plasma ratios for abrocitinib in mice, rats , monkeys and humans were approximately 1, showing no preference for any compartment. In rabbits, there was a preference for the plasma compartment (ratio 0.59). Regarding the metabolites M1, M2 and M4, there was no preference for any compartment. The me tabolism of abrocitinib was examined in vitro in rat, monkey and human liver microsomes . The primary metabolic pathways were oxidative. In vitro human CYP phenotyping studies showed that CYP2C19 is the primary clearance route , followed by contributions from CYP 2C9, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. The excretion of abrocitinib was investigated in bile and urine after single i.v. administration in rats, and in urine after repeated oral administration in rasH2- Tg mice. In rats, approximat ely 7% and 0.1% of the drug was e liminated unchanged in urine and bile, respectively . In mice, M4 was the major metabolite detected in urine . In humans, following oral administration of 200 mg of 14C-abrocitinib, approximately 85% radioactivity was recovered in urine and 10% in faeces. M1, M2 and M4 w ere predominant in pooled urine. All metabolites in faeces were less than 2% each. The passage into milk was investigated in lact ating rats after single oral administration of abrocitinib at 10 mg/kg . Concentrations of abrocitinib in milk were higher compared to plasma and mea surable for up to 24 hours, while plasma concentrations were measurable for up to 8 hours . The recommendation for breastfeeding in the information for healthcare professionals is adequate. 5.3 Toxicology The toxicological evaluation of abrocitinib was conducted in rats , rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. The oral route of administration as well as the duration of the studies in rodents and non -rodents support the clinical use. The toxicity profile of abrocitinib was evaluated in toxicity studies with daily dosing for up to 6 months in rats (30, 45 or 70 mg/kg/day ) and 9 months in monkeys (15, 35 or 75 mg/kg/day). Toxicological findings occurred in rats and monkeys . The main target organs for toxicity were the haematopoietic and immune systems, bones and kidney s. The findings in the hematopoietic and immune system were caused by the mode of action of abrocitinib and occurred in rats and monkeys at 1- and 10-fold respectively of the unbound AUC 24 at the maximum re commended human dose (MRHD). SwissPAR 10 / 19 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Significant immune suppression observed across the species was characteri sed by lymphocytopenia associated with the decrease in T -cells, T-cell subsets (helper and cytotoxic), plasma cell s, B cells, and NK cells. Decreased lymphoid cellularity was observed in the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, bone marrow and gut-associated lymphoid tissue . Polyoma virus infections in the prostate in rats and cytomegalovirus in fections in various organs in monkeys were possibly related to this immunosuppression. Lymphocytopenia as well as increased incidence of Infections were observed in clinical studies. In a dedicated in vitro immunotoxicity study , abrocitinib had no unanticipated effects on parameters of human cellular imm une funct ion or human cell -mediated host resistance . Decreases in red blood cells and haemoglobin and decreases in platelets were observed in rats. Abro citinib -related bone dystrophy was observed only in repeat -dose studies in rats with a short duration 1 month at doses 75 mg/kg/day (mild) and 200 mg/kg/day (moderate), associated with exposures >24- fold the unbound human AUC 24. The administration of abrocitinib is not expected to pose a risk of effects on bone in adults at clinically relevant therapeutic doses based on the absence of effects on bone findings in the 6- month toxicity study in rats and in any of the cynomolgus monkey toxicity studies up to 9 months at exposures 26- fold the unbound human AUC 24 at the MRHD. Male and female rats showed c rystalluria (calcium oxalate) at exposures 18- fold the clinical exposure. However, there was no histological correlate in the bladder. The obstructive crystal nephropathy in mice is a rodent -specific phenomenon related to highly concentrated urine and is not predicted to be a relevant human risk . Safety margins are in general low. The toxicity concerns are adequately monitored clinically and adequate measures defined. A fertility and early embryonic development study was conducted in male and female rats with oral administration of abrocitinib at doses up to 70 mg/kg/day. Effects on female fertility (lower fertility index, corpora lutea, im plantation sites) and increased post-implantation l oss were observed in rats at 70 mg/kg/d ay and 30 mg/kg/day , respectively , with exposures 29 - and 11- fold the unbound hu man AUC 24. These effects were fully reversible following a 1 -month recovery period. Abrocitinib did not cause malformations in either rats or rabbits. In the embryo- foetal developm ent study in rats, the average number of late resorptions p er litter was increased at 60 mg/kg/day at exposures 17-fold the unbound human AUC 24 at the MRHD. Skeletal variations (short 13th ribs and cervical arches with reduced ventral processes, thickened ribs and unossified metatarsals ) occurred at 60 mg/kg/day. No adverse events were observed in rabbits. The product is contraindicated during pregnancy , and contraception is recommended for women of child- bearing potential. In a pre -/post-natal development study in rats administered abrocitinib orally at 10, 30 or 60 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20, d ystocia was observed at 30 mg/kg/day , and t otal litt er loss occurred at 60 mg/kg/day. These findings were observed at exposures >10-fold the unbound human AUC 24 at the MRHD. In the juvenile toxicity study in rats with abrocitinib administered orally for 53 days (from d ay 10 of age) at doses of 5, 25 or 75 mg/kg/day , bent bones, malrotated paws and/or small/soft/misshapen femoral head were observed with histopathological abnormal morphology of the femoral head at all doses . These macroscopic and microscopic findings were not reversible. The exposure at 5 mg/kg/day corresponds to about 0.9 -fold exposure at a clinical dose of 200 mg in adolescent patients . The findings indicate that abrocitinib could cause malformations in bone and lower bone length and width from toddler age up to adolescent populations. The key safety findings in bones obser ved in the juvenile study are included in the RMP together with the relevance to human usage in the adolescent population, as well as in the information for healthcare professionals. Abrocitinib was not genotoxic in an Ames assay at concentrations up to 5 ,000 \u00b5g/plate . In the in vitro micronucleus assay in TK6 cells, a statistically significant increase in the percent age of cells with micronuclei was observed at concentrations of 37.4 and 43.6 g/mL without metabolic activation. Based on additional investi gations, micronucleus formation was due to an aneugenic mechanism. No increases in micronuclei were observed in an in vivo micronucleus assay in rats after oral administration Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 of up to 600 mg/kg at exposures 114- fold the unbound human AUC 24. The genotoxic risk is therefore considered low. In carcinogenicity studies in rasH2 -Tg mice at 10, 20 or 60 mg/k g/day (males) and 10, 25 or 75 mg/kg/day (females) for up to 26 weeks , there were no abrocitinib- related neoplastic findings at exposures within clinical exposure. In rats administered 3, 10 or 30 mg /kg/day for up to 104 weeks , females at 10 mg/kg/day had a higher but not statistically significant incidence of large thymus , which correlated microscopically with benign thymomas . the absence of genotoxicity, pre- neoplastic or neoplastic findings in the repeated toxicity studies in rats, absence of dose dependency in the incidence of benign thymomas and the presence of this finding with other JAK inhibitors, thymomas would not be cons idered a significant risk to humans, although there is no safety margin. Other types of malignancies than thymomas were observed in clinical studies with abrocitinib. Abrocitinib was not phototoxic in vivo in Long Evans rats. Based on the ERA, abrocitinib does not represent a risk for the environment at the prescribed dose. 5.4 Nonclinical Conclusions In conclusion, the pharmaco- toxicological profile of abrocitinib is considered to be sufficiently well characterised. The submitted nonclinical data support the approval of Cibinqo in the proposed indication. The relevant information has been included in the information for healthcare professionals .

The final drug product w ill be commerciali sed as 50 mg and 100 mg strength immediate release film -coated tablets. Bioequivalence of single 200 mg doses of the Phase 3 tablet formulation and commercial tablet formulation was demonstrated under fasting conditions. AUC inf and C max of abrocitinib were increased by 26% and 29%, respectively, and T max was prolonged by 1 h when co- administered with a high -fat, high -calorie breakfast. The proposed dosing recommendation to take the tablet irrespective of food consumption is acceptable and was applied in the Phase 3 studies. ADME Absorption The pharmac okinetic profiles of abrocitinib and its major metabolites M1, M2 and M4 in healthy subjects following single (3 mg to 800 mg) and multiple doses (30 mg and 400 mg) were evaluated in 15 Phase 1 studies. Sparse pharmacokinetic samples were collected in the Phase 2 and 3 studies and contributed exclusively to the population PK analyses. After a single dose of 100 mg abrocitinib in healthy subjects, the peak plasma concentrations of 519.8 ng/mL were reached after 1 h. Mean abrocitinib AUC inf was 1 ,549.0 ng*h/m L. Absolute bioavailability (F) was estimated at 60% based on the PO/IV ratio of dose- normali sed plasma AUC. Taking into account the total 14C urinary excretion following PO and IV administration of 14C-abrocitinib, the fraction absorbed (F a) of abrocitini b was estimated at 91%. This difference between F and F a may indicate a considerable first -pass effect, which is consistent with the liver extraction ratio and the role of CYP metabolism. Whereas the intra- individual variability was low for AUC of abrocitinib, intra -subject variability for C max was estimated at 32%. Following multiple QD doses of abrocitinib in healthy subjects, steady -state plasma concentrations of abrocitinib were reached after approximately 3 to 4 days. In the context of a population PK analysis, it was shown that C max and AUC were increased by 27% and 31%, respectively, in AD patients compared to healthy subjects, which was not considered clinically relevant. Based on the population analysis, the steady -state accumulation ratio of abrocitinib for the QD dosing regimen of 200 mg in AD patients was estimated at 1.3. Dose proportionality of abrocitinib can be considered demonstrated for QD doses between 30 mg and 400 mg. Distribution Based on in vitro findings, the fractions unbound ( fu) in plasma for abrocitinib, M1, M2 and M4 were 0.36, 0.63, 0.71 and 0.83, respectively. Blood/plasma ratios of 1.07, 1.13, 1.27 and 0.87, respectively, for abrocitinib, M1, M2 and M4 suggest approximately equal distribution between red blood cells and plasma. The volume of distribution at steady state was calculated to be 100.2 L after IV dosing. Metabolism and Elimination In vitro human CYP phenotyping studies showed that abrocitinib CYP3A4 aeces , accounting for 85.0% and 9.5% of the total radioactivity , respectively . The predominant circulating entity was abrocitinib (25.8%) followed by M4 (13.8%), M2 (12.4%) and M1 (11%). All other metabolites accounted for <10% of the total radioactivity in plasma. The major metabolites in urine were M1, M2, M4 and M6, accounting for 16.2%, 13.5%, 15.4% and 12.0% of the administered radioactive dose, respectively, whereas only small amounts of the parent drug were present in urine (0.6%). The metabolites have been shown to be OAT3 substrates , indicating active renal secretion. Major metabolites in f aeces were M1 and 7 3012 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 accounting for 1.7% and 1.5% , respectively, of the administered radioactive dose. The low amounts of parent drug in urine and f aeces suggest that abrocitinib is primarily eliminated by metabolism. Since the parent drug as well as the metabolites M1 and M2 were shown to be pharmacologically active, the active moiety was defined as the unbound sum of the exposures of abrocitinib, M1 and M2 adjusted for their relative potencies based on the in vitro IC50,u for IFN -. Based on the population PK analysis, the initial clearance of abrocitinib was estimated at 22 L/h. The mean terminal half -lives of abrocitinib, M1, M2 and M4 were 5.9 h, 4.2 h, 3.9 h and 5.0 h, respectively, following a single dose of 200 mg abrocitinib and 6.0 h, 6.3 h, 4.6 h and 5.8 h, respectively, at steady state after multiple QD doses of 200 mg abrocitinib. Special Populations / Intrinsic Factors The impact of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of abrocitinib and its major metabolites following a single dose of 200 mg abrocitinib was investigated in a dedicated study in subjects with normal hepatic function and mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Increasing hepatic impairment was associated with increased abrocitinib exposures in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment : AUC inf +33% and +54%, respectively; C max, -6% and Based on small changes in Cmax,u and AUC inf,u of the active moiety (<15%), no dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No patients with severe hepatic impairment were included. The impact of kidney function on the pharmacokinetics of abrocitinib and its major metabolites following a single dose of 200 mg abrocitinib was investigated in a dedicated study in subjects with normal renal function and moderate to severe renal impairment. Increasing renal impairment was associated with increased abrocitinib exposures in subjects with moderate and severe impact on C max,u of the active moiety was less pronounced, AUC inf,u was increased by 110% and 191% ,respectively, in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. In consideration of these findings, a dose reduction by half is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment, whereas administration of abrotcitinib is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment. Based on extrapolation using linear regression and in view of 100 mg being approved as the maxim um dose, no dose adjustment for patients with mild renal impairment is recommended. No patients with ESRD were included. Using data from seven Phase 1, two Phase 2 and two Phase 3 studies, a population PK analysis was conducted to identify factors that account for variability of the abrocitinib PK. The PK of abrocitinib was well described by a 2- compartment model with parallel zero- and first -order absorption, time- dependent absolute bioavailability (F) and time - and dose -dependent clearance (CL). The final model included the following covariates: co -administration of rifampin, fluconazole and fluvoxamine on CL; and co-administrati on of a high-fat meal on absorption; and formulation, co- administration of rifampin, fluconazole and fluvoxamine, 800 mg dose, repeated dosing, race, disease status, mild and moderate hepatic impairment and gender (female participants) on F. Furthermore, an updated population PK analysis for both the parent drug and metabolites to simulate the PK of the active moiety at steady state was conducted. Although there are limitations, no dose adjustments are recommended based on gender, age, body weight and race. No relevant differences in abrocitinib exposure were observed between different CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 phenotypes. Interactions The in vitro DDI risk assessment was conducted for the relevant enzymes and transporters at adequate concentrations of abrocitinib and its metabolites M1, M2 and M4. Abrocitinib did not reversibly inhibit any of the investigated CYPs; however, abrocitinib was shown to be a time -dependent inhibitor of CYP2C19 (IC 50 = 42 M), CYP2D6 (IC 50 = 92 M) and CYP3A4/5 (IC 50 = 40 M - 81 M) in the presence of NADPH. Abrocitinib was shown to induce CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. M1, M2 and M4 did not reversibly inhibit any of the investigated CYPs; however, they were shown to be weak time -dependent inhibitors of CYP3A, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 above concentrations of 16.9 M, 9.49 M and 30 M, respectively. M1 and M2 were shown to induce CYP2B6 and CYP1A2, whereas M4 only induced 3012 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Abrocitinib, M1, M2 and M4 did not show any reversible inhibition of the major UGT isoforms. Furthermore, abrocitinib did not inhibit SULT1E1, SULT1A1 or SULT2A1. Abrocitinib was shown to be a substrate of P -gp and BCRP but not of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Renal transporters were not investigated, which is acceptable as very little parent drug is excreted in urine. Abrocitinib inhibited P -gp (IC 50 = 100.3 \u00b5M), BCRP (IC 50 = 9.8 \u00b5M), OAT3 (IC 50 = 26 \u00b5M), OCT1 (IC 50 44.2 \u00b5M), MATE1 (IC 50 =5.5 \u00b5M) and MATE1K (IC 50 = 10.7 \u00b5M). M1, M2 and M4 were shown to be substrates of OAT3 but not of OAT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K. M1, and M4 50 = 44.9 \u00b5M - 79 50 = \u00b5M - 61.3 \u00b5M). Based on these in vitro findings, eight clinical DDI studies were conducted to investigate abrocitinib as a potential perpetrator and victim drug. Co -administration with fluvoxamine, a strong CYP2C19 and moderate CYP3A fluconazole, strong a 1.75- and 3.83 -fold increase exposures, respectively. Based on 1.91- and 2.55 -fold increase s in the AUC inf of the active moiety, a dose reduction by half is recommended in patients receiving dual strong inhibitors of CYP2C19 and moderate inhibitors of CYP2C9, or strong inhibitors of CYP2C19 alone. Co- administration with rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A and CYP2C19 inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, led to a decrease of abrocitinib and active moiety exposures by 88% and 56%, respectively. Since this decrease may be associated with reduced efficacy, co- administration of CYP inducers is not recommended. When co -administered with probenecid, o inf increased 1.28- and 1.66- fold, respectively. No dose adjustments are required. Co-administration with abrocitinib did not have an impact on the exposures of oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and levonorgest rel), midazolam (substrate BCRP OAT3) and metformin (substrate for MATE1/2 K and OCT2). Co- administration with abrocitinib resulted in a 1.53- and 1.40- fold increase of dabigatran, a substrate for P -gp, C max and AUC inf. No dose adjustments are required. Caution should be exercised with concomitant use of Cibinqo and dabigatran or P -gp substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, such as digoxin. Although abrocitinib was shown to be a substrate of the intestinal effl ux transporters P -gp and BCRP, no clinical DDI studies with inhibitors of these transporters were conducted. This is acceptable considering the high oral absorption with an estimated Fa of 91%. The solubility of abrocitinib was shown to be pH -dependent; therefore, interactions with drugs that increase gastric pH may reduce the absorption of abrocitinib. Mechanism of Action and Primary Pharmacology Abrocitinib inhibits JAK1 by blocking the ATP binding site. A 28 -fold selectivity over JAK2, >340 -fold over JA K3 and 43- fold over TYK2 has been shown in in vitro studies. Inhibition of JAK1 leads to the modulation of cytokines involved in the pathophysiology of AD. The two pharmacologically active metabolites M1 and M2 exhibit similar inhibitory effects as the par ent drug abrocitinib. Secondary Pharmacology (Safety) A thorough QT/QTc study in healthy subjects suggest s the absence of an unacceptable prolongation in cardiac repolari sation compared to placebo following the administration of a single supratherapeutic dose of 600 mg abrocitinib. 6.2 Dose Finding and Dose Recommendation The submitted dose finding documentation is based predominantly on the dose- ranging study B7451006, as well as the three pivotal studies. In the randomised double- blind study B7451006, the following oral treatments were compared in parallel as monotherapy over 12 weeks in around 50 patients (only emollients were permitted as topical treatments): Abrocitinib 10 mg 3012 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Abrocitinib 30 mg 1x1/day Abrocitinib 100 mg 1x1/day Abrocitinib 200 mg 1x1/day Placebo The highest abrocitinib dose of 200 mg/day was chosen on the basis of non- clinical toxicity data. The patients had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis that could not be adequately controlled with topical treatment. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who showed an almost complete clinical response after 12 weeks of treatment (IGA 0 or 1 and 2 points improvement). Other IGA -related, as well as common EASI -, NRS - and SCORAD- related, variables were investigated as secondary endpoints. Adverse events were more frequent numerically with abrocitinib than with placebo , and a relevant proportion involved respiratory infections. Regarding TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation and SAEs, no consistent dose responses were observed. No fatalities or prohibitive safety problems were described. Based on the outcome of the dose finding study, abrocitinib was investigated at the doses of 100 mg and 200 mg in the submitted pivotal studies , both as monotherapy and adjunctive treatment with topical corticosteroids. As the dose increased in these studies, an increasing difference compared to placebo was described for the investigated efficacy endpoints. The data also indicated a dose -dependent increase in herpes infections and other safety problems. 6.3 Efficacy The submitted evidence of efficacy is based predominantly on three pivotal studies : MONO -1 (B7451012), double- blind 2:2:1 parallel -group comparative studies with the same design and size, placebo treatment was compared with abrocitinib treatment at the doses of 100 mg and 200 mg once daily over 12 weeks. The primary endpoints were the percentages of patients who showed a clear clinical improvement after 12 weeks of treatment (IGA1, EASI75) compared to placebo. There was a clear clinical improvement in IGA with abrocitinib of 23.7% vs placebo 7.9% (MONO -1) and vs 10.4% respectively (MONO -2). For details please refer to the attached information for healthcare professionals . Combination treatment with topical corticoster oids in adults (Study COMPARE B7451029) In this randomised, double- blind 2:2.2:1 parallel -group comparative study, the following interventions over 12- 16 weeks were compared in adult patients ( 18 years) whose condition could not be adequately controlled with topical treatment: abrocitinib, dupilumab an d placebo. The basic treatments were cutaneous preparations (moderately strong corticosteroids on active lesions, weak topical corticosteroids on active lesions on critical body sites; calcineurin inhibitors or PDE4 inhibitors were permitted). Primary and secondary endpoints were similar to those in the monotherapy studies (IGA, EASI at 12 weeks). Regarding the primary and secondary endpoints, a statistically significant and clinically relevant better outcome was reported for abrocitinib and for dupilumab compared to placebo. There was a clear clinical improvement for IGA with abrocitinib of 36.6% v s placebo 14% and for EASI -75 with abrocitinib of 58.7% vs placebo 27.1% after 12 weeks. For details please refer to the attached information for healthcare professionals. SwissPAR 16 / 19 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Key supportive studies Study B7451014 (REGIMEN) In this m aintenance withdrawal study, open- label treatment for 12 weeks with abrocitinib 200 mg monotherapy was followed by a double- blind comparison of responders who were randomised to receive either placebo, abrocitinib 100 mg or abrocitinib 200 mg monotherapy. In the absence of a response, or if a response was lost, abrocitinib 200 mg in combination with topical corticosteroids was subsequently used as rescue medication. The p rimary endpoint was the occurrence of a flare, defined as a loss of response (loss of at least 50% of EASI response at Week 12 and an IGA score of 2.) A statistically significant, dose -dependent reduction in flares was described for both doses of abrocitinib. In patients with an absent response or loss of response, the rescue treatment subsequently produced an improvement in all pre -treated patients, but this was more pronounced in those who lost the response while taking placebo than in those who were taking abrocitinib. Long- term extension follow -up study B7451015 (EXTEND) Patients in the pivotal \"parent st udies\" (B7451012/B7451013/B7451029) could transfer to the still ongoing long -term extension follow -up study B7451015. Patients who had been treated with abrocitinib 100 mg or 200 mg in the parent studies continued, and are continuing this treatment, while patients who had been previously treated with placebo or dupilumab were randomised 1:1 either to the abrocitinib 100 mg or the abrocitinib 200 mg arm. At randomisation, the 100 mg arm comprised a total of 595 patients and the 200 mg arm 521 patients. In addition to abrocitinib, the patients were, and are, allowed to be treated with topical corticosteroids. Among patients who did not achieve IGA (0 or 1) response after 12 weeks of abrocitinib treatment and entered EXTEND, 14% and 22% of patients continuing abrocitinib 100 mg once daily in EXTEND achieved IGA (0 or 1) response by Week 16 and Week 24 (with 4 and 12 additional weeks of treatment), respectively, and 19% and 27% of patients continuing abrocitinib 200 mg once daily achieved IGA response by Week 16 and Week 24, respectively ( NRI-analysis). Among patients who achieved response at Week 12 of a qualifying parent study and entered EXTEND, the majority of patients maintained their response at Week 48 of cumulative abrocitinib treatment for both doses of abrocitinib (53% and 57% for IGA (0 or 1) response, and 71% EASI -75, and 52% and 69% for PP -NRS4 with 100 mg once daily and 200 mg once daily, respectively (NRI -Analysis) ). Conclusion: Based on the submitted documentation, Swissmedic considers tha t the evidence presented demonstrates clinical efficacy in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who failed to respond adequately to topical corticosteroids alone. 6.4 Safety The number of exposed patients/patient years in the Full Cumulative Pool was 3128/2088.8. Analyses were performed in different p ools. The \"Primary Safety Pool\" included all AD patients exposed to the study medication in randomised placebo- controlled studie s (study periods). Data from this pool showed a higher number of TEAEs with abrocitinib compared to placebo. The \"All Exposure Pool\" included all AD patients who were exposed in studies to abrocitinib 100 mg or 200 mg. Overall higher incidence rates are r eported for SAEs and TEAEs resulting in permanent discontinuation. Fairly common events were infections, nausea, headache, dizziness, gastrointestinal disorders and acne. Slight dose -dependency was described for the frequencies of herpes infections (but not infections overall or severe infections), gastrointestinal disorders and headache. SwissPAR 17 / 19 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Adverse event of special interest Serious dose -dependent clinical long -term sequelae observed during the experience to date with other JAK inhibitors include, in addition to thromboembolic events and infections, cardiovascular events, malignancies, gastrointestinal perforations and increased mortality. Other relevant safety aspects prolongation The \"thorough QT study\" B7451027 described a dose- dependent QTc prolongation, although a clinically relevant prolongation was observed only with clearly supratherapeutic exposures. No conclusive increase in cardiac problems was described for the investigated study population. However, patients with a QTcF interval of over 450 ms or with risk factors for torsades de pointes were excluded from the treatment. Vaccination The submitted vaccination/immunogenicity sub- study does not describe any impairment of the immune response during treatment with abrocitinib. However, the sub- study sh ows methodological shortcomings : the case numbers are small, results are not reported as specified in the protocol and the results submitted for the abrocitinib arms relate only to selected patients (8/9 abrocitinib 100 mg and 6/4 abrocitinib 200 mg; by contrast 10/10 placebo). 6.5 Final Clinical and Clinical Pharmacology Benefit Risk Assessment The clinical pharmacology package was extensive and covered all the relevant aspects. Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that no dose adjustme nts are necessary based on body weight, age, gender and race. No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild renal impairment and patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No unacceptable prolongation in cardiac repolari sation was observed in a thorough QT/QTc study. A dose reduction by half is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment, whereas administration of abrotcitinib is no recommended for patients with severe renal impairment. A significant in vitro DDI risk was id entified for abrocitinib and its metabolites. Based on clinical DDI studies, a dose reduction by half is recommended in patients receiving dual strong inhibitors of CYP2C19 and moderate inhibitors of CYP2C9, or strong inhibitors of CYP2C19 alone. Co- admini stration of CYP inducers is not recommended. The submitted clinical documentation demonstrates benefits in patients with atopic dermatitis treated with abrocitinib compared to placebo regarding important clinical efficacy endpoints. Long- term data for the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib indicate an increase in the risk of cardiac problems and malignancies. In February and September 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated that a long -term post -marketing study with the JAK in hibitor tofacitinib found an increased risk of cardiac problems and malignancies compared t o tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and warned that other JAK inhibitors may p ose similar risks based on the current data situation. Swissmedic carefully moni tors these risks in the class of JAK inhibitors. Overall, a positive benefit/risk profile has been shown for the treatment of atopic dermatitis patients with abrocitinib when all relevant precautions are taken into account in the following indication: \"Cibinqo is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults when therapy with topical medicinal products does not provide adequate disease control or cannot be used.\" The recommended dosage is 100 mg once daily. If there is no sufficient improvement after 12 weeks of treatment, the medicinal product should be discontinued.

Information for healthcare professionals 2 / 24 Indications/Uses Cibinqo is indicated for the treatment of moderate- to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults when therapy with topical medications does not provide adequate disease control or cannot be used. Dosage/A dministration Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a healthcare professional experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Cibinqo is indicated (see section \u00ab Indications/Uses \u00bb). Usual dosage The recommended dose of Cibinqo is 100 mg once daily. Cibinqo can be used with or without medicated topical therapies for atopic dermatitis. If there is no sufficient improvement after 12 weeks of treatment, the medication should be discontinued. Treatment initiation Treatment with Cibinqo should not be initiated in patients with a platelet count <150 \u00d7 10 3/mm3, an neutrophil count (ANC) <1 \u00d7 103/mm3 or who have a haemoglobin value < 8 g/dL (see section \u00abWarnings and precautions\u00bb). Missed doses If a dose is missed, patients should be advised to take the dose as soon as possible unless it is less than 12 hours before the next dose, in which case the patient should not take the missed dose. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time. Dose interruption If a patient develops a serious infection, sepsis or opportunistic infection, interruption of Cibinqo until the infection is controlled should be considered (see section \u00abWarnings and precautions\u00bb). Interruption of dosing may be needed for management of laboratory abnormalities as described in Table 1 (see section \u00abWarnings and precautions\u00bb) . Information for healthcare professionals 3 / 24 Special dosage instructions Drug -drug interactions In patients receiving dual strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19 and moderate inhibitors of CYP2C9, or strong of CYP2C19 alone (e.g. fluvoxamine, fluconazole, fluoxetine and ticlopidine), the recommended dose of Cibinqo should be reduced by half to 50 mg once dai ly. The use of C ibinqo is not recommended concomitantly with moderate or strong inducers of CYP2C19/CYP2C9 enzymes \u00bb). Patients with impaired hepatic function No d ose adjustment is required in patients with mild (Child Pugh A) or moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment (see section \u00abPharmacokinetics\u00bb) . Cibinqo must not be usedin patients with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment (see section \u00abContraindications\u00bb ). Patients with impaired renal function No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment, i.e. estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 60 to < 90 mL/min. In patients with moderate (eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min) renal impairment, the recommended dose of Cibinqo should be reduced by half to 50 mg once daily (see section \u00abPharmacokinetics\u00bb ). Cibingo is not recommended in patients with severe (eGFR < 30mL/min) renal impairment. Cibinqo has not been studied in patients with end- stage renal disease (ESRD) on renal replacement therapy. Elderly patients The risks and benefits of the recommended dose for patients 65 years of age should be considered (see section \u00abWarnings and precautions\u00bb) . There are no conclusive data in patients 75 years of age and older. Children and adolescents The safety and efficacy of Cibinqo in paediatric patients under 1 8 years of age have not yet been established. Information for healthcare professionals 4 / 24 Mode of administration Cibinqo is to be taken o rally once daily with or without food at approximately the same time each day. In patients who experience nausea while taking Cibinqo , taking with food may improve nausea. Cibinqo tablets should be swallowed whole with water and should not be split, crushed, or chewed. Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section \u00abComposition - Excipients\u00bb. Active serious systemic infections, including tuberculosis (TB) (see section \u00ab Warnings and precautions \u00bb). Severe hepatic impairment (see section \u00ab Dosage/Administration\u00bb lactation (see section \u00ab Pregnancy, lactation\u00bb ). Warnings and precautions Serious infections Serious infections have been reported in patients receiving Cibinqo . The most freq uent serious infections in clinical studies were herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and pneumonia, (see section \u00abUndesirable effects\u00bb ). Treatment must not be initiated in patients with an active, serious systemic infection (see section \u00abContraindications \u00bb). Risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Cibinqo should be considered for patients: with chronic or recurrent infection who have been exposed to TB with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection who have resided or travelled in areas of endemic TB or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Cibinqo . A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Cibinqo should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing which is appropriate for immunocompromised patients and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated. Discontinuation of C ibinqo should also be considered until the infection has resolved. Information for healthcare professionals 5 / 24 Tuberculosis Patients should be screened for TB before starting Cibinqo therapy . Yearly screening for patients in highly endemic areas for TB should be considered. Cibinqo must not be given to patients with active TB (see section \u00ab Contraindications \u00bb). For patients with a new diagnosis of latent TB or prior untreated latent TB, preventive therapy for latent TB should be started prior to initiation of Cibinqo . Viral reactivation clinical \u00abUndesirable effects\u00bb ). The rate of herpes zoster infections was higher in patients 65 years of age and older and patients with severe atopic dermatitis at baseline (see section \u00abUndesirable effects\u00bb). If a patient develops herpes zoster, temporary interruption of treatment should be considered until the episode resolves. Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy and during therapy with Cibinqo . Patients with evidence of active hepatitis B or hepatitis C (positive hepatitis C PCR) infection were excluded from clinical studies (see section \u00abPharmacokinetics\u00bb). Patients who were hepatitis B surface antigen ne gative, hepatitis B core antibody positive, and hepatitis B surface antibody positive had testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. Patients who had HBV DNA above the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) were excluded. Patients who had HBV DNA negative or below LLQ could initiate treatment with Cibinqo ; such patients had HBV DNA monitored. If HBV DNA is detected, a liver specialist should be consulted. Vaccination No data are available on the response to vaccination with live or inactivated vaccines in patients treated with Cibinqo . Based on current data, it is not possible to assess the extent to which Cibinqo inhibits the immune response to neo- and/or booster antigens. U se of live, attenuated vaccines during or immediately prior to Cibinqo therapy is not recommended. The time interval between live vaccination and treatment with Cibinqo must be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines for immunom odulatory agents. Prior to initiating Cibinqo , it is recommended that patients be brought up to date with all immuni sations, including prophylactic herpes zoster vaccinations, in agreement with current immuni sation guidelines. Information for healthcare professionals 6 / 24 Gastrointestinal Perforations Gastrointestinal perforation have rarely been observed during treatment with JAK inhibitors, as Cibinqo. Venous thrombotic events including pulmonary embolism thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been receiving Cibinqo (see section \u00abUndesirable effects\u00bb ). Cibinqo should be used with caution in patients at high ris k for DVT/PE. Risk factors that should be considered in determining the patient's risk for DVT/PE include older age, obesity, a medical hi story of DVT/PE, prothrombotic disorder, use of combined hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, patients undergoing major surgery, or prolonged immobilisation. If clinical features of DVT/PE occur, Cibinqo treatment should be discontinued and patients should be evaluated promptly, followed by appropriate treatment. Malignancy (including non- melanoma skin cancers) Immunomodulatory drugs could increase the risk of tumor diseases including lymphoma. More cancer cases were observed with a JAK inhibitor other than abrocitinib in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis versus TNF inhibitors. Malignancies, including non- melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), were observed in clinical studies with Cibinqo . The risks and benefits of Cibinqo treatment should be considered prior to initiating in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated NMSC or cervical cancer in situ or when considering continuing Cibinqo therapy in patients who develop a malignancy. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer. Haem atologic abnormalities Confirmed ALC < 0.5 \u00d7 10 3/mm3 and platelet count <50 \u00d7 103/mm3 were observed in less than 0.5% of patients in clinical studies . Treatment with Cibinqo should not be initiated in patients with a platelet count <150 \u00d7 103/mm3, an ALC < 0.5 \u00d7 103/mm3, an ANC < 1 \u00d7 103/mm3 or who have a haemoglobin value <8 g/dL (see section \u00abDosage/Administration\u00bb). Platelet count and ALC should be monitored 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with Cibinqo and thereafter according to routine patient management (see Table 1). Lipids Dose -dependent increase in blood lipid parameters were reported in patients treated with abrocitinib compared to placebo (see section \u00abUndesirable effects\u00bb). Lipid parameters should be assessed Information for healthcare professionals 7 / 24 approximately 4 weeks following initiation of Cibinqo therapy and thereafter according to their risk for cardiovascular disease. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on car diovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. More serious adverse cardiac events have been observed with a JAK inhibitor other than abrocitinib compared with TNF inhibitors in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Patients should be monito red and managed according to clinical guidelines, due to the known cardiovascular risks associated especially with hyperlipidaemia. Laboratory monitoring Table 1. Laboratory monitoring guidance Laboratory measure Monitoring guidance Action Platelet counts Before treatment initiation, 4 weeks after initiation and thereafter according to routine patient management Treatment should be discontinued if platelet count s are <50 \u00d7 103/mm3. Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC) Before treatment initiation, 4 weeks after initiation and thereafter according to routine patient management Treatment should be interrupted if ALC is <0.5 \u00d7 103/mm3 and may be restarted once ALC returns above this value. Treatment should be discontinued if confirmed. Lipid parameters Before treatment initiation, 4 weeks after initiation and thereafter according to clinical guidelines for hyperlipidaemia Patients should be monitored according to clinical guidelines for hyperlipidaemia. Elderly A total of 145 patients 65 years of age a nd older were enrolled in Cibinqo studies. The safety profile observed in elderly patients was similar to that of the adult population with the following exceptions: a higher proportion of patients 65 years of age and older discontinued from clinical studi es and were more likely to have serious adverse events compared to younger patients; patients 65 years and older were more likely to develop low platelet and ALC values; the incidence rate of herpes zoster in patients 65 years of age and older was higher t han that of younger patients (see section \u00abUndesirable effects\u00bb). There are no conclusive data in patients above 75 years of age. Excipients Lactose intolerance Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

Interactions Effect of Cibinqo on other medicinal products The effect of abrocitinib on the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs is presented in Table 2 . Table 2. Change in Pharmacokinetics of Coadministered Drugs in the Presence of Abrocitinib Coadministered Drugs or In Vivo Markers of CYP Activity Dose Regimen of 200 mg once daily x 9 days EE: 1.07 (0.99, 1.15) LN: 0.86 (0.75, 0.97) EE: 1.19 (1.12, 1.26) LNb: 1.10) No dose adjustment Sensitive CYP3A Substrate: Midazolam 200 mg once daily x 7 days 0.93 (0.84, 1.04) 0.92 (0.86, 0.99) No dose adjustment Sensitive 200 mg single dose 1.40 (0.92, 2.13) 1.53 (1.09, 2.15) Caution should be exercised with concomitant use of Cibinqo with dabigatran or P -gp substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, such as digoxin Sensitive BCRP and OAT3 substrate: Rosuvastatin 200 mg once daily x 3 days 0.99 (0.86, 1.14) 1.02 (0.93, 1.12) No dose adjustment Sensitive MATE1/2K substrate: Metformin 200 mg once daily x 2 days (0.81, 0.96) 0.93 (0.85, 1.03) No dose and AUC inf compare coadministration of abroc itinib with the drug versus administration of the drug alone. bAUC last of levonorgestrel was reported in lieu of AUC inf because the terminal phase of levonorgestrel was not well characterized. Information for healthcare professionals 9 / 24 No clinically significant effects of Cibinqo were observed in drug interaction studies with oral contraceptives (e.g., ethinyl oestradiol/levonorgestrel) . In vitro , of dabigatran etexilate (a P-gp substrate), with a dose of Cibinqo 200 mg increased dabigatran AUC inf and C max by approximately 53% and 40%, respectively, compared with administration alone. The effect of abrocitinib on pharmacokinetics of digoxin, a P -gp substrate with a narrow therapeutic index, has not been evaluated. Caution should be exercised as the levels of digoxin may increase. Effect of other medicinal products on Cibinqo Abrocitinib is metabolised predominantly by CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 enzymes, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 enzymes, and it s active metabolites are renally excreted and are substrates of the organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3). Therefore, exposures of abrocitinib and/or its active metabolites may be affected by medicinal products that strongly inhibit or induce CYP2C19 or CYP2C 9 or inhibit the OAT3 transporter. The effect of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of abrocitinib is presented in Table 3 . Dose adjustments, as appropriate, based on these results are outlined in section \u00abDosage/Administration\u00bb. Table 3.

Co-administration with products which increase gastric pH The effect of elevating gastric pH with antacids, H2- receptor antagonists (famotidine), or proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole) on the pharmacokinetics of abrocitinib has not been studied and may reduce the absorption of abrocitinib due to the low solubilit y of abrocitinib at pH above 4. Other in vitro interactions In vitro , abrocitinib or its metabolites were not significant metabolites at clinically meaningful concentrations are not inhibitors of organic anion transporter (OAT)3, organic cation transporter (OCT)1, multidrug and toxin compound extrusion protein (MATE)1/2K and breast protein (BCRP), organic or OCT2. Pregnancy, lactation Pregnancy There are no or limited amount of data on the use of Cibinqo in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section \u00abPreclinical data\u00bb). Cibinqo is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section \u00abContraindications\u00bb) . Women of c hildbearing potential Women of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 month following the final dose of Cibinqo . Pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential should be encouraged. Lactation There are no data on the presence of Cibinqo in human milk, the effects on the breast fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Cibinqo was secreted in milk of lactating rats. A risk to Information for healthcare professionals 11 / 24 newborns/infants cannot be excluded and Cibinqo is contraindicated during breast feeding (see section \u00abContraindications\u00bb) . Fertility Based on the findings in rats, oral administration of Cibinqo may result in temporary reduced fertility in females of reproductive potential. These effects on fe male rat fertility were reversible 1 month after cessation of Cibinqo oral administration (see section \u00abPreclinical data\u00bb). Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies have been conducted on the effect of Cibinqo on driving ability or abilit y to operate machinery. Patients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with Cibinqo (see \u00abAdverse Effects \u00bb). Undesirable effects The most commonly reported adverse reactions occurring in 2% of patients treated with Cibin qo 200 mg in placebo- controlled studies upper abdominal pain (2.2%) . The most frequent serious adverse reactions are infections (0.3%) (see section \u00abWarnings and precautions\u00bb ). A total of 3 '128 patients were treated with Cibinqo in clinical studies in atopic dermatitis representing 2'089 patient -years of exposure. There were 994 patients with at least 48 weeks of exposure. Five placebo controlled studies were integrated ( 703 patients on 100 mg once daily, 684 patients on 200 mg once daily and 438 patients on placebo) to evaluate the safety of Cibinqo in comparison to placebo for up to 16 weeks. Listed in Table 4 are adverse reactions observed in atopic dermatitis clinical studies presented by system organ class and frequency, using the following categories: frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Includes changes detected during laboratory monitoring (see text below). Description of selected undesirable effects Please note, that the 200 mg dose is not approved in Switzerland. Infections In placebo controlled studies, for up to 16 weeks, infections have been reported in 27.4 % of patients treated with placebo and in 34.9 % and 34. 8% of patients treated with Cibinqo 100 mg. Most infections were mild or moderate. The percentage of patients reporting infection -related adverse drug reactions compared to placebo simplex was more frequent in patients with a history of herpes simplex or eczema herpeticum. Most of the herpes zoster events involved a single dermatome and were non-serious. All the opportunistic infections were cases of multidermatomal cutaneous herpes zoster (0.6%), most of which . The incidence rate of herpes zoster in patients 65 years of age and older (7.40 per 100 patient -years) was higher than that of patients 18 to less than 65 years of age (3.44 per 100 patient -years) and less than 18 years of age (2.12 per 100 patient -years). The incidence rate of herpes zoster in patie nts with severe atopic dermatitis at baseline (4.93 per 100 patient -years) was higher than that of patients with moderate atopic dermatitis at baseline (2.49 per 100 patient -years) (see section \u00abWarnings and precautions\u00bb) . Information for healthcare professionals 13 / 24 In placebo controlled studies, for up to 16 weeks, the rate of serious infections was 1.81 per 100 patient -years in patients treated with placebo, 3. 32 per 100 patient -years in patients treated with Cibinqo 100 mg.Among all patients treated with Cibinqo , including the long- term extension study, the rate of serious infections was 2.65 per 100 patient -years treated with Cibinqo 100 mg. The most commonly reported serious infections were herpes simplex, herpes zoster, Venous thrombotic events including pulmonary embolism Events were observed in the clinical trial program only during treatment with 200 mg, which is not approved in Switzerland (see section \u00abWarnings and precautions\u00bb). Thrombocytopenia In placebo controlled studies, for up to 16 weeks, treatment was associated with a dose- related decrease in platelet count. Maximum effects on platelets were observed within 4 weeks, after which the platelet count returned towards baseline despite continued therapy. Confirmed platelet counts of <50 \u00d7 10 3/mm3 were reported in 0.1% of patient s exposed to 200 mg., and in 0 patients treated with 100 mg or placebo. Among all patients exposed to Cibinqo , including the long- term extension study, confirmed platelet counts of <50 \u00d7 103/mm3 were reported in0.1% of patients treated with 200 mg, occurring at Week 4. A higher proportion of patients 65 years of age and older developed a platelet count nadir < 75 \u00d7 103/mm3 (see section \u00abWarnings and precautions\u00bb). Lymphopenia In placebo controlled studies, for up to 16 weeks, confirmed ALC <0.5 \u00d7 103/mm3 occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with Cibinqo 200 mg and 0 % of patients treated with Cibinqo 100 mg or placebo. Both cases occurred in the first 4 weeks of exposure. Among all patients exposed to Cibinqo , including the long- term extension, confirmed ALC <0.5 \u00d7 103/mm3 were reported in 0. 3% of patients treated with 200 mg and 0.1% of patients treated with 100 mg, all of whom were 65 years of age and older (see section \u00abWarnings and precautions\u00bb). Lipid elevations In placebo controlled studies, for up to 16 weeks, there was a dose- related increase in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- c), total cholesterol, and high -density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL- c) relative to placebo at Week 4 which remained elevated through the final visit in the treatment period. There was no meaningful change in the LDL/HDL ratio in patients treated with abrocitinib relative to patients treated with placebo. Events related to hyperlipidaemia occurred in 0. 4% of patients exposed Information for healthcare professionals 14 / 24 to 100 mg, 0.6% of patients exposed to 200 mg and 0% of patients exposed to plac ebo ( see section \u00abWarnings and precautions\u00bb). Creatine phosphokinase elevations (CPK) In placebo controlled studies, for up to 16 weeks, significant increases in CPK values (> 5 \u00d7 ULN) occurred in 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, 1.8% of patients tr eated with 100 mg . Most elevations were transient, and none led to discontinuation. In the clinical studies, there were no reported events of rhabdomyolysis. Nausea In placebo- controlled studies, for up to 16 weeks, nausea was reported in 1.8% of patient s treated with placebo and in 6.3% of patients treated with 100 mg. Discontinuation due to nausea occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with C ibinqo . Among patients with nausea, 63.5% of patients had onset of nausea in the first week of therapy. The median duration of nausea was 15 days. Most of the cases were mild to moderate in severity. Children and adolescents (use in this age group is not approved in Switzerland) A total of 635 adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age) were enrolled in Cibinqo atopic dermatitis studies. The safety profile observed in adolescents in atopic dermatitis clinical studies was similar to that of the adult population (see section \u00ab Dosage/Administration \u00bb). Psychiatric disorders Patients who showed suicidal ideation(s)/behavior(s) in relevant preliminary investigations were excluded from the clinical trials. Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is very important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of t he medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions online via the ElViS portal (Electronic Vigilance System). You can obtain information about this at www.swissmedic.c h . Overdose Cibinqo was administered in clinical studies up to a single oral dose of 800 mg and 400 mg daily for 28 days. Adverse reactions were comparable to those seen at lower doses and no specific toxicities were identified. In case of an overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for signs and Information for healthcare professionals 15 / 24 symptoms of adverse reactions (see section \u00abUndesirable effects \u00bb). Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Pharmacokinetics data up to and including a single oral dose of 800 mg in healthy adult volunteers indicate that more than 90% of the administered dose is expected to be eliminated within 48 hours . Properties/Effects ATC code D11AH08 Mechanism kinase (JAK)1 inhibitor. JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor -receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence cellular processes of haematopoiesis and immune cell function. Wit hin signalling pathways, JAKs phosphorylate and activate Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Cibinqo modulates the signalling pathway at the point of JAK1, preventing t he phosphorylation and activation of STATs. Cibinqo reversibly and selectively inhibits JAK1 by blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. In cell assay, Cibinqo has biochemical even higher selectivity over the broader kinome. In cellular settings, where JAK enzymes transmit signals in (i.e., JAK1 relative to receptors utilising JAK2 only or JAK2/TYK2 pairs. The relevance of selective enzymatic inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to clinical effect is not currently known.Both the parent compound and the active metabolites inhibit cytokine signalling with similar levels of selectivity. Pharmacodynamics Clinical biomarkers Treatment with Cibinqo was associated with dose- dependent reduction in serum markers of inflammation, including high sensitivity C- reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin- 31 (IL 31) and thymus and activation- regulated chemokine (TARC). These changes returned to near baseline within 4 weeks of drug discontinuation. Cardiac electrophysiology Information for healthcare professionals 16 / 24 The effect of Cibinqo on the QTc interval was examined in subjects who received single doses of abrocitinib 600 mg in a placebo- and positive- controlled thorough QT study. In a concentration- QTc analysis, abrocitinib at therapeutic and supratherapeutic plasma concentrations did not lead to a prolongation of the QTc intervals. Clinical efficacy The efficacy and safety of Cibinqo as monotherapy and in combination with background medicated topic al therapies over 12 -16 weeks were evaluated in 1 '616 patients in 3 pivotal Phase 3 randomised, double- blind, placebo- controlled studies (MONO -1, MONO- 2, and COMPARE) . In addition, the efficacy and safety of C ibinqo in monotherapy over 52 weeks (with the option of rescue treatment in flaring subjects) was evaluated in 1' 233 subjects in a Phase 3 induction, randomised withdrawal, double- blind, placebo- controlled study (REGIMEN). The patients in these 4 studies had moderate -to- severe atopic dermatitis as defined by Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score 3, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score 16, BSA involvement 10%, and Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP -NRS) 4 at baseline visit to randomi sation. Patients who had a prior inadequate response or for whom topical treatments were medically unadvisable, or who had received systemic therapies were eligible for inclusion. All patients who completed the parent studies were eligible to enrol into the long-term extension study EXTEND. Baseline characteristics In the placebo -controlled studies (MONO -1, MONO- 2, COMPARE) and the open label induction, randomised withdrawal study (REGIMEN) across all treatment groups 41.4% to 51.1% were female, 59.3% to 77. 8% were Caucasian, 15.0% to 33.0% were Asian and 4.1% to 8.3% were Black, and the mean age was 32.1 to 37.7 years. In these studies, 32.2% to 40.8% had a baseline IGA of 4 (severe atopic dermatitis), and 41.4% to 59.5% of patients had received prior system ic treatment for atopic dermatitis. The baseline mean EASI score ranged from 28.5 to 30.9, the baseline PP -NRS ranged from 7.0 to 7.3 and the baseline Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) ranged from 14.4 to 16.0. Clinical response 12-week monotherapy (M ONO -1, MONO -2) and 16- week TCS combination (COMPARE) studies A significantly larger proportion of patients achieved both primary endpoints IGA 0 or 1 and/or EASI -75 with 100 mg once daily Cibinqo compared with placebo at Week 12 or Week 16 (see Table 5). Information for healthcare professionals 17 / 24 A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved at least a PP -NRS 4 -point improvement with 100 mg once daily Cibinqo compared with placebo. This improvement was observed as early as Week 2 and persisting through Week 12 (Figure 1). Treatment effec ts in subgroups (e.g. weight, age, sex, race and prior systemic immunosuppressant treatment) in MONO- 1, MONO- 2 and COMPARE were consistent with the results in the overall study population.

Long- term efficacy Eligible patients who completed the full treatment period of a qualifying parent study (e.g. MONO -1, MONO 2, COMPARE) were considered for enrolment with or without background medicated topical Information for healthcare professionals 19 / 24 therapy in the long -term extension study EXTEND. Patients conti nued the same dose as they were randomized to in the parent study and the blind was maintained. The majority of patients on Cibinqo 100 mg once daily maintained their response at Week 48 of cumulative treatment [60% for IGA (0 or 1) response, 79% EASI -75, and 62% for PP -NRS4]. Patients who received dupilumab in the COMPARE study and subsequently entered EXTEND were randomised to either 100 mg or 200 mg of Cibinqo once daily upon entering EXTEND. Among non responders to dupilumab in the COMPARE study who were randomized to Cibinqo 100 mg once daily, a substantial proportion of patients achieved response 12 weeks after switching to Cibinqo [34% IGA (0 or 1) response, and 68% for EASI -75]. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Abrocitinib is well- absorbed with over 91% extent of oral absorption and absolute oral bioavailability of approximately 60%. The oral absorption of abrocitinib is rapid and peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1 hour. Both C max and AUC of abrocitinib increased dose proportionally from 30 to 400 mg. After single 100 mg doses in healthy adult subjects, the mean (%CV) of abrocitinib AUC and Cmax were 1549 (75) and (79), respectively. Co-administration of Cibinqo with a high -fat meal had no clinically relevant effect on abrocitin ib exposures (AUC and C max increased by approximately 26% and 29%, respectively, and T max was prolonged by 2 hours). In clinical studies , Cibinqo was administered without regard to food ( see section \u00abDosage/Administration\u00bb). Distribution After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution of Cibinqo is about 100 L. Approximately 64%, 37% and 29% of circulating abrocitinib and its active metabolites M1 and M2, respectively, are bound to plasma proteins. Abrocitinib and its active m etabolites distribute equally between red blood cells and plasma. Metabolism The in vitro metabolism of abrocitinib is mediated by multiple study, abroci tinib was the most prevalent circulating species, with 3 polar mono -hydroxylated metabolites identified as M1 (3 -hydroxypropyl), M2 (2 and M4 (pyrrolidinone pyrimidine). At M2 (11%) M4 (24%) are major metabolites and M1 (9 .6%) is a minor metabolite. Of the 3 metabolites in circulation, M1 and M2 have similar JAK inhibitory profiles as abrocitinib, while M4 was Information for healthcare professionals 20 / 24 pharmacologically inactive. The pharmacologic activity of Cibinqo is attributable to the unbound exposures of paren t molecule (~60%) as well as M1 (~10%) and M2 (~30%) in systemic circulation. The sum of unbound exposures of abrocitinib , M1 and M2, each expressed in molar units and adjusted for relative potencies, is referred to as the abrocitinib active moiety. Elimination The total body clearance of abrocitinib is 22 L/hr. The elimination half -life of abrocitinib is about 6 hours. Steady state plasma concentrations of abrocitinib are achieved within 48 hours after once daily administration. After a 200 mg oral admi nistration of [ 14C]-abrocitinib in humans, total recovery of radioactivity was approximately 95%, with approximately 85% recovered in urine and 10% in feces. Cibinqo is eliminated primarily by metabolic clearance mechanisms, with less than 1% of the dose excreted in urine as unchanged drug. The urinary excretion of the metabolites of abrocitinib is 16%, 14% and 15% of the administered abrocitinib dose for M1, M2 and M4, respectively, and the metabolites are substra tes of OAT3 transporter. Kinetics in specific patient groups Hepatic impairment Patients with mild (Child Pugh A) and moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment had approximately 4% decrease and 15% increase in active moiety AUC inf, respectively, compared to patients with normal hepatic function. These changes are not clinically significant, and no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see section \u00abDosage/Administration\u00bb). In clinical studies, Cibinqo was not evaluated in patients with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment (see section \u00abContraindications\u00bb) , or in patients screened positive for active hepatitis B or hepatitis C (see section \u00abWarnings and precautions\u00bb) . Renal impairment In a renal impairment study, patients with severe (eGFR <30 mL/min) and moderate (eGFR 30 to< 60 mL/min) renal impairment had approximately 191% and 110% increase in active moiety AUC inf, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function (eGFR 90 mL/min; (see secti on \u00abDosage/Administration\u00bb). Pharmacokinetics of abrocitinib have not been determined in patients with mild renal impairment, however , based on the results observed in other groups , an increase of up to 70% in active moiety exposure is expected in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to< 90 mL/min ). The increase of up to 70% is not clinically meaningful as t he efficacy and safety of abrocitinib in atopic dermatitis patients with mild renal impairment (n=756) was comparable to the overall population in Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies . The eGFR in individual patients was estimated using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. Information for healthcare professionals 21 / 24 Cibinqo has not been studied in patients with ESRD on renal replacement therapy (see section \u00abDosage/Administration\u00bb ). In Phase 3 clinical studies, Cibinqo was not evaluated in patients with atopic dermatitis with baseline creatinine clearance values less than 40 mL/min. Children and adolescents (use in this age group is not approved in Switzerland) Adolescents (12 to <18 years ) Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, there was no clinically significant difference in the mean Cibinqo steady -state exposures in adolescent patients compared to adults at their typical body weight s. Body weight, gender, genotype, race, and age Body weight (34-204 kg), gender, CYP2C19/2C9 genotype, race (white, asian, black, other) , and age (12-84 years) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on Cibinqo exposure (see section \u00abDosage/Administration\u00bb). Preclinical data General toxicity In toxicity studies of up to 1 month of C ibinqo dosing in rats initiated at 6- 8 weeks and 9- weeks of age, a bone dystrophy findingwas noted, at exposure of greater than or equal to 46 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRH D) of 100 mg. No bone findings were observed in rats at any dose in the 6- month toxicity study (up to 50 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 100 mg) or in any of the toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys (up to 60 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 1 00 mg). Mutagenicity Cibinqo is not mutagenic in the bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames assay). Although assay, Cibinqo is not aneugenic or clastogenic at clinically relevant exposures based on the res ults of the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. Carcinogenicity No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in Tg.rasH2 mice administered C ibinqo for 26 weeks at exposures equal to 1.2 and 0. 4 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 1 00 mg in female and male mice, respectively. In the 104- week oral carcinogenicity study, C ibinqo resulted in statistically higher Information for healthcare professionals 22 / 24 incidence of benign thymomas in female rats at exposures greater than or equal to 5.4 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 1 00 mg. No evidence of Cibinqo -related tumorigenicity was observed following oral Cibinqo administration in female rats at exposures equal to 1.2 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 1 00 mg or in male rats at exposures equal to 26 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 100 mg. Reprodu ctive toxicity Cibinqo had no effects on male fertility or spermatogenesis at doses up to 70 mg/kg/day at exposures equal to 50 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 100 mg. Cibinqo resulted in effects on female fertility (lower fertility index, corpora lutea , and implantation sites) at exposures equal to 56 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 1 00 mg and higher postimplantation loss in rats at exposures greater than or equal to 2 0 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 100 mg. The effects on female fertility in rats reversed 1 month after cessation of Cibinqo administration. No effects on female fertility were noted at exposures equal to 3.8 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 100 mg. No foetal malformations were observed in embryo -foetal development studies in rats or rabbits. In an embryo- foetal development study in pregnant rabbits, oral administration of Cibinqo during gestation days 7 to 19 had no effects on embryo- foetal survival or foetal morphological development at exposures equal to 15.2 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 1 00 mg. Cibinqo resulted in an increase incidences of unossified forelimb phalanges at exposures equal to 15.2 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 1 00 mg. In an embryo- foetal development study in pr egnant rats, oral administration of Cibinqo during gestation days 6 to 17 resulted in increased embryo- foetal lethality at exposures equal to 32 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 1 00 mg. No embryo- foetal lethality was observed in pregnant rats orally dosed with Cibinqo during organogenesis at exposures equal to 2 0 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 1 00 mg. Cibinqo resulted in increased incidences of skeletal variations of short 13th ribs at exposures greater than or equal to 2 0 times the human AUC at the M RHD of 1 00 mg and reduced ventral processes, thickened ribs, and unossified metatarsals were observed at exposures equal to 32 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 1 00 mg. No skeletal variations were noted in rats at exposures equal to 4.6 times the human AU C at the MRHD of 1 00 mg. In a rat pre - and postnatal development study in pregnant rats, oral administration of Cibinqo during gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 resulted in dystocia with prolonged parturition and lower offspring body weights at exposures greater than or equal to 2 0 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 100 mg and lower postnatal survival at exposures e qual to 32 times the human AUC at the MRHD Information for healthcare professionals 23 / 24 of 100 mg. No maternal or developmental toxicity was observed in either dams or offspring at exposures equal to 4.6 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 1 00 mg. Juvenile animal toxicity In the juvenile rat study, oral a dministration of C ibinqo to rats initiated at postnatal Day 10 resulted in bone findings (malrotated and/or impaired use of the forelimbs, hindlimbs, or paws, fractures and/or abnormalities of the femoral head, and bony dystrophy) , at exposures 1.6 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 1 00 mg. Irreversible low femur length and width were observed at exposures 52 times the human AUC at the MRHD of 1 00 mg. Other information Incom patibilities Not applicable.
