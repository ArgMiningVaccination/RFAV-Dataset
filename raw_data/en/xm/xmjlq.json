There's little evidence this herb is effective for any use By Lisa Andrews, MEd, RD, LD Updated on September 10, 2022 Medically reviewed by Elizabeth Barnes, RDN Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Uses Side Effects Precautions Dosage Overdose Interactions What to Look For How to Store Similar Supplements Frequently Asked Questions Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceous) is an Asian plant that's been used medicinally for centuries. In Chinese, it's called huang qi, which means \"yellow life energy.\" That's because the root is yellow and it is considered to be one of the most useful herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). However, Western research has yet to provide much evidence of its effectiveness. This article looks at the claims about astragalus, what research says about them, potential dangers, safe and unsafe dosages, and how to shop for and store astragalus. Dietary supplements are not regulated like drugs in the United States, meaning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement tested by a trusted third party, such as USP, ConsumerLabs, or NSF. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, that doesn't mean they are necessarily safe for all or effective in general. Therefore, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about potential interactions with other supplements or medications. Supplement Facts Active Ingredient(s): Astragalus Alternate Name(s): Huang qi, Astragalus membranaceous, bei qi, hwanggi, milk vetch Legal Status: Available to consumers in liquid, capsule, tablet, intravenous, and inhalable forms. Suggested Dose: 5 to 60 grams per day for up to 4 months Safety Considerations: Astragalus has immune effects. It's not advised during pregnancy or breastfeeding, in infants or children, in people with autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus or type 1 diabetes), or those getting immunosuppressive therapy for cancer or other illnesses. Uses of Astragalus In TCM, astragalus is used for a variety of ailments. Scientists have begun studying it as a potential treatment for: Immune support Heart disease Complications of diabetes Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) In addition, some people use astragalus for constipation, allergies, the common cold, or upper respiratory infections. However, before anyone can say for sure whether it's safe and effective for any medicinal use, researchers need to conduct more and higher-quality human studies. Research to this point should be considered preliminary. Supplement use should be tailored to your individual needs and health history and approved by a healthcare provider such as a doctor, pharmacist, or registered dietitian. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease. Immune Support A 2016 study looked at oral (by mouth) astragalus for preventing acute respiratory tract infections in children. Researchers concluded there was inadequate evidence to support this use. Astragalus membranaceus was also studied in a small group of adult rowers to evaluate the impact on the immune system after exercise. The small, double-blinded study used doses of 500 milligrams (mg) during an intensive 6-week training camp. Compared to the control group, the treatment group had better recovery. However, the study was too small to draw conclusions about whether it changes how the immune system works. Heart Disease Researchers have studied astragalus for various heart conditions. It may have a diuretic effect, which could lower blood pressure and cause blood vessels to relax. A small study on astragalus for post-menopausal high blood pressure (hypertension) and metabolic syndrome suggested some benefits. The study compared the regular treatment alone to the regular treatment plus either 5 grams or 10 grams of astragalus per day. After one year, the group getting 10 grams of astragalus had better diastolic (bottom number) blood pressure, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratios. While this is promising, larger studies are still needed. A systematic review of studies on Astragalus membranaceous in humans and animals suggested it may help treat a heart condition called viral myocarditis. Astragalus lowered harmful heart enzymes and levels of troponin (a protein that indicates heart damage) in the treatment group. Researchers concluded that astragalus is an: AntiviralAnti-inflammatoryAntifibrotic (prevents the thickening and scarring of damaged connective tissue) Again, more research is needed before astragalus can be recommended for treating viral myocarditis. Verywell / JR Bee Complications of Diabetes: Diabetic Kidney Disease Astragalus has been studied for use in diabetic kidney disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies suggested that both oral and injectable astragalus may reduce urine protein loss and serum creatinine levels in diabetic kidney disease. Due to limited high-quality studies, more research is needed. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) In studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an inhaled form of astragalus improved measures of breathing including forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) 14 days after treatment. Researchers reported that it also improved the immune function of people with acute exacerbation of COPD. However, more research is needed before recommending astragalus for COPD. What Are the Side Effects of Astragalus? Even \"natural\" products can cause unwanted side effects, and astragalus is no exception. Common Side Effects Some common side effects of astragalus may include: Rashes Itching Nausea and diarrhea Headache Fatigue Runny nose Long-term side effects are unknown, as studies beyond four months long haven't been done. Severe Side Effects Severe side effects from astragalus are likely rare. Talk with your healthcare provider about any questions that you may have. Precautions Astragalus may cause immunomodulation (a change or increase in your body's immune response). You shouldn't use astragalus without a healthcare practitioner's recommendation if you have autoimmune diseases such as: Crohn's disease Multiple sclerosis Psoriasis Rheumatoid arthritis Type 1 diabetes Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) You also shouldn't use astragalus if you've had an organ transplant. Also, keep in mind that supplement safety generally isn't established for children, people with chronic conditions, those taking prescription medications, or during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Dosage: How Much Astragalus Should I Take? Researchers don't have enough scientific evidence to define an appropriate dose of astragalus for various age groups or conditions. The appropriate dose for you may depend on many factors, including your age, sex, and medical history. Talk to your healthcare provider for personalized advice and always tell them what herbs or supplements you're taking. What Happens If I Take Too Much Astragalus?

If you believe you've taken too much astragalus, contact your healthcare provider immediately for further guidance or get emergency medical attention.

Antivirals: Theoretically, astragalus may change the effectiveness of antiviral medications such as acyclovir and amantadine.Blood pressure medications: Astragalus can lower blood pressure. It could cause dangerously low blood pressure if combined with hypertension medications.Cancer treatments: In mice, astragalus suppresses estrogen, so it may reduce the effectiveness of certain cancer treatments that target estrogen levels.Diuretics and drugs affected by diuretics: Astragalus' possible diuretic effects may impact how well your body processes certain drugs. It may also interact with other diuretics.Immunomodulators: Astragalus has immune effects. It may interfere with drugs that suppress or stimulate the immune system. Astragalus may also interact with other herbs and supplements that have effects similar effects to the drugs mentioned above. Be sure you carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement so you know what's in it and at what levels. Always review this information with your healthcare provider and discuss any potential interactions with foods, medications, or other supplements.
