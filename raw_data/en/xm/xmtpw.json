Every year, April 2, is celebrated as the World Autism Day to identify and honour the unique talents that autistic people possess. On this day, the organisations working in this domain come together to increase awareness and create developments in the existing knowledge and support system for autistic people. However, there is still a great deal of stigma around autism that prevents people with autism from obtaining equal opportunities in the social, political, and economic constructs of society. So, here we take a step forward in removing the stigma of autism on this world autism day. What is Autism Spectrum Disorder? As the name suggests, Autism Spectrum Disorder is a collection of conditions related to the brain that leads to the exhibition of certain characteristics like obsession with some specific subjects, strong inclination towards routines, particular ways of sensing things, and definite interest in some objects. Signs of autism can be observed in children from an early stage. However, due to social stigma and sometimes, a lack of awareness around the condition, it largely remains undetected till a later stage. How Does Autism Affect People in their Daily Lives? [Autism Spectrum Disorder](https://www.nivabupa.com/health-insurance-articles/autism-spectrum-disorder.html) doesn't only affect people suffering from it, but also affects their families. It is because autistic people are unable to manage their daily tasks like showering, tying their shoelaces, learning things, identifying common objects, etc. Therefore, the families have to act as caregivers and help people with autism perform their daily tasks. It is also one of the reasons for stress among families having an autistic member. Let's understand how autism affects people in a bit more detail. - People with autism face trouble in forming social interactions. - They are overly obsessed with objects such as wheels. - Traditional ways of teaching and learning don't suit autistic people. They require specialised means of learning or non-traditional ways to learn. - They have their particular ways of comprehending the signals sent by their sensory organs. - They face problems processing complex forms of communication and speech. - Also, people with autism may not convey their feelings through facial expressions or change their expressions according to their mood. - People with autism often face challenges in occupying an equal position as other people without autism. - In times of humanitarian or medical emergency, autistic people are more vulnerable to danger due to inadequate information with health-care providers. Why is there a Stigma around Autism? Even though the world has entered the 21st century and narratives around things that were once considered taboo are changing, neurological disorders are still looked down upon. People, including medical professionals, often overlook the signs of autism in people. Autistic people are not treated with as much care as they should be. [Autism](https://www.nivabupa.com/health-insurance-articles/things-you-ought-to-know-about-autism.html) has such a negative image attached to it that even when people diagnose the existence of autism in their children, they refrain from seeking professional help in terms of treatment, care, or any other assistance. This leads to autistic people falling into a position of neglect and falling behind other people of their age. How to Help People with Autism on this World Autism Awareness Day, 2022? To break the stigma around autism and ensure equal opportunities at educational institutes and employment sectors, organisations need to step forward and begin initiatives to raise awareness about autism. Normalising the existence of neurological disorders is the first step toward achieving a fair space for autistic people. If you are someone who would like to contribute to this cause, here are some ways in which you can help people with autism on this world autism day. - Start a conversation in your circle about autism, its signs, and possible treatment. - If you know someone who has autism spectrum disorder, offer them help and check on them to see if they can manage their daily tasks. - If you are a part of an educational institute, make sure that people with autism obtain the special care that they need. It is very important to remember that some people with autism may live independently. But there is still a large group of autistic people who need special care and assistance to gain access to opportunities in their life. - If you are a working professional, start a dialogue about extending equal access to opportunities for people with autism. - Extend a helping hand to a family with an autistic member. You can take out some time to spend with the family and help them relieve their stress. You might also offer to take the autistic person out so that they can get some fresh air. People with autism may have trouble learning things like other people. But it doesn't mean that they lack something. With due care and specialised ways of teaching, we can help autistic people achieve their complete potential and carve an equal space for themselves in a personal as well as professional environment. As autistic people may need special care, it is best to buy a [health insurance plan](https://www.nivabupa.com/health-insurance-plans.html) and ensure a healthy life for them.
