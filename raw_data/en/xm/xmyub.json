It imparts every benefit of vitamin E, anywhere applied. It will help improve stretchmarks, scars, dark spots, crepe-sagging skin-dryness, itchiness, irritation and much more. The skincare benefits of Vitamin E are only found with the natural forms of vitamin E, like found in food. Synthetic vitamin E imparts little benefit because it is more of a chemical than a vitamin. Which is why we mix full spectrum (food extracted) tocotrienols, tocopherols with natural D alpha vitamin E and use a lot of it in every jar. Plus, the ratios of those ingredients are correct so you get maximum skincare benefits. Your body contains over 75 trillion cells that depend on vitamin E to protect their outer lipid-fat layer from damage. Without vitamin E protection that lipid layer will oxidize and cause cellular dysfunction and death. Creating many issues, none of which are good. Keeping your skin at optimal levels of vitamin E will improve any skin issues your dealing with and provide protection against any future ones that might occur. We invite you to try this product if you are not satisfied with the results simply return for a full refund. Made in the USA at our facility in Nashville Tn. Providing you skin with full spectrum vitamin E most are not getting from their diet has many benefits. The only way your body can deliver vitamin E to your skin is through your sebum oil. So, people with oily skin will have more vitamin E in their skin than others with dry skin. Topically applying vitamin E is the fastest most efficient way of elevating the vitamin E levels in your skin. The Synthetic vitamin E that is used in most cosmetic products, has very little benefit compared with for example the natural tocopherol found in wheat germ. Even better are the forms of vitamin E called tocotrienols. They are only found in certain foods and provide the most spectacular vitamin E benefits. We make this Megadose Vitamin E Body Butter with high levels of natural tocopherols and tocotrienols extracted from food, so they are in the most potent natural form. The ratios are important when using a mixture of tocopherols and tocotrienols. If it is not correct the tocopherols can reduce the benefits of the tocotrienols. Our blend has the correct ratios so when you apply this vitamin E body butter you get maximum vitamin E benefit. This product is especially effective for varicose veins, stretch marks, inflammation, rash, eczema. Directions: Apply a small amount and massage in as needed. Can be used head to toe. Ingredients: Shea butter, coco butter, natural D-alpha tocopherol (vitamin E), full spectrum tocotrienols and tocopherols (Vitamin E), grapeseed oil, brazil nut oil, baobab oil, proprietary oil extraction of (kakadu plum (natural vitamin C) gotu kola, frankincense and myrrh,) Indian sandalwood and bergamot essential oils.
