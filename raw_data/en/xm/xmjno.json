Monthly Tuesday meetings from 6:00-6:45 PM Upcoming meeting on September 26th, 2023 This group supports those who have been negatively effected by a difficult or traumatic childbirth experience. This realization may come weeks, months, or years after the birth of your baby. Here you can feel supported by others with similar experiences. We'll explore some of the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are common after a traumatic birth. You'll develop new coping skills so that you can get back to feeling like yourself again.
