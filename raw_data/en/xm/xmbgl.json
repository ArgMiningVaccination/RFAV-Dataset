This word list is not meant to be a substitute for professional medical care. The ICA recommends you consult your own physician regarding any course of treatment or medication. Any products or therapies described below should not be construed as recommended or endorsed by the ICA. Please click the first letter of the word, or scroll to Z acetylcholine A chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, prevalent in the central nervous system which plays an important role in the transmission of nerve impulses in the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls, among other things, the function of smooth muscles, including those of the bladder. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) acupressure A type of massage developed in ancient China in which pressure is applied with the fingers to specific acupuncture points along \"energy channels\" in order to stimulate the production of certain body chemicals which have the potential to relieve pain, stimulate other desired effects, and relax muscles. Some IC/BPS patients have found acupuncture and acupressure beneficial, although some who initially experience improvement have reported that the effects are not long-lasting. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) acupuncture The tradition of healing developed in ancient China in which needles are applied to designated points along energy channels to stimulate \"chi,\" defined as \"the life force,\" or \"energy.\" \"Needling\" of specific points has the potential to relieve pain through the stimulation of specific chemicals called endorphins, and to relax muscles. Some IC/BPS patients receive relief or a decrease in symptoms and often report an improvement in well-being, while others do not experience any or much improvement. Although acupuncture has been widely practiced in the US, it was only recently approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for general use. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) acute Used to describe the onset of symptoms, usually sudden, severe and intense. Acute pain is a warning from the body that something is wrong. The onset of IC/BPS symptoms is often acute, but symptoms may also develop slowly and gradually. See chronic. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) aerobic activity Physical exertion which raises the heart rate to a specified range, or \"target heart rate.\" In general, the \"target heart rate\" can be determined by taking 220, subtracting your age, and taking 80% of that figure. To derive maximum benefits, 20 to 30 minutes of aerobic activity five to six days a week should be the general goal. Three to four days a week is sufficient for maintenance. The benefits of aerobic exercise may include healthy weight loss, sounder sleep, a heightened sense of well being, lighter menstrual periods, improved circulation, possible lowering of cholesterol, and decreased risk of heart disease and osteoporosis, among many others. Any exercise that raises the heart rate to the \"target\" range will work, including swimming, water-walking, and low-impact aerobics. You should consult a physician before initiating a strenuous exercise program, and take a treadmill stress test if advisable to determine your safe target heart rate. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) afferent nerves Nerves that transmit sensory impulses from the skin, muscles, or organs inward to the spinal cord and brain. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) allergen A substance that can cause an allergic response in the body, but is only harmful to some people, whose immune systems may be hypersensitive.

[index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) This act of Congress prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment and in public services (except the US Government), public and private transportation, public accommodations and telecommunications services. As defined by this act, a disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of a person's major life activities. This Act applies to businesses with 15 or more employees. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) amino acids The building blocks of proteins in the body, as well as the products of protein breakdown. Twenty amino acids are necessary for normal metabolism and they are divided into two groups: non-essential amino acids that are produced by the body, and essential amino acids that must be obtained through the diet. L-arginine and l-tryptophan are examples of amino acids. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) analgesic A prescription or over-the-counter medication which relieves pain, ranging from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, known as NSAIDs (Motrin\u00ae, Anaprox\u00ae), aspirin (Anacin\u00ae, and other to opioids (morphine, codeine). [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) anesthesia Medications that bring about loss of sensation, especially the awareness of pain. Types of anesthetics include general, local, regional and topical. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) antiarrhythmics A class of medications generally used to treat heart arrhythmias, and currently being studied as a treatment for neuropathic pain. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) antibiotics Medications used to treat bacterial or microbial infections. Also referred to as antimicrobials. Antibiotics are used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, they are not considered an effective treatment for interstitial cystitis. Side effects can include nausea, rash, fever, fatigue, and overgrowth of yeast. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) antibodies Molecules produced by the immune system that attach themselves to foreign substances and incapacitate them. See immune response. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) anticholinergic A class of medications which blocks the passage of nerve impulses through the parasympathetic nervous system. Anticholinergic effects may include relaxation of the bladder and decreased intensity of bladder contractions, as well as dryness of mucous membranes, i.e. dry mouth, constipation. Examples of medications originally designed to treat epilepsy, anticonvulsants are now being used to treat other conditions, such as neuropathic pain. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) antihistamines Prescription or over-the-counter medications that counter the activity of histamine, a substance normally present in the body that causes irritation and inflammation when released from injured cells. See mast cells. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) antigen A substance, foreign to the body, usually a protein or carbohydrate, capable of producing an immune response. Antigens can cause allergic reactions in some people. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) antimicrobial medications Types of medications which kill or prevent the growth of microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria and fungi. Examples of these types of medications include antibiotics, antifungals, and antiviral preparations. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) antispasmodic medications Medications which decrease or eliminate muscle spasms. Examples of antispasmodics include Cystospaz\u00ae and Levsin\u00ae. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) cystoplasty (and supratrigonal cystectomy) In this surgical procedure, the top of the bladder is excised, leaving the base and the urethra, and a piece of bowel is attached and fashioned into a \"new\" bladder. Patients continue to void normally through the urethra. This procedure has largely been abandoned for treatment of IC/BPS, due to serious complications, i.e. it may not relieve the pain associated with IC/BPS; IC/BPS may appear on the bowel wall (the \"new\" bladder). It is also not recommended for IC/BPS patients who have intractable symptoms, yet have a good bladder capacity under anesthesia. See urinary diversion. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) autoimmune A condition in which the immune system produces antibodies against the body's own tissues, sometimes damaging the tissues and causing disease. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index)\"> autonomic nervous system The part of the nervous system that regulates involuntary bodily functions (functions not consciously controlled) such as heart rate, breathing and the G.I. (gastrointestinal) tract. The autonomic nervous system consists of two parts, the parasympathetic nervous system and the sympatethic nervous system. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) hyperplasia Enlargement of the prostate gland. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) benzodiazepines A group of medications used to treat anxiety and muscle spasms. These medications, including Xanax\u00ae, Valium\u00ae and Klonopin\u00ae, are sometimes prescribed for IC/BPS symptoms. Side effects include drowsiness and loss of coordination. A physician should monitor the use of these medications, as they may be habit-forming. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) bicarbonate A naturally occurring salt that is a constituent in many chemical compounds. In the form bicarbonate of soda, or baking soda, it serves as an antacid. Sodium bicarbonate raises the pH of urine and may temporarily relieve IC/BPS symptoms. Should not be used by patients on a salt-restricted diet. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) biofeedback A technique in which a person may learn how to exert conscious control over involuntary responses such as heart beat, blood pressure, skin temperature, breathing, etc. Responses may be monitored and progress can be recorded using electronic devices, computers, and video display terminals. Using biofeedback, some IC/BPS patients have learned to relax the pelvic floor muscles and hence, reduce painful muscle spasms. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) biopsy A diagnostic test in which samples of tissue are obtained for examination under a microscope. In bladder biopsies, which are performed under general or regional anesthesia, tissue samples are taken of the bladder wall using a long forceps. A biopsy of the bladder wall may be necessary to rule out other diseases such as bladder cancer (which is not associated with IC/BPS) and to assist in the diagnosis of IC/BPS. A bladder biopsy may also be required for participation in research studies. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) bladder The urinary bladder is a hollow sac that normally holds 12 to 16 ounces of urine at a time (its functional capacity), although it is capable of holding from 25 to 30 ounces (its true capacity). The bladder wall is composed of 1) a thin mucous membrane lining (mucin or the glycosaminoglycans or GAG layer); 2) an epithelial lining; 3) a layer of connective tissue; and 4) the outer muscular layer called the detrusor. Voiding is controlled by both voluntary and involuntary nerves and normally occurs every two to five hours. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) bladder cocktail A solution of a combination of medications that is infused into the bladder by means of a catheter. The bladder cocktail usually refers to a combination of DMSO, steroids, Marcaine\u00ae, sodium bicarbonate and heparin. This procedure is typically done in a doctor's office. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) bladder holding protocol See bladder retraining. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) bladder neck The place where the urethra joins the body of the bladder. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) bladder retraining program Also called \"bladder holding protocol.\" A technique which can decrease urinary urgency and frequency by holding urine for progressively longer intervals. The pain of IC/BPS must first be addressed before bladder retraining can be used successfully. After determining the shortest comfort interval between voids, the patient ignores the first urge to void and waits a set amount of time before voiding, for example, three to five minutes. After several weeks, the bladder nerves may become acclimated to the longer voiding interval, and the interval is lengthened. Over several months the comfort interval between voids can be lengthened substantially and some patients are even able to establish a \"normal\" voiding pattern. Bladder retraining can be done with the help of a therapist who is familiar with this regime, or can be done on your own. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) bladder-sphincter dyssynergy Lack of coordination between the urethral sphincter and bladder muscle which are under involuntary control. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) bradykinin A slow-acting but powerful peptide that promotes blood flow by widening blood vessels. Bradykinins also constrict smooth muscles, and stimulate pain receptors. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) Candida albicans A yeast normally found in the mucous membrane tissues of the mouth, G. I. tract, and vagina. An overgrowth in the vagina can cause itching, burning, and a whitish cottage cheese-like discharge which has the characteristic pungent odor of yeast. Normally, adequate levels of the lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria keep yeast growth under control. Too much yeast may also function as an allergen, and is thought to be a factor in a wide variety of illnesses, although this theory remains controversial in mainstream medicine. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) capsaicin The active ingredient in many hot peppers. Capsaicin bonds to specific receptors and releases potent neurotransmitters which initially cause irritation and pain, desensitization of the nerve fibers, resulting in a period of pain relief. Capsaicin has been instilled into the bladders of some IC/BPS patients on an experimental basis. Preliminary studies have not found capsaicin to be effective in treating IC/BPS symptoms. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) catecholamine One of the amines, or nitrogen-containing neurotransmitters in the body, including dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, which affects, among other things, the activity of smooth muscles, and may be increased by stress.

[index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) central nervous system (CNS) The brain and spinal cord [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) cholinergic Nerve endings which release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) chronic Chronic pain is lingering pain which serves no practical purpose. IC/BPS is considered to be a chronic condition, but may be acute in onset as well. Chronic pain persists over time. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS) A serious and complex illness that affects many different organ systems. It is characterized by incapacitating fatigue (experienced as profound exhaustion and extremely poor stamina), neurological problems and numerous other symptoms. CFIDS can be severely debilitating and can last for many years. CFIDS is often misdiagnosed and/or frequently unrecognized and can resemble other disorders including mononucleosis, multiple sclerosis (MS), fibromyalgia (FM), Lyme disease, post-polio syndrome and autoimmune diseases such as lupus. CFIDS is also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and myalgic encephalomyelitis (sodium oxychlorosene) Chemically related to household bleach, Clorpactin was an early intravesical treatment for IC/BPS and continues to be used on a limited basis, primarily for people who do not respond to DMSO or other therapies. Clorpactin exerts a detergent action on the bladder's lining, possibly destroying nerve endings. This treatment can be very painful and should be done under general anesthesia. It can, however, be diluted and instilled into the bladder as an in-office procedure. Initial symptom worsening is to be expected. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) collagen The fibrous protein that forms, among other things, the connective tissue.

A synthetic derivative of cortisol, hydrocortisone has very strong anti-inflammatory properties. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) cox - 2 inhibitor A new type of anti-inflammatory medication that works by blocking the inflammatory enzyme cyclo-oxygenase (cox), but does not appear to block the Cox - 1 enzyme that protects the stomach lining. Cox - 2 inhibitors are similar to NSAIDs in pain relieving properties. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) culture and sensitivity test A urine test that identifies the presence of bacteria in the urine and identifies the specific antibiotic(s) that can inhibit or prevent their growth.

[index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) generic Regarding medications, refers to formulations not protected by trademark. Generic formulations contain the same basic ingredients approved by the FDA, but may contain varying amounts of additives, filler, color, et cetera. When available, generic medications are generally less expensive than their trademarked counterparts. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) glomerulations Pinpoint hemorrhages found on the bladder wall of 90% of IC/BPS patients, which have become the hallmark of the non-ulcerative type of IC/BPS. Also known as petechial hemorrhages. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) The mucous membrane coating of the bladder wall, composed of complex sugar molecules (mucopolysaccharides), which, in the normal bladder, protect the deeper layers from bacteria and urinary toxins. Although the cause or causes of IC/BPS are not known, many researchers believe that IC/BPS is caused by a defect in this lining. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) hematuria Abnormal presence of blood or red blood cells in the urine. This blood can sometimes be detected visually, or by using a dip-stick test, or it may require microscopic observation. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) heparin A naturally occurring substance in the body that acts on cells to prevent clotting in the veins. The medication derived from heparin, heparin sodium, is a compound that has both anti-inflammatory and surface protectant properties. It is instilled into the bladder as a treatment for IC/BPS. Heparin sodium is thought to mimic the bladder's mucous lining, temporarily \"repairing\" the GAG lining. It can be used as a primary treatment method, or as a \"maintenance medication\" to supplement other types of treatment. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) histamine A normally occurring bodily substance which causes irritation and/or inflammation when released from mast cells.

Among their many functions, hormones help regulate metabolism, mediate behavior and responses to stress, facilitate resistance to disease, and promote growth and development, especially of the reproductive organs. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) hypothyroidism Decreased activity of the thyroid gland. Symptoms may include weight gain, sluggishness, dry skin, intolerance to cold, and slowing of bodily processes. Treatment includes prescribing oral dosages of the deficient hormone. Dosage is adjusted to stabilize thyroid hormone levels. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) Hunner's patch Originally described by Dr. Guy Hunner, an American urologist, in 1915 and characterized as \"ulcers\" on the bladder wall, these distinctive reddened patches typically have central ridges or scarring and may ooze blood. About five to ten percent of IC/BPS patients have Hunner's patches which denote the \"classic\" form of the disease. Also called Hunner's ulcers. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) hysterectomy Removal of the uterus, as well as the fallopian tubes, and ovaries. In subtotal hysterectomy, the cervix, the tip of the uterus that extends into the vagina, is preserved. In total hysterectomy the entire uterus is removed. Removal of one or both fallopian tubes is called salpingectomy. Removal of one or more ovaries is called ovariectomy or oophorectomy. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) hydrodistention A procedure used in the diagnosis and treatment of IC/BPS. Throughout the procedure, a cystoscope is used to observe the walls of the bladder. The bladder is filled with 60 to 80 centimeters of water for eight minutes while the patient is under general anesthesia. The water is then drained from the bladder. Typically, a bloody effluent (the fluid that flows out of the bladder) is seen. Next, the bladder is examined while an irrigant (water) expands the bladder.

[index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) l-arginine An amino acid that is available over-the-counter and has been studied as a possible treatment for interstitial cystitis. Researchers are Yale University found that nitric oxide synthase (NOS) - the enzyme that produces nitric oxide - was found to be lower in interstitial cystitis patients than in controls and much lower in interstitial cystitis patients than in patients with urinary tract infections. However, conflicting data from researchers in Stockholm, Sweden reported that above average levels of l-arginine are typically found in some inflammatory disorders, including IC/BPS. The Swedish research team found increased levels of nitric oxide in IC/BPS patients' bladders both before and after treatment with l-arginine. Recommended dose of L-arginine by researchers at Yale is 500mg three times daily for at least six months. The effect of this nitric oxide pathway should be to relax smooth muscle and decrease pain.

There are four basic prostatic conditions: (NBP), and prostatodynia. Precise diagnosis of these conditions can be difficult because the symptoms are similar. - Acute bacterial prostatitis A bacterial infection of the prostate gland. Symptoms of sudden onset include chills, fever, urinary urgency and frequency, and difficulty in urinating. Bacteria can be cultured from prostatic secretions and urine. - Chronic bacterial prostatitis Symptoms are similar to acute bacterial prostatitis, except that onset is gradual, may be fairly mild, and may wax and wane. Some men may be asymptomatic, that is, they may not have any symptoms at all, yet bacteria can be cultured from prostatic secretions and urine. - Non-bacterial or abacterial prostatitis In this condition, men may experience irritative voiding symptoms, and white blood cells in the urine, which is a sign of inflammation and may be seen in prostatic secretions, but no bacteria can be cultured. Some men who are diagnosed with this condition may actually have IC/BPS. - Prostatodynia Pain or discomfort in the prostate of unknown origin which may also be felt in the rectum, perineum, or bladder. Some men who are diagnosed with this condition may actually have IC/BPS. pseudoaddiction Can occur in chronic pain patients seeking adequate relief from their pain. This phenomenon may happen when a patient is under-prescribed pain medication, is then helped temporarily by the medication, and thus begins to horde the medication, seek out refills, multiple prescribers, etc. This is relief-seeking behavior, not addictive behavior. In reality, opioid abuse is rare in pain patients.

The body's immune system normally makes proteins called antibodies to protect the body against viruses, bacteria and other foreign materials. These foreign materials are called antigens. In an autoimmune disorder such as lupus, the immune system loses its ability to differentiate between foreign substances (antigens) and its own cells and tissues. The immune system then makes antibodies directed against \"self.\" These antibodies, called \"auto-antibodies,\" react with the \"self\" antigens to form immune complexes. The immune complexes build up in the tissues and can cause inflammation, injury, and pain. Lupus is considered a rheumatic disease.

[index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) tricyclic antidepressants A group of medications used to treat depression that have been found to increase the serotonin levels in the body. In addition to improving mood at higher dosages, low doses of these medications interfere with pain impulses and promote sleep. These medications are also anticholinergic, and may help some IC/BPS patients with frequency and bladder spasm problems. The tricyclic medication Elavil\u00ae (amitriptyline) has become one of the first-line treatments for IC/BPS symptoms. Other tricyclic antidepressants used and Pamelor\u00ae (nortriptyline). [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) trigger points Localized painful areas which develop in muscles and connective tissues due to chronic spasms, contractions, or overuse. Nerves stimulated by chronically contracted muscles can release potent neurotransmitters, causing hypersensitivity and pain. Trigger points have been identified in the vaginal areas of IC/BPS patients and in women with vulvodynia. Pain from trigger points can be reduced by a special form of massage called myofascial release. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) trigone The part of the bladder wall, shaped like an upside-down triangle, which contains the highest concentration of bladder nerves.

[index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) ureters The two thin, muscular tubes about nine inches long which transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder. They enter the bladder at the top of the trigone. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) urethra A small, tubular structure that enables urine to pass from the bladder out of the body. The female urethra is relatively short in length compared to the male urethra. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) urethral pressure profile (UPP) One of the urodynamics tests which measures the changes in urethral pressure, used to assess how well the urethra functions in maintaining continence. In this test, a catheter is inserted into the bladder and withdrawn at a steady rate, revealing the pressure within the urethra, and therefore, the ability to hold urine or to urinate. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) urethral syndrome A constellation of symptoms including urinary urgency, frequency and pain with urination. The diagnosis of urethral syndrome is controversial, and many urologists believe that this \"syndrome\" is really a mild form of IC/BPS.

Does not identify the type of bacteria. Urinalysis can also identify the pH of the urine, as well as the presence of red blood cells, protein, and glucose, etc. Urinalysis can identify that bacteria are present in the urine, but it does not indicate the type of bacteria. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) urinary diversion Surgical procedure in which urine is diverted away from the bladder by directing the ureters into a piece of bowel and out to the skin of the abdomen. Urine is then collected in an external bag. In a second type of diversion, an internal pouch is created from a segment of bowel. The ureters are connected to the new \"internal pouch.\" Pouches used include the Koch, Indiana and Florida Pouch. Urine collects in the pouch and is emptied via catheter four to six times a day. In both of these procedures, the bladder may be removed or left in place. An orthotopic diversion, where the bladder is removed and a new bladder, constructed from the bowel and connected to the urethra is left in its place, is being performed in selected centers. Patients can void through the normal urethral channel and not need a bag or a catheter. Urinary diversion may result in serious complications including infections and chronic kidney damage over 15 or 20 years [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) urinary tract All organs and ducts involved in the production, release and elimination of urine, i.e. the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) urodynamic tests Tests done in a urologist's office, intended to assess continence, or how well the bladder can hold urine. This series of tests includes cystometrogram, electromyography, residual urine test, uroflow, and voiding Also called uroflowmetry. One of the urodynamic tests which measures the amount of urine flow and the efficiency of the bladder in emptying. This test assesses urethral obstruction or other causes of inefficient bladder emptying.

[index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) One of the urodynamic tests, in which an X-ray of a full bladder reveals its shape and capacity, its ability to store and empty urine, residual urine, and the existence of ureteral reflux. This is an x-ray of the bladder and urethra which is performed as the patient voids. The study reveals the shape and capacity of the bladder, as well as its capacity to empty. It also enables the evaluation of the neck of the bladder and urethra during urination. VCUG is often performed in conjunction with urodynamic evaluation and is called videourodynamics (VUDS). [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) vulva The outer genitalia or external parts of the female genital organs. Consists of the labia, the opening of the vagina, and the various glands. [index](https://www.ichelp.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=546&frcrld=1#index) vulvodynia Chronic vulvar discomfort or pain characterized by complaints of burning, stinging, irritation or rawness of the female genitalia. Burning sensations are the most common, but vulvodynia pain is highly variable. The condition varies in persistence and location. Pain may be constant or intermittent, localized or diffuse. In many cases of vulvodynia, pain occurs spontaneously. Vulvodynia has also occasionally been referred to as pudendal neuralgia, or hypersensitivity, of the vulva. The four types of vulvodynia are described. Careful diagnostic evaluation is important in order to distinguish these conditions from each other and from others with similar symptoms and to choose the most effective treatment. - Vulvar vestibulitis - Inflammation around the \"vestibule,\" or opening to the vagina. This condition may occur alone or in combination with other types of vulvar pain. Symptoms of vulvar vestibulitis include sensations of burning, dry, raw, or tight skin, and may range from mild to severe. Pain is usually caused by external touch, or by pressure caused by intercourse, tampon insertion, tight pants, bicycling or horseback riding, for example. A few patients, however, may have symptoms without touch or pressure. Some patients with vulvar vestibulitis only have discomfort with intercourse. Others are uncomfortable on a daily basis and find it difficult to sit or walk. Some women cannot tolerate intercourse, but others can, although there is usually some degree of discomfort. Women with severe, enduring pain may develop vaginismus, a spasm of the pelvic floor muscles that makes intercourse or tampon insertion difficult or impossible. - Dysesthetic vulvodynia - Vulvar pain caused by irritated or inflamed nerves. Pain may encompass the inner labia, or may extend beyond the vulva to the anus or groin area, or down the inner thighs. Some women experience sharp pains or deep aching. This type is most common in post-menopausal women and women with fibromyalgia, and may also be seen with interstitial cystitis. - Cyclic vulvovaginitis - The yeast Candida normally inhabits the mouth, vagina, intestinal tract, and skin. If Candida overgrows in the vagina or on the vulva, it can cause itching, burning, inflammation, and swelling. Candida may affect the vulva without causing any obvious vaginal discharge. Skin may tear or split from swelling. The cause of chronic Candida is unknown, but various theories have suggested an allergy to yeast or fermented products, immune suppression, or some type of autoimmune response to yeast. Symptoms may flare around the time of menses (hence, \"cyclic\"). - Vulvar or mucous dermatoses - Skin disorders which occur on the vulva's membranes may cause chronic itching or burning. When scratched, these areas become inflamed, more irritated and hypersensitive, and can be caused, or made worse, by overuse of topical medications or frequent douching. This category includes several skin eruptions characterized by the term \"lichen,\" which merely describes a tough, scaly, or peeling appearance. The most common is lichen simplex, but lichen sclerosis and lichen planus are two "}
