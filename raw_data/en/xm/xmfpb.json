Pharmacist Summer is finally coming, bringing with it sunny days, a light breeze and a multitude of possibilities to take care of your well-being. At Soin & Nature, we are delighted to accompany you throughout this summer season and to offer you advice and [natural products](/en/1363-naturopathie) for optimal health. The sun is shining, the birds are singing and nature is in full bloom. This is the perfect time to enjoy the benefits of nature and incorporate healthy habits into your summer daily life. Whether you spend your days at the beach, hiking in the mountains or simply in your garden, here are some tips to make the most of this summer season by promoting your well-being naturally. The face, the expressive organ par excellence, and the body require special attention when it comes to sun protection. This need becomes even more pressing when the sun begins to deploy its rays with a more sustained intensity. Although it is an essential source of vitamins, including vitamin D, the sun is still a potentially dangerous opponent for our skin. Indeed, the harmful effects of the sun are multiple: premature appearance of wrinkles, accelerated aging of the epidermis, [superficial](/en/18393-dexerylspecific-gel-creme-brulure-coups-de-soleil.html) and deep burns. It is therefore essential to ward off our skin against these aggressions, and the use of lotions and [sunscreens](/en/16-soins-solaires-pharmacie) is an effective response to this challenge. These products, specifically designed to protect our epidermis, are able to defend us against UVA and UVB, ultraviolet rays from which no skin is immune. If the ordinary day cream is a precious ally in the daily protection of our skin against external aggressions, it is unfortunately helpless in the face of powerful solar radiation. For optimal protection, it is recommended to opt for a specific sunscreen for the face and sensitive areas, supplemented by [a sun mist](/en/15067-anthelios-spf50-brume-visage-invisible-75ml.html) dedicated to the rest of the body. When choosing your sun protection, the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) plays a crucial role. This varies (SPF 50, SPF 30 ...) and must be adapted according to your phototype, this classification that distinguishes individuals according to the reaction of their skin during sun exposure. For children, it is essential to choose a milk or [sun spray](/en/20647-uriage-bariesun-spf-50-spray-200-ml.html) specially formulated for their sensitive skin. Specific sunscreens for sensitive skin promote a harmonious tan and prevent unwanted skin reactions. If you are sensitive to the environmental impact of your consumption, turn to our organic solar products, designed with respect for nature The timeless charm of tanned skin attracts many sun lovers, who do not hesitate to expose themselves to its warm rays to obtain the golden complexion so desired. However, this quest for the perfect tan can often turn into a real ordeal for our skin if we neglect the threat of [photo-aging](/en/1348-anti-tache). Photo-aging, a phenomenon induced by prolonged and unprotected exposure to ultraviolet light, is a process that accelerates skin aging. It leads to the premature appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, the degradation of skin elasticity, and can even promote the development of pigment spots. This is where our [anti-wrinkle sunscreens](/en/18110-dermaceutic-sun-ceutic-creme-solaire-haute-protection-anti-age-50ml.html) come in. These innovative products combine both high protection against UVA and UVB and effective anti-aging action. They are a real advance in the field of sun care, allowing you to tan in complete serenity without fear of the harmful effects of photo-aging. These anti-wrinkle sunscreens are enriched with powerful active ingredients, with antioxidant properties, which fight against free radicals generated by sun exposure. They also promote the production of collagen and elastin, these proteins essential to maintain the suppleness and firmness of our skin. In this way, not only do they help prevent the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but they also help reduce the appearance of wrinkles already installed. [These sunscreens](/en/1429-tres-haute-protection-spf50) are available in several forms: milks, sprays or oils, to meet all preferences and needs. They adapt to all phototypes and offer different protection factors (SPF), for tailor-made protection according to your skin type and the level of sunshine. These sun care products offer a double promise: to allow a progressive and natural tan while preserving the youth of your skin. They embody a real technological breakthrough, the result of advanced scientific research in skin care, combining sun protection and anti-wrinkle action in the same product. Stop sacrificing the beauty and health of your skin on the altar of tanning. With our anti-wrinkle sunscreens, enjoy summer and the sun in complete serenity, without fear of photo-aging. Tanning is no longer a challenge for your skin, but a moment of pleasure, relaxation and well-being. In the heart of summer, another enemy, much smaller but just as harmful, appears: the mosquito. These small flying insects are a real nuisance and it is important to know how to choose your mosquito repellent. For this, several criteria must be taken into account: Thus, depending on these parameters, you will be able to effectively choose your mosquito repellent. The concentration of the active ingredient affects the effectiveness of the product, as well as the frequency and quality of application. To guard against the inconvenience of mosquito bites, day and night, the use of [skin repellents: ](/en/12958-spray-repulsif-naturel-anti-moustiques-phytosun-aroms-75ml.html)is strongly recommended. Three to four times a day, carefully distribute the repellent over your entire skin, without forgetting the smallest plot, because mosquitoes have the art of finding it. Repellents should always be applied after sunscreen, on exposed skin exposed and exposed to mosquito bites. Avoid applying repellent to children's hands to avoid contact with eyes and mouth. Protect yourself from mosquitoes during the summer by choosing the best mosquito repellent suitable for your situation. Preserve your comfort and fully enjoy the summer pleasures by avoiding these unwanted little flying insects.
