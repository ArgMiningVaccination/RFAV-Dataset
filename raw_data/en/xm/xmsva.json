Incidence by gender in 2014: 2 3,530 men 22,890 women Deaths by gender in 2014: 2 0,170 men 19,420 women Age: M ost patients are between age 65 and 80 at diagnosis Race: I n the US, African-Americans are more likely to develop PC than Caucasians4 Risk factors Tobacco smoking > 30% of PC cases are due to smoking Pancreatitis (5% of PC cases) F amilial >> Acquired Increasing age W eaker association: P ost-gastrectomy, post-cholecystectomy Diet: high fat intake, high meat intake Diabetes Industrial carcinogens Family History (5-10%) Familial What are the most common symptoms at diagnosis? p ain jaundice weight loss decreased appetite depressionnausea/vomiting blood clots itching fatigue new onset diabetes If it looks like pancreas cancer on a scan, why is a biopsy required? Because knowing the pathologic type of pancreas cancer determines treatment options Exocrine carcinoma indolent Pancreatic adenocarcinoma demonstrating a prominent desmoplastic stromal reaction 6 Staging pancreas cancer T he stage of a cancer refers to the extent of the disease at diagnosis Stage is one of the most important factors for deciding treatment options and determining a patient's prognosis Stage is determined by CT scan, endoscopic ultrasound, biopsy, and physical examination. Sometimes stage is determined at surgery What is the TNM staging system? T NM staging is a standard way to determine how much a cancer has spread The 3 elements are T, N, and M T: Indicates the size of the tumor in the pancreas a nd whether it has grown into nearby organs N: Indicates spread to lymph nodes M: Indicates spread to other organs -t he most common sites of spread are the liver, lungs, or abdominal cavity (peritoneum)7 TNM staging for pancreatic cancer Stage TNM Description IA T1N0M0Tumor 2 cm (T1), confined to pancreas. No spread to lymph nodes (N0). No distant spread (M0). IB T2N0M0Tumor >2 cm (T2), confined to pancreas. No spread to lymph nodes (N0). No distant spread (M0). IIA (to bile duct, peri-pancreatic tissues) but not into major blood vessels (T3). No spread to lymph nodes (N0). No distant spread (M0). IIB T1-3N1M0Tumor has spread to lymph nodes (N1). No distant spread (M0). III T4NAnyM0Tumor is growing outside the pancreas into nearby major blood vessels or nerves (T4). Lymph nodes may be involved (Any N). No distant spread (M0).

We look for targets with intriguing data in the laboratory Caveat: Promising preclinical data h as led to many disappointing results in patients A core set of 12 signaling pathways are genetically altered in most PC. Some of these pathways, or their downstream mediators, may be potential therapeutic targets Hidalgo, Pancreatology 2014; Jones, Science 200853 How do we select new drugs to test in PC patients? The choice of drug for a given clinical trial is u ltimately based on: Availability of agents for clinical testing against a target of interest Phase I single-agent and combination safety data W illingness of a drug company to test drugs in this disease Some types of drugs being evaluated for PC: Chemotherapy Cytotoxic chemotherapy: T hese drugs (such as gemcitabine) affect the DNA of the cancer cell in various ways -MM-398: A nano-liposomal irinotecan Drugs to enhance the uptake of chemotherapy into t he pancreas: -T hese agents target the dense stroma around the tumor that acts as a barrier to protect the cancer cells from chemotherapy -Hedgehog pathway inhibitors (worked in the lab, not in patients): GDC-0449, IPI-926 -Pegylated Hyaluronidase: PEGPH2054 Some types of drugs evaluated for PC: Targeted therapy Targeted therapy: T hese drugs (such as erlotinib) affect signaling pathways that turn cell growth on and off Many early trials were unsuccessful, likely because they were offered to unselected patients Targeted agents may be more effective in subsets of patients who have the specific abnormalities in their tumors that are targeted by those drugs -Targeting abnormal DNA damage repair in patients with BRCA 1 2 mutations PARP inhibitors: veliparib, high CRP Ruxolitinib Some types of drugs being evaluated for PC: Immunotherapy Immunotherapy V accines -Stimulate the immune system to attack the cancer GVAX/CRS-207 Immune checkpoint inhibitors -Take off the brakes in the immune system so that it can attack the cancer Several agents in early trials 55 Hopefully someday, these headlines will be for pancreatic cancer drugs Thank you for your participation.
