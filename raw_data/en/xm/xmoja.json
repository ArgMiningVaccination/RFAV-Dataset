It is a self-directed distance learning course based on the principal ideas of Rudolf Steiner, called Anthroposophy or Spiritual Science. Participants can begin any time and work at their own pace. Anthroposophy sheds light on understanding the physical, soul and spiritual aspects of the human being and its relationship to the other kingdoms of nature - from the soil, plants, animals, elements, ethers and right out to the cosmos. The EduCareDo Foundations in Anthroposophy year-long course provides the principals of anthroposophy through reading, experiments, artistic activities, meditative exercises and is supported by private communication with a tutor. The lessons raise new questions, and challenge and inspire participants to discover something new in the world and in themselves. These foundations are fundamental to understanding how to apply the methods that arise out of anthroposophy such as Waldorf Education, Biodynamic Agriculture and Anthroposophic Medicine. The course is the basis for many teacher trainings, parent education, health practitioner training and biodynamic apprenticeships. Lesson Plan Each lesson contains practical exercises and applications of the theme. Throughout the course of study, the participant is invited to consider and engage with new perspectives on health, nutrition, biography, the arts and sciences, gender and sexuality, social ecology, biodynamics, the natural world, and much more. [See the entire list of subjects by lesson ](/subjects-by-lesson) Participants may complete the course at their own speed and submit diary sheets and artistic renderings to their tutor to receive a Certificate of Completion.
