SCHOOL PHILOSOPHY 21 In harmony with Loma Linda University and the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the School of Nursing believes that the aim of education and health care is the development of wholeness in those served. Individuals, created to reflect the wholeness of God's char- acter, have been impaired by the entrance of sin, disease, and death. God's purpose is therestoration of each person to the original state at Creation. God works through human agen-cies to facilitate individual wholeness. Nursing functions to assist individuals and societal groups to attain their highest potential of wholeness. Through a variety of roles, nurses put into practice a body ofknowledge and a repertoire of skills to assist the human system with health problems.The School of Nursing provides an environment in which students and faculty can growin professional competence and Christian grace. PHILOSOPHY OF NURSING EDUCATION In support of the philosophy , mission, and values of Loma Linda University and the philosophy , mission, and values of the School of Nursing, the faculty affirms the following beliefs: Learning is an interactive process that involves all of the learner' s faculties. A learning environment nurtures the development of potential, promotes maturation of values, cultivates the ability to think critically and independently , and encourages a spir - it of inquiry. Clinical experiences are essential to the development of professional and technical nurs- ing competence. Students\u2014influenced by the effect of physiological, psychological, sociocultural, devel- opmental, and spiritual variables on their lives\u2014learn in different ways and bring differ-ent meanings to the learning experience. Students participate in development of the science and practice of nursing.

This deposit is refund-able, less any courier/mailing fees, under the fol-lowing circumstances: 1) during the student' s last quarter of enrollment at Loma Linda University, 2) when a visa is denied by a U.S. embassy or con-sulate, or 3) when a student terminates his/herprogram. United States immigration regulations require a prospective student to document his/her finan-cial resources for tuition, fees, and living expens-es. For international students, on-campusemployment is allowed but limited by visa regula-tions (e.g., for F-1 and J-1 students, employmentis limited to a maximum of twenty hours per weekwhile school is in session). Scholarships, assist-antships, and living stipends are rarely available at Loma Linda University because it is a small, pri- vate university (i.e., not supported by the U.S. orCalifornia state government but rather is churchsponsored). Employment plans require approvalby a designated school official (DSO) inInternational Student Services. VISAS F-1 student visa Loma Linda University is authorized by the United States Department of Homeland Securityto issue F-visa applications (i.e., I-20 forms). TheF-1 student visa is the visa of choice for mostinternational students coming to Loma LindaUniversity. This visa allows study(e.g., certificates, studies). Degree-earning study-load requirements andare allowed limited on-campus employment. TheI-20 is issued after a student has been acceptedinto a program, has paid the advance deposit, andhas documented his/her financial plan for the cho-sen program. Contact International StudentServices at 909 \\558-4955 for further information on F-1 student visas and the governing regula- tions.

Students are expected to respect the standards and ideals of theSeventh-day Adventist Church. Prospective students have the freedom to choose or reject University or School standards, but the decision must be made before enrollment.Application to and enrollment in the University constitute the student's commitment to honorand abide by the academic and social practices and regulations stated in announcements, bul-letins, handbooks, and other published materials; and to maintain a manner that is matureand compatible with the University's function as an institution of higher learning. It is inevitable that the student will come under question if academic performance is below standard; student duties are neglected; social conduct is unbecoming; or attitudes demonstratedeficiencies such as poor judgment, moral inadequacy , or other forms of immaturity. Procedures for evaluation of academic and nonacademic performance\u2014as well as for the student to exercise his/her right of appeal\u2014are described in each School's section of the Student Handbook .

Prospective students who have questions concerning the University' s expectations should seek specific information prior to enrollment.

Percentage breakdown for grading The undergraduate division of the School of Nursing uses the following percentages for com-puting grades: 94 -100% A 91 62% F NURSING COURSES Nursing course grades Most nursing courses in the undergraduate curriculum are divided into approximately equalcomponents of theory and clinical laboratorypractice. A grade for a nursing course represents acombination of the theory and the clinical labora - tory grades. In order to pass a nursing course, a student must receive a grade equivalent to a C orabove in both the theory and clinical laboratorysections of the course. A grade of C- or belowplaces the student on provisional status and thecourse must be repeated. Provisional status The student is referred to the ACADEMIC PRO- GRESSION section for the policy relating to provi - sional/probationary status. Class preparation Assignments are planned to require approxi - mately two to three hours of preparation by thestudent for each hour of class. Clinical laboratory Laboratory assignment is under the direction of the instructor. In this assignment the studenthas supervised experience in the care of patients.Tardiness or unexcused absences from clinicallaboratory is cause for failure. Absences due toextenuating circumstances (e.g., personal illnessor death in the family) must be made up. When aclinical laboratory is made up during nonclinicaltime, there is a $50 make-up fee. Attendance Attendance at class, clinical laboratory, and chapel is expected. Chapel attendance records arepart of the student' s permanent record. Clinical practice Nursing students are required to practice in client-care settings under the supervision of a reg-istered nurse. Each student will be expected to beable to apply basic theoretical concepts to clinicalACADEMIC POLICIES AND PRACTICES 3940 SCHOOL OF NURSING practice by assessing; planning; implementing nursing procedures; and evaluating the care ofindividuals, families, and communities. In the per-formance of routine nursing care, all students willfunction within the policies of the clinical agencyand demonstrate the professional behavior out - lined in the School of Nursing BULLETIN and University Student Handbook. Students are expected to be knowledgeable about clients and their problems and about theplans for care prior to actually giving care: Theymust come prepared for the clinical experienceand must adequately assess a client using theNeuman-Systems Model. Students are expected toperform skills safely. Students whose performanceis deemed unsafe may be dropped from the clini- cal course. Repeating a course Any nursing course or named cognate course taken while a student at Loma Linda UniversitySchool of Nursing in which the earned grade is C- or lower must be repeated before the student can progress to another course. Named cognates are:biochemistry, developmental psychology, epidemi-ology , ethics, nutrition, sociology , and statistics. When a student repeats a course, both the original and repeat grades are entered on the student's per-manent record; but only the repeat grade and cred - it are computed in the grade point average and included in the total units earned. Change of grade A grade may not be changed by the instructor except when an error has been made in comput-ing or recording the grade. Such changes areacceptable up to the end of the following term. SPECIAL COURSE WORK The following special course work is subject to approval by the appropriate offices in the School of Nursing.

Alleged student misconduct is subject to review by theSchool of Nursing to determine whether discipline isappropriate. Discipline may include dismissal. When a student fails to observe the University or School of Nursing policies or regulations that govern nonacademic and nonclinical general conduct, thefollowing discipline procedures are instituted: 1. Upon receipt by the associate dean or dean of a serious allegation of misconduct, a studentmay be suspended from the School, pendingand during the immediate investigation of theallegations. Suspension shall mean that thestudent may not attend class, meet clinicalappointments, attend campus events, or bepresent on campus without permission fromthe dean or designee. The process for evaluating alleged miscon- duct follows: 2. The individual alleging the misconduct files a written allegation with the dean or the associ - ate dean. 3. The dean or the associate dean then conducts an informal investigation. At the conclusionof this informal investigation, the dean or theassociate dean (or designee)\u2014 decides that the allegations lack a substan- tive basis for further investigation; or decides that there is a substantive basis to jus - tify continuing the investigation, and refers the matter to the Student Conduct Committee(which is made up of faculty who are mem - bers of the Student Affairs Committee). Student Conduct Committee If the case is referred to the Student Conduct Committee, the committee takes the following steps: 1. The associate dean or the dean provides the committee with the allegations of misconductand any other information pertaining to thealleged misconduct. 2. The Student Conduct Committee notifies the stu - dent in writing of the allegations and of the sup - porting information provided to the committee.3. The Student Conduct Committee interviews the student, as well as those bringing the alle-gations. The student may appear before thecommittee in the meeting room with a repre - sentative from the faculty of the School ofNursing but may not be accompanied by fam-ily, friends, or legal counsel. In addition, the committee may interview anyone else whom it determines can helpclarify the merits of the allegations.

School of Nursing students are expected to operate under the general policies ofthe University and School and the specific policies of the program in which they areenrolled. The School reserves the right to update and modify the curriculum to keep cur-rent with trends in health care. Undergraduate Program BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE ASSOCIA TE IN SCIENCE DEGREE OPTION The primary aim of the School of Nursing undergraduate nursing program is to pre- pare competent practitioners who are committed to excellence in practice and toChristian principles. The faculty believe that baccalaureate education in nursing is the basis for professional practice. However, in response to both societal and students'needs, an Associate in Science (A.S.) degree option is provided for students after theyhave completed all nursing and general education content necessary to prepare for licen - sure as a registered nurse in California. The basic professional curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in nursing is consistent with the faculty belief that students should be broadly educated. Thefocus is on the synthesis of nursing knowledge and skills with knowledge and skills fromthe humanities and sciences. Preparation for practice includes experiences in primary , secondary , and tertiary health care with clients from various age and cultural groups and socioeconomic strata. The curriculum is based on the Neuman Systems Model, which addresses stressors to the client system. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM SEQUENCE The undergraduate program begins with four quarters of preclinical work, which forms the general education and science base for nursing. These quarters may be completed atany accredited college or university. Following six quarters of clinical instruction and addi-tional general education and cognate courses at Loma Linda University School of Nursing,the student is eligible to receive the A.S. degree and is prepared to write the state boardexamination. After completion of another two quarters, the student is eligible to receive theB.S. degree and is prepared for professional nursing practice at the baccalaureate level. Theclinical experience develops the student's technical and theoretical capabilities in a progres-sive manner and within the context of the nursing process: assessment, analysis, planning,implementing, evaluating. Most of the baccalaureate nursing major is in the upper division,where clinical experience is gained in a broad variety of settings. Integral components ofupper-division courses are leadership concepts and skills, research, health promotion, andactivities which foster collaboration in planning health care with the family and all mem-bers of the health care team.

STANDARD (GENERIC) BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE PROGRAM [FOR STUDENT WITH NO NURSING DEGREE OR LICENSE] This is the usual program for students without pre- vious degrees or licenses in nursing. See page 48 for the complete sequence of courses. ASSOCIATE IN SCIENCE DEGREE (A.S.) PROGRAM OPTION [FOR STUDENT WORKING TOWARD AN RN AND A B.S. DEGREE] For the student who wishes to work as a registered nurse during the last two quarters of the generic B. S. degree program, an A.S. degree option is avail-able. The program is outlined on page 52. ACCELERATED BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE PROGRAM [FOR GENERIC STUDENT WITH NO NURSING DEGREE OR LICENSE] The student with a G.P.A. of at least 3.0 who has no provisional grades in the previous academic year and who has completed all cognate courses forhis or her level may request to accelerate throughthe nursing program if there is room in the desiredcourses. Any student in this intensive bachelor'sdegree track whose G.P .A. falls below 3.0 or whose grade in any course falls below a B during any quar- ter will be returned to the regular schedule (the stan - dard Bachelor of Science degree program) at thebeginning of the next quarter. INTENSIVE BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE PROGRAM; OR CERTIFICATE / TO MASTER'S [FOR STUDENT WITH (NON-NURSING) BACHELOR'S DEGREE] For students who have completed a B.S. or B.A. degree in a field other than nursing, there are two options. One option leads to a baccalaureate degreein nursing; the other option, to a certificate in nurs-ing that would prepare a student for entry into theGraduate Program in Nursing at Loma LindaUniversity . Applicants to either of these tracks should expect to carry very intensive academicloads. Because of this, students in these tracks mustmaintain a 3.0 G.P .A. each quarter . If a student' s G.P.A. falls below 3.0, the student will be moved tothe standard track. The baccalaureate degree option This option will lead to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in nursing.

In addition to these facilities, specialized libraries are located in various medical and school departments and other entities on campus. Central library The historical roots of the Del E. W ebb Memorial Library\u2014the central library of Loma Linda University\u2014goback to 1907, when a small library collection was startedin a room of the old Loma Linda Sanitarium. In 1953 thegrowing collection was moved to its own building on the Loma Linda campus. In 1981 a new library was built froma Del E. W ebb Foundation grant, giving the library a total floor space of 87,670 square feet. This structure nowhouses the main library, while the old structure is nowshared between the Department of Archives and Special Collections and the bound retrospective journals. As ofJune 2003, the library has a total collection of 353,019 books and bound journals; 165,856 print and electronic books; 8,211 current print and electronic journal titles;and 6,060 media items.
