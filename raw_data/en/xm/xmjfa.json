Read on to learn how chiropractic care benefits the immune system. [request an appointment](/appointments/) Immune System Treatment Treatment from a chiropractor is an effective method of boosting the immune system. CD4s are cells that compromise a significant portion of a person's immune system. In one study, doctors found that patients undergoing chiropractic procedures saw their CD4 numbers increase by 46%. In comparison, patients that belonged to the control group, and weren't given chiropractor care, only saw a 7.6% increase in their CD4. Long-Term Chiropractic Care Another study was performed on otherwise healthy individuals who had been receiving chiropractic care for five years. Those participants were found to have a stronger immune system than those who were not receiving chiropractic care by 200%. In comparison, the immune system of patients receiving chiropractic care was 400% more effective in keeping them healthy than the immune systems of cancer patients were. Those getting regular care from a chiropractor were found to have just as strong of an immune system in their later years of life. This proves the effects of chiropractic care on the immune system do not decline over time. Why Chiropractic Care Helps Chiropractic care primarily focuses on the spine, which is connected to the immune system. A misaligned spine can cause damage to anyone's immune system. When this happens, the immune system can't protect the human body. In most cases, a weakened system is caused by compressed nerve pathways. Many chiropractic techniques can be used to decompress the nerves, which can make the immune system stronger. Even as far back as 1918, chiropractic techniques had a demonstrated positive effect on the immune system of flu patients. Those stricken with the flu who were treated by a doctor and a chiropractor simultaneously were much more likely to recover. The death rate among those treated by both professionals was much lower than among those who only received medical care.
