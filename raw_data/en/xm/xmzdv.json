Use these baby-safe first aid tips to learn what to put on baby cuts to heal their delicate skin in no time. By Mona A. Gohara, M.D. Updated on July 27, 2023 Medically reviewed by Monika Goyal, M.D. No matter how diligently you watch over your baby, occasional accidents and injuries are bound to happen, especially as they get more mobile. In fact, as your little one explores their environment, it's pretty much guaranteed. These minor injuries, including cuts, scrapes, and bruises, often upset or worry parents, but a few small boo-boos are an inevitable part of childhood. As long as you administer baby-safe first aid and know what to put on baby cuts, they aren't likely to be dangerous or have long-lasting consequences. Here you'll find a step-by-step breakdown of how to treat minor cuts and scrapes and tips from experts on what to put on baby cuts to heal them fast. g-stockstudio/Shutterstock Apply Pressure Baby skin is very vascular, with lots of little blood vessels at the surface. This means baby cuts are likely to bleed, possibly heavily. \"Hold firm pressure directly over the area for 15 minutes with a clean cloth,\" says Kristina Collins, MD, a dermatologist in Austin, Texas. If the bleeding does not stop at that point, contact a healthcare provider for further guidance. Cleanse the Cut First, clean your own hands, and then clean your baby's cut. Allison Hanlon, MD, PhD, a dermatologist at Vanderbilt University's Department of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, recommends gently washing the area with a non-fragranced soap or non-soap cleanser and water. Avoid scrubbing. Let the water run over the cut to clear out any dirt. If debris remains in the cut after this process, consider a trip to a health care provider to get it looked at and fully cleaned out. Dr. Hanlon advises against cleaning cuts with hydrogen peroxide: \"There is a misconception that applying hydrogen peroxide will prevent infection and aid in wound healing. Hydrogen peroxide can actually be toxic to the healthy cells needed for the wound to heal.\" 12 First-Aid Tips for Common Kid Injuries Skip the Antibiotics Many parents wonder what to put on baby cuts to promote healing and prevent infection. However, you may not need to put anything on your baby's cut except a bandage or a dab of lubricating ointment. \"Antibiotic ointments and sprays are popular for wound care, but they're not necessary for clean wounds,\" explains Dr. Hanlon. \"Studies have shown that in surgical wounds treated with petrolatum or topical antibiotics, there was no difference in infection rates.\" (Petrolatum is another word for petroleum jelly.) Over-the-counter topical antibiotic ointments have other downsides as well: First, they commonly cause allergic contact dermatitis (a red itchy rash) in children. Second, unnecessary use can contribute to the growing problem of drug-resistant bacteria. So, what should you do? Skip the meds and focus on keeping the cut clean. Then, watch for signs of infection. Signs include \"increased tenderness and drainage or redness tracking away from the wound, usually occurring a few days after the cut or scrape,\" says Dr. Hanlon. \"If the site shows signs of infection, notify your pediatrician or dermatologist for further evaluation.\" How to Stock Your Medicine Cabinet Like a Pediatrician Lubricate the Wound When thinking about what to put on your baby's cut, the important thing is to keep it moist. \"It is definitely a myth that the wound should be allowed to air or scab,\" says Dr. Collins. Research has shown that keeping a scrape well lubricated\u2014not dry\u2014actually speeds up and promotes wound healing\u2014and reduces scarring. To keep your baby's cut lubricated, Dr. Hanlon likes to apply a thin layer of white petrolatum ointment one to two times a day with dressing changes until the skin has closed. Keeping the wound wet will also prevent anything (such as a bandage or clothing) from sticking to the healing skin. Apply a Bandage Getting a colorful bandage can help quell the trauma of a cut for a young child. However, bandages can be a choking hazard in babies under the age of 1, especially if the cut is on their fingers. Alternatives include non-stick covers such as Telfa (which is readily accessible at your local drugstore), paper tape, and liquid bandage. When to Call the Doctor While most baby cuts and scraps can be dealt with at home, some wounds warrant consultation with a health care provider. Call a doctor if the cut is:Bleeding heavily or doesn't stop bleeding after 15 minutes of pressureCaused by a puncture from a dirty or rusty itemDeep, longer than 1 inch, or has jagged edges that don't close easilyExcessively painful for your babyEmbedded with dirt or other debris that you can't removeOn the face or eye areaShowing signs of infection, such as redness, warmth, swelling, or excess drainageAdditionally, if you have any other concerns about your child's wound, consult with a medical professional. Prevent Scars As the cut begins to resolve, the area can turn pink, purple, or even brown. This discoloration, called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, generally goes away after a few weeks or months and represents an expected response to skin injury. You can ward off this post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation by applying a broad spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen containing titanium dioxide or zinc oxide every two hours when the healed, closed wound is exposed to sunlight. (Ultraviolet light can make skin discoloration last longer.) If your little one develops a scar, it will likely be there to stay though it may fade over time and will appear smaller as they grow. These permanent marks can be either flat or thickened like keloids. In general, you should worry more about scarring with a deeper cut. \"Scrapes or cuts that are on the top layer of skin usually do not heal with a scar,\" says Dr. Hanlon says. \"Wounds that penetrate the deeper layers of skin may result in scarring.\" To promote healing and reduce scarring, Anthony Rossi, MD, a dermatologic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York City, likes a prescription cream called Biafine. It has alginate, a natural wound dressing derived from different types of algae and seaweeds, which speeds up healing. Dr. Collins also suggests silicone strips to reduce the thickness and appearance of scars.
