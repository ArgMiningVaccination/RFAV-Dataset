THE SUNRISE REVIEW PROCESS A sunrise review is an evaluation of a proposal to change the laws regulating health professions in Washington. The Washington State L egislature's intent, as stated in c hapter 18.120 RCW, is to permit all qualified people to provide health service s unless there is an overwhelming need for the state to protect the interests of the public by restricting entry into the profession. Changes to the scope of practice should benefit the public. The Sunrise Act ( RCW 18.120.010) says a health care professio n should be regulated or scope of practice expanded only when: Unregulated practice can clearly harm or endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public, and the potential for the harm is easily recognizable and not remote or dependent upon tenuous arg ument; The public needs and can reasonably be expected to benefit from an assurance of initial and continuing professional ability; and The public cannot be effectively protected by other means in a more cost -beneficial manner. If the legislature identifies a need and finds it necessary to regulate a health profession not previously regulated, it should select the least restrictive alternative method of regulation, consistent with the public interest. Five types of regulation may be considered as set forth in RCW 18.120.010(3): 1. Stricter civil actions and criminal prosecutions. To be used when existing c ommon law, statutory civil actions , and criminal prohibitions are not sufficient to eradicate existing harm. 2. Inspection requirements . A process enabling an appropriate state agency to enforce violations by injunctive relief in court, including, but not limited to, regulation of the business activity providing the service rather than the employees of the business, when a service being performed for people involves a hazard to the public health, safety or welfare. 3. Registration. A process by which the state maintains an official roster of names and addresses of the practitioners in a given profession. The roster contains the location, nature and operation of the health care activity practices and, if required, a description of the service provided. A registered person is subject to the Uniform Disciplinary Act (c hapter 18.130 RCW ). 4. Certification . A voluntary process by which the state grants recognition to a person who has met certain qualifications. Non -certified people may perform the same tasks, but may not use \"certified\" in the title . 1 A certified person is subject to the Uniform Disciplinary Act. 5. Licensure. A method of regulation by which the state grants per mission to engage in a health care profession only to people who meet predetermined qualifications. Licensure protects the scope of practice and the title. A licensed person is subject to the Uniform Disciplinary Act. 1 Although the law defines certification as voluntary, many health care professions have a mandatory certification requirement such as nursing assistants -certified, home care aides, and pharmacy technicians.

Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Background and Proposal Naturopaths have been licensed to practice naturopathy or naturopathic medicine in Washington since 1987 under chapter 18.36A RCW.2 The Naturopathic Advisory Committee was under the authority of the secretary of the Department of H ealth (department) until 2011. At that time, the legislature replaced the advisory committee with the Board of Naturopathy (board) and transferred licensing and disciplining authority from the secretary to the board.3 Prior to 1987, naturopaths were regulated under the D rugless H ealing statute (chapter 18.36 RCW) to practice \"drugless therapeutics .\" The original naturopathic scope of practice excluded the us e 4 of legend drugs5 with the exception of vitamins, minerals, whole gland thyroid, and substances included in traditional botanical and herbal pharmacopoeia. N on-drug contraceptive devices were allowed, except for intrauterine devices. Intra muscular injections were limited to vitamin B -12 preparations and combinations for indication of B-12 deficiency. The use of controlled substances was specifically prohibited. The scope of practice was amended in 2005 to expand prescriptive authority for naturopaths . The current prescri ptive authority is limited to \"those legend drugs and controlled substances consistent with naturopathic medical practice in accordance with rules established by the board\"6 and include s: Legend drugs under WAC 246- 836-210, exclud ing botulinum t oxin and inert substances for cosmetic purposes ; and Controlled substances , limited in RCW to codeine products7 and testosterone products8 contained in S V of chapter 69.50 RCW. WAC 246- 836-211 require s a naturopath to be approved by the board before being authorized to prescribe, dispense, or order the approved controlled substances . On April 24, 2014, Representative Eileen Cody, c hair of the House Health Care and Wellness Committee, requested that the department consider a sunrise application. The request was to review a proposal \"that would allow naturopaths to prescribe legend drugs and controlled substances contained in Schedules II through V of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act \" and included draft bill H -4573.4, a n act relating to prescriptive authority of naturopaths (Appendix A ). The draft bill removes the limitation on controlled substances in RCW 18.36A.020(10) , and amends the practice of naturopathic medicine in RCW 18.36A.040(2) to incl ude \" legend drugs and controlled substances contained in Schedules II through V of the uniform controlled substances act, chapter 69.50 RCW, necessary in the practice of naturopathy.\" 2 Naturopaths were originally regulated under the Department of Licensing and moved to the Department of He alth when it was created in 1991 (Chapter 3, laws of 1991). 3 Chapter 41, laws of 2011. 4 \"Use\" means prescribing, administering, or dispensing. 5 Legend drugs are required to be dispensed on prescription only or are restricted to use by practitioners (RCW 69.41.010). 6 Changed in 2011 from \"rules established by the secretary\" by Chapter 41, Laws of 2011. 7 For example, Tylenol #3 (acetaminophen with codeine ) or expectorant codeine . 8 Male hormone supplements , products to treat low testosterone levels. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 3 On May 30, 2014, the Washington Association of Naturopathic Physicians (WANP , applicant ) submitted its applicant report to assess the criteria required in chapter 18.120 RCW ( Appendix B ). The applicant suggests the following changes to draft bill H -4573.4: A section requiring the board to adopt pain management rules that conform with HB 2876 (chapter 209, laws of 2010); and Amendments to the proposed changes to RCW 69.41.030(1) to add \" a naturopathic physician under chapter 18.36A RCW when authorized by the board of naturopathy \" and to RCW 69.45.010(12) \" a naturopathic phy sician under chapter 18.36A RCW when authorized to prescribe by the board of naturopathy...\" In subsequent follow up at the public hearing and in written correspondence, the applicant indicated the desire to include additional changes in the draft bill, such as inclusion in the prescription monitoring program, a one- time addition of eight hours of supplemental education and training focused on controlled substances in Schedules II -V, and 10 additional hours annually of continuing education in pharmacology . RECOMMENDATION The department doesn't support the proposal to expand the prescriptive authority of n aturopaths to include all Schedule II -V controlled substances without limitations . Rationale: The applicant has not demonstrated problems with the current prescriptive authority that would justify unlimited expan sion of the naturopathic prescriptive authority for controlled substances. Unlimited prescriptive authority isn't necessary for naturopaths to practice as primary care physicians under Medicaid. Referrals for controlled substances are often necessary, especially in long -term opioid therapy, to ensure the most qualified health care professionals are prescribing these substances, which are controlled because of their significant risks to public health due to overdose, abuse and misuse. The applicant hasn't demonstrated that naturopaths receive adequate education in clinical pharmacotherapy of prescribing opioid, antianxiety, sedative, hypnot ics, and amphetamine substances to treat various disease states to safely pr escribe controlled substances. The department doesn't see a benefit to increas ing access without limitation to prescription opioid pain medications included in this proposal because: o Prescription opioid related overdoses and deaths have reached epidemic levels. o Data has shown a correlation between the rise in overdose deaths and states that have expanded prescription access to prescribed opioids. o The state is currently engaged in i ntensive and effective efforts to curb the overuse of opioids in Washington. Granting unlimited prescribing authority for controlled substances is contrary to these efforts. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 4 Although the department doesn't support unlimited expansion of prescriptive authority, the sunrise review process surfaced new information and perspectives that the legislature should consider. Notably , the HCA has provided the following arguments in support of a limited expansion of naturopathic prescriptive authority , with which the department agrees : The HCA recognizes the potential benefit of more convenient and comprehensive health care of clients whose primary care provide r is a naturopath . Naturopaths currently have a narrower range of prescriptive authority than other designated primary care providers in Washington. It is likely that patients with acute non -life or limb -threatening injuries will seek care in their places of practice, and there is a s ubset of the population for whom codeine is not effective and/or not tolerated. The HCA agrees with the applicant that e xpanded Medicaid coverage is expected to include an expanded demographic of patients with medical conditions requiring controlled substa nces in the naturopathic primary care setting. Deaths related to prescription opioids have occurred almost without exception i n patients on chronic therapy. Short -term treatment of acute conditions with controlled substances is considered safer. Limited prescriptive authority may reduce the number of unnecessary emergency department visits. In addition, Bastyr University has indicated a willingness to develop and offer a continuing medical education program on controlled substances to address deficiencie s in core training, and has offered assistance in developing necessary educational requiremen ts. Should the legislature consider exploring expanded prescriptive authority for naturopaths , the department recommends: Limiting prescriptive authority to contr olled substances in Schedule III -V 9, and hydrocodone products in Schedule II.10 All other Schedule II controlled substances should be prohibited. Limiting controlled substance prescriptions to no more than seven days when treating a particular patient for a single trauma, episode, or condition or for pain associated with or related to the trauma, episode, or condition. Maximum dosage of 120 milligrams morphine equivalent dose (MED) per day . 11 9 This would include Tramadol, which naturopaths had prescriptive authority to prescribe as a legend drug until the FDA recently reclassified it as a Schedule IV controlled substance. 10 Hydrocodone products are short -acting opioids, wh ich meet the HCA's stated goal of providing naturopaths an additional tool to treat acute pain. These products were rescheduled from Schedule III to Schedule II in October of 2014. 11 Morphine equivalent dose means a conversion of various opioids to a morph ine equivalent dose by the use of accepted conversion tables. 120 MED is the mandatory consultation threshold for adult patient s set in the administrative codes of p roviders with full prescriptive authority (as required in Chapter 209, Laws of 2010) . Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 5 Authorization for the Board of Naturopathy, in consultation with the Pharmacy Quality Assurance Commission, to undergo rulemaking to determine appropriate training and education . Requiring the board to adopt pain management rules appropriate for acute pain treatment, including, but not limited to, patient examination and screening for comorbidities and risk factors. Requiring naturopaths with prescriptive authority for controlled substances to register in the Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) 12 database to access patient prescription history. 12 The PMP is a secure online database that collects data on Schedul es II-V controlled substances. Prescribers are authorized to access PMP data before prescribing or dispensing drugs to look for duplicate prescribing, possible misuse, drug interactions, and other potential concerns (chapter 70.225 RCW). Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 6 SUMMARY OF INFORMATON Background Naturopaths have been licensed to practice naturopathy or naturopathic medicine in Washington since 1987 under chapter 18.36A RCW . The Naturopathic Advisory Committee was under the authority of the secretary of the department until 2011. At that time, the legislature replaced the advisory committee with the Board of Naturopathy (board) and transferred licensing and disciplining authority from the secretary to the board.13 Prior to 1987, naturopaths were regulated under the Drugless H ealing law (chapter 18.36 RCW) to practice \"drugless therapeutics .\" The original naturopathic scope of practice excluded the use of legend drugs with the exception of vitamins, minerals, whole gland thyroid, and substances as exemplified in traditional botanical and herbal pharmacopoeia, and non- drug contraceptive devices excluding intr auterine devices. Intramuscular injections were limited to vitamin B -12 preparations and combinations for indication of B-12 deficiency. The use of controlled substan ces was specifically prohibited. The naturopath's scope of practice was amended in 2005 to expand the prescriptive authority. The current prescriptive authority is limited to \"those legend drugs and controlled substances consistent with naturopathic medical practice in accordance with rules established by the board\" 14 and include s: Legend drugs under WAC 246- 836-210, exclud ing botulinum t oxin and inert substances for cosmetic purposes ; and Controlled substances , limited to codeine and testosterone products contained in S chedules III, IV, and V of chapter 69.50 RCW. WAC 246- 836-211 requires naturopaths to be approved by the board before they are authorized to prescribe, dispense, or order controlled codeine and testosterone products .15 As of November 1, 2014, there were 1,215 naturopaths licensed in Washington. 16 Requirements for licensure under RCW 18.36A.090 and WAC 246- 836-150 include successful completion of a board- approved doctora l degree program in naturopathy (at least 3,000 hours of instruction) and passage of the basic science, clinical science, and minor surgery portions of the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination . The board has approved seven schools i n the United States and Canada that are accredited by the Council on Naturopa thic Medical Education. The Council on Naturopathic Medical Education has stricter standards than Washington law, including that the program be a minimum of 4,100 hours, with at least 1,200 hours devoted to clinical training. Proposal for Sunrise Review On April 24, 2014, Representative Eileen Cody, c hair of the House Health Care and Wellness Committe e, requested the department consider a sunrise application. The request was to review a proposal \"that would allow naturopaths to prescribe legend drugs and controlled substances contained in Schedules II through V of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act \" and included draft bill H -4573.4, a n act relating to prescriptive authority of naturopaths (Appendix A ). The draft bill 13 Chapter 41, laws of 2011. 14 Changed in 2011 from \"rules established by the secretary\" 15 Naturopathic physicians must sign an attestation of completion of at least four hours of graduate -level instruction in specific pharmacology topics before being granted this limited prescriptive authority. 16 Department of Health Integrated Licensing and Regulatory System. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 7 amends the practice of naturopathic medicine in RCW 18.36A.040(2) to include \" legend drugs and controlled substances contained in Schedules II through V of the uniform controlled substances act, chapter 69.50 RCW, necessary in the practice of naturopathy.\" On May 30, 2014, the applicant submitted its applicant report to assess the criteria required in chapter 18.120 RCW (Appendix B) . The applicant suggests the following changes to draft bill H - 4573.4: A pain management section that conforms with HB 2876 (chapter 209, laws of 2010); and Amendments to the proposed changes to RCW 69.41.030(1) to add \" a naturopathic physician under chapter 18.36A RCW when authorized by the board of naturopathy \" and to RCW 69.45.010(12) \" a naturopathic physician under chapter 18.36A RCW when author ized to prescribe by the board of naturopathy...\" At the public hearing and in written correspondence, the applicant indicated the desire to include additional changes to its proposal , such as inclusion in the prescri ption monitoring program , eight additional hours of supplemental education and training focused on controll ed substances in Schedules II -V, and addition of 10 hours of continuing education in pharmacology. Public Participation and Hearing The dep artment received the request from the legislature to conduct this sunrise review on April 24, 2014, and received the applicant report on May 30, 2014. On June 9, 2014, the department posted the proposal and all applicant materials to the sunrise web page and notified interested parties of the public hearing scheduled for July 17 , 2014. Written comments were accepted until the conclusion of the public hearing, with an additional comment period for follow up after the hearing. At the hearing, the applicant presented the sunrise proposal and responded to que stions from the hearing panel. The applicant presenters included Robert May, ND , from W ashington A ssociation of Naturopathic P hysicians ; Jane Guiltinan, ND, dean of the Naturopathic Program at Bastyr University ; and Chris Krumm, ND, from HealthPoint (communi ty health organization) . Dr. May testified that he recognizes the draft legislation from Representative Cody does not include requirements for rulemaking on education and training necessary for expanding prescriptive authority to include controlled substances. He stated he wanted it to be very clear that WANP intends to ask the legislature to include education and training necessary to ensure public safety and optimal care by naturopaths who wish to have this ex panded prescriptive authority. He also indicated he intends to request amendments to bring the bill into conformity with the Controlled Substances Act and to include a requirement for pain management rules similar to those in place for other prescribers . He added that naturopath physici ans have been safely prescribing legend drugs and limited controlled substances (testosterone and codeine products) since 2005. Dr. Guiltinan provided information on Bastyr's four -year doctoral residen cy program (see page 16 under Pharmacology Training for details provided at the hearing). S he also a ddressed questions about naturopathic residencies , stating they are optional at this time . Bastyr offers the largest number of opportunities wit h 25 residency slots per year. She also stated there is a requirem ent for 20 hours per year of continuing education. Dr. Guiltinan indicated support of rulemaking to identify where additional education and training requirements would be Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 8 appropriate for naturopaths . However, Dr. Guiltinan stated that if the proposal were enacted by the legislature, she does not think Bastyr would add hours t o the current training but would adjust the existing pharmacology hours to incorporate controlled substance training. During the rebuttal period, Dr. Guiltinan revised her statements and indicated Bastyr would be \" willing to develop and offer a continuing medical educational program on controlled substances... that could address any current deficiencies in core training...\" ( see summary of rebut tals on page 33 and Appendix F). Dr. Krumm gave some background on HealthPoint, which is a large , multi- center , community health organization that serves primarily low -income and underserved King County patients . HealthPoint is an important provider of Medicaid services. Many of HealthPoint's patients struggle with additional physical, mental and psychosocial stressors that complicate their care. He shared one recent example where a patient needed pain medication, but the prescription was delayed because Dr. Krumm wasn't authorized to write a controlled substance prescription; instead, he had to refer the patient to another doctor . He also discussed how reduction in dual utilization and time spent consulting unnecessarily within a busy primary care practice would be better for t he patients. All three applicant presenters responded to questions from the department hearing panel regarding the proposal. (See A ppendix C for summary of hearing ). In addition, three members of the public testified at the hearing. One testified i n support of the proposal and two in opposition. We received 14 letters in s upport of the proposal from naturopaths and other health care providers , including allopathic physicians advanced registered nurse practitioners ( ARNPs ), and osteopathic physicians . We received 15 letters in opposition to the proposal from organizations , including the Washington State Medical Association that was undersigned by a number of organizations representing physicians in various specialties ; Washington Osteopathic Medical Association; Washington Academy of Family Physicians; Providence Health and Services; Washington State Medical Quality Assurance Commission; an d other health care providers. We received three letters offering co mments from t he Association of Washington Health Plans (AWHP) , Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA) , and the W ashington East Asian Medicine Association) . (See Appendix D for written comments received) . The following themes were found in the written and oral public comments we received during our review. Themes in support of proposal Naturopaths have been practicing safely with their current prescriptive authority . Patients would benefit from increased authority in the primary care setting , including continuity of care and avoid dual utilization of providers. This change is needed for naturopaths to fully partic ipate as primary care providers in response to the g rowing shortage. Oregon already has broad controlled substance prescriptive authority , and naturopaths are practicing safely there. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 9 Naturopaths have adequate training for this increase in prescriptive authority. A federally funded organization that employs naturopaths as par t of a multi- disciplinary team t hat serves M edicaid patients and uninsured patients stated that the naturopaths it employs are competent and compassionate , and expansion of prescriptive authority would improve services to patients. It would also reduce unnecessary visits and time spent consulting that drains res ources and costs money. An advanced registered nurse practitioner wrote to state she has worked with naturopaths in an integrated medicine clinic and has sometimes collaborate d with the na turopaths in her clinic to have patients referred to her for prescriptions outside of the naturopath's authority. She wrote that the referrals were always appropriate and warranted. Themes in opposition to proposal The fundamental teaching of naturopaths is rooted in the belief that it is an alternative approach to traditional medicine . Naturopaths have their place in the health care system as providers with a philosophy that seeks to restore and maintain optimum health by emphasizing nature's inherent self - healing process. According to the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, this is accomplished through education and the rational use of natural therapeutics . Expanding prescriptive authority for controlled substances will add to the problem of over-prescribing that has led to the epidemic of overdose deaths in Washington. Expanding prescriptive authority to include controlled substances is not in the best interest of the public and will not increase acces s to care in a meaningful way. There will be negative consequences from the proposal , pos ing a public threat because naturopaths lack training in clinical pharmacology, as well as practical knowledge of drug effects. Medical doctors seek to master this throughout their careers, not just through c ontinuing medical education. Medical and osteopathic doctors have substantially more pharmacology training, including the additional years of residency training. Granting providers with less training the authority to prescribe dangerous controlled substanc es is unnecessary and contrary to the intent of pain management legislation such as ESHB 2876 (Chapter 209, Laws of 2010). Designation as a primary care provider i s an insufficient argument to support this expansion. Other The Association of Washington Health Plans stated the following: The applicant should be required to provide details about naturopathic educational curriculum, particularly in relation to controlled substances and dealing with addi ction. Because of t he prescription drug abuse epidemic and high rate of opioid deaths, the department should exercise significant caution in extending prescriptive authority for these substances without ensuring appropriate training and education. Consider i nclusion of specific tr aining on acute and long -term chronic pain management, starting with W ashington S tate M edical A ssociation 's practitioner education on this topic. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 10 The applicant should be required to provide information on the frequency of occurrenc es where naturopaths must refer patients for controlled substance prescriptions since that was used to define the problem. The HCA stated it recognizes the potential benefit of more convenient and comprehensive health care of clients whose primary care provider is a naturopath if appropriate pharmacology education and training are clearly defined. It initially recommended a one -year residency requirement, but when the HCA found out the rarity of naturopathic residencies and reviewed the supplemental education requirements submitted by the applicant, had less concern about the adequac y of naturopath pharmacology training. The HCA recommends expanding prescriptive authority for naturopaths for controlled substances limited to treatment of acute conditions for a limited amount of time. It states this will reduce disruption in treatment and may reduce the number of unnecessary emergency department visits. Washington E ast A sian Medicine A ssociation sent a letter with a concern that is outside the scope of this sunrise review. It was regarding citations the applicant submi tted with its applicant materials so we are including the comment . The reference was to a Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) definition regarding coverage of health practitioners not covered by another classification who diagnose, treat, and care for patients (WAC 296- 17A-6109) . L&I included acupuncture in the list of remedies these naturopaths may use. The association requested to go on record in this report to state that acupuncture is not within the natu ropathic scope of practice. Applicant's Definition of the Problem and Proposed Solution The applicant relies heavily on the fact that naturopaths have been designated as primary care providers in several sections of law and rule. In defining the problem, it has state d the current limitation on prescriptive authority interferes with naturopaths' ability to provide the whole spectrum of primary care to their patients. The need for referral to other providers disrupts continuity and coordination of care and results in dual utilization and increased costs to the health care system. As evidence of this disruption in care, a member of the applicant group who is a naturopath gave one example at the public hearing where he had to refer a patient to another provide r for a cont rolled substance prescription. H is patient faced a one- day delay in receiving pain medications due to the referral to a medical doctor . In addition, the dean of Bastyr University 's naturopathic program estimated at the public hearing that about five percent of the population at the Bastyr teaching clinic in Wallingford has a need for controlled substances. S everal naturopaths and their patients sent comments sharing challenges they have faced with the need for referrals for controlled substances. Challenges included the need to develop relationships with several providers who were not as invested in their care as their naturopath , delays in accessing prescrip tions, and using emergency departments for acute pain needs. Some included stories about poor care they received from other providers, such as MDs, influencing their decisions to see naturopaths as their primary care physicians. Expansion of Medicaid incl udes an expanded demographic of patients with medical conditions that require controlled substances in the naturopathic primary care setting. The increasing shortage of primary care providers in response to Medicaid expansion and increased coverage under t he Patient Protection and A ffordable C are Act (ACA) is making referrals more Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 11 challenging. In response to department questions about the primary care shortage and how it relates to the proposal, the applicant provided numerous references (see Appendix B ). It also included references to support the anticipated new shortage with the expansion of Medicaid. The applicant has assert ed there are parallels to the advanced registered nurse practitioner expansion in prescriptive authority and to the circumstances that existed during a 1992 sunrise review on their prescriptive authority . These were listed as: Naturopaths have a h istory of safe prescribing under existing authority evidenced by increased demand for their services, high patient satisfaction, and no com plaints about prescribing.17 Restricting availability of controlled substances to certain segments of the population creates a lack of access to care and serious risk to the public. Because naturopaths already serve in primary care roles, failure to expand prescriptive authority creates the same risks. Public benefit from the availability of qualified providers to function in an expanded practice capacity may be mor e appropriate and less costly. Naturopaths are well positioned to provide these same benefits to the public with the inclusion of controlled substances in their scope of practice. The circumstances in effect when advanced registered nurse practitioners were granted expanded prescriptive authority are very similar to current circumstances regarding the need for increased access in many areas of Washington. The applicant has stated naturopaths require unlimited controlled substance prescriptive authority in order to provide optimal care for their patients. They believe m ost controlled subs tances are rarely, if ever , used by any primary care provider, as evidenced by the department 's Prescription Monitoring Program's \"top 20\" list of the most prescribed controlled substances . The applicant submitted the t op 20 l ist in response to the department's question about what medications naturopaths would most likely prescrib e. This list includes Schedule II opioid pain medications such as oxycodone , methadone and hydromorphone; II D eficit H yperactivity D isorder (ADHD) ; and Schedule IV -anxiety and sedative medicati ons like Ambien and lorazepam. After the public hearing, the applicant submitted an additional list of anticipated medications naturopaths may need in primary care practice. These included sedatives like Xanax and Valium on Schedule IV, Vicodin on Schedule III, 18 ADHD medications like Ritalin, and opioids like m orphine on Schedule II. The applicant stated that the eight hours of additional pharmacology education (in addition to the four hours required for current prescriptive authority) and 10 hours of additional continuing education in pharmacology that it proposes as amendments to the draft bill will ensure public safety. Naturopaths have been prescribing legend drugs since 2007, many with significant potential for drug interactions . These medications require more knowledge and monitoring in order to prescribe with in safe parameters and have serious potential s ide effects and 17 The department would like to make a correct ion to this statement. There are a small number of co mplaints about naturopathic prescribing , and even more about improper authorizations of medical marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance under both state and federal law . 18 Vicodin and other hydrocodone combination products became Schedule II controlled substances as of October 6, 2014. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 12 complications. Naturopaths have incorporated these drugs into their primary care practices successfully. In addition, naturopaths spend more time in office visits and have an emphasis on the doctor -patient relationship. In combination with the wide array of other traditional non- drug naturopat hic modalities like clinical nutrition, lifestyle counseling, body work techniques, and stress management ; naturopaths create a foundation where use of controlled substance prescriptions can be used in lower dosages and for shorter periods of ti me, which limit abuse and addiction potential. (See Appendix B for full applicant report) . Controlled Substances Controlled substances are drugs, substances, or immediate precursors included in Schedules I through V of the state and federal Uniform Controlled Substances Acts ( chapter 69.50 RCW and Title 21 USC ). Drugs are schedule d based on acceptable medical use and potential for abuse or dependenc e, with the lowest number classifications indicating the most dangerous substances. Schedule I drugs have no accepted medical use and the highest abuse potential . Schedule II drugs have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychol ogical or physical dependence. Schedules III through V drugs have lesser potential for abuse and dependence than S chedule I and II drugs . Opioid pain medications f all under Schedule II and III. Also included in Schedule II are methamphetamines, pentobarbital, and hallucinogenic substances. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reports that abuse of prescription and nonprescription opioid painkillers is a public health epidemic that can lead to u nintentional poisoning deaths. People in rural counties are about tw ice as likely to overdose on prescription painkillers as people in large cities. 19 Data shows that states with higher sales of prescription opioids have higher rates of overdose deaths. In addition: The three opioids most often involved in overdose deaths are methadone, oxycodone, and hydrocodone. Medicaid clients are twice as likely to receive an opioid prescription compared to non- Medicaid clients and are six times more likely to have a fatal overdose involving prescription opioids. One in 20 people in the United States use prescription painkillers non- medically to get high. By 2010, enough opioid pain relievers were sold in the United States to medicate every adult with a typical dose of five milligrams of hydrocodone every four hours for one month. 20 According to the CDC , in 2013 the United States made up about four percent of the world's population but consumed 80 percent of the world's oxycodone and 99 percent of the w orld's hydrocodone.21 Because of the health risks associated with opioid use, the legislature passed ESHB 2876 ( chapter 209, Laws of 2010) requiring boards and commissions with prescriptive authority for opioids22 to 19 http://www.cdc.gov/Features/VitalSigns/PainkillerOverdoses/ , accessed August -a-closer -look-at-heroin , accessed August 19, 2014. 22 Podiatric Medical Board, Dental Quality Assurance Commission, Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery, Medical Quality Assurance Commission, and Nursing Care Quality Assurance Commission. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 13 adopt rules on chroni c, non- cancer pain management. The legislation required adoption of rules related to clinical assessment tools and tracking the use of opioids. It specifically required rules outlining the criteria for when a practitioner must refer a patient to, or seek a consultation with, a pain specialist. The need for referral for controlled substance prescriptions is often a necessary coordination, rather than a disruption, of health care. It is necessary to ensure the most qualified healthcare professionals are prescribing these substances, which are cont rolled because of their risks. Naturopathic training has a major focus on treatments such as homeopathy, botanical medicines, and physical medicine techniques like hydrotherapy and soft tissue manipulation. Less time is focus ed on pharmacology and little on controlled substances. With the growing access to prescription opioid medications and the e pidemic of overdose deaths, a very cautious approach should be taken i n considering expanding access to these medi cations. We must always consider patient safety . This is particularly true when considering controlled substances and pain management, where the data shows a correlation between the rise in overdose deaths and states that have expand ed the use of controlled substances such as opioids. Safe and effective chronic opioid therapy for chronic non- cancer pain requires clinical skills and knowledge in both the principles of opioid prescribing and on the assessment and management of risks associated with opioid abuse, addiction, and diversion. 23 The applicant hasn't shown that the current educational standards for clinical pharmacotherapy relating to prescribing opioid, antianxiety, sedative, hypnotics, and amphetamine substances for various disease states is sufficient to provide for patient safety and good clinical outcomes. Current Regulation and Practice of Naturopathic Physicians The scope of practice of naturopaths has been amended twice since 1987: Chapter 158, laws of 2005, expanded the scope of pra ctice to: o Expand the prescriptive authority to include \"those legend drugs and controlled substances consistent with naturopathic medical practice in accordance with rules established with the secretary, \" limiting c ontrolled substances to codeine and testo sterone products contained in S chedules III, IV, and V of chapter 69.50 RCW . o Amend the definition of minor office procedures to add treatment of lesions and intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, and intradermal injections of substances according to rules established by the secretary . 24 o The secretary, in consultation with the former Naturopathy A dvisory C ommittee and the former B oard of Pharmacy25 were required to develop education and training requirements that the naturopaths must meet before being gr anted prescriptive authority for testosterone and codeine controlled substance product s. 23 Roger Chou, et al, Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Chronic Opioid Therapy in Chronic N oncancer Pain, The Journal of Pain, vol. 10, Issue 2, pp. 113- 130, http://www.jpain.org/article/S1526 -5900(08)00831- 6/fulltext . 24 Consistent with department recommendations in a 1 999 sunrise review . 25 Now the P harmacy Quality Assurance Commission . Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 14 Chapter 40, laws of 2011 , changed the limitation that physical modalities must be noninvasive , replacing it with those physical modalities that don't exceed those used as of July 22, 2011, in minor office procedures or common diagnostic procedures. This legislation also removed the limitation that only non- drug contraceptive devices could be used in treatment. Chapter 41, Laws of 2011, transferred auth ority from the secretary to the Board of Naturopathy to adopt rules regarding n aturopaths' authority to prescribe testosterone and codeine controlled substances . Naturopaths' current scope of practice is defined in RCW 18.36A.040 as \"the practice by naturopaths of the art and science of the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disorders of the body by stimulation or support, or both, of the natural processes of the human body.\" This includes : Manual manipulation Nutrition and food science Homeopathy Minor office procedures such as treating superficial lacerations, lesions, and abrasions Injections of substances consistent with the practice of naturopathic medicine; and Naturopathic medicines, including legend drugs an d controlled substance s limited to codeine and testosterone products (such as Tylenol with codeine or male hormone supplements) , consistent with naturopathic medical practice as set in rule by the board . Naturopaths who wish to prescribe codeine or testosterone must first submit an attestation that they have complet ed at least four hours of graduate -level instruction in specific pharmacology topics and be granted authority by the board. There are currently 717 out of 1,215 licensed naturopaths who hold this authorization. The applicant states that naturopaths have been practicing within their current prescriptive authority safely. This authority includes many legend drugs that have significant risks such as potential for drug interactions or seriou s potential side effects and complications such as Coumadin, lithium, and insulin. ( Note: N o data was provided to support or refute this assertion) . Naturopathic Theory Naturopathic medicine is described as a distinct primary health care profession, emphasizing prevention, treatment, and optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods and substances that encourage individuals' inherent self -healing process. The practice of naturopathic medicine includes modern and traditional, scie ntific, and empirical methods. It focuses on holistic, proactive prevention and comprehensive diagnosis and treatment that help to facilitate the body's inherent ability to restor e and maintain optimal health. Naturopaths ident ify and remove barriers to good health by creating a healing internal and external environment.26 According to the board, this care should include the full range of medical options, including the use of controlled substances , to ensure greater options for patients. 26 American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP), http://www.naturopathic.org/education . Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 15 Naturopathic Physician Education and Training The board has approved seven Council on Naturopathic Medical Education ( CNME ) accredited schools in the United States and Canada for licensure in Washington. The counc il requires programs to be a minimum of 4,100 clock hours, with at least 1,200 hours devoted to clinical training. Naturopaths are trained in four - or five -year, graduate- level programs in basic and clinical sciences . Naturopathic curriculum includes many courses in clinical nutrition, homeopathic medicine, botanical medicine, psychology and counseling .27 There are residency options at schools, such as Bastyr University, but there is no residency requirement for graduation or state licensure. The currently accredited naturopathic schools provide a range of 60 to 96 hours dedicated to pharmacology, with additional hours of medication management.28 The Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination , which is required for licensure in Washington, includes a pharmacology section that is described in more detail below . Pharmacology Training There is no consistency in pharmacology training across the various health professions with full or limited prescriptive authority for controlled substa nces in Washington ( MDs, osteopathic podiatrists , and optometrists ). The educational programs for these professions, including that of natur opaths , incorporate basic science courses and clinical experien ce. However, there is a broad range of theories and focuses in each type o f school and health profession. P harmacological concepts are taught throughout many courses, making it difficult to parse out exactly how many credits or hours focus on pharmacology, the topics covered, and the depth of the education. The departm ent requested the applicant identify how naturopathic pharmacology training compares to other licensed professions with full prescriptive authority. The applicant provided information on naturopathic training but recommended the department and other prescribers provide information on other profes sions for comparison purposes. The department has summarized the information received from multiple sources on the pharmacology training for other professions with prescriptive authority below (see written comments in Appendix D for full comments) . Bastyr University states its program includes 88 hours dedicated to pharmacology , with additional hours included in the clinica l sciences modules that cover medication management . In her presentation at the public hearing, Jane Guiltinan, ND, dean of Bastyr University's Naturopathic Medicine program , stated that about half of the pharmacology hours are included in basic sciences during the first two years, and the other half are learned as part of the clinical sciences. The current pharmacology training does not focus on controlled substances since t hey are not in the Washington scope of practice for naturopaths . Dr. Guiltinan stated that if controlled substances were added to the prescriptive authority, Bastyr would not add additional hours to the current training but would instead adjust the current hours to incorporate appropriate training. During the rebuttal period, Dr. Guiltinan revised her statements and indicated Bastyr would be \"willing to develop and offer a continuing medical educational program on controlled substances... that could address a ny current deficiencies in core training...\" 27 Bastyr University , accessed 7/1/2014. 28 Applicant report. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 16 The applicant submitted information from four other approved naturopathic programs in the United States showing a range of 70 -96 hours of pharmacology training. This information was cited from a 2013 Vermont repo rt29 that review ed naturopaths' education and clinical training to determine whether it includes sufficient academic and clinical training in pharmacology for additional prescriptive authority ( including controlled substances ). The report concluded that Council on Naturopathic Medical Education accredited programs include didactic and clinical pharmacology training that varies from program to program , \"ranging from sufficient to wanting .\" The Vermont report recommended a conservative approach to naturopa th prescribing that \"errs on the side of public protection,\" including a number of recommendations to be completed as a condition of enacting ex panded prescriptive authority. These included passage of a naturopathic pharmacology examination , a period of prescription review by another authorized prescriber for new practitioners , and continuance of a formulary of substances that may be prescribed for patients and the conditions naturopaths are competent to treat based on that naturopathic trainin g and experience. According to Sam Russo, naturopathic advisor to the Vermont Office of Professional Regulation, the formulary will sunset in 2015 and naturopaths will be authorized to prescribe w ithin their scope of training. This will accommodate for the variation in training among naturopathic programs. The College of Osteopathic Medicine at Pacific Northwest University of Health Science and WOMA provided information about osteopathic medicine pharmacology training. The y indicated osteopathic doctor training in cludes 163 contact hours in pharmacology in the first and second years, focusing on mechanism of action, potential adverse effects, and appropriate applications. The following two years incorporat e clinical training in pharmacology , including diagnosis directing medication selection, dosi ng, and alternative therapies. This is followed by a minimum of three -year residencies, where DOs hone these skills while overseen by an attending physician . 30 Washington State Medical Association ( WSMA ) provided information about allopathic physician pharmacology training. The University of Washington requires two quarters specific to pharmacology, equaling 180 hours of class time. Pharmacology is covered in many other courses during the final two years of medical school. In addition, during their residency training, MDs continue to learn clinical pharmacology, indications and contraindications for prescribing medications for disease and conditions working with experienced physicians . 31 Since t he applicant has cited parallels to Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners ( ARNP s) throughout its proposal, we are providing more detail regarding Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner pra ctice, education, and training. Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners are licensed to practice independently with a broad scope of practice based on education, certification , standards of care, and competencies developed by professional organizations. For example, the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties has developed a set of Nurse 29 Vermont Office of Professional Regulation report to the legislature, Prescriptive Authority for Naturopathic Physicians , February 5, 2013, https://www.sec.state.vt.us/media/389803/Naturopath_Prescribing_2013.pdf 30 Information submitted by Assistant Dean of Clinical Education at Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences College of Osteopathic Medicine, and WOMA (See Appendix D - Written Comments). 31 Letter submitted by WSMA, July 24, 2014 (See Appendix D - Written Comments). Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 17 Practitioner Core Competencies .32 WAC 246- 840-300 requires the ARNP scope of practice to be within the individual ARNP's knowledge, experience and practice. Advanced Registered Nurse Practit ioners are required to hold a Registered Nurse (RN) license and to have graduated from an accredited advanced nursing education program. They must also acquire and maintain certification in a nurse practitioner specialty, such as the American Nurses Credentialing Center Academy of Nurse Practitioners, American Midwifery Certification Board or Council on Certi fication of Nurse Anesthetists. Education to become an R N includes pharmacology education and principles to appropriately and safely administer medications and asses s patients' responses to them. Initial application for advanced registered nurse practitioner prescriptive authority requires at least 30 contact hours of education in pharmacotherapeutics related to the applicant's scope of practice and includes pharmacokinetic principles and their clinical application and the use of pharmacological agents in the prevention of illness, restoration, and ma intenance of health (WAC 246- 840-410). Most programs provide more than the minimum hours. WAC 246- 840-360 requires that a dvanced r egistered nurse practitioners m eet the following requirements to renew their licenses every two years : Minimum of 250 hours of independent clinical practice in the advanced registered nurse practitioner role; and Completion of 30 continuing education hours relevant to the area of certification and scope of practice. Many national certification organizations, such as Ame rican Nurses Credentialing Center and Academy of Nurse Practitioners , require 1,000 clinical practice hours for renewal every five years , or the advanced registered nurse practitioner must retest and pass the certification examination again . Renewal of the prescriptive authority is separate and requires 15 hours of continuing education in pharmcotherapeutics relevant to the area of certification and scope of practice, in addition to the 30 hours of continuing education required for licensure renewal (WAC 24 6-840-451). 33 Prescriptive Authority in Other States Seven states and Washington DC grant naturopaths a limited prescriptive authority that does not include controlled substances.34 In Alaska, Connecticut,35 Minnesota, and North Dakota, naturopaths are regulated but don't have prescriptive authority for legend drugs or controlled substances. Naturopaths aren't regulated or licensed in more than 30 states. 32 http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.nonpf. org/resource/resmgr/competencies/npcorecompetenciesfinal2012.pdf . 33 Provided by Louise Kaplan, PhD, ARNP, FNP -BC, FAANP, Director, Nursing Program, Saint Martin's University, at the department's request. 34 Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, New Hampshi re and Utah have varying levels of prescriptive authority for legend drugs. 35 Connecticut reviewed a proposal dated March 20, 2014, to add prescriptive authority for naturopaths but concluded it did not provide enough information to demonstrate adequate educa tion. The report can be found at: http://www.ct.gov/dph/lib/dph/practitio ner_licensing_and_investigations/scope_of_practice_2014/report_to_the_ge neral_assembly -naturopaths_3_21_14_final_report.pdf . Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 18 The department identified four states where naturopaths have varying levels of prescriptive authority for controlled substances: Arizona , Oregon, California , and Vermont . Arizona and Oregon have the broad est auth ority for controlled substances (Appendix F) . Arizona 's authority is limited to Schedule s III-V and morphine in S chedule II (excluding cancer and antipsychotic medications ). Oregon operates from a large formulary that includes many S chedule II controlled substances. All four states are uniform in the require ment of continuing education in pharmacology for license renewal . However, each s tate also has unique requirements, which include: Arizona, Oregon, and Vermont require additional pharmacology courses and /or pharmacology/formulary examination s for licensure. Oregon includes a one -time mandatory pain management course. California requires supervision by an allopathic or osteopathic physician for S chedule IV - V controlled substances and a patient -specific protocol checked by a supervising physician for Schedule II substances. Vermont requires a period of prescription revie w by an authorized prescriber for new providers. Primary Care The applicant submitted definitions regarding primary care from the American Associatio n of Family Physicians. The association defines primary care as being performed by a physician36 who manages care and collaborat es with other health professionals, using consultation and referral when appropriate. Primary care physicians are described as generalist physicians who are the first point of contact and take continuing responsibility for p roviding a patient's care, which includes coordinating the use of the entire healthcare system to benefit the patient. The applicant has asserted that to provide primary care effectively, naturopaths need prescriptive authority for the full range of cont rolled substances in Schedules II -V. It state s that their use will be limited to those appropriate to the naturopathic scope of practice and within the context of naturopathic philosophy and training. When asked to elaborate on the conditions naturopaths are likely to treat under the expanded Medicaid demographic, many of the applicant's responses focused on pain management. Primary care includes coordinating care that is outside of the provider's scope of practice , education , and training, and includes r eferr al to an appropriate provider. Naturopathic physicians are approved under Medicaid to provide primary care services. However, they are authorized to provide only those services that are within their scope of practice . There is no indication that unlimited prescriptive authority is necessary or expected by Medicaid to act as primary care providers. The Medicaid population is shown to be in a high -risk category for opioid pain medications, with data showing they are twice as likely to receive an opi oid prescription compared to non- Medicaid clients, and are six times more likely to have a fatal overdose involving prescription opioids . The Health Care Authority has indicated naturopaths may offer a 36 AAFP use of the term \"physician \" refers to MDs and DOs. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 19 valuable contribution to Medicaid patient s through alternative methods to decrease the need for opioid medications . Primary Care Shortage The department acknowledges there are shortages of primary care physicians in Wash ington and across the country. This is a complicated issue, with disparities in primary care capacity across different regions and populations, and was an issue long before the A ffordable C are A ct. Some of the reasons for the smaller pool of primary care physicians include a high workload, lower reimbursement rates, and less compet itive salaries. Strategies to increase the supply of primary care providers have included utilizing advanced registered nurse practitioners in an expanded capacity to help fill gaps in primary care. Their prescriptive authority has evolved in response to specific n eeds in the healthcare system. These have included evidence that advanced registered nurse practitioners have filled specific voids in rural and underserved areas , and their numbers and distribution have made them effective in filling these gaps. In contrast , the applicant testified that the vast majority of naturopaths practice with in King, Pierce and Snohomish c ounties. A map provided by the applicant shows that more than half of all naturopaths licensed in Washington are in King County alone , and 10 counties have none . The expansion of Medicaid in the Affordable Care Act has caused anticipation that shortages may be exacerbated as the primary care workforce m ust take on many new patients. The Washington State Office of Financial Management conducted a research project on the availability of primary care physicians to serve this newl y expanded Medicaid population. This report stated that findings have been unclear on the ability of Washington's primary care capacity to ab sorb the expanded Medicaid population. It concluded that it appears the state has sufficient capacity overall, with disparities appearing to lie in specific rural areas . 37 Parallels to ARNPs The department finds that this proposal does n't parallel the 1992 sunrise review and subsequent expansion of advanced registered nurse practitioner prescriptive authority . During the sunrise review, the ARNP sunrise applicant was able to demonstrate that not expanding their prescriptive authority would severely restrict access to primary and specialty care in rural areas. It provided information regarding access to care challenges in rural areas and how advanced registered nurse practitioner's prescriptive authority was tied to addressing those challenges. It also showed that these providers had been put into a situation where they had the responsibility , but not the authority , to prescribe controlled substances. The applicant hasn't demonstrated these same conditions exist or that expansion of naturopath prescriptive authority would have the same impact . In addition, the advanced registered nurse practitioner report was conducted prior to the expanded use of opioids for chronic, non- cancer pain. Many significant changes in the political and health care lan dscape have occurred since 1992. 37 Availability of Primary Care Physicians to Serve the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid Expansion Population, Washington State Office of Financial Management, Research Brief No. 65, June 2012. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 20 REVIEW OF PROPOSAL USING SUNRISE CRITERIA The Sunrise Act , chapter 18.120 RCW includes regulated professions seeking to substantially increase their scope of practice; however it does not provide specific criteria for evaluating these proposal s. RCW 18.120.010(2) includes the following criteria for evaluating proposals to regulat e a health profession for the first time : \"A health profession should be regulated by the state only when: Unregulated practice can clearly har m or endanger the health, safety, or welfare of the public, and the potential for the harm is easily recognizable and not remote or dependent upon tenuous argument; The public needs and can reasonably be expected to benefit from an assurance of initial and continuing professional ability; and The public cannot be effectively protected by other means in a more cost -beneficial manner. First Criterion: Unregulated practice can harm or endanger health or safety. Naturopaths are currently a thoroughly regulated profession. The proposal as written does not offer adequate protections to meet this criterion . Controlled substances are often dangerous drugs and are scheduled based on their potential for misuse, abuse and dependence. Opi oids are used at epidemic levels, with a correlation shown between the rise in overdose deaths and states that have expanded prescription access of these substances. Naturopathic schools include training in pharmacology that varies in content and length . The proposal does not include sufficient training specific to controlled substances, and Bastyr University , a primary educator of naturopaths in this region , has indicated it will revise the current pharmacology training to include controlled substances rather than add hours to the training if the draft bill is enacted . It will also develop and offer continuing medical education programs on controlled substances. If the legislature decides to expand the naturopathic scope of pract ice to include prescriptive authority for additional controlled substances, it will be necessary for additional protections to ensure the public's health and safety. The department believes the additional education and training the applicant proposes is n't sufficient for an expanded prescriptive authority for controlled substances . We would want the Board of Naturopathy, in consultation with the Pharmacy Quality Assurance Commis sion, to undergo rule making to determine appropriate training and education. Second Criterion: The p ublic needs and will benefit from assurance of professional ability. There are adequate laws and rules in place to assure the public of initial and continued professional ability for the current naturopath scope of practice. The proposal as written does not offer adequate protections to meet this criterion . The applicant has not shown adequate core training or that the additional education proposed will ensure the public of professional ability to safely prescribe controlled s ubstances. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 21 If the legislature considers expand ing the naturopathic scope of practice to include prescriptive authority for additional controlled substances, then the Board of Naturopathy will need authority to undergo rule making . Third Criterion: Public protection cannot be met by other means in a more cost beneficial manner . The current naturopathic scope of practice protects the public. The proposal as written does not offer adequate protections to meet this criterion . If the legislature considers expand ing the naturopathic scope of practice to include prescriptive authority for additional controlled substances, then the Board of Naturopathy will need authority to undergo rulemaking as there is no other more cost beneficial manner to protect the public. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 22 DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS TO LEGISLATURE The department does n't support the proposal to expand the prescriptive authority of naturopaths to include all Schedule II -V controlled substances without limitations . Rationale: The applicant has not demonstrated problems with the current prescriptive authority that would justify unlimited expan sion of the naturopathic prescriptive authority for controlled substances . Unlimited prescriptive authority is n't necessary for naturopaths to practice as primary care physicians under Medicaid. Referrals for controlled substances are often necessary, especially in long -term opioid therapy, to ensure the most qualified health care professionals are prescribing these substances, which are controlled because of their significant risks to public health due to overdose, abuse and misuse. The applicant has n't demonstrate d that naturopaths receive adequate education in clinical pharmacotherapy of prescribing opioid, antianxiety, sedative, hypnotics, and amphetamine substances to treat various disease states to safely prescribe controlled substances. The department does n't see a benefit to increas ing access without limitation to prescription opioid pain medications included in this proposal because: o Prescription opioid related overdoses and deaths have reached epidemic levels. o Data has shown a correlation between the rise in overdose deaths and states that have expanded prescription access to prescription opioids. o The state is currently engaged in intensive and effective efforts to curb the overuse of opioids in Washington. Granting broader prescribing authority for controlle d substances is contrary to these efforts. Although the department doesn't support unlimited expansion of prescriptive authority , the sunrise review process surfaced new information and perspectives that the legislature should consider. Notably , the HCA has provided the following arguments in support of a limited expansion of naturopathic prescriptive authority , with which the department agrees : The HCA recognizes the potential benefit of more convenient and comprehensive health care of clients whose prim ary care provider is a naturopath. Naturopaths have a narrower range of prescriptive authority than other designated primary care providers in Washington. It is likely that patients with acute non -life threatening or limb -threatening injuries will seek car e in their places of practice, and there is a subset of the population for whom codeine is not effective and/or not tolerated. The HCA agrees with the applicant that e xpanded Medicaid coverage is expected to include an expanded demographic of patients with medical conditions requiring controlled substances in the naturopathic primary care setting. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 23 Deaths related to prescription opioids have occurred almost without exception in patients on chronic therapy. Short -term treatment of acute conditions with contro lled substances is considered safer. Limited prescriptive authority may reduce the number of unnecessary emergency department visits. Bastyr University has indicated a willingness to develop and offer a continuing medical education program on controlled s ubstances to address deficiencies in core training, and has offered assistance in developing necessary educational requirements. If this alternative is considered, the department recommends: Limiting prescriptive authority to controlled substances in Sche dule III -V, 38 and only hydrocodone products in Schedule II.39 Limiting controlled substance prescriptions to no more than seven days when treating a particular patient for a single trauma, episode, or condition or for pain associated with or related to the trauma, episode, or condition. Maximum dosage of 120 milligrams morphine equivalent dose (MED) per day . 40 Authoriz ing the B oard of Naturopathy, in consultation with the Pharmacy Quality Assurance Commission, to undergo rulemaking to determine appropriate training and education . Requiring the board to adopt pain management rul es appropriate for acute pain treatment, including, but not limite d to, patient examination and screening for comorbidities and risk factors . Requiring naturopaths with prescriptive authority for controlled substances to register in the Prescription Monitoring Program ( PMP )41 database to access patient prescription history . 38 This would include Tramadol, which naturopaths had prescriptive authority to prescribe as a legend drug until the FDA recently reclas sified it as a Schedule IV controlled substance. 39Hydrocodone products are short -acting opioids, which meet the HCA's stated goal of providing naturopaths an additional tool to treat acute pain. These products were rescheduled from Schedule III to Schedule II in October of 2014. 40 Morphine equivalent dose means a conversion of various opioids to a morphine equivalent dose by the use of accepted conversion tables. 120 MED is the mandatory consultation threshold for adult patient s set in the administrative codes of providers with full prescriptive authority (as required in Chapter 209, Laws of 2010) . 41 The PMP is a secure online database that collects data on Schedules II -V controlled substances. Prescribers are authorized to access PMP data before prescribi ng or dispensing drugs to look for duplicate prescribing, possible misuse, drug interactions, and other potential concerns (chapter 70.225 RCW). Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 24 REBUTTALS TO DRAFT REPORT The department shared a draft report with sunrise participants and interested parties and invited rebuttal comments or suggested corrections . We received 37 letters of rebuttal, correcti on, or support that are summarized below. The full rebuttals are included in Appendix F. We have summarized the topics of rebuttal s and suggested corrections , along with our response or actions. Applicant We received rebuttals from t he applicant on the follow topics and statements in the draft report . 1. The applicant did n't prove the current prescriptive authority is inadequate, problematic, or that it causes disruption of continuity and coordination of care. The applicant disagreed with this ratio nale, citing: A 1992 sunrise report supporting expansion of advanced registered nurse practitioner prescriptive authority . The example provided at the hearing where a patient's pain medication was dela yed (page 9). The applicant stated this example did n't simply demonstrate inconvenience, but a patient self -medicating with an inappropriate drug that had dire implications. T his example wasn't unique for naturopaths in smaller or rural practices. Naturopaths don't have access to the common controlled substance medications the applicant submitted with the applicant materials that a re necessary for primary care. This proves the current prescriptive authority is problematic for naturopathic physicians and patients. The HCA report, Emergency Department Utilization: Assumed Savings from Best Practices Implementation42. The applicant states the current prescriptive authority contributes to unnecessary utilization of emergency room services which are contrary to goals outlined by the HCA in its report. The report states that if a client does not have a primary care physician or can't be seen in a reasonable amount of time for a low acuity need, he or she may turn to the emergency department. Department Response: The applicant relies heavily on a 22 -year old sunrise report that occurred prior to the opioid epidemic this state and nation faces currently . The poli tical and health care landscape was very different than what exists today. In addition, the few is olated examples provided by the applicant are not ev idence of a problem that would rise to the level of substantially expanding a profession's scope of practice. The HCA report may make a case for a limited expansion of prescriptive authority for acute conditions. The department received several rebuttal l etters from naturopaths and naturopathic patients citing challenges they have faced with the lack of prescriptive authority for controlled substances. In addition, we received a rebuttal letter from the HCA stating the proposal (with 42 Washington State Health Care Aut hority, http://www.hca.wa.gov/Documents/legreports/3ESHB2127C7L2012E2PVEmergencyDepartmentUtilizationReport. pdf. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 25 specific limitations) may reduce unnecessary emergency department visits for controlled substances . The report has been revised to reflect these comments. 2. Prescriptive authority is n't necessary for naturopaths to practice as primary care physicians under Medicaid. The applican t disagreed with this rationale, citing a conclusion in V ermont 's Report on Education and Clinical Training of Naturopathic Physicians that the evolution of the naturopathic profession necessitates the ability to prescribe primary care pharmaceuticals to fulfill their role as primary care physicians when it falls within the scope of a naturopath' s education and training. P rimary care is not defined by provider type but by a core set of services, including m anagement of acute conditions. The applicant also stated that p atients who select a naturopath as their primary care provider shouldn't be subject to discrimination as to services they can receive, including prescribing controlled substances for acute conditions and for chronic conditions such as ADHD. Department Response: The department does n't consider scope limitations based on education and training to be discrimination because the patient has a choice between different types of primary care providers with different levels of training and scopes of pr actice. HCA' s letter of rebuttal support ing limited prescriptive authority for naturopaths in order to effectively treat Medicaid patients stated that allowing naturopaths to prescribe controlled substances for acute and time limited periods is patient centered and appropriate (with additional education). Their letter didn't indicate that the scope expansion is require d or necessary for naturopaths to maintain primary care provider status. The report has been revised to reflect these comments. 3. Referral s for controlled substances are necessary to ensure the most qualified health care professionals are prescribing these substances, which are controlled because of their significant risks to public health due to overdose, abuse and misuse. The applicant stated that referrals for chronic opioid therapy are well described in the Interagency Guidelines on Opioid Dosing for Chronic Non- Cancer Pain and other literature and agrees these patients should be co- managed with a board certified pain specialist. However, it disagreed that referrals are appropriate for controlled substances for acute cases, which require timely treatment and when delays for referral can put patients at risk. Department Response: The department agrees that acute cases require timely treatment and delays can put patients at risk . However, the statement that the most qualified health care professionals should be prescribing these substances is accurate, especial ly for chronic opioid therapy. This rationa le has been slightly revised for clarification. 4. The applicant has not demonstrated naturopaths receive adequate education to safely prescribe controlled substances and t he additional education and continuing education are not sufficient to overcome the deficiencies. The applicant reiterated that the four hours of supplemental education naturopaths are required to complete t o apply for the current prescriptive authority works , and that naturopaths ha ve a safe record of pres cribing . This includes pain medications like tramadol and affirms that the current continuing education model was built on a strong core education Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 26 in pharmacology and pharmacotherapeutics. The applicant requested that if the department believes alternate educational requirements would better protect the public, we should identify this education in the final report for consideration for rulemaking. Department Response: It is the applicant's responsibility to demonstrate adequate training to increase a profes sion's scope of practice. The department requested the applicant provide detailed information comparing the pharmacology training of current controlled substance prescribers to that of naturopaths , including length of training and specific content; however sufficient information was n't provided. No changes were made to the report in response to these comments. 5. The department does n't see a need to increase access to prescripti on opioid pain medications be cause of t he prescription opioid epidemic, the li nk between the rise in overdose deaths and states that have expanded the use of prescription opioids , and granting broader prescribing authority for controlled substances is contrary to the current efforts to curb the overuse of opioids. The applicant disagreed with this rationale , stating that n aturopathic medicine offers an alternative approach and a unique per spective that includes more time with patients and emphasis on alternative non- drug therapeutics that will lessen the need for controlled substances . However, i n some acute cases a short -term opioid prescription for a carefully screened patient may be the most medically appropriate treatment. The applicant stated that the department suggest s a moratorium on new prescriptive authority for any type of provider, including MDs, osteopathic doctors , advanced registered nurse practitioner and physician assi stants, which would not serve the public and would compound the problems occurring now. It also suggests the department identify the states with an increas e in overdose deaths to review whether they include licensure for naturopaths and whether this data is relevant. The applicant included citations of studies supporting the efficacy of the \"naturopathic approach.\" Department Response: The department did not suggest a link between opioid -related deaths and naturopath prescriptive authority . We were recognizing the cur rent problems with opioids and stating that adding more provider types who can prescribe controlled substances is contrary to efforts to cur b the overuse of opioids. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has released information showing that Oregon and Arizona, where naturopath prescriptive authority is broadest, had 82.2.- 95 painkiller prescription per 100 people in 2012, compared to 72- 82.1 per 100 people in Washington. 43 In addition, efficacy of the naturopathic approach isn't the subject of this review, so the additional citations are irrelevant to this sunrise. In light of additional information provided during the rebuttal period of the sunrise review, the department has amended the rationale to indicate we don't see a benefit to increasing access without limitation to prescription opioid pain medications . 43 http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/opioid -prescribing/infographic.html#map. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 27 6. Speculation that naturopaths have a safe prescri bing record. The applicant disagreed wit h the statement that it \"speculated\" naturopaths have been prescribing legend drugs with significant risks, such as Coumadin, lithium, and insulin safely and provided no data to support this assertion. It cited : There have been no complaints against naturopaths for issues with prescribing within the current scope of practice. The applicant asked the department to provide data on the number of complaints against naturopaths for issues related to prescribing authorized controlled substances, t estosterone and codeine. The department responded that there have been 24 complaints related to prescribing outside the statutory scope of practice with four closed with no action, nine with issuance of Stipulations of Informal Disposition, and 11 in process. Department Response: The department considers the above statements to be speculation because th e applicant provided examples of dangerous legend drugs currently within the naturopath prescriptive authority but did not provide data on what naturopaths are actually prescribing. In addition, prescribing outside the statutory scope of practice is a serious problem . No changes were made to the report in response to these comments. 7. Review of first sunrise criterion: unregulated practice can harm or endanger health or safety. The applicant disagreed with the department's assessment of this criterion , stating that naturopaths have an established safety record for their current prescriptive authority . It provided evidenc e of the primary care shortage and references supporting the anticipated increased shortage due to Medicaid expansion . This establishes the readily apparent potential for public harm due to lack of access to primary care. Department Response: Naturopaths are already considered primary care providers. However, the HCA agreed in its rebuttal that some prescriptive authority for controlled substances may be beneficial to the Medicaid population that naturopaths are now authorized to treat. The report was revised to add this information. 8. Review of second sunrise criterion: the public needs and will benefit from assurance of professional ability. The applicant disagreed with the department's assessment of this criterion, stating the current model for naturopath prescriptive authority forms the basis for the supplemental and continuing education in this proposal, and that the proposed additional education meets or exceeds that of other provider types with full prescriptive authority. Department Response: The applicant has not provided sufficient information for the department to adopt this c onclusion. However, in light of additional information provided during the sunrise review process, the department added that if the legislature considers limited expans ion of prescriptive authority, rulemaking by the Board of Naturopathy in consultation with the Pharmacy Quality Assurance Commission will be necessary. 9. Review of third sunrise criterion: public protection cannot be met by other means in a more cost benef icial manner. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 28 The applicant repeated the parallels it cited in their applicant materials to the 1992 advanced registered nurse practitioner sunrise review and added that r eferral to the emergency department or other to other primary care providers for acute conditions requiring controlled substances would not be considered best practices. Department Response: The department agrees that referral s for acute conditions can be problematic and has made changes to indicate this in the report. 10. Report of Dr. G uiltinan's testimony from public hearing that Bastyr would not add hours to the current pharmacology training but would incorporate controlled substances into existing training. The applicant stated Bastyr University has confirmed it is interested in and has the ability to develop and offer supplemental education to fulfill requirements enacted by the legislature and Dr. Guiltinan has provided comments to this effect. In addition, due to a curriculum change in process at Bastyr, the number of contact hours for naturopath pharmacology was inaccurately reported as 60.5, while the correct number is actually 88 hours with an elective for an additional 20 hours available. Department Response: This is new information and the report has been revised accordingly . 11. Placement of public comments in the draft report. The applicant stated it was unclear why the department included a Health Care Authority (HCA) letter in the paragraph about letters of opposition when the HCA recognized potential benefit of the proposal . It also questioned inclusion of the letter from Washington East Asian Medicine Association , which didn't address topics covered in the sunrise review. Department Response: These two letters were clearly identified in the report as letters of concern , rath er than opposition. However, c hanges have been made to the public testimony section to ensure these comments are clear ly and accurately reported . 12. Public comments the applicant mistook for department statements . The applicant had concerns about the following statements in the report: The department implies naturopathy is limited to natural therapeutics in the statement, \"NDs have their place in the health care system as providers with a philosophy that seeks to restore and maintain optimum health... ac cording to the American Associatio n of Naturopathic Physicians...\" It directed us to reference the current AANP website for correct statements. The department suggests prescriptive authority for providers with less training that MDs is dangerous through the statement, \" MDs and DOs having substantially more pharmacology training and residencies, and that granting providers with less training controlled substance prescriptive authority is unnecessary and contrary to legislative efforts ...\" Department Response: These statement s are represented under public comments, not the department's position. No changes were made to the draft report in response to the se comments. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 29 13. Department reports of concerns from the AWHP an d HCA regarding naturopathic education . The applicant states that these comments were made before it provided additional details about naturopathic education in follow up to the department. Department Response: The report has been revised to clarify these comments . 14. Reporting of the expanded demographic of Medicaid population. The applicant disagreed with the department's statement that it \"has speculated that the expansion of Medicaid will include an expanded demographic of patients with medical conditions that require controlled substances i n the naturopathic primary care setting.\" It stated that the department's citation of CDC reports on page 13 showing Medicaid clients are twice as likely to receive an opioid prescription compared to non- Medicaid clients confirms Medicaid expansion will in clude an increased percentage of patients requiring opioid prescriptions in the na turopathic primary care setting. Department Response: The term \"speculated\" was changed to \"asserted\" in the report. 15. Department criticism of naturopathic core education and characterization of applicant's recommendatio n for supplemental education. The applicant pointed to the 2005 legislative change granting their current prescriptive authority and the additional education to obtain this prescriptive authority, along with the safe record of prescribing. It also requested a correction needed to the report where the department reported the applicant recommended eight hours of supplemental education, rather than th e actual 12 hours . Department Resp onse: The report has been revised to clarify that the applicant recommends eight hours in addition to the four hours required for current prescriptive authority. 16. Department statement that the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education has no standard pharmacology training. The applicant argue d this is an untrue statement and provided a statement from C ouncil on Naturopathic M edical E ducation . Department Response: The report has been revised to remove this statement. 17. Naturopathic educational standards for clinical pharmacology. The applicant reiterated its willingness to ask the legislature to require the Board of Naturopathy to initiate formal rulemaking to develop the most appropriate process and regulatory means for Washington and request the department identify the recommenda tions that would protect the public in this regard. Department Response: This is n't new information. No changes were made to the report in response to this comment. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 30 18. Registered N urses and A dvanced R egistered N urse P ractitioner pharmacology education. The applicant reported the following observations on training of other prescribers: In assessing the core nursing education related to pharmacology, it does n't appear that the bachelor's level education includes diagnosis or prescription of medications, which naturopathic education includes both didactically and clinically. Initial application for advanced registered nurse practitioner's prescriptive authority requires 30 contact hours of pharmacotherapeutics, while core naturopathic education includes 70- 90 hours, with Bastyr reporting 88 hours of pharmacology course work and an elective for 20 additional hours. Advanced registered nurse practitioner renewal of prescriptive authority requires 15 hours of continuing education in pharmacotherapeutics relevant to the area of certification and scope of practice, whereas the naturopathic requirements are proposed in the applicant report to increase from 20 to 30 hours per year with 10 specific to pharmacology, exceeding the ARNP requirements. Department Response: Comparison of mere numbers of hours without comparing course content is n't helpful to this review. No changes were made to the report in response to these comments. HEALTH CARE AUTHORITY The department received a letter requesting the following clarifications and updates about the Health C are Authority' s initial letter of comment: 1. Modification of the characterization of the HCA's perspective. R evise this statement to \"recognizes the potential benefit of more convenient and comprehensive health care of clients whose primary care provider is a naturopath, if appropriate and clearly defined pharmacology education and training for naturopaths were required in conjunction with this change in the scope of practice authority for naturopaths.\" 2. Clarifica tion of the HCA's concerns . The HCA' s primary concern is than an increase in prescriptive authority must include adequate pharma cology education and training. It was concerned with the vagueness in the original applicant report and suggested a one -year residency. However, after reading follow up comments from the applicant, finding out the rarity of naturopathic residencies, and reviewing the proposed supplemental education and continuing education submitted, the HCA has less concern with the adequacy of pharmacology training as it relates to the limited prescriptive authority it suggests . 3. Concerns in the report over prescription and overuse in patients on Medicaid . Almost without exception, the deaths from opioids have occurred in patients on chroni c therapy. Short -term treatment with controlled substances is much safer and at times indicated. 4. Medicaid's expanded demographic. The HCA agreed with the applicant that Medicaid will include an expanded demographic of patients with medical conditions requi ring controlled substances in the naturopathic primary care setting and that naturopaths can offer valuable contributions with alternatives that may decrease the need for opioid medications. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 31 5. Support proposal with limitations. The HCA would s upport the applicant's proposal if prescriptive authority for controlled substances was limited to the treatment of acute conditions and for a limited amount of time. Treatment f or chronic condition should be done in collaboration with specialists. 6. Benefits. E xpanded prescriptive authority will allow naturopaths to manage primary care patients when they have acute and time limited conditions re quiring controlled substances. In the acute setting, this will reduce disruption of care and may also reduce unnecessary emerg ency department visits. Department Response: The report has been revised to include the requested clarifications , corrections, and updates. It has also been revised to address the potential benefit of limited prescriptive authority for acute conditions , including reduc tion in delays in care and unnecessary emergency department visits. This is a similar approach to the prescripti ve authority for optometrists. However, the complex prescriptive authorities for various professions cause confusion for prescribers and place pharmacists in an awkward position of gatekeeper when filling prescriptions . Clear parameters must be set for pharmacists to effectively play this role. SAM RUSSO, ND, Lac, RMSK, CONTRIBUTOR TO VERMONT REPORT The department received a letter from one of the contributors to the Vermont report cited in the draft sunrise requesting the following clarifications and corrections to the draft report: 1. Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination . It didn't review the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination , but received information from the organization about its exam. After the report was published, Dr. Russo stated that he revisited the information on the exam core clinical science examination and found that it does evaluate the clini cal aspects of pharmacology. 2. Corrections to information on Vermont in Appendix E. R equested c orrection to the table of pharmacology education/continuing education t o indicate the information was taken from the administrative rules, not statute. 3. Pharmacology examination. T he Vermont rules will be updated to strike the requirement to pass the National Board of Medical Examiners pharmacology exam or the exam given at the University of Vermont's College of Medicine... and will be replaced with \"an exam ination created by the Office of Professional Regulation .\" Vermont found that naturopaths aren't eligible to take the National Board of Medical Examiners and the University of Vermont exams were not appropriate because they test for intro ductory pharmacolo gy training. A new exam is available. 4. Vermont formulary. Requested corrections on page 16, fourth paragraph to 1) show that the current formulary will sunset in 2015 and naturopaths will either be able to pursue a license endorsement to prescribe within their scope of training or have no prescriptive authority; and 2) expand on \"errs on the side of publi c protection.\" One of the reasons Vermont chose a two tiered system was to accommodate for the variation in training among naturopath programs. 5. Oregon and Arizona schools. Requested the department address more in the report about Oregon's and Arizona's naturopathic colleges that provide training in controlled substances, rather than focusing on Bastyr. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 32 Department Response: The report h as been revi sed to reflect the se clarifications and corrections. However, no changes were made to the report regarding Oregon and Arizona pharmacology training because detailed information on these schools wasn't provided by the applicant . Jane Guiltinan, ND Dean and Professor, School of Naturopathic Medicine, Bastyr University Dr. Guiltinan wrote that Bastyr is willing and able to develop and offer a continuing medical educational program on controlled substances through its continuing education department to address any deficiencies in core training required by the legislature and Board of Naturopathy. She offered Bastyr's assistance in developing the education and training requirements to ensure public safety and optimal care by naturopaths in using controll ed substances. In addition, she corrected the number of pharmacology hours she provided at the sunrise hearing, stating it is actually 88 didactic hours, rather than 60.5. Department Response: This was new information so t he report has been revised accordi ngly. Board of Naturopathy The board wrote in support of the applicant's proposal, stating: The practice of naturopathic medicine seeks to restore and maintain health by emphasizing the natural and inherent self -healing process, starting with the least in vasive method possible. The continuum of care and treatment modalities should include the full range of medical options, including controlled substances, which ensures greater health care options for Washington residents . The board supports the applicant's intent to include rulemaking authority for the board, which would be similar to the efforts in 2005 when legend drugs, codeine, and testosterone were added to the naturopathic scope of practice. The foundation of naturopath education is sound and the academic standards include a strong curriculum in clinical pharmacology, prescription drug management, and patient safety monitoring. It recognized the example of the University of Washington School of Medicine's significant phar macology training and stated that Bastyr also has a curriculum robust in pharmacology that meets or exceeds that of other prescribers. The board agreed that an increase in prescriptive authority to include controlled substances would require additional spe cific training to a degree comparable to that of other prescribers. The board stated it supports the applicant's intent to include additional continuing education hours specific to pharmacology. The board stated it supports the applicant's intent for adopt ion of pain management rules to address concerns about opioid abuse and misuse and ensure public and patient safety. The board stated it is confident the history of safe prescribing supported by naturopathic - complaint history will continue with expanded prescriptive authority. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 33 Department Response: Since these comments are not rebuttals to the report, no changes were made to the report except to include the board's support for the proposal. Additional Rebuttals to Draft Sunrise from Providers and Patients We received rebuttal letters from 13 naturopath patients supporting the applicant's proposal, and agreeing that the current need for referral to another health care provider for controlled substance prescriptions causes problems. These include increased costs to patients to see another provider such as multiple co -pays; loss of time from work or family ; and disruption in coordination of care. These patients indicated trust in their naturopathic primary care providers and the relationship they h ave developed, and that they often distrust other types of providers they have been required to see in order to receive controlled substances. Some patients indicated they were forced to stop taking necessary medications due to high medical bills and chall enges with being referred. We received eight rebuttal letters from naturopaths , their staff, and other health care providers indicating support for the applicant's proposal. These comments agreed with the applicant that naturopaths are qualified to prescr ibe controlled substances, and that the principles of naturopathic medicine allow for these types of prescriptions when less invasive methods do not work. These comments also agreed with the applicant's assertions that the current prescriptive authority ca uses challenges, including dual uti lization and additional costs. They also cited issues with titrating patients off of controlled substances (reducing dosage) when implementing an alternative treatment plan. The department received four comments generall y supporting the applicant's proposal and asking the department to reconsider the draft recommendations. Department Response: The report has been revised to include this information. Additional Comments Supporting Department's Draft Recommendations We also received seven additional letters supporting the recommendations in the draft report. Three were from health care providers - an advanced registered nurse pra ctitioner in psychiatric practice and two pharmacists. One of the letter s was from the Ame rican Naturopathic Medical Association oppos ing expand ed prescriptive authority for naturopaths (and stating the current prescriptive rights of naturopaths should be rescinded) . It state d it receives many complaints regarding naturopaths prescribing , Council on Naturopathic Medical Education approved naturopathic schools don't train at the same level as allopathic medical schools, and to grant prescriptive authority for any drug is confusing to the public and dangerous due to the naturopath level of ed ucation. Department Response: No changes were made to the report in response to the se comment s.

Summary: A naturopath may prescribe and a dminister controlled substance s contained in Schedules II through V of the u niform controlled substances act , chapter 69.50 RCW, necessary in the practice of naturopathy. Proposed Amendments: WANP recommends the Final Sunrise Review Report and Recommendations to the Legislatur e include a pain management section that conforms with HB 2876 (2010) Concerning pain management (Moeller); plus the following two bolded amendments that will require authorization by the Board of Naturopathy because H 4573.4 fails to require such authorization: Sec. 3. RCW 69.41.030 and 2013 c 71 s 1 and 2013 c 12 s 1 are e ach reenacted and amended to read as follows: (1) It shall be unlaw ful for any person to sell, deliver, or possess any legend drug except upon the order or prescription of \"....a naturopathic physician u nder chapter 18.36A RCW when authorized by the board of naturopathy, ....\" Sec. 5.

(12) \"Practitioner\" means ... a naturopathic physician under chapter 18.36A RCW when authorized to prescribe by the board of naturopathy .... Name and title of profession the applicant seeks to credential/institute change in scope of practice: Naturopathy (Naturopathic Physicians) RCW 18.36A Applicant's organization: Washington Association of Naturopathic Physicians (WANP) person: Robert May, ND - Executive Director Address: 9500 Roosevelt Way NE, Ste number: 2065472130 Email address: executive@wanp.org of members in the organization: Approximately 350 Approximate number of individuals practicing in Washington: 850 Name(s) and address(es) of national organization(s) with which the state organization is affiliated: The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians 818 18th Street, NW, Suite 250 Washington, DC 20006 www.naturopathic.org Name(s) of other state organizations representing the profession: None Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 55 OUTLINE OF FACTORS TO BE ADDRESSED Please refer to RCW 18.120.030 (a ttached) for more detail. Concise, narrative answers are encouraged. Please explain the following: (1) Define the problem and why regulation is necessary: In Washington State, Naturopathi c physicians (NDs) are licensed and regulated by the State Board of Naturopathy and have primary care scope of practice, includi ng prescriptive authority for legend drugs, and the controlled substa nces testosterone and codeine. NDs are not currently authorized to prescribe other controlled substa nces commonly used in primary care practice. As of January 2014, NDs are eligible to enroll as primary care providers in Apple Health (Medicaid) and are covered in the Exchange Medicaid Insurance plans, including Coordinated Care Corp., Community Health Plan of Washington, and Molina Healthcare of W ashington. This expanded demographic includes many patient s with medical conditions that require controlled substances in the primary care setting. Due to the limitations on ND pre scriptive authority, NDs now mu st refer patients to other primary care providers when controlled su bstances are necessary. This r esults in \"dualutilization\" of medical providers, and increased costs to patients, insurers, a nd the State. It also interferes with optimal patient care by disrupting continuity and coordination of care. In addition, the wellknown and increasing shortage of primary care providers due to the expansion of Medicaid and increased coverag e under the Affordable Care Ac t is making such referrals more challenging. (2) The efforts made to address the problem: H 4573.4, as submitted by Represe ntative Cody, is the specific effort to update the naturopathic practice act (RCW 18.36A) to addr ess the problem described abov e. (3) The alternatives considered: NDs are licensed and regulated b y the State Board of Naturopath y. However, the Board cannot provide for such expansion of scope. Legislation, with rulemak ing by the Board of Naturopathy, is required to make this change in prescriptive authority. (4) The benefit to the public if regulation is granted: Benefits to the public, insuranc e carriers and the State, inclu de lower costs, improved quality of care and increased access to primary care providers. Regulation and supervision by the Board of Naturopathy will assure proper qu alifications, education, train ing, examinations, and maintenance of competency. (5) The extent to which regulation might harm the public: The need for regulation of contro lled substances to protect the public from harm is well documented and was further ident ified in the passage of HB 2876 (2010) Concerning pain management (Moeller), which required healt h care provider boards and comm issions to adopt new and extensive rules regarding ch ronic, noncancer pain management. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 56 (6) The maintenance of standards: The Washington State Board of Nat uropathy regulates the naturop athic profession. This body is responsible for and subject to all of the oversight provisions and requirements for effective quality assurance standards to exist in the health profession as define d in the following: RCW 18.130 Regulation of Health Professions Uniform Disciplin ary Act WAC 24612 Administrative Procedu re and Requirements for Credentialed health Care Providers WAC 24616 Standard of Professional Conduct Ultimate oversight is already in place under the Washington Sta te Secretary of Health. (7) A description of the group proposed for regulation, including a list of associations, organizations, and other groups representing the practitioners in this state, an estimate of the number of practitioners in each group, and whether the groups represent different levels of practice. Naturopathic physicians are the group proposed for regulation a nd are already licensed under RCW 18.36A and regulated by the State Board of Naturopathy under WAC 246836. The Washington Association of Naturopathic Phys icians (WANP) is the only group in the state representing naturopathic physicians, and h as done so since 1934. WANP does not represent groups with different levels of practice. According to the Department of H ealth, there are currently 1177 NDs licensed in Washington State (as reported at the May 16, 2014, State Board of Naturopathy public meeting.) (8) The expected costs of regulation: NDs are already eligible to obtain DEA numbers at a cost of app roximately $750 every 3 years. We anticipate additional requirements and costs for continuing edu cation and training for those NDs who choose to prescribe the controlled substances listed under Bill #: H 4573.4. We do not foresee any additional costs to the State from this l egislation. (9) List and describe major functions and procedures performed by members of the profession (refer to titles listed above.) Indicate percentage of time typical individual spends performing each function or procedure: Naturopathic physicians are reco gnized in statute and in practi ce as primary care providers in the State of Washington. See attached reference. As primary care providers, NDs supervise, coordinate, and provi de initial care or continuing care to patients, and initiate a referra l for specialty care and mainta in supervision of health care services rendered to the covered person.

Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 61 HB 2549 (2008) Establishing a patientcentered primary care collaborative program (Seaquist). NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. The legislature finds that our primary care system is severely faltering and the number of people choosing primary care as a profession is decreasing dramatically. Primary care providers include family medicine and general internal medicine physicians, pediatricians, naturopathic physicians , advanced registered nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 62Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Follow Up Questions to Applicant Responses from Washington Association of Naturopathic Physicians Contact: Robert May, ND executive@wanp.org 2065472130 July 9, 2014 1. Please explain generally how prescription of controlled substances fits within the traditional philosophy and practice of naturopathy. The scope of naturopathic medicine has evolved since its inception to include primary care practice. As the profession has grown and become more integrated within the larger healthcare system, the patient demographics have changed as well. ND s now participate in Medicaid, as well as all private insurance plans in Washington. To meet the needs of this larger patient population NDs need prescriptive authority for controlled substances Schedule II V. Traditional naturopathic philosophy emphasizes the importance of supporting the patient's innate healing capacity and thus includes a wide array of 'n atural' therapeutics, such as diet, lifestyle and nutritional medicine. However, this philosophy does not preclude the use of treatments that are in the best interest of the patient and meet the current standard of care. NDs are currently trained and licensed to utilize prescription drugs, including testosterone and codeine products in Schedules III, IV and V. Such prescriptions are most commonly used when nonpharmaceutical treatments are not appropriate to address a patient's condition at a particular time. 2. Schedules II through V of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act (UCSA) broadly includes opium/opiates, stimulants, depressants, narcotics, and anabolic steroids, with specific substances and drugs fully set forth in Chapter 69.50 RCW. (A) From among the listed drugs and substances in these schedules, which are those that would be commonly used in primary care practice of naturopathic physicians, for what specific purpose, and with what frequency? ND education and scope of practice focuses on primary care services. Therefore, the ND use of controlled substances will be limited to those medications appropri ate for primary care services. In addition, NDs have a wide array of nonpharmacologic treatments and have many options for treatment that do not involve use of controlled substances. See the attached list of 'top twenty' most commonly prescribed controlled substances from the Prescrip tion Review Program of the Washington Department of Health. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 63We anticipate, and recommend, that with the addition of prescriptive authority for controlled substances, NDs will be subject to all provisions of the Pain Management Rules, RCW 18.32.785, as applied to ARNPs, MDs, and DOs. (B) Similarly, which of the listed drugs and substances would be rarely or never used in a naturopathic setting? NDs would rarely or never use those controlled medications not recognized or appropriate for primary care practice. Please see the 'top twenty' most commo nly prescribed controlled substances list referenced above. We expect NDs prescription patterns will parallel the frequency of use reflected in this data and that additional controlled substances will rarely be used. 3. Is it your intent to include all Sched ule II - V controlled substances, or do you intend for the board of naturopathy to have authority to limit the medications in rule? Yes, it is our intent to include all Schedule II - V controlled substances, consistent with the ND primary care scope of pra ctice. However, the WANP has also requested in our Applicant Report that the legislature includes the following three amendments to H4573.4/14 4th in the final Sunrise Review Report and Recommendations to the Legislature. These Amendments will require the Board of Naturopathy to (1) adopt new rules on chronic, non cancer pain management under HB 2876 (2010) Concerning pain management (Moeller); and (2) to authorize a naturopathic physician to prescribe controlled substances, as follows: (1) Include a pain management section that conforms with HB 2876 (2010) Concerning pain management (Moeller); plus the following two underlined amendments that will require the Board of Naturopathy to authorize a naturopathic physician to prescribe controlled substances because H 4573.4 fails to require such authorization: (2) Sec. 3. RCW 69.41.030 and 2013 c 71 s 1 and 2013 c 12 s 1 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows: (1) It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, deliver, or possess any legend drug except upon the order or prescription of \"....a naturopathic physician under chapter 18.36A RCW when authorized by the board of naturopathy, ....\" (3) Sec. 5. RCW 69.45.010 and 2013 c 19 s 81 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows: .... (12) \"Practitioner\" means ... a naturopathic physician under chapter 18.36A RCW when authorized to prescribe by the board of naturopathy .... These amendments will conform naturopathic laws to those of the ARNP, DO, and MD boards and commissions regarding pain management. They will also require the Board of Naturopathy to promulgate new rules covering new education and training requirements for these new controlled substances as further discussed below. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 644. Do you have specific data to support the reference to the \"well known and increasing shortage of primary care providers due to the expansion of Medicaid and increased coverage under the Affordable Care Act?\" Yes. Please see the attached document entitled, 'SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS REFERENCES.' 5. RCW 18.120.030(4)(c) asks the extent to which th e public can be confident that qualified practitioners are competent. - (A) What education and training qualifies naturopaths to prescribe controlled substances? - (B) Please include initial education and training, as well as continuing education currently available to ensure ongoing competency. - (C) Please be specific on course content and credits/length and how this compares to the level of preparatio n offered to other licensed professions with full prescriptive authority. - (D) Please also be specific regarding curricula both in Washington and for outof state schools offering naturopathy training. - (E) Please describe both the current curricula and the training receiv ed by practitioners who graduated within the prior thirty years. - (F) The draft bill expands the scope of practice for all naturopathic physicians. How can the public be confident all currently licensed naturopaths have sufficient training? According to Bastyr University, the largest naturopathic medical institution in the country, ND curriculum requires satisfactory completion of a total of 4383.5 hours of instruction. Of these hours, 3173.5 are didactic and 1210 are clinical with 60.5 hours dedicated to pharmacology. In addition, medication management is included in many of the clinical science courses in third and fourth year, though it is very difficult to provide an exact number of hours for these. The State of Vermont, which is in the process of finalizing full prescriptive authority for NDs, surveyed a number of naturopathic medical institutions in the US and Canada and report those hours of pharmacology instruction are as follows: Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, Toronto, ON - 70 hours National University of Health Sciences, Lombard, IL - 90 hours National College of Natural Medicine, Portland, OR - 72 hours Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine, Scottsdale, AZ - 96 hours In Washington State, naturopathic physicians have had prescriptive authority for all legend drugs, including testosterone and codeine products in Schedules III, IV and V, since 2007 (WAC 246836210 and 246.836.211 .) The WANP understands, according to DOH data, that there have not been any complaints against NDs for prescribing substances that are in the current authorized scope (i.e. legend drugs; codeine and testosterone products.) Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 65Public confidence in ND competence is enhanced by the requirements that all naturopathic graduates must currently take and pass national board licensing exams (NPLEX) that include pharmaco therapeutic agents in schedules IIV. In addition to the national examinations, the Department of Health, in November 2007, implemented WAC 246.836.210 and 246.836.211 requiring all NDs to complete additional educational hours for prescriptive authority for legend substances and the controlled substances testosterone and codeine products. Continuing education requirements for NDs in Washington State are defined in WAC 246.836.080. The WANP will recommend to the legislature the inclusion of a requirement for the Board of Naturopathy to promulgate rules covering education and training requirements for this expanded prescriptive authority. The WANP recommends the DOH and other professions directly provide information about 'the level of preparation offered to other licensed professions with full prescriptive authority.' Since 2005, all NDs, including those who graduated within the prior thirty years, have been required to meet the education requirements specified in WAC 246.836.211. Similarly, to qualify for ex panded prescriptive authority, NDs will have to meet appropriate and clearly defined educational requirements promulgated by the Board of Naturopathy following passage of thi s legislation, including the amendments recommended above. Evidence of public confidence in NDs is demonstrated by a finding in the 2013-2014 Puget Sound Health Alliance report that rated Bastyr Center for Natural Health the fourth highest score for 'Overall Rating of the Provider', a measure of the patient's overall satisfaction. This was out of 46 medical groups with clinics in 185 locations across the Puget Sound region. The Center includes the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program. 6. RCW 18.120.030(3) asks what alternatives were considered to the proposal. - (A) Did you consider options other than granting full prescriptive authority to address the problem you identified with treating an expanded demographic? - (B) Is full prescriptive authority, including all Schedule IIV controlled substances, the only option? Yes, full prescriptive authority, including all Schedule IIV controlled substances, is the only option available for treating the expanded demographic of patients in Washington. RCW 18.36A.020 (10) of the Naturopathy Practice Act, specifically prohibits the prescribing of controlled substances other than codeine and testosterone products that are contained in Schedules III, IV, and V in chapter 69.50 RCW. Therefore, only an amendment to this law will extend the authority to prescribe controlled substances to NDs. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 66Naturopathic prescriptive authority will be the same as that of ARNPs in a primary care setting. Full authority is necessary to address the full range of primary care clinical situations and also to maintain the ability for NDs to access new drugs that will surely be developed for use in primary care over time. Expanded prescriptive authority is also necessary to maintain access to changes in classification of medications. This recently occurred with Tramadol, previously a legend medication. It will soon be reclassified as a Schedule IV drug and NDs will no longer have authority to prescribe it.

Data as of: 6/16/2014 STATE: WASHINGTON County: All Counties Discipline: Primary Medical Care Open Positions = 63 PCP positions available in WA State As of January 1, 2014: USA: There are currently approximately 6,000 designated Primary Care HPSAs. Primary Care HPSAs are based on a physician to population ratio of 1:3,500. In other words, when there are 3,500 or more people per primary care physician, an area is eligible to be designated as a primary care HPSA. Applying this formula, it would take approximately 8,000 additional primary care physicians to eliminate the current primary care HPSA designations. Additionally, the formula used to designate primary care HPSAs does not take into account the availability of additional primary care services provided by Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants in an area. Other sources describing primary care supply use other ratios; for example, a ratio of 1 physician to 2,000 population. To meet this ratio, approximately 16,000 more primary care physicians would need to be added to the current supply (reporting on HRSA's findings for Shortage Areas Statistics, as of April 28, 2014, for Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Areas) http://kff.org/other/state indicator/primary carehealthprofessional shortage areas hpsas/ Sources: Bureau of Clinician Recruitment and Service, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, HRSA Data Warehouse: Designated Health Professional Shortage Areas Statistics, as of April 28, 2014 Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) Location Total Primary Care HPSA Designations Percent of Need Met Practitioners Needed to Remove HPSA Designation United States 6,0871 60.41% 8,073 Washington 147 46.71% 228 NOTES: For primary medical care, the population to provider ratio must be at least 3,500 to 1 (3,000 to 1 if there are unusually high needs in the community). The number of primary care HPSA designations includes HPSAs that are proposed for withdrawal and HPSAs that have no data. By statute, designations are not withdrawn until a Federal Register Notice is published, generally once a year on or around July 1. The percent of need met is computed by dividing the number of physicians available to serve the population of the area, group, or facility by the number of physicians that would be necessary to eliminate the primary care HPSA (based on a ratio of 3,500 to 1 (3,000 to 1 where high needs are indicated)).The number of additional primary care physicians needed to achieve a population toprimary care physician ratio of 3,500 to 1 (3,000 to 1 where high needs are indicated) in all designated primary ca re HPSAs, resulting in their removal from designation.

However, to paraphrase a common axiom, no good news comes without consequence. While many agree it is good news that more U.S. residents have access to coverage, the influx of insured residents also means that the focus might need to be redoubled on a pre existing problem: a shortage of primary care providers .

Specifically, duplicative, fragmented, and delayed services will be minimized or elimin ated; as well as emergency room referrals for filling Schedule II V prescriptions and double billing. All health care practitioners recognize the potential harm to the public if appropriate medication therapy is delayed. Restricting availability of Schedule II V drugs to ND patients represents a serious risk to public life, health, and safety. Benefits of ND Prescriptive Authority for Controlled Substances, Schedules II - V, also include the following: a) The public will benefit by the availability of additional qualified providers, already functioning in their primary care practice capacity, to prescribe prescription drugs, which may be more appropriate and less costly for the patient. b) The State benefits because ND licensing fees cover all the costs of regulating ND education, training, and enforcement. c) Patients will benefit in the reduction in time off work and transportation costs. d) Patients are also protected by existing Drug Enforcement Agency requirements that apply equally to NDs and other health care providers who prescribe controlled substances. The Board of Pharmacy also provides sanctions for misuse of controlled substances. e) Patients will benefit from ND treatment of the whole person as primary care providers, assuring continuity in patient treatment and greater accountability of the provider. Patien ts will feel more assured when they have one provider to go to regarding their care and treatment. f) Patient care is also assured because NDs are already trained as PCPs to use independent judgment, consult with other health care providers, know their scope limits, and refer patients to more specialize d providers when necessary. g) And, NDs are traditionally very conservative in prescribing medications and typically utilize more natural, educational, lifestyle approaches, unless otherwise indicated for specific patient needs.

Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 76Additional Comments on Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Responses from Washington Association of Naturopathic Physicians Contact: Robert May, ND executive@wanp.org 2065472130 July 27, 2014 Overview In comments submitted to the Department of Health and offered in testimony at the public hearing on July 17, 2014, it is evident that there are two primary concerns of opponents to this Sunrise Review: 1) Public safety in relation to prescription of opiatebased medications, and 2) Naturopathic education and training The WANP recogniz es and agrees that both of these issues need to be addressed in order for the proposed legislation to serve the public good and improve the quality of naturopathic medical care in our State. We recognize the wide spread public health issues in our state and across the countr y related to the abuse and addict io n from opiate medications, as well as the potential for overdose and serious adverse reactions with these drugs. We recognize that expanded prescriptive authority carries with it a significantly increased burden of responsibility for NDs and that such expanded authority also raises issues of drugseeking behavi or and diversion of medications. To address these increased risks to public safety, we advocate for inclusion in the proposed legislation of, and will promote to the naturopathic profession, awareness and use of, all of the State's systems, monitoring, and reporting programs related to controlled substance prescribing, including: Pain Mana gement statutory (http://www.doh.wa.gov/ForPublicHeal thandHealthcareProviders/Healthca reProfessionsandFacilities/Presc riptionMonitoringProgramPMP.aspx), Naturopathic Scope of Practice Pain Management Resources (http://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermi tsandCertificates/MedicalCommissi on/MedicalResources/PainManagement.aspx ). These established programs, in addition to the increased requirements for education and training that are detailed below, will ensure public safety by providing NDs with resources to safely and competently utilize medications from Schedules II - V in their primary care practices. We also want to highlight the safe and successful prescriptive practices of naturo pathic physicians at their current level of prescriptive authority. Since 2007 NDs in Washington have had authority for ALL legend drugs, and the controlled substances testosterone and codeine products. In addition to the aforementioned and widely recognized issues of abuse and addiction with opiate medications, it should be noted that man y legend drugs have signif icant potential for drug interactions, (e.g. MAO inhibitors, antifungal azole medications, Coumadin), require more knowledge and monitoring to prescribe with safe parameters (e.g. Coumadin, lithium, insulin) and have serious potential side effects and complications (e.g. insulin, NSAIDs, diuretics, SSRIs). The fact that NDs have incorporated legend drugs into their primar y care practices successfully and without complaint or disciplinary action from the DOH since 2007 demonstrates that our doctors have a significant and working awareness and competence in medication therapy and management - and that with the supplemental education requirements proposed below - will be able to incorporate expanded prescriptive authority for Schedule II - V medicatio ns successfully and to the public' s bene fit. We also offer the perspective that one of the primary factors impacting patient safety with regard to prescription medications is a strong doctor / patient relationship. Both naturopathic medical education and philosophy emphasize a comprehensive unders tanding of mult iple health factors in patient assessment, including psychosocial parameters that give the doctor more insight into the core issues impacting a patient's health. NDs also emphasize patient education and selfresponsibility for health positive behaviors. This is the reason that naturopathic office visits tend to take Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 78more time, with 60minute initial visits and 30minute return visits quite common among the profession. These naturopathic practice patterns and emphasis on the doctor - patient relationship, in combination with the wide array of other traditional non drug naturopathic modalities, such as clinical nutrition, lifestyle counseling, body work techniques, and stress managem ent practi ces create a foundation in which the use of controlled substance prescriptions can be used in lower dosages and for shorter periods of time, thus limiting the inherent abuse and addiction potential of these substances. The proposals offered below for increasing both supplemental and continuing competency education will ensure that NDs safely and competently prescribe medications from Schedules II - V. We believe these addition al educatio nal requirements address the issues raised in the public hearing and the written comments submitted to the DOH. DOH Public Hearing Panel Questions from 7/7/14 1. Much of the information you've submitted emphasizes the naturopath's relationship to primary care, but I don't have a good sense of the range of what is considered \"primary care.\" Could you please describe common conditions or medical issues that are likely to present among patients seeking primary care from naturopaths? Primary care has the same meaning for naturopathic physic ians th at it does for other primary care providers, such ARNPs, MDs, DOs and PAs. Please see the attached document including a description of 'primary care' from the American Academy of Family Physicians. NDs manage and treat the same spectrum of acute and chronic conditio ns. (\"AAFP primar y care definition.\") In naturopathic practice, common conditions include, but are not limited to, infections, abdominal pain and digestive disorders, chest pain, sprains and strains, fatigue, headaches, fevers, skin conditions, as well as chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, anxiety, depression, hormone issue s, diabetes, skin condit ions, and women's health Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 79issues. Like other primary care providers, NDs also perform physical exams, PAP smears and wellchild visits. They order laboratory tests, provide immunizations and refer for specialist services whenever appropriate. NDs have been providing primary care services for nearly 20 years in Washington and are recognized for contracting and reimbursement by all major health plans , including the Medicaid and Labor and Industries systems. Claims for naturopathic services utilize the same AMA CPT codes for office visits and primary care procedures as other primary care providers. Diagnoses are recorded with the same ICD9 coding system used throughout the health care system. In additio n, the WANP has already prese nted continuing education programs for naturopathic physicians in the new ICD10 diagnostic coding system set to take effect in October 2015. 2. Your submittals state that \"the ND use of controlled substances will be limited to those medications appropriate for primary care services\" and that \"NDs would rarely or never use tho se controlled medications not recognized or appropriate for primary care practice.\" Could you please talk about which of the Schedule IIV substances would be appropriate for the primary care services you've described? Examples of common controlled substances that could be used in naturo path ic pr imary care practice include, but are not limited to the following: Schedule V: Codeine products - Cough suppressant (authorized currently) Pregabalin - Analgesic in neuropathic pain Lomatil / Preparations w/small amts of opium - Tramadol - Analgesic Soma - Antispasmodic (Very rarely prescribed) Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 80 Schedule III: Vicodin - Analgesic Marinol - Antinausea (Very rarely prescribed) Tylenol 3 - Analgesic (authorized currently) Testosterone - Anabolic steroid (authorized currently) Schedule II: Ritalin - for ADHD Adderall Stimulant for ADHD and Narcolepsy Oxycodone - Analgesic for severe pain Desoxyn - Stimulant for ADHD and Obesity Codeine - Analgesic for acute pain, NSAID allergy Morphine - Analgesic for severe chronic pain (as an alternative to Oxycodone, rarely) As with all other professions with prescriptive authority, NDs must practice within the limits of their training and licensed scope of practice. 3. Can you give us a general estimate of the percentage of primary care cases that would require Schedule IIV substances? Specific data is not available to assess the actual percentage of controlled substance prescriptions by naturopathic physicians. We expect that ND prescriptive patterns will follow similar trends as other primar y care providers with the caveat that NDs may prescr ibe controlled substances less frequently as their patients are often seeking alternatives to drug therapies. 4. Some additional material you submitted draws a parallel between naturopaths and ARNP prescriptive authority. Have you read the ARNP rules relative to that group's prescriptive author ity, and are naturopaths seeking the same conditions and requir ements as those applied to ARNPs? The WANP has the ARNP rules for prescriptive authority\" Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 81We assume these Rules provide an assurance of public safety and regulation and we have identified numerous parallels in the scope of practice and need for controlled substances in Schedules II - V between the ARNP primary care providers and naturopathic primary care providers. In terms of naturopathic primary care services, we do advocate for comparable conditions and requireme n ts as those applied to ARNP primary care providers with regard to prescriptive authority for Schedules II V. 5. You have asserted that naturopaths will help to fill a shortage in primary care practitioners and provided numerous references to such a shortage in other documents, several of which specify shortages in rura l or underserved areas. You also included data from the federal Health Professions Shortage Areas database, which shows the distribution of shortage areas and underserved populations by county. Could you please talk about the geographic distribution of naturopaths in relation to the underserved areas and specific populations identified in the HR SA database? Attached are geographic maps (\"Maps ND by county 71814\") from the Department of Health identifying the location of NDs throughout Washington State. While the majority of NDs are currently located in King County, we anticipate continuing expansion into all areas of Washing ton. This is supported by a study conducted at Bastyr University th at identified a strong interest from naturopathic medical students in practicing in both rural and underserved areas of our state. The study is attached. (\"Survey ND student interest rural or underserved areas.\") We anticipate increasing numbers of NDs serving rural and unde rserv e d areas resulting from inclusion of NDs in Medicaid. However, as was noted in the ARNP Sunrise Review report of 1992, some providers \"are unwilling to move to rural locations because under current law they know that they cannot provide the full range of indicated medication therapy their patie nts might require.\" NDs face similar challe nges in pr imary care rural practices due to this limitation in prescriptive authority. 6. The proposed bill would give naturopaths prescriptive authority only for those Schedule IIV substances that are \"necessary in the practice of Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 82naturopathy.\" In your submittals, you've stated that you expect \"ND prescribing patterns will parallel the frequency of use\" shown in the Prescription Monitoring Program table you submitted. There are 20 items on that list, compared with considerably more than 20 substances and all manner of derivatives listed in Schedule II alone. At the same time, your submittals indicate your intent to include all Schedule IIV substances. Given what you've said about limitations of use to primary care and probable use paralleling the PMP list, could you please explain why everything on Schedules IIV is \"necessary in the practice of naturopathy\"? The WANP would like to be very clear that we do not consider \"eve rything on Schedules II -V is 'necessary to the practice of naturopathy'\" and most controlled substances are rarely, if ever used by any of the primary care professions , as evidenced in data from the Prescription Monitoring Program. This data shows that the twenty most common contro lle d substances, which account for less than 10% of all controlled substances and derivatives listed in Schedules II - V, constitute approximately 90% of controlled substance prescriptions. We also note that none of the professions with full prescriptive authority likely use ALL of the cont rolled substances available to them. However, the administrative model in use by all other prescribing professions will be applicable to NDs as well. Full access to Schedules II - V also allows for development and change in medication technology and classification of drugs, as has been seen recently with the reclassification of Tramadol from legend to Schedule IV status. Dentist s , podiatrists and nurse practitioners have full access to Schedules II - V, but only use those controlled substances as indicated and appropriate for their scope and patient populations. These same limitations will be in effect for NDs. As a result the WANP feels strongly that naturopathic phys icians need access to the full range of Schedule II - V controlled substances. The primary reason that NDs need prescriptive authority for Schedules II - V controlled substances is to provide optimal care. As primary care providers, NDs see the full range of patients and practice thro ughout the Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 83state, often as independent practitioners. In acute clinical situations, such as in a severe migraine headache, low back strain/sprain, or in an uncomplicated kidney stone, current prescriptive authority is insufficient and can prevent patients from receiving the most effective treatment. Similarly, in cases of episodic anxiety, current ND prescriptive authority does not include antianxiety medicatio ns that can adequately address a patient's needs. Patients in any of the above situations must currently incur the cost of time and expense to schedule with another type of provider for these otherwise very manageable situations. Also, in an urgent situation, lack of access to a medication from Schedule II - V could create a hazard for our patients by delaying medically necessary and appropriate therapy and contribute to excessive use of emergency department services. An additional reason for granting full scope prescriptive authority is that it allows the naturopathic profession to grow and evolve with changes in the health care and pharmaceutical industries. The recent reclassification of the drug Tramadol from legend status to Schedule IV is a good example of the type of problem that can occur when NDs have a limited or partial list of controlled substances. All providers with full prescriptive authority, including dent ists, podiatrists, and nurse practitioners, are required to practice within the limits of their training. Naturopathic physicians will be limited to the use of controlled substances appropriate to their scope of practice and within the context of naturopathic philosophy and training. Medications commonly used in primary care run the full spectrum of Scheduled drugs to unscheduled Legend drugs. Limiting a primary care prov ider's prescr iptive authority to legend drugs, plus testosterone and codeine products only, as the current naturopathic statute does, significantly compromises the doctor's ability to prescribe appropriate medications. For example, common medications used for treating ADHD and narcolepsy such as Ritalin and Concerta (methylphenidate) and rall but another common ADHD medication Stattera (atomoxetine) is a legend drug. While some ADHD patients may benefit from Straterra, if either of the other two most Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 84commonly used ADHD medications (Ritalin and Concerta) are needed, the patient would have to access a different provider. Common medications used to treat fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, such as Cymbalta (duloxetine) and Neurontin (gabapentin) are legend drugs, but Lyrica (pregabalin) is a schedule V medication. Again, one particular drug is not appro priate for all patients and primar y care providers need the ability to choose the medication that will be the safest and most effective. In some cases, primary care providers must provide a shortterm \"bridge\" prescription of a medication (such as a benzodiazepine) until the patient can access his or her original prescribing provider or spec ialist . Primary care providers also often help wean their patients off chronic benzodiazepines when the original prescriber or a specialist is not accessible. This is especially common in lowincome underserved clinic settings. And, since benzodiazepines are not included in the current ND prescriptive scope, ND patients must either risk potent ially severe withdrawal side effects from abrupt cessation of their medication, or they must access a different provider promptly. Currently, NDs have very limited medication options in cases of acute and chronic pain. These options include NSAIDs, Tylenol and Codeine products. NSAIDS such as naproxen and indomethacin are commonly used for mild to moderate acute pain and arthritis. Ho wever, in many cases, NSAIDs are inappropriate and potentially dangerous. For example, in patients using blood thinners like warfarin, patients with renal insufficiency, and patients with gastric ulcers these legend drugs are contraindicated. Tylenol (acetominophen) may help with mild to moderate pain but rarely helps alone in cases of more severe pain, and it may be inappro pri ate in patients with liver disease. Schedule III Tylenol #3 (acetaminophen/codeine) is in current ND prescriptive scope, but it is indicated for mild to moderate pain. Other common pain medications used by primary care providers for moderate to moderately severe pa in, such as Schedule III Vicodin (hydrocodone/acetaminophen) and schedule II Percocet Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 85(oxycodone/acetaminophen) can avoid some of the above mentioned problems, but are outside the current scope of NDs. Ultram (tramadol), a legend drug indicated for moderate to moderately severe acute pain, was a useful legend drug until just recently, when it was reclassified to a Schedule IV (and is now no longer within naturopathic prescr iptive author it y.) NDs use many nondrug therapies (such as physical medicine and manual techniques) to relieve pain and often are able to help patients avoid drug therapy completely. However, in cases where those treatments are not effective, or are not medically appropriate, conventional pain medications may be needed, including the commonly prescribed Sche duled medication s. These are just a few examples of how patient care, and in some cases patient safety, can be compromised by the current limitations in prescriptive authority - and they provide a strong rationale for expansion of ND authority to include medications in Schedules II - V. Response to Issues Raised at the Public Hearing \"Convenience\" The issue of 'patient convenience' was raised as insufficient reason to justify this expansion in prescriptive authority. The WANP fully agrees that convenience alone does not justify this legislative change. However, we also note that expanded prescriptive authority for NDs would decrease the need for patients to schedule additional office visits with additional providers solely for the prescription of a controlled substance. Such decreased utilization protects the doctor patient relationship and contributes to better case management, patient compliance, and quality of care and can save time and cost for additional medical visits, as well as unnecessary trips to the emergency department. The fact that NDs were not include d in th e chronic pain management bill in 2010 was also raised. When this bill was passed, NDs only had access to controlled substances testosterone and codeine products, as is currently the case. These controlled substances are not typically relevant to chronic Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 86pain management as defined in the bill and so inclusion of NDs was not warranted. An MD attendee at the public hearing who supports expansion of ND prescriptive authority offered the perspective that the doctor - patient relationship is of primary importance in prescription safety and effectiveness. The WANP agrees with this perspective and recognizes the natur e and average length of time of naturopathic office visits is consistent with this perspective. Extended facetoface time strengthens the doctor patient relationship and allows the doctor to both gather information and also educate patients about their condition and care. Education and Training It is evident from comments to the Department of Health prior to the public hearing that the primary concern about expanding naturopathic prescriptive authority is whether NDs have sufficient education and training to safely incorporate medications from Schedules II - V in their primary care practices. The WANP appreciates these concerns and is committed to advocating for high qualit y supplemental education for NDs as well as expanded continuing education require ments to ensure ongoing competency and public safety. Similar concerns were raised in 2005 when the legislature revised the naturopathic practice act RCW 18.36A to expand naturopathic prescriptive authority to include all legend drugs and the contro lle d substances testosterone and codeine products. Following that legislative action, the Department of Health implemented WAC 246836211 that requires the following in order for NDs to be eligible to apply for DEA certification (a pre requisite to prescribing controlled substances): WAC 246836211 Authorization regarding controlled substances. (1) Upon approval by the board, naturopathic physicians may obtain a current Federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration. The board may approve naturopathic physicians who have: (a) Provided documentation of a current Federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration from another state; or Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 87(b) Submitted an attestation of at least four twelve hours of instruction. Instruction must be part of a graduate level course from a school approved under chapter 18.36A , 18.71, 18.57, or 18.79 RCW. Instruction must include the following: (i) Principles of medication selection; (ii) Patient selection and therapeutics education; (iii) Problem identification and assessment; (iv) Knowledge of interactions, if any; (v) Evaluation of outcome; (vi) Recognition and management of complications and untoward reactions; and (vii) Education in pain management and drug seeking behaviors. (2) The naturopathic physician must retain training documentation at least five years from attestation date. Since implementation of WAC 246836211 in 2007, NDs have had expanded prescriptive authority and according to the Department of Health, there have been no formal charges made against an ND for prescribing within current authorized scope of practice. Such lack of formal charges against NDs also shows that a residenc y program, on top of WANP's prop osed education requirements, is not needed as ND education and training has been sufficient without residency ever since the passage of the ND's last scope bill mentioned above. Also, the WANP proposed education requirements will be greater than that of ARNPs and ARNPs have also shown that a residency progra m has not been needed as ARNPs obtained full prescriptive authority without a requirement for a residency program as well. In this Sunrise process, the WANP proposes to modify WAC 246836211 to require an additional 12 hours of supplemental education (currently 4 hours; ARNPs do not have a supple mental require ment) and training focused on controlled substances in Schedules II - V. In addition, the WANP proposes changes to continuing competency requirements for NDs, currently defined as follows: WAC 246836080 Continuing competency program. (1) Licensed naturopathic physicians must demonstrate completion of twenty thirty hours of continuing education as provided in chapter 24612 WAC, Part 7. Only courses in diagnosis and therapeutics as listed in RCW 18.36A.040 shall be eligible for credit. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 88(2) In emergency situations, such as personal or family illness, the board may in its discretion, for good cause shown, waive all or part of the continuing education requirement for a particular oneyear period for an individual licensee. The board may require such verification of the emergency as is necessary to prove its existence. We propose increasing the annual requirement for ongoing naturopathic continuing education to 30 hours per year (versus the current 20 hours; ARNPs require 22.5 hours per year.) We also recommend 10 hours , of the total 30 hours, be required in the area of pharmacology (not currently required; ARNPs require 7.5 hours per year of pharmacology.) This requiremen t for ongoing annual education in pharmacology is consistent with Oregon's requirement where NDs have had full scope prescriptive authority since 2007. It is also comparable to current continuing competency requirements in Washington for ARNPs who are required to have 15 hours of pharmacology credits every two years. Please note that the WANP plans to request the legislature to modify H4573.4 to include the amendments specified in our Applicant Report requiring the Board of Naturopathy to promulgate formal rulemaking that requires additional education and training for NDs. The WANP believes the aforementioned recommendations will ensure public safety and ongoing competency of naturopathic phys icians in prov iding optimal primary care services to the citizens of Washington. (See attached \"Added Legal References.\") Washington State Health Innovation Plan The Washington State Health Innovation Plan, published in January 2014, \"....is built to achieve three ultimate aims: better health, better care, and lower costs.\" Page iii.

Report to the Legislature In its report to the State legislature, the Health Care Authority has identified that lack of access to primary care results in unnecessary use of emergency departments. Approval of this Sunrise Review and passage of the proposed legislation can give NDs tools to more effectively help prevent such unnecessary use of emergency departments.

If a client does not have a primary care physician, or cannot be seen in a reasonable amount of time for a lowacuity need, he or she may turn to the emergency department. .....\" Conclusion In 1992, the Department of Health conducted a Sunrise Review entitled \"Expansion of ARNP Prescriptive Authority.\" The conclusion of that process was a recommendation from the DOH to approve expansion of prescriptive authority for ARNPs. The WANP notes numerous parallels throughout that report to the current Sunrise and the proposal to expand prescriptive author ity for naturopathic physicians. These include: In 1992, ARNPs had \"been legally prescribing legend drugs and Class V controlled substances in Washington for 13 years.\" NDs have been prescribing legend drugs and controlled substances limited to testosterone and codeine products in Schedules III - V for seven years. \"Their prescribing patterns have proven effective and safe. This is evidenced by: (1) an increased demand for ARNP services, particularly in areas of the health care system underserved by their physician counterparts; (2) high levels of patient satisfaction; and (3) minimal complaints about ARNP prescribers before the boards of Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 91nursing and pharmacy.\" o ND licenses in Washington have steadily increased and are now comparable to the number of osteopathic physicians at near 1200. o Evidence of public confidence in NDs is demonstrated by a finding in the 20132014 Puget Sound Health Alliance report that rated Bastyr Center for Natural Heal th - the teaching clinic for the natu ropathic medical program - the fourth highest score for 'Overall Rating of the Provider', a measure of the patient's overall satisfaction. This was out of 46 medical groups with clinics in 185 locations across the Puget Sound region. o According to the DOH, there have been no complaint s and no disciplinar y actions against NDs for prescribing within their current scope of practice. The concluding statements and DOH recommendation in support of the ARNP Sunrise Review of the 1992 identify risks and benefits to the public, including: \"Information provided indicates that restricting availability of Schedule II - IV drugs to certain segments of the population creates a lack of acce ss to care and represents a serious risk to the public life, health, and safety.\" o WANP Recommendation: With NDs already serving in primary care roles throughout Washington, the WANP believes that failure to expand prescriptive authority for NDs creates the same risk for lack of access to appro pri ate care for the public as was noted in 1992. And, \"The public would benefit by the availability of qualified providers, already functioning in an expanded practice capacity, to prescribe prescription drugs which may be more appropriate and less costly. ARNPs use indepe nden t judgm ent, deal with many of the same maladies as do Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 92physicians, consult with other health care providers, know their limits and know when to refer.\" o WANP Recommendation: In light of the documented increased need for primary care providers and increased access to care in Washington, the WANP believes that NDs are very well positioned to offer these same benefits to the public and that this statement is equa lly true for NDs with th e inclusion of expanded prescriptive authority for Schedule II - V controlled substances. We have identified numerous additional parallels in the 1992 ARNP Sunrise Review report and we have attached a copy for your review. Given that: the circumstances in effect when the ARNPs gained expanded authority are very similar to th ose at present, in terms of a need for increased access in many areas of Washington, that NDs have a demonstrated record of understanding drug therapy and incorporating it in their practices effectively since 2007, that there have been minimal complaints and disciplina ry action against NDs related to prescriptive authority, that the WANP is committed to inclusion of all pertinent controlled substance statutes, as applicable to other prescribing professions, that the WANP is committed to inclusion of an amendment to H4573.4 requiring the Board of Naturopathy to promulgate rules re quiring additional education and training, that the WANP is recommending supplemental education of 12 hours in controlled substances from recognized experts in the field, that the WANP is recommending increasing annual continuing competency requirements for NDs to 30 hours per year with 10 specifically in pharmacology, (beyond the current ARNP requiremen ts), Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 93 that NDs in Oregon have been successfully prescribing Schedules II - V since 2007, and that this scope expansion will benefit the public, the state, insurers and individual patients, the WANP encourages the Department of Health to recommend approval of expansion of naturopathic prescriptive authority to include Schedule II - V controlled substances. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 94WANP REFERENCES 1. Much of the information you've submitted emphasizes the naturopath's relationship to primary care, but I don't have a good sense of the range of what is considered \"primary care.\" Could you please describe common conditions or medical issues that are likely to present among patients seeking primary care from naturopaths? Primary Care http://www.aafp.org/about/policies/all/primarycare.html Primary Care In defining primary care, it is necessary to de scribe the nature of services provided to patients, as well as to identify who are the primary care providers. The domain of primary care includes the primary care physician, other physicians who include some primary care services in their practices, and some non-physician providers. However, central to the concept of primary care is the patient. Therefore, such definitions are incomplete without including a description of the primary care practice. The following five definitions relating to pr imary care should be taken together. They describe the care provided to the patient, the system of providing such care, the types of physicians whose role in the system is to provide primary care, a nd the role of other physicians, and non-physicians, in providing su ch care. Taken together they form a framework within which patient s will have access to efficient and effective primary care services of the highest quality. Definition #1 Primary Care Primary care is that care pr ovided by physicians specifically trained for and skilled in comprehensive first contact and continuing care for persons with any undiagnosed sign, symptom, or health concern (t he \"undifferentiated\" patient) not limited by problem origin (biological, behavioral, or soci al), organ system, or diagnosis. Primary care includes health promotion, disease prevention, health maintenance, counseling, patient education, di agnosis and treatment of acut e and chronic illnesses in a variety of health care settings (e.g., office, inpatient, critical care , long-term care, home care, day care, etc.). Primary care is pe rformed and managed by a personal physician often collaborating with other health professi onals, and utilizing consultation or referral as appropriate.Primary care provides patie nt advocacy in the health care system to Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 95accomplish cost-effective care by coordination of health care services. Primary care promotes effective communication with patients and encourages the role of the patient as a partner in health care. Definition #2 Primary Care Practice A primary care practice serves as the patient's first point of entry into the health care system and as the continuing focal point for all needed health care services. Primary care practices provide patients with ready access to their own personal physician, or to an established back-up physician when th e primary physician is not available. Primary care practices provide health promotion, disease prevention, health maintenance, counseling, patient education, di agnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illnesses in a variety of health care settings (e.g., office, inpatient, critical care , long-term care, home care, day care, etc.). Primary care practices are organized to meet the needs of patients with undifferentiated problems, with the vast majority of patient concerns and needs being cared for in the primary care practice itself. Primary care practices are generally located in the community of the patients, thereby facilitating access to health care while maintaining a wide variety of specialty a nd institutional consultative and referral relationships for specific care needs. The structure of the primary care practice may include a team of physicians and non-physician health professionals. Definition #3 Primary Care Physician A primary care physician is a generalist physi cian who provides definitive care to the undifferentiated patient at the po int of first contact and take s continuing responsibility for providing the patient's care. Such a physician must be specifically trained to provide primary care services. Primary care physicians devote th e majority of their practice to providing primary care services to a defined population of patients. The style of primary care practice is such that the personal primary care physician serves as the entry point for subs tantially all of the patient's medical and health care needs - not limited by problem origin, organ system, or diagnosis. Primary care physicians are advocates for the patient in coordinating the use of the entire health care system to benefit the patient. Definition #4 NonPrimary Care Physicians Providing Primary Care Services Physicians who are not trained in the primary care specialtie s of family medicine, general internal medicine, or general pediatrics may sometimes provide patient care services that are usually delivered by primary care physicia ns. These physicians may focus on specific patient care needs related to prevention, health ma intenance, acute care, chronic care or rehabilitation. These physicians, however, do not offer these services within the context of comprehensive, first c ontact and continuing care. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 96The contributions of physicians who deliver so me services usually f ound within the scope of primary care practice may be important to specific patient needs. However, the absence of a full scope of training in primary care requires that these individuals work in close consultation with fully-trained, primar y care physicians. An effective system of primary care may utilize these physicians as members of the health care team with a primary care physician maintaining responsibility for the function of the health care team and the comprehensive, ongoing he alth care of the patient. Definition #5 NonPhysician Primary Care Providers There are providers of health care other th an physicians who render some primary care services. Such providers may include nurse practitioners, physician assistants and some other health care providers. These providers of primary care may meet th e needs of specific patients. They should provide these services in colla borative teams in which the ultimate responsibility for the patient resides with the prim ary care physician. (1975) (2006) *In this document, the term physician refers only to doctors of medicine (M.D.) and osteopathy (D.O.). Use of Term The AAFP recognizes the term \"primary ca re\" and that family physicians provide services commonly recognized as primary care. However, the terms, \"primary care\" and \"family medicine\" are not interchangeable. \"Primary care\" do es not fully describe the activities of family physicians nor the pract ice of family medicine. Similarly, primary care departments do not replace the form or function of family medicine departments. (1977) (2011 COD) Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 97WANP Proposed WAC Amendments Prescriptive Authority for Schedule II - V Controlled Substances Annual Continuing Education WANP proposes increasing the annual requirement for ongoing naturopathic education to 30 hours of continuing education per year (versus current 20 hours; ARNPs require 22.5 hours per year) with 10 hours, of the total 30 hours, required to be in the area of pharmacology (not currently required; ARNPs require 7.5 hours). This requirement for ongoing annual education in pharmacology i s consistent with Oregon's requirement where NDs have had full scope prescriptive authority since 2 007. It is also comparable to cu rrent continuing competency requirements in Washington for ARNPs who are required to have 15 hours of pharmacology credits every two years. WAC 246836080 Continuing competency program. (1) Licensed naturopathic physicia ns must demonstrate completion of twenty thirty hours of continuing education with ten hours in 'pharmacology ' as provided in chapter 24612 WAC, Part 7. Only courses in diagnosis and therapeutics as listed in RCW 18.36A.040 shall be eligible for credit. (2) In emergency situations, suc h as personal or family illness , the board may in its discretion, for good cause shown, waive all or part of the continuing education require ment for a particular oneyear period for an individual licensee. The board may require such verification of the emergency as is necessary to prove its existence. Supplemental Education for NDs Supplemental Education and Training for DEA certification WANP proposes to modify WAC 246836211 to require an additional 12 hours of education (currently 4 hours; ARNPs do not have a Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 98supplemental requirement) in graduate level instruction by recognized experts in the use of controlled substances in the primary care setting. This is a onetime requirement for NDs to be eli gible for DEA certification. WAC 246836211 Authorization regarding controlled substances. (1) Upon approval by the board, naturopathic physicians may obt ain a current Federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration. The board may approve naturopathic physicians who have: (a) Provided documentation of a current Federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration from another state; or (b) Submitted an attestation of at least four 12 hours of instruction. Instruction must be part of a graduate level course from a school approved under chapter 18.36A, 18.71, 18.57, or 18.79 RCW. Instruction must include the following: (i) Principles of medication selection; (ii) Patient selection and therapeutics education; (iii) Problem identification and assessment; (iv) Knowledge of interactions, if any; (v) Evaluation of outcome; (vi) Recognition and management of complications and untoward reactions; and (vii) Education in pain managemen t and drug seeking behaviors.

Simon, PhD, ND, Pamela Snider, ND Seattle, Washington. Introduction Shortages in the primary care physician workforce are expected to worsen as the decade advances. Declining numbers of conventionally trained medical doctors (MDs) are in part due to little interest among students at medical schools in internal medicine as a career. A 2008 JAMA study found that only 23.2% of students surveyed responded that they were planning a career in internal medicine; only 2% of those were planning to become general practice or primary care physicians . These deficits impact rural and underserved communities hardest. In a longitudinal study by Rabinowitz et al that evaluated the Physician Shortage Area Program, the single most important variable associated with rural practice was rural origin. The objective of this survey was to ascert ain the rural living experience level among naturopathic medical students, their level of interest in serving as primary care providers in rural and/or urban underserved community settings, and their willingness to relocate to these areas in exchange for medical school loan repayment. Figure 1. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 103 Design, Setting, and Participants The survey was a web based cross -\u00adsectional survey of all medical students enrolled at one US naturopathic medical school, Bastyr University. All students received an invitat ion to complete the survey in the Fall quarter of 2010. The main outcome measures were student demographics, career interests, rural life experience level as measured by number of years lived in a rural area, willingness to relocate in exchange for medic al school loan repayment and year of medical school education. Results and Discussion There were 130 respondents to the online survey which was circulated among 407 active naturopathic students at Bastyr University. This represented a response rate of 33% . Among students that have lived in a rural area, those with a level 4 or 5 interest in practicing naturopathic medicine rurally was 59% with 77 of the 130 respondents. (Fig 2, below) There was a correlation with the most experience in rural areas and a le vel 5 desire to practice there with over half of those with 10 or more years of rural experience desiring to practice rurally. Figure 2: Level of interest in practicing naturopathic medicine in a rural area . (A rural community is defined as a city, town, or village of 2,500 citizens or less.) Rural living experience: 10 years or more, 5 -\u00ad10 years, 0-\u00ad5 years or none. There is a high level of interest among survey responders to practice naturopathic medicine in an underserved area. Those with a level 4 and 5 interest, 43 and 59 students respectively, represented 78% of all responders. (Fig 3, below) There seems to be a slight correlation between rural living experience and level of interest in practicing in underserved areas, but fully 33% of those with no rural experience expressed a level 5 interest level in practicing in an underserved area. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 1 2 3 4 5 Response Count Level of Interest Yes, 10 years or more Yes, 5 to 10 years Yes, 0 to 5 years No Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 104 Figure 3: L evel of interest in practicing naturopathic medicine in an underserved area .

Rural living experience: 10 years or more, 5-\u00ad10 years, 0-\u00ad5 years or none. The percentage of students with some rural living experience is 59% with 77 of the 130 respondents. Twenty three percent of the total has 10 or more years of rural experience. Interest in working with special populations among the naturopathic students surveyed was robust. The highest interest levels were for work with Native American/Tribal communities and the elderly. ( Fig. 4, below).

The willingness of survey responders to relocate to a rural and/or underserved community to practice naturopathic medicine in exchange for medical school loan repayment is overwhelmingly positive with 94.6% of respondents expressing this willingness.

Rural experience is not necessarily correlated with this interest, however, the high percentage of students who are from rural areas (59%) and e xpressed an interest in rural and underserved health care may provide answers to retention issues faced by state and federal loan forgiveness programs. As has been demonstrated, rural origin is the single most important variable associated with rural practice. The vast majority of students, with or without expressed interest in this type of practice, were also willing to relocate to rural or urban underserved communities in exchange for medical school loan repayment. This represents a ready, willing, and able work force to help alleviate the current and projected workforce shortage in primary care medicine. Future Plans The authors would first like to expand this survey to other naturopathic medical schools . A collaboration is under development with Jon Wardle, ND, MPH, PhD a Trans -\u00adPacific Fellow at the University of Washington and at the University of Queensland in Australia to perhaps then expand the survey to allopathic medical schools.

Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 107Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 108EXPANSION OF AUTHORITY OF ADVANCED REGISTERED NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO PRESCRIBE CERTAIN CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES INFORMATION SUMMARY BACKGROUND Senate Bill 5635 introduced in the 1991 session of the Legislature, proposed expanding the authority of advanced registered nurse practitioners (ARNPs) to prescribe certain controlled substances. On August 13, 1992, Representative Dennis Braddock, Chair of the House Committee on Health Care, requested that the Department of Health conduct a review of this proposal under the \"Sunrise\" law. The Department conducted a review according to the criteria in the \"Sunrise\" law (RCW 18.120.110) and the Department's Guidelines for Credentia1in~ Health Professions in Washin~ton State. The Department reported its findings and recommendations to the Legislature by December 31, 1992. The purpose of the Sunrise Act is to avoid regulation wherever possible. The concern of the legislature in this case is that an increase in the ARNPs' scope of practice does not prevent other qualified individuals from practicing within the same scope. If a proposed increase in the scope of practice does not prevent other currently licensed or non-licensed groups from practicing within the proposed scope, then the review would focus on whether the applicant group can practice safely. The review would not consider whether an increase in scope is necessary from a health profession supply perspective. OVERVIEW OF SUNRISE PROCEEDINGS The Department of Health began discussions with interested parties on the proposed increase in the prescriptive authority of advanced registered nurse practitioners in September 1992. Regulatory agencies in other states were requested to provide sunrise reviews, regulatory standards, existing laws and administrative rules, or other information which would be useful in evaluating the proposal. In addition, a literature search was conducted seeking professional journal and other articles regarding the current level of prescriptive authority of ARNPs in other states. Various agencies, associations, organizations and individuals both proponents and opponents were invited to provide information and feedback on the proposal. L&C/HSD December 22, 1992 1 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 109The Department of Health, Licensing and Certification, Office of Health Services Development convened a diverse committee og DOH staff to review material and provide input and serve as the hearings panel on the proposal. Staff from the medical, osteopathic, pharmacy and nursing boards were invited to participate as liaisons to their respective boards. A public hearing was held in Seattle on November 9, 1992 at which attendees were given the opportunity to express opposition to or support and receive answers to questions regarding the proposal. Interested parties were given an additional ten days to submit final comments and to provide additional clarifying information requested by the panel. Final recommendations were prepared for presentation to the Secretary of the Department of Health. The Department's summary and analysis of the proposal is outlined below, along with the Departmenfs recommendations. L&C/HSD December 22, 1992 2 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 110I. SUMMARY OF THE APPLICANT GROUP PROPOSAL The lettered sections below are from Section VI. of the Guidelines for Credentialing Health Professions in Washington State. The summary of the Applicant Group's responses to each section is in bold. A. Whether there is a serious risk to the public's life, health, or safety if the scope of practice remains as it is. ARNPs have been legally prescribing legend drugs and Class V controlled substances in Washington for 13 years. Their prescribing practices have proven effective and safe. This is evidenced by: (1) an increased demand for ARNP services, particularly in areas of the health care system underserved by their physician counterparts; (2) high levels of patient satisfaction; and (3) minimal complaints about ARNP prescribers before the boards of nursing and pharmacy . . The proposed legislation relates specifically to extending existing ARNP prescriptive authority to include additional classes of drugs rather than expanding the current scope of practice into areas in which ARNPs are not educated or experienced. An ARNP's ability to adequately practice to his or her full potential has been weakened by the prohibition on prescribing schedules II-IV drugs. This results in fragmented, delayed and duplicative care being provided ,to patients. Delays in receiving necessary medications can lead to increased health risks and additional costs postponing needed treatment. ARNPs, collaborating physicians, and pharmacists recognize the potential harm to the public if appropriate medication therapy is delayed. Innovative approaches have been developed over the past 13 years which allow an ARNP to make the decisions about controlled substance selection and dosage for their patients. This enables them to \"prescribe\" while technically complying with current law. These innovative approaches include the use of presigned physician prescription pads\" telephone orders to pharmacists by physicians at the request and specifications of an ARNP, or physician countersignature of an ARNP's drug orders in facilities, usually long after the medication has been administered to the patient. Where practiced, these tactics have allowed patients timely access to needed care. As widespread as they are, unfortunately, they are not available in all areas of the state. This points to the need to put into statute currently accepted, if not legal, prescriptive practices. If these mechanisms of \"gaming\" the system were to be eliminated, and controlled substance prescriptions originated solely from physicians and dentists in strict compliance with existing law, the public health, safety, and welfare of the people of Washington would take a serious step backward. L&C/HSD December 22, 1992 3 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 111B. Whether alternatives to legislation are available to solve the problem and, if so, why they were rejected. The 1973 amendments to the Nurse Practice Act (Chapter 18.88.280 (16) RCW) specifically prohibit \"permitting the prescribing of controlled substances as defined in schedules I through IV of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, chapter 69.50.\" Therefore, a legislative mandate to remove the restriction on schedules II through IV is necessary. A specific issue in this area which needs to be resolved relates to Certified Registered NUrse Anesthetists (CRNAs), one of the ARNP specializations. The boards of nursing and pharmacy currently take opposing views on whether the utilization of controlled substances by CRNA's constitutes prescribing. Based upon the Board of Pharmacy interpretation, the practice of selecting, ordering and administering drugs during anesthesia care involves prescribing. Such prescribing may not be undertaken through a delegated prescriptive authority from physicians or dentists, regardless of the presence of guidelines or protocols which address such practice arrangements. Theoretically, an expansion of the \"gaming maneuvers\" previously discussed could provide de facto expanded prescriptive authority to more ARNP practices, and serve as an alternative to legislative solutions. However, this only continues the misconception of who actually makes the drug decisions for the ARNP's patient, and potentially increases the liability of collaborating physicians, pharmacists and RNs. A legislative alternative is the only possibility for resolution of this issue. C. Benefit to the public if the change in practice scope is granted. The potential for increasing access to indicated drug therapy while minimizing duplicative services will be afforded by the proposed legislation. Specifica~ly, the following benefits are anticipated: I. Access to needed care. There is ample evidence that ARNPs have helped to fill a void for primary care practitioners in the rural and urban underserved areas of Washington. Their role is most effective when they provide the full range of services for which they have been trained, including the prescribing of necessary medications. Patients benefit by having their needs met as quickly as possible through a delivery system that affords continuity of care. The record over the past 13 years of patient experiences with limited ARNP prescriptive authority attests to the beneficial role of ARNPs in access to care. L&C/HSD December 22, 1992 4 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 1122. Reduction in delayed provision of health services. Patients who require schedule II-IV controlled substances can have their condition properly evaluated and diagnosed by an ARNP. Under strict interpretation of current law, they are unable to receive the indicated medication without the involvement of a second provider. If a second provider is readily available, care may not be excessively delayed. Unfortunately, utilizing the services of a physician to repeat an exam or to merely prescribe medications is an ineffective and costly way to deliver health care in Washington. It limits the availability of the second provider to treat other patients when the second provider is, in fact, duplicating what the first provider has already done. In fact, there is little evidence to suggest that this second intervention by a physician normally changes the decisions made by the ARNP. 3. Cost savings for health care provision. The proposed legislation will help contain costs to the health care system in several ways. First, as pointed out above, less duplication of services will save money and time. Additionally, the patient is saved undue expense, risk, suffering, and time by receiving prompt treatment at a single point of service. It makes little economic sense for a patient or third party payor to incur the extra expense of a hospital emergency room visit to receive a prescription which should have been written by the ARNP in the first place. Certain patients may choose not to seek additional services, especially from providers with whom they are unfamiliar. For example, it is well documented that patients who rely on controlled substances for the outpatient treatment of certain psychiatric disorders can enter prolonged in\u00ad patient treatment due to untimely drug management. Such patients are frequently under the care of ARNPs specializing in psychosocial problems. There are some ARNPs who are unwilling -to-move-to rural locations because under current law they know they cannot provide the full range of indicated medication therapy their patients might require. They are unsure if the \"gaming maneuvers\" necessary to provide appropriate medication to their patients would be in place in those areas. This lack of provider availability thus requires patients to endure added expense and time to travel to other areas to receive health care. c. Accountability. The public, as well as other health professionals with whom ARNPs collaborate, will be better served as a result of the proposed legislation legitimizing existing practice. Currently, a review of prescriptions which originate with an ARNP and are signed L&C/HSD December 22, 1992 5 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 113by a collaborating physician make it appear that the physician prescribes controlled substances at a higher rate than the physician actually does. ARNPs are on record supporting audits of ARNP\u00b7originated prescriptions, and the boards of nursing and pharmacy could develop a model for such use. Without prescriptions signed by the originating and authorized ARNP, however, such an audit would prove misleading. Additionally, patients have the right to know who is responsible for initiating the selection and ordering of the medications used in their care. The ARNP typically retains the responsibility of educating the patient about the use and effects of the prescribed controlled substance. Management of the patient's condition that originally warranted the controlled substance use Is also carried out by the ARNP. D. The adequacy of proposed changes in training/experience requirements to meet responsibilities of the proposed practice. ARNPs currently must comply with rigorous education and experience requirements for initial and continued prescriptive authority. In part, ARNPs must stay current in the prescription and management of Schedule II\u00b7IV controlled substances. The proposed legislation does not amend ARNP education and training standards specifically to cover the additional schedules of drugs. It is understood that the board of nursing, with the advice of the proposed ARNP advisory council, will monitor education and practice. The board of nursing will also update rules about initial and continuing standards for prescriptive licensure. Washington State currently has-some of the most stringent requirements in the nation for the continuing education of ARNPs. E. The extent to which the change may harm the public. The proponents do not foresee increased public harm as a result of the proposed legislation. However, two theoretically negative impacts are addressed: 1. More ARNPs with controlled substance prescribing authority could mean more potential for drug diversion to the public and for addiction by ARNPs. According to input from the boards of pharmacy and nursing, addiction and diversion by nursing groups are not unheard of, but they seem to be unrelated to the prescriptive authority for these drugs. Often addictions are of the street variety as opposed to drugs prescribed by the practitioner. Additionally, most health care facilities recognize the potential for theft if medications are either overstocked, unaccounted for, or poorly protected. That risk would not increase because current facility drug stocking patterns are not likely to change as a result of the proposed legislation. L&C/HSD December 22, 1992 6 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 1142. Some third party payors argue that allowing ARNPs to prescribe Schedule II-IV substances will increase their costs because of the increased utilization of ARNP services and consequently of prescription drugs. Such a result seems highly unlikely for the following reasons: a. Nurse practitioners, like their physician counterparts, do not bill their patients (and their insurance companies) for the sole cost of writing a prescription. Third party billings are submitted for various evaluation and management services, regardless of whether a prescription, or prescriptions, are written. As previously stated, costs go up when the ARNP must refer their patient to a second provider or emergency room for needed medication. Obviously, the second provider will naturally expect payment for their services, commonly billed under a separate evaluation and management code. The proposed legislation should result in less duplication of service and, therefore, reduced cost to patients and to the third party payors. b. Medication costs are affected by prescribing practitioners through the specification of the drug selected, (e.g., generic vs. name brand) as well as through the volume of prescriptions written. ARNPs are well aware of the cost effects of their prescribing practices and tend to turn to medication therapy less frequently than their physician counterparts. Still, when medications are indicated, they should be available through the prescription of the qualified provider. There is no reason to expect that controlled substances prescribed by an ARNP will cost the patient or their insurer more than if a physician prescribed them. F. Impact of the proposed change on cost of selVices to the public. Impact on costs of administering the program. It is anticipated that costs of indicated service will decrease when one practitioner is allowed to provide the same service that currently requires two practitioners, frequently in different locations. Additionally, it is likely that utilizing ARNPs to their full potential as prescribers will enhance competition. A common theme among health care reform proposals is that competition brings down costs, as in other market-driven sectors. Nothing in the proposed bill serves to eliminate or decrease collaborative interaction between health care practitioners where it is appropriately indicated. This proposal will reduce the cost of services to the public. Information regarding costs to the Department of Health in implementing the proposed legislation was unavailable to the applicant group at the time of proposal submission.

ANALYSIS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH REGARDING THE NEED FOR AN EXPANSION OF THE PRESCRIPTIVE AUTHORITY OF ADVANCED REGISTERED NURSE PRACfITIONERS TO PRESCRIBE CERTAIN CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES Studies. information and staff findings Many articles and documents were presented by proponents in response to issues and concerns raised regarding the expansion of prescriptive authority. Opponents did not provide articles or documents to substantiate the positions taken in their written information or oral testimony. Serious Risk to the Public: Oral and written testimony provided by the Office of Community and Rural Heaith and other proponents at the public hearing maintains that not expanding ARNP prescriptive authority would severely restrict access to primary and specialty care in rural areas. Testimony provided concluded that anesthesia services for surgery and trauma care in rural hospitals may not be accessible. Information regarding Washington's rural areas was provided which demonstrates the access problem and reliance upon mid-level providers (including ARNPs.) Information provided in various articles, including \"Comparative Analysis of Nurse Practitioners With and Without Prescriptive Authority\" indicates that nurse practitioners with prescriptive authority had more experience and were more likely to practice in rural or suburban areas or in nongroup settings than ARNPs without prescriptive authority. Staff concludes that restricting ARNPs from prescribing schedule II-IV substances contributes to a lack of access to care, thus representing a serious risk to the publics life, health or safety. This appears to creates a situation where ARNPs have the responsibility but not the authority for the prescribing of schedule drugs which is currently occu~ing. Alternatives to Legislation: As pointed out by the applicant group, Chapter 18.22.280(16) RCW of the Nurse Practice Act specifically prohibits the prescribing of controlled substances as defined in schedules I through IV of the Controlled Substances Act, only an amendment to this law will extend to ARNPs the authority to prescribe schedule drugs. Opponents did not offer an alternative to legislation, but instead an alternative to legislative proposal. They presented as an option the recently passed California statute permitting prescribing based on variables such as site of care, type of care patient health status, type of supervision and the number of ARNPs supervised. L&C/HSD December 22, 1992 8 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 116The Yale Journal of Regulation suggests that restrictive provisions relating to site-specific care are deterimental and have the effect of setting up a two-teir system of care. Under a California-type of arrangement, in some locations and under certain situations, ARNPs would have full prescriptive authority while under others they would not. Research information provided in various articles suggests that these provisions are needless and detrimental and legislative specifications of such professional norms is unnecessarily duplicative. ARNPs are trained to use independent professional judgement in providing care and are trained to know when to consult with and to refer to other health care providers, and that they have an ethical and a legal duty to do so when appropriate. Staff concurs with this conclusion and recommends that the California example notwithstanding, the only alternative may be a legislative solution to expand prescriptive authority. Benefit to the Public: Information provided suggests that the public would benefit from the maintenance of access to the current level of anesthesia care. Prescriptive authority expansion will allow place the full range of drugs within the ARNP scope of practice. This would allow prescribing drugs which may be most appropriate, less costly, better tasting and may have less significant side effects. Staff concurs with this finding. Additionally, staff recognizes the need for a mix of qualified health providers if quality health care is to be attained. Adequacy of Training: The \"brevity\" of an ARNP's education was raised as a concern by opponents. However, since this sunrise request was specific to the expansion of prescriptive authority, our review centered on the adequacy of an ARNP's pharmacology education. Information submitted by proponents and educators provided a comparison of pharmacology related education for various health professionals having prescriptive authority. This comparison indicated the following formal education in pharmacology: Medicine ARNPs CRNAs Dentists L&C/HSD December 22, 1992 graduate education 74 contact hours 70 contact hours 130 contact hours 40 contact hours continuing education none required 15 hours every 2 years 15 hours every 2 years none required 9 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 117Podiatrists 14 hours to deliver nitrous oxide 14 hours for conscious oral sedation 1 year for general anesthesia 55 contact hours 7 hours every 5 years 7 hours every 5 years 18 hours every 3 years none specific to prescribing requirements Physicians receive additional training and experience related to drug therapy in conjunction with their residency education. However, they are qualified to receive a prescriptive license at the end of their medical school training. None of the disciplines require undergraduate pharmacology preparations and the above hours represent the minimum requirement necessary to qualify for a prescriptive license upon graduation. ARNPs currently prescribe legend drugs which are considered dangerous or life threatening. The pharmacology education ARNPs currently receive clearly prepares them to make appropriate decisions regarding drug therapy. Their pharmocology education exceeds that of both Dentists and Podiatrists (who have the authority to prescribe schedule drugs); and their continuing education requiremtns in pharmacology are more stringent than any other health profession. Present ARNP pharmaceutical training is comprehensive and adequate to meet the responsibilities of expanded prescriptive authority. It is recommended however, that a member from the physician and pharmaceutical communities be included in the proposed Advisory Council. Public Hann: Various articles indicate there is no evidence suggesting harm to the public would occur if ARNPs were granted the authorituy to prescribe scheduled drugs. Existing Drug Enforcement Agency requirements apply equally to ARNPs and other health professionals who prescribe scheduled drugs. Board of Pharmacy can also apply appropriate sanctions for misuse of scheduled drugs. Board of Nursing has a disciplinary structure in place. Although the issue of safe dispensing remains a concern, especially related to the criminal element and potential break-ins. The Nursing and Pharmacy professions are nearing agreement on the availability of drugs for dispensing. There is legitimate concern on both sides and staff recommends that this issue be carefully scrutinized. L&C/HSD December 22, 1992 10 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 118Costs of Services: Opponents also raised the issue of increased cost due to \"ARNP parity with physicians.\" No documented evidence was presented by opponents or proponents to support positions. However, based on oral testimony, staff concludes that even if some costs increased due to \"parity\", other costs would still be reduced by elimination of duplication and reduced emergency room visits. Additionally, staff concludes that overall costs would also be reduced due to the availability of a more cost effective mix of health care providers and strengthening of referral patterns. Staff acknowledges that although ARNPs are traditionally very conservative in prescribing, passage of this bill would increase prescriptions and in an increase in health care expenditures for them. There would also be a cost for administering this regulation. However, the overall effect would be a net reduction in costs. REGULATION IN OTHER STATES AND JURISDICTIONS Inquiries were sent to professional licensing bodies in 49 states and the District of Columbia, requesting information on the regulation and prescriptive authority of ARNPs in those states. Responses from 27 states were received. Information provided by responding states and proponents indicate that 13 states currently grant ARNPs independent legislative authority to prescribe. In eight of those states, ARNPs are authorized to prescribe controlled substances. Twenty-four states provide dependent ARNP prescriptive authority (i.e., authority in some way dependent on state\u00ad authorized physician or pharmacist approval). Within these twenty-four states, ARNPs in ten states are authorized to prescribe controlled substances. ARNPs in three other states have site-dependent, limited authority to prescribe. A summary of the various state provisions related to legal authority, prescriptive authority, and reimbursement status of ARNPs is attached. ESTIMATED COST OF REGULATION The cost of regulation is based on a fiscal note analysis of a 1991 House Bill related to expansion of prescriptive authority. The level of activity required by that bill, although not identical, will provide a very close estimate. Those costs are as follows: New: Volume (#) Rate L&C/HSD December 22, 1992 Estimated cost 1st Year 600 98.19 11 Estimated cost 2nd Year 200 98.19 Total 800 98.19 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 119Revenue Renewals: Volume (#) Rate Revenue TOTAL REVENUES 1st BIENNIUM New: Volume (#) Rate Revenue Renewal: Volume (#) Rate Revenue TOTAL REVENUES 2nd BIENNIUM The statute requires the Secretary to recover the costs for management of health professions through professional fees. L&C/HSD December 22, 1992 12 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 120III. STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS The Department of Health recommends approval of the expansion of prescriptive authority for Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners. Information provided indicates that restricting availability of Schedule II-IV drugs to certain segments of the population creates a lack of access to care and represents a serious risk to the public life, health, and safety. The alternatives presented by opponents do not appear to address the issues of ARNP training and capability of ARNPs to safely and effectively prescribe Schedule II-IV substances. These opponent alternatives seek to address the overall ability of ARNPs to function as independent providers, a topic which is not within the purview of this sunrise review. The public would benefit by the availability of additional qualified providers, already functioning in an expanded practice capacity, to prescribe prescription drugs which may be more appropriate and less costly. ARNPs are trained to u'se independent judgement, deal with many of the same maladies as do physicians, consult with other health care providers, know their limits and know when to refer. Pharmacology training requirements for ARNPs are comprehensive and adequate to meet the responsibilities of expanded prescriptive authority. However, it is recommended that the ARNP advisory committee include a licensed physician and licensed pharmacist in order to provide a broader perspective regarding specific training requirements. Evidence provided demonstrates that expansion of prescriptive authority would not harm the . public. Costs are expected to decrease, access is expected to increase, and the change will provide for the best mix of health care personnel. A concern regarding public safety was raised due to the potential for theft or burglary of controlled substances at additional dispensing sites. There may be a need for dispensing of controlled substances when and where a pharmacy may not be accessible. It is the Department's recommendation that the nursing and pharmacy professions work to reach a resolution on this issue. The Department recommends that this issue continue to be carefully scrutinized. No documented evidence was presented to support the position that expanded prescriptive authority would increase or decrease costs. However, it seems likely that overall cost of medical care would potentially be decreased by elimination of duplication, double billing and reduced emergency referrals for filling Schedule II-IV prescriptions. L&C/HSD December 22, 1992 13 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 121 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 122 Appendix C Public Hearing Summary Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 123 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 124 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Public Hearing July 17 2014 Kristi Weeks, director of legal services and legislative liaison at the Department of Health (department), called the hearing to order and gave instructions to participants. She introduced department staff assisting with the hearing, and introduced the hearing pane l. The panel's role is to make sure we have all the information we need to make a sound recommendation, so they will ask a lot of questions. The panel members were: Alex Lee, staff attorney in our Office of Legal Services; Meghan Porter, communications and evaluations coordinator for the Washington Tracking Network from our Environmental Public Health division; Deborah Johnson, policy analyst in our Hea lth Systems Quality Assurance division. Ms. Weeks announced that after the hearing, ther e will be a 10-day written comment period before the department drafts the initial report. This is to allow interested parties to provi de additional information on topics brought up at the hearing, and allow those who could not attend the hearing to submit information. Ms. Weeks reminded participants that the sunrise re view process has statutorily mandated criteria that should be the focus of discussion at the hearing. Next, Ms. Weeks welcomed the applicant pane l to make their presentation on the proposal. Applicant Presentation Robert May, ND, Executive Director Washington Association of Naturopathic Physicians (WANP) Dr. May stated that the proposed legislation H 4573. 4, would be changing the scope of naturopathic practice to expand prescriptive authority from the curr ent status of all legend drugs and the controlled substances testosterone and codeine products, to all controlled substan ces within schedules II through V. The draft legislation from Representative Cody does not include requirements for the promulgation of rules regarding education and training for naturopathic physicians who would be expanding their prescriptive scope. He asked to make it very clear that WANP recognizes this and intends to ask the legislature to amend the draft bill to specifically require the Board of Naturopathy (board) to do rulemaking to address the necessary education and trai ning to ensure public safety and optimal care by naturopathic physicians (NDs) in the use of these new medications. He added the intent to include two or three other amendments noted in the applicant report that would bring this legislation into conformity with the Cont rolled Substances Act. These are already in law for other prescribing professions. In addition, he added the need for specific language that was in HB 2876, referred to as concerning pain management by Representative Moeller, that set very specific and discreet guidelines and clinical requirements for the use of controlled substances in the management of pain for any provider types who have this prescriptive authority. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 125 He stated he feels that naturopathic law and practice should be required to meet these standards. This is a primary addition that should be added to the applican t report and he stated WANP is not endorsing the language of the bill as it exists right now. Since 2005, when the last prescriptive authority e xpansion for naturopathic physicians occurred (implemented in 2007 after rules were written), NDs have had the authorit y to prescribe all legend substances and the controlled substances testosterone and codeine products. Dr. May stated there has been no formal disciplinary actions against NDs fo r prescribing within that authorized scope of medications. There have been a number of what are referred to as stipulations- they're called STIDs, that are informal dispositions, minor corrective actions that do not qualify at a level of disciplinary actions. Kristi Weeks corrected Dr. May that STIDs are in formal discipline, but discipline nonetheless. Dr. May stated thanks to Ms. Weeks for the correc tion, and indicated he thought there was such a distinction. In 2013, the Washington State Legislat ure included naturopathic physicians in funding for Medicaid primary care services. And since January of this year, 2014, NDs have been enrolling, participating and serving this new demogr aphic of patients in Washington. With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Medicaid in Washington, he stated NDs have become aware that their ability and role as primary care providers is in more demand; and NDs are practicing in more and more areas of the state. As a result, NDs have also identified the need for additional tools to fully provide optimal prim ary care in all these settings. This is the basis for bringing forward this request to expand the prescriptive au thority. In the current status, the system as it is supports a number of issues that add to cost a nd decrease to quality in care for patients who are seeing naturopathic doctors for their primary care services. This includes dual-utilization which, in the event that a patient does need a particular controlled substance, requires a prescription from a second prac titioner who has this license ability. This can delay appropriate treatment; can increase cost to the patient, to the state, and to insurers; and disrupts patient- doctor relationships, effective coordina tion of care, and optimal management for that patient. It can also increase issues of non-compliance if a patient has to take additional time off or travel to see another provider to get something that is needed. Dr. May referred the hearing participants to W ANP responses to supplemental questions from the department. He stated WANP has specifically tried to provide more informati on that creates the basis for the proposal, and demonstrates both the value, the safety to the public and the advantages to the state. Dr. May also referred to the written comments in opposition to the proposal that were shared at the hearing, and stated there appears to be some factual misunde rstanding about the nature of naturopathic medical education. He introduced Dr. Jane Guiltinan from Bastyr University to present next and address ND education. Jane Guiltinan, Dean of the Naturopathic Program at Bastyr University Dr. Guiltinan introduced herself as a naturopathic physician since 1986 and Dean of the School of Naturopathic Medicine at Bastyr University. She stat ed her role on the panel is to provide information on the current education and training of naturopathic physic ians at Bastyr University and, more broadly, the other four accredited naturopathic programs in the United States. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 126 Bastyr University is a four year doctoral residential program. Students who come into the program must have a bachelor's degree and all their typical pre-med pr erequisites before they begin the program. It is a four or sometimes five year program, 4,383.5 hours. Of those hours, there were some comments in the concerns of the comments that were posted that there was no anatomy or pathology, and that is inaccurate. The first two years of the program are essentially basic science years; where students take anatomy, including cadaver dissection, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, clinical laboratory diagnosis, etc. The curriculum is currently being revise d (they are in the third year of revising) to go from a discipline-based basic science curriculum to a systems based curriculum. So what you see in the Bastyr University catalog might say \"integrated structure and function\" and \"integrated musculoskeletal\" but within those integrated modules, they are teaching an atomy, physiology, biochemi stry, pathology, etc. The third and fourth years are primarily the clinical years, a combination of both didactic (about 1,000 or 1,200 hours) and clinical sciences. Those are the \"ology's\"- rheumatology, pulmonology, dermatology etc. Within those courses, students learn principles of pharmacotherapy. They take a total of 60.5 hours in pharmacology. Half of those hours are in the sec ond year of the program; the other half are clinical pharmacology in the third year of the program. Then, there are 1,210 clinical training hours where students train in outpatient settings; primarily in the teaching clinic in Wallingford, where they see about 40,000 patient visits a year. Also in external clini cal sites, such as community health clinic systems, women's health shelters, senior centers, etc. In those clinical training hours they are supervised by licensed physicians, and they, again, do primary car e medicine where they do appropriate evaluation, diagnosis and then come up with therapeutic treatment plans which may include non-pharmacologic approaches and also, oftentimes, medi cal pharmacotherapy approaches. There were questions about whether the other colleg es in the United States provide the same level of training and the answer to that is yes. All five accr edited colleges of naturopathic medicine in the United States have approximately the same number of hours and approximately the same curriculum. They are all accredited regionally, Bastyr University by th e Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, which is the same accrediting agency that accredits the University of Washington. They're also programmatically accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medicinal Education, where there's much more information about the accreditation process and st andards. This is an accrediting body that's recognized by the Department of Education and Bastyr has recently been reaffirmed for six additional years of accreditation. There were some comments about residencies, and Dr . Guiltinan stated that the residencies, at this moment, in the naturopathic profession's maturation are op tional. Bastyr University is by far the largest provider of residency opportunities for graduates, offering about 25 residency slots per year. The other schools are somewhat less than that. Residencies are subsidized by the colleges themselves; they receive no subsidies from the Graduate Medical Education Fu nd either by the state or the federal government. That is the current level of education and training. There is also a requirement for 20 hours per year of continuing education requirements for naturopaths in the state. As Dr. May stated, they are firmly in support of rulemaking that would identify where additi onal education and training requirements would be appropriate for NDs if this legislation passes. She then introduced Dr. Krumm to speak from a clinical perspective. Dr. Chris Krumm, ND, HealthPoint Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 127 Dr. Chris Krumm described his background, clinical work, patient population, and followed with a recent case example that to help illustrate the need for the proposed scope expansion. He graduated with his doctorate degr ee in naturopathic medicine from Bastyr University in 2004, then completed two years of clinical residency, which included practicing at the main community health clinic of HealthPoint in Kent. Dr. Krumm was hired as a fu ll-time naturopathic physician at HealthPoint after completing his residency, and has worked there for th e last seven years. HealthPoint is a large, multi- center community health organization, serving pr imarily low-income and underserved King County patients. They are an important provider of Medicai d services in the state of Washington, and also serve many uninsured residents. Many of their patients struggle with additional physical, mental and psyco- social stressors that complicate their care. They were one of the first federally funded organizations in the country to employ naturopaths, as part of a multi-disci plinary care team, starting about 15 years ago. The NDs at HealthPoint practice alongside MDs, DOs, nur se practitioners, and PFPAs as part of the clinical care team. They carry their own patient load as primary care providers (PCPs) and frequently serve as consultants for their colleagues' patients. In add ition, they manage acute walk-in patients when their PCPs are out or their schedules are full. Since Medicaid coverage for naturopathic primary car e services began in January of this year, demand for ND appointments has risen significantly. He is finding a lot of patients that have wanted to see him for years, but were not able to afford even the lowest sliding scale fee who are now starting to consult with him using their Medicaid coverage. The demand has grown so much that HealthPoint recently hired a fourth naturopathic physician to be on staff and help meet the incr eased patient needs in this area. The relatively recent Medicaid inclusion of NDs in W ashington did a lot to reduce barriers of access for a lot of Medicaid patients. The limitations of the current naturopathic prescriptive scope still presents challenges; and while he is able to address most is sues without needing to write a controlled substances prescription, there are cases where a controlled substance is necessary and the most appropriate choice. He stated he wanted to share one very recent case ex ample that occurred that seems particularly relevant in this matter. He had a long-term patient who was very medically complicated. She presented with severe, acute, radiating back pain. He been working for a long tim e to help manage her diabetes, asthma, hypertension, sleep apnea, and, more recently, atrial defibrillation (for which she's now on Warfarin, blood-thinner). She revealed to Dr. Krumm that she'd been self- medicating with high dose ibuprofen. It's the combination which, you know, puts her at great risk of bleeding. They knew from past episodes of pain that Tylenol did not work. She had tried that again, and it did not touch her pain. She was intolerant of many typical narcotic pain medications, with the exception of Tramadol, that other people had provided for her. Dr. Krumm knew this because about a year earlier, he had helped her through a similar episode, a severe pain episode, using physical medicine and a short cour se of Tramadol. However, Tramadol has just been reclassified from a legend substance to a schedul e IV controlled medication that he can no longer prescribe according to many emails and warnings from the pharmacy board. He needed to find another option for her. She was unwilling to see any other prov ider that he could have referred her to in the clinic, so he asked several people if they could take a look. He found one provider who reviewed her case and agreed that it seemed the most appropriate prescription for her. She received a prescription, but unfortunately, by the time she got out of her appointme nt, the pharmacy had closed so she could not refill Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 128 the prescription that night. Dr. Krumm saw her back on follow-up the very next da y, and she revealed she was once again taking her high dose ibuprofen against his strong warnings against it. She eventually was able to stop, and filled the appr opriate prescription without any serious effects to his knowledge. But he stated it is a good example of how this restriction on ND prescriptive authority can, in some cases, delay appropriate medical therapy and put patie nts at risk of serious side effects. In this case, they got away without a severely bad outcome. Aside from the safety issues related to delaying approp riate therapy, any reduction in dual-utilization and time spent consulting unnecessarily within a busy prim ary care practice will help avoid wasting resources that cost patients and insurers and the state valuable time and money. Along with a long track record of NDs serving as PCPs in such a high-need environmen t for 15 or so years, this is the reason both the HealthPoint CEO, Don Trumpeter, and medical dire ctor, Evan Oakes (an MD) are supporting the sunrise review prescriptive scope expansion. All of the conventional medical colleagues he works with at HealthPoint have expressed support for this because they feel this is the right choice for their clinics, patients and for the state. Panel Questions Q. Deborah Johnson asked about the specific 60.5 hours in pharmacology. How many hours of that would be estimated to include sch edules II-V controlled substances? A. Dr. Guiltinan responded and clarified that. 60.5 hour s of pharmacology is specifically pharmacology, or clinical pharmacology in integrated therapeu tics modules; and then, additionally, in the \"ology\" modules, or the clinical science modules, there are other hours that would address medication management. At this moment, they would be cove red in a very basic way, because they would be covered as a class of drugs. Mechanism of action woul d be covered, some particular drugs would be covered, and all naturopath ic medical students must take a basic science and a clinical science national board examination. There are blueprints for those examinations, and there are required medications that the students are required to learn. In those require ments are scheduled drugs, because some other states who license naturopathic physicians have broader sc opes and already have these scheduled substances in their scope; Oregon and Arizona are two examples. So yes, they would be covered in a basic way right now. Q. If this authority were granted, would you be changing that up? Would you be increasing that, or increasing emphasis on that at all? A. They would be hard-pressed to add any hours or cr edits to the curriculum, because it's already jam- packed. But she stated they would certainly \"t weak\" those hours and revise them to include any expanded scope that is a result of this process. Q. The next question was directed to Dr. May. Much of the information WANP has submitted centers on NDs relationships to primary care. I do appreciate the case example that you gave as well, but beyond that case example, I don't really have a good sense of the range of what's considered primary care. Could you please describe common conditions and medical issu es that are likely to present specifically among naturopaths and their patients coming for primary care? A. Dr. May stated that he may ask Dr. Krumm to supplemen t with his clinical experience, but stated he is aware that naturopaths had have the role of serving as PC Ps for some of the major insurers in our state for Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 129 over 15 years. And in that context, primary care is an interchangeable title among the type of provider offering those services. He stated he feels that would include everything from routine physicals, preventive services, acute care, and then the management of referrals. He said in the Regence Blue Shield system, naturopathic doctors have been in the role of gatekeeper in that capacity for many years. In that type of system, he's not sure how many of those pa rticular benefit plans are still operating, but in those managed care plans NDs are responsible and have to authorize referrals to specialists that their patient might need. He suggested that the role of pr imary care offered by naturopathic physician is interchangeable with the role of primary care offe red by a nurse practitioner, or a medical doctor, or osteopath or physician's assistant in a similar system. Q. Your submittals also state that, \"the ND use of c ontrolled substances will be limited to medications appropriate for primary care services\" and that, \"NDs would rarely, or never, use those controlled medications not recognized or appropriate for primary care practice\". Could you please talk about which of the Schedule II-V substances w ould be appropriate for the primar y care services you've indicated? A. Dr. May stated that they submitted a document from the prescription monitoring program (PMP) at the Department of Health that identifies about 20 c ontrolled substance prescriptions in Washington. It is his understanding is that over 90% of the prescriptions of controlled substances are contained within those 20 medications. Without speculating into an area NDs ha ve not yet had authority to prescribe, he felt that ND patterns of prescription will model those already documented in the PMP program. Q. The proposed bill language as it currently stands would give naturopaths prescriptive authority only for the Schedule II-V substances that are, \"necessary in the practice of na turopathy\". You've stated that you expect that the prescribing patterns would generally follow that PMP list that you submitted. There are 20 items on that list, but in Schedule II alone, w ithout counting any of the other schedules, there are considerably more than 20 substances, and then all th eir derivatives on top of that. At the same time, your submittals indicate the intent to include all of the Sc hedule II-V substances. Those two seem to me to be at sort of an odds with one another, so given what you've said about the limitations of use to primary care and then probable use paralleling the PMP list, could you explain why everything on those schedules is considered necessary in the practice of naturopathy? A. On the one hand, there's the administrative issue and the example Dr. Krumm demonstrated by the limitation that has occurred when a drug is reschedul ed, or reclassified. When looking at the prescriptive authority of professions like the nurse practitioners or physician assistants, ev en including dentists, podiatrists, and other groups; there don't seem to be discreet lists of medications. Rather, they have authority for classes of drugs within the appropriate scope of their profession. He stated he would encourage similar language, because it prevents the profession from having to come back each year as drug status changes, or new research is found, or a new medication is released, and have to go to the legislature to change a limited list that is out of da te. In comparing this with the prescriptive authority with, say, nurse practitioners, they don't see any of t hose limitations, and so they have modeled their proposed legislation on that same model. Q. Would you oppose language in the bill, \"necessary in the practice of naturopathy\"? A. Dr. May stated that they would not. That is the qualifier that underlies all the professions. Any practitioner who has full scope is going to be constr ained by their scope of practice or specialty or whatever their area is. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 130 Q. Regarding the definition of the practice of naturopath y and the language in the draft bill. The statute currently talks about naturopathic medicine and defines the practice of naturopathic medicine. The draft language indicates that a naturopath can prescribe co ntrolled substances necessary in the practice of naturopathy. Is the practice of naturopathy dis tinct from the practice of naturopathic medicine? A. Dr. May stated he would view that as being synonymous. He believes all te rms naturopathic were included in the bill; so in a sense, naturopathy, naturo pathic physician, naturopa thic doctor, naturopathic medicine, would be viewed as being essentially the same term. Q. The practice of naturopathy would be equal to the practice of naturopathic medicine? A. Yes. Q. Can you just tell the panel what the basi c foundation of naturopathic medicine is? A. Dr. May responded that naturopathic medicine is a unique and historical perspective on healthcare that views the human body as having inherent or innate healing capacity. This practice and medicine is designed to always look as far as possible to support th at inherent, natural process in the body to achieve health. Many treatments related to diet, lifestyl e, and nutrition are to provide the body with the environment, the support to manifest healing or revers e disease. As they noted, with the expansion of the NDs role in the state, they are seeing patients who are much sicker than they have in the past or who are already on prescription medications. This includes tho se who have acute injuries or painful situations in which the best choice of medicine is likely a pharm aceutical agent. Their philosophy does not preclude any particular therapy. They would look towards what is the most gentle, least invasive manner of achieving health for an individual. A. Do you think that that's going to confuse patients, when they come in expecting natural remedies and then an ND offers them pharmaceuticals? Do you thi nk that's going to cause any problems with future patients or current ones who expect a cer tain theory, because you are naturopaths? A. Dr. May responded that he thinks some patients ma y be surprised. His impression from talking with NDs is that far more patients will actually be relieve d that when they know a medication is the right course of care, they are able to stay with their doc tor who they have established a relationship with and take that medication in the context of an ove rall naturopathic approach to their health. Q. Pharmaceuticals would be the last stop? You woul d try all other natural remedies and then go to pharmaceuticals, if necessary. A. In a general way, that's one way of saying it. If someone comes in who has just sprained their ankle very badly or is in acute pain, it may not be appropria te to go through trying a lot of herbal remedies or compresses or other things that could be valuable in mo re minor situations. It's really a question of what is the patient need at a particular time that gives them the best care. Does that answer your question? Q. It just seems confusing to mix the two. NDs claim to practice natural healing but then throw pharmaceuticals in just because they are considered primary care practitioners now. But NDs have always considered themselves as a primary care prac titioners, so why now? That's kind of where I'm confused. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 131 A. Dr. May responded that he guesses in the past, patients sometimes came in needing something beyond the ND scope of practice. It wasn't that the doctors didn't recognize that, or refer them where needed. It's just that it required an entire additional appointme nt, fee, and time for the patient. He asked whether Dr. Krumm had something to add. Dr. Krumm added that a lot of this has to be put in to perspective of the patient population, income, and desire to become better regardless of what it takes to do so. A lot of his patients have a great preference for natural medicines, however they're low income. The $20 they pay for a flat fee sliding scale charge for an appointment is all they have. If they are on Medicaid and learn that their plan does not cover natural supplements or herbal medici nes, they have to pay out of pocket to get such an item. Then it becomes a choice of what is the most appropriate conventional medication that they can get that is covered. If they are on a $40 a month natural cholesterol supplement when they can get a prescription medication for free or a very low co-pay, that makes a difference. The NDs have to explain the pros and cons, and it's just a different patie nt population than I think people were seeing 20 or 30 years ago. Does that answer your question a little better? Q. A question was asked about intramuscular injections and what Dr. May thinks about that. A. Dr. May stated he believes they would view whatev er the optimal route of a particular drug delivery that was needed at a particular time by a particular patient, is what they would do. But he stated he doesn't feel comfortable pulling out particulars or saying \"yes we would- this would always be used intravenously\" or \"intramuscularly\" or anything else. It would be dependent on the substance and on the clinical context. Q. Dr. May was asked to give a general estimate of the percentage of primary care cases that would require schedule II-V substances. A. Dr. May responded that he doesn't think he has that data, but would be happy to work with the department or try to find something like that. Q. Dr. Krumm was asked to estimate, based off of his c linical experience, how many of his patient that he refers to get pharmaceuticals. A. Dr. Krumm stated it's a relatively low percentage, but it does come up often enough where he's faced with having to refer patients to one of his colleagues. He stated that they often have no desire to see one of his colleagues because a lot of his patients ar e very adamant about going to see a naturopathic physician. They trust them in management of their car e. But overall, he stated that the vast majority of cases don't need to be referred for pharmaceuticals, but when certain things come up, it is appropriate. Dr. Guiltinan added that based on her observation in the teaching clinic in Wa llingford, it likely be something less than 5% of the population that would potentially need to be referred for controlled substances. Q. Dr. May was asked about a reference earlier to AR NP prescriptive authority, and some additional materials he had submitted that draw a parallel betw een naturopaths and ARNP prescriptive authority. She asked whether he had read the ARNP rules and WAC relative to their prescriptive authority, and if so, is that what naturopaths are seeking. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 132 A. Dr. May responded that they are very aware that ARNP s have clinical specialties that the naturopathic profession does not; such as anesthesiology, pain management, psychiatric nursing. They have specific prescriptive authority requirements for the different sp ecialties, and so they are not looking for anything to that extent. He stated they are limiting th eir comparison to the independent primary care nurse practitioners. He stated they have reviewed those rules, but he doesn't claim to know them well enough to speak to them specifically at the hearing. Q. A follow up was asked, whether Dr. May is aware that with the ARNP construct, an individual has to have an endorsement and carry it along with thei r license, and renew it along with their license for prescriptive authority? It's not a blan ket prescriptive authority for all ARNPs. A. Dr. May responded that he does understand they ARNPs have to maintain a separate nursing license, a license as an ARNP, and then there are additiona l educational requirements for their prescriptive authority. Q. Is that the type of scenario th at you are seeking for naturopaths? A. Dr. May responded that without committing to that exact format, they are looking at continuing education and training requirements that would en sure optimal practice and public safety, which will likely require additional continuing educ ation for naturopa thic physicians. Q. You submitted information about the federal health personnel shortage areas for Washington State by county. You had asserted that naturopaths will help to fill shortage of primary care practitioners, and provided numerous references to a lot of different materi als. Some of those focused on shortages in rural or underserved areas, and then you included data fro m this database by reference. It shows the distribution of shortage areas and underserved populat ions by county. Could you please talk about the geographic distribution of naturopaths in relation to the underserved areas and specific populations identified for Washington State in this document? A. Dr. May responded that he can address that the vast majority of naturopaths are within the greater Puget Sound area at this time; and in fact, the majority are in the three most populous counties of King, Pierce and Snohomish County. He stated that they have doctors in many of the other counties, and they are in small numbers at this time. However, as the profession grows, and their ability to integrate with the medical system and participate in programs such as Medicaid, and options for reimbursement, they expectant that many graduates will want to serve in and practice rural and underserved areas. He added that they have study data conducted through Bastyr Univ ersity students indicating a very high percentage are interested in practicing in rural and underserved ar eas. He stated he feels that as the barriers to their ability to practice there are reduced, we will see many more naturopaths move to those areas to offer primary care services. Q. A follow up was asked. Beyond the rural areas, a lot of these are discreet to homeless, migrant health type populations. Do you have any data around serving specifically those populations? A. Dr. May responded that he doesn't have specific data on that. NDs are new to the Medicaid system, and are growing. When, he last talked with the Health Care Authority, the data had not yet been available. He stated that Bastyr University's t eaching program includes a number or rotations that Dr. Guiltinan can probably address that have to do with homeless programs, underserved areas and so it's all a regular part of the education. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 133 Dr. Guiltinan added that yes, Bastyr has an external site program of approximately 23 external sites where a team of faculty and naturopathic medical st udents go into these settings and provide care, free of charge, to underserved communities. That includ es seniors, homeless women's shelters, homeless youth high school, underserved high school, teen health center, and other such settings. Public Testimony Ms. Weeks asked for the first panel of public test imony to come up. This included Katie Kolan from Washington State Medical Association (WSMA) and Dr. Peter Dunbar from WSSA. Dr. Peter Dunbar Peter Dunbar began testimony. He introduced himself as professor of anesthesiology at the University of Washington and in practice at Harborview Medical Ce nter for the past 20-and-something years. In addition to medical school and college, he did a pain fellowship in 1990; which is an additional year on top of his anesthesia training, and four years of anesthesia residency and medical school. He stated that he worked initially in pain service at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and then was chief of the pain service at Harborview Medical Center. He stated that in his experience, with the advantage of time, much has changed in the prescribing of opiates in th e last 30 years since he graduated medical school. When he was a student, they never prescribed opiates fo r anything other than very short periods of time, following surgery or the like. They never prescribed opiates for chronic conditions, or for what they called non-malignant conditions, that were not involved with cancer. He described a battle over opening up opiate prescribing to the general public and general use by primar y care providers, which Dr. Dunbar stated he fought. He stated this idea was championed by a group of anesthesiologists who thought that they could safely treat non-malignant pain with opiates. He stated that experience led to the epidemic of opiat e overdoses that now plague our society. He stated \"the road to hell is paved with go od intentions,\" because their intenti ons were that people without cancer are also hurting and suffering so they deserve to be treated with opiates too. However, taking the individual anecdotal case and expanding it to the general principle doesn't work when you start talking about issues with public health. By the time Dr. Dunba r was in charge of the pain service at Harborview, they were seeing the number of people dying of opiate overdoses in Washington doubling every 18 months. And as he said he predicted in 2005, by 200 9 or 2010, the number of people who died in this state from opiate overdoses was greater than the number of people who died from automobile accidents., He stated they people in the United States consume over 80-90% of all the opiates that are consumed on the entire planet; despite our population being significantly less than 5% of the pl anet's population. And, unfortunately making it even worse, we've increased th e use of opiates across the country, and the use of opiates is absolutely horrifying, as the document which was showing the top 20 uses. He added that he does not believe we've significantly reduced the problem of chronic pain in America, He said he doesn't have data on this, but there does not seem to be fe wer people with less pain now, despite using 5-10 times as much opiates as our country did in the past. Something Dr. Dunbar stated they never taught him in medical school about the permanent damage done by people being on long periods of opiates, like 90 days or longer, and that the chance of somebody who's taken opiates that long of gettin g off those opiates is very low. He thought about 5%. He said it has been his experience that long-term use of opiates has permanently changed people's response to pain. It also actually reduces life expectancy. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 134 He said he appreciates the concern that the naturopathic physicians show for their patients to want to make it somewhat more convenient for their patients, but he feels that the last thing we need is to make it more convenient to get opiates. They are dangerous and people who are on them are incredibly persuasive. Nothing, nothing is more persuasive than somebody who wants their opiates. If people need opiates, then they really need to be working with somebody who's a specialist in that topic. He stated he's not necessarily saying that you have to be a board certified pain specialist like him, but at the very least it needs to be someone who's taken a great deal of interest pain management with adequate and extra training in it. He warned against opening the floodga tes on yet another set of providers giving opiates and adding to an already existing problem. Katie Kolan, WSMA Ms. Kolan introduced herself as director of legisla tive and regulatory affairs at the Washington State Medical Association (WSMA). She stated that she wanted to specifically address the high-level points WSMA has reviewed in the applicants' proposal. Sh e first addressed the designation as a primary care provider to justify support of expanding the scope to allow the prescribing of controlled substances scheduled II-V. That is an administrative designation in law, and the designation of a naturopathic doctor as a primary care practitioner is just that. It does not, specifically and inherently, come with the authority to prescribe or the need or reason to prescribe. The designation as a primary care provider does not, in and of itself, support the decision to allow for an expanded scope. The proponents also brought up in their application th at some of the patient population a naturopathic doctor sees may require the use of these medications. Her second point was that the provider shortages and dual-utilization that was called out in the applica tion; those are two areas that the medical association is also very concerned about. She stated they don't want to see overuse or dual-utilization of practitioners either. But in the case where prescribing of these dangerous medications is necessary, referral is appropriate. And she stated that Dr. Dunbar said it earlier, convenience is not a reason to allow for an expanded scope; to allow access to these dangerous drugs through prescribing to a patient who is visiting with a naturopathic doctor. Her third point was that WSMA was actually a little b it confused about the reference of HB 2876 that was passed a couple years back. It was passed to direct the boards and commissions to adopt rules regarding the management of chronic non-cancer pain. She stat ed that naturopathic doctors were notably omitted from that list of practitioners. It makes sense, based on the timeline that that legislation passed. But specifically, they were not considered as being one of those list of practitioners who should be granted additional scope, or should at least be educated to allow their patients who are on those medications to also become educated about that patient population that they're seeing. There was reference in the applicant panel to additional education and additional training, and of course WSMA is open to seeing what those additional recomme ndations are. But they have not yet seen that; and so the relevance of that legislation to them has no specific nexus or meaning. Ms. Kolan also brought up a question of process and notice regarding the sunrise process. They have not been able to see the additional supplementary questions that were submitted to the applicant th at they picked up a copy of on their way into the hearing. Those were not posted on the website prior to the hearing. So WSMA has not had an opportunity to reply to those additions to the applicant report. WSMA will be reviewing the supplemental information and providing comments on tho se during the comment period after the hearing. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 135 Q. Ms. Weeks asked a question on whether WSMA's concer ns would be different if the proposal did not include controlled substances in Schedule II. A. Ms. Kolan stated she does not believe they would be different. She will need to run that through the executive committee, leadership, and clinical experts to determine that, but felt comfortable answering that it probably wouldn't change it. Q. Ms. Weeks asked the same question to Dr. Dunbar A. Dr. Dunbar responded that it's hard to say. Fu ndamentally, he sees the value of naturopathic physicians, may see himself referring patients to a naturopathic physician. He stated that he doesn't really know much about naturopathy, except don't eat too mu ch fat. His knowledge about naturopathy really consisted of nutrition. He stated that what we know about opiate receptors, there are 26, 27, 30 opiate receptors, and we are always finding new ones, and ther e are various drugs that will affect those receptor, some in Schedule II, others in Schedule III. He deferred to the medical association. Q. Ms. Kolan was asked whether she has ever heard stories about inconvenience with someone who was visited a naturopath a nd being referred on. A. Ms. Kolan responded that none of WSMA's physicians have come to her with that particular complaint. She hasn't asked that specific question of them, but they represent across the board from primary care practitioners to specialty and sub-specia lty practitioners, and it's a general theme that the issue of referral and re-referral, and over- dual-utilization seems to be a problem across the board for patients. Q. Ms. Kolan was asked if there is a specific number of hours of pharmacology training for MDs. A. She stated she we will follow up with the specific hour s, but she think that, just very crudely, medical schools are 4 years; with an additional residency af ter medical school (3-7 years); and if you want to move into a sub-specialty it's an additional one to three years on top of that. She stated WSMA will follow up with thee specific hours of training, but since the proposal they reviewed had no reference to specific hours and training, they did not have an opportunity to respond yet. Dr. Dunbar added that additional pharmacology training is great for teaching how drugs work, but there's a lot more to it. It's a question of systematically integrating how the drugs work from a psychological component, which you're not going to learn about in a pharmacology class. There is also how they will react to other drugs and other illnesses, and a whole lot of the systematic integration of the training across things. He stated he would not presume to know much about naturopathy if he did 60 hours of training. It would not be equivalent to going to Dr. Guiltinan's school. It would give him a narrow slice, but the trouble is, these drugs are complicated. They've b een around for millions of years and our bodies have learned to become very attached to them, which mak es them a very special and different class of drug. Melissa Weakland, MD Dr. Weakland introduced herself as a family physician medical provider, representing herself. She is an active member in the Washington Association of Family Practitioners and serves on the King County board. But she stated her organization represents a large panel of people, with diverse opinions. She stated she is in support of the naturopathic incr ease in scope; even though her broader organization has Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 136 submitted a statement in opposition to it. She stated she has been a primary care practicing physician for over 10 years, with a very vibrant practice. She wanted to address some of the comments that came up. She said there are two issues that have been discussed . One from the naturopathic side is more about access to quality primary care. She stated the concerns that have been raised about it are about a different issue of safety in helping patients. She stated she th inks we need to recognize there's a very shift in the health care where what's considered alternative treatments can and has become part of mainstream medical care. In her world there are many MDs now pr acticing alternative treatment s, and it's interesting that no one opposes or questions when she wants to do acupuncture or provide supplemental treatments. But somehow, when a naturopath wants to have a broader toolbox, then suddenly there's huge concern that their training is not adequate for it. Alternative care is part of mainstream now. Her patients come in seeking naturopathic care. She said often patients don 't even think about whether she is an MD or an ND. Patients go to someone their friend said was a great doctor. Titles get more concerning in these types of situations. She said that Dr. Krumm gave some examples from the clinical side and a question was raised whether it interrupts the primary care experience as an MD wh en patients come to them for prescriptions that naturopaths can't write. She stated that it does. She received referrals from patient s in this way, not a lot of them, but some. She stated that it's about the pa tient-physician relationship, and she thinks in terms of safety, that is the most important thing in prescribi ng. She knows her patients. She has a patient who comes to her once a year because she does a lot of fl ying for her job and has fear of flying. She uses medication to help with that anxiety that her natu ropathic primary care physician can't prescribe. She comes to Dr. Weakland once a year for 10 or 20 pills. This patient could really roll that visit into a normal primary care visit, but instead has to take tim e out of her schedule and pay for an extra visit. She stated she also had a patient referred to her in acute back pain, who sees a regular naturopathic physician. He has about three episodes of back pain about every 20 years or so, and he came to her because his provider could not provide a narcotic for hi s back pain. It works ve ry well for him. So she had to see him, and she did not have a relationship with him. It's not how she likes to practice medicine, and not what she considers safe medicine. She says it causes a dilemma because she wants to see patients who are seeing her because they want to see her, not because she can write them a script that the provider they want to see can't do. Safety is the main concern. It's the main oppositi on that her organization put forth, as well as the WSMA. But she questions whether there is ev idence that shows that the training she has makes her better prepared to prescribe these medications. She referred to Dr. D unbar's testimony that some of the things he was talking about were not taught to him in medical school . She thinks the safety she has in prescribing is what she learned from working with patients from he r clinical experience over the years. There are different rules in place depending on the dosage of op ioid prescribed. If she has a patient who takes a certain dose of a certain amount of a narcotic, she either has to consult a pain specialist for that, or show that she has special training to do that. So there are different rules that already exist to protect patients from inappropriate prescribing. She also stated that Dr. Dunbar made a great point th at it's a problem that exists now with her and her colleagues. They are the ones prescribing these medications, and it's a big problem. She is curious where the evidence shows that she is so well trained in prescribing these better than what her naturopathic colleagues would be. She thinks her colleagues in the world of medicine are about evidence-based Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 137 medicine and hold themselves pretty high in that. So, she questions where th e evidence is for all the concerns that are put forth about the naturopath and prescribing safety. They have proposed additional training. She feels there would be accountability after the fact. This presents an opportunity. There is a health care dilemma. There is a primary care provider shortage. This is a gr oup of physicians who are very motivated to provide quality care, and there is a barrier to providing it. If we are look for solutions, instead of continuing to put up barriers, this is a potential solution to expand primary care for people who desire it and need it. If there is a problem in the future, it seems it can be addressed at that point. Q. You started that you don't understand why we're c oncerned about expanding the naturopathic scope, because you can expand yours to prescribe or recommend herbs and minerals. I think there's a big difference between expanding scope for controlled substances and offering herbs and minerals to someone. So I'm confused by your statement. I think what we're supposed to do is exactly that; to find out what if best for the patients. Opening up pr escriptive authority for controlled substances is much different than offering herbs or minerals or another natural approach to your patients. Can you clarify? A. Dr. Weakland stated she thinks part of it was brought up earlier about patients potentially being confused if they came to see a naturopath who prescribed a pharmaceutical. She thinks that was partially to address that, but she doesn't think patients are confused at all in that setting. She thinks it is the way of the world, of health care today, that all of the m odalities are being mixed together. She added that, in terms of safety, the patient-physician relationship is what improves safety more than anything, and in general, naturopathic clinics are se t up to have stronger patient-physician relationships than what most of her clinical settings allow her to have. She agreed there is quite a difference between a supplement, but because of chemical properties, she cautioned they ar e not as benign as perhaps sometimes people think. Hearing Wrap Up and Next Steps Kristi Weeks then wrapped up the hearing and provided next steps which included: An additional 10 day written comment period through July 27th, at 5:00 pm for anything that has not been addressed or any rebuttals participants would like to make. The department will share an initial draft report with interested parties in September for rebuttal comments. Those participating in the sunrise will receive the draft as long as the department has contact information. We will incorporate rebuttal comments into the repor t and submit it to the Secretary of Health for approval in October. Once the Secretary approves the report, it is subm itted to the Office of Financial Management for approval to be released to the legislature. OFM provides fiscal and policy support to the governor, legislature and state agencies. It will be released to the legislature prior to the legislative session, and will be posted to our website once the legislature receives it.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide these comm ents and recommendations. We hope you will find them of assistance. Please do not hesitate to c ontact me with any questions or to discuss. Sydney Smith Zvara Executive Director Association of Washington Healthcare Plans 1 http://washingtonacep.org/Postings/e dopioidabuseguidelinesfinal.pdf 2 http://www.atg.wa.gov/prescriptiondrug.aspx#.U8Rdv0Tn_IU I am writing to respectfully provide written testim ony in full support of extending the prescribing privileges for Naturopathic Doctors in the State of Wa shington. I feel that N.D.s in WA should be allowed to prescribe the full range of controlled substances that are currently allowed by other primary care providers. As increasing numbers of N.D.s become licensed and are thus more prevalent in primary care settings, the need for prescribing all the controlled substances that are typica lly prescribed in those settings is only logical. Restricting prescribing privileg es for a particular group of primary care providers leads to duplication of services (when patients must see a second provider for the same problem), and consequently increases the cost of care to ever yone involved. Also, when patients are unable to accomplish a second visit in a timely manner, morbidity persists and can be an additional source of increased health care costs. Since 2007, N.D.s have been safely prescribing all legend drugs, as well as codeine and testosterone ( both controlled substances), and I am conf ident that the same will be true of other scheduled drugs. I am a dually licensed physician in WA (M.D. a nd N.D.), and have been practicing in academic naturopathic settings for the past eight years. I would like to say that I have nothing but the highest regard for my naturopathic colleagues, who, in my opinion , match all other groups of medical professionals in terms of professional skill, dedication to excellence, in tegrity, empathy and commitment to healing in the gentlest but most effective way. I do hope that, in the future, the needs of their patients can be served equally when a controlled substance is the best therapeutic choice. Katherine A. Raymer, M.D., N.D. While I do not know the curriculum for naturopathic school, it is my understanding that naturopathy is a practice of nontraditional medicine that frowns upon th e use of drugs. I am aware that naturopathic physicians are not required to do postgraduate training (medical and osteopathic physicians are) and many decry the non evidence based practices of natur opathy. Based on this, I don't understand why Washington State permits any prescribing by naturopa thic doctors and I certa inly would not recommend allowing them to prescribe controlled substances. Leslie Burger, MD After reading the laws that govern this proposal, I can find at least a dozen good reasons to deny prescriptive authority to Naturopaths, but the overwhelming reason is that the fundamental teaching of naturopathic physicians is a belief that this is an alternative approach to medicine. I have worked with several graduates from Bastyr Un iversity. All expressed thinly covered disdain for traditional medicine like MD's, DO's, and NP's pract ice, and most strongly believing that they knew Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 148better. I simply do not see any reason at all to gr ant these folks prescriptive authority to dispense C-II drugs to an already over prescribed population in the state of Washington. I believe this would just open the door to the possibility that the problem of over prescribing of controlled drugs would just continue to grow. In fact, these are the same drugs that are the cause of overdose and death to people across the nation, not just here in Washington. I would strongly suggest that the Naturopathic Physician stick to the areas of expertise that are stressed in their education, namely using nature's own ways to promote healing, and leave the prescribing of all controlled drugs limited to the professionals that are now licensed to do so . There is no reason to expand access for patients to habit forming and dangerous drugs, and there are dozen s of reasons not too.

Box 45502 Olympia, Washington 98504-5502 Memorandum To: Sherry Thomas, Policy Coordinator, Health Sy stems Quality Assurance, Department of Health From: Dennis Martin, Administrator, Office of Legisl ative Affairs and Analysis, Health Care Authority Re: Sunrise Review - Naturopa th Scope of Practice Change Date: July 15, 2014 Thank you for providing notice of the Sunrise Review hearing regarding change to the scope of practice authority for naturopaths. After reviewing the app licant report and proposed legislation, the Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA) submits the follo wing information regarding the health benefit plans administered by the HCA that could be affected by this proposed mandate, which would allow for Naturopaths to prescribe and administer cont rolled substances (Sch edules II through V). The Heath Care Authority strives to ensure patien ts have access to safe, effective treatment while reducing the number of people who misuse, abuse, or overdose from these powerful drugs. The Authority takes increasing the number of pot ential prescribers seriously, as it may increase the potential for inappropriate prescribing. However, the potential magnitude of an increase of controlled substance prescriptions affecting the benefit plans admini stered by the Authority is indeterminate. The primary concern regarding this practice change is whether ade quate pharmacology training will be required consistent with the change in scope of pr actice. The applicant report states, \"Regulation and supervision by the Board of Naturopathy will as sure proper qualificati ons, education, training, examinations, and maintenance of competency.\" The vagueness of the language leaves room for ambiguity. A specific requirement, such as an additional year of residency which some naturopaths choose to complete, may be more comprehensive a nd appropriate for the propor tional increase in scope. Medicaid has identified no conflict w ith Federal rule. As long as the prescriber has legal authority to prescribe the medications in question (which this legisl ation provides), and the pres criber is enrolled with Medicaid, Medicaid can pay under th e same rules as any other medi cation. Federal rule limits the products paid for, not the status of the prescriber . If naturopaths were a llowed by law to prescribe Schedules II - V, Medicaid would be allowed to pay for t hose prescriptions. The Authority recognizes the potential benefit of more convenient and comprehensive health care of clients whose primary care provider is a Naturopa th, if appropriate and cl early defined pharmacology education and training for Naturopath s were required in conjunction wi th this change in the scope of practice authority for naturopaths. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 161Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 162Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 163 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Written Comments Recived After Hearing July 27, 2014 Please limit prescriptive authority to homeopathic me dications. Legend drugs and controlled substances are beyond the scope of their knowledge to provide safe therapy. What the public doesn't need is another profession who doesn't know how to use medications that can harm them. I have personally seen patients who have been hospitalized from the inadequate use of medications by naturopaths. Thank you. Dr. James Bradley Knott, Pharm.D Director of Pharmacy Naturopathy favors a holistic approach with non-inva sive treatment and generally avoids the use of surgery and drugs. It seems suspect that a doctor of Naturopathy would want to extend their privileges increasing their ability to dispense drugs. The argument based on the notion of fewer Medical doctors available for naturopaths to partner with is a false premise. It seems the request to expand scope of practice is based on revenue. The proposal resists the concept of referring patients when a practitioner is operating outsid e their scope of practice. Scope of practice is based on level of expertise. Naturopaths appear to ha ve a ridiculously wide scope of practice already. A naturopath has the right to give patients mental health counseling, acupuncture, nutritional counseling, and massage to name a few. Can 4-5 years of schooling provide the level of expertise to be solely responsible for the health of a human being? Practitioners of naturopathy often pr efer methods of treatment that are not compatible with evidence- based medicine, and in doing so, reject the tenets of biomedicine. It seems paradoxical that such a group would want to extend their scope of practice to include more drugs. Much of the ideology and methodological underpinnings of naturopathy are in conflict with the paradigm of evidence-based medicine. Many naturopaths have opposed vaccination for example. Why would practitioners of naturopathy want to expand their ability to prescribe drugs? Amy Alpine PhD LMHC CCDC II Hello, It seems to me, that as Naturopathic Physicians are fully trained physicians, that they should have the same prescribing capacity as a other. Patricia Dawson. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 164 I agree that Naturopathic doctors should be allowed to prescribe controlled drugs as they have requested in their proposal in the Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Review application. Linda L Wilcox, R. Ph I have reviewed the material in this email regard ing the WA Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Review. Expanding the WA Naturopathic Physicians Scope to include CII through CV scheduled medications comes with added responsibility, such as more Continuing Education Requirements in Pharmacology. Currently, I am registered as a Pharmacist in both WA and OR. Additionally, I am also licensed as Naturopathic Physician in OR and currently have DEA registration. In Oregon, Naturopathic Physicians can obtain DEA registration and write for controlled substances scheduled CII through CV. Obtaining DEA registration is completely up to each individual Naturopathic Physician. I vote YES to expanding the WA Naturopathic Ph ysicians Scope to include CII th rough CV scheduled medications.-- Sincerely, Paula S. I am a graduate from SCMM in Tempe Arizona. I have practiced in both Arizona and Washington state, and currently have my own practice in Bellevue, Washington. I have had experience working with Medical Doctors and Doctors of Osteopathic Medici ne, and have had experience prescribing scheduled medications. I believe that it is especially important in Washington state, where Naturopathic Physicians are recognized as primary care physicians, that ND's are able to prescribe along the same scope as other primary care physicians. We are trained in pharmaco logy just as MDs and DO's with the philosophy to first do no harm. I believe that with increased prescr iption rights, ND's will continue to practice smart, safe and responsible medicine. It will only give ND' s the opportunity to become equals in the primary care world and allow us the ability to fully manage primary care issues that are already under our scope. Amira Ahdut ND, LAc We ardently oppose the proposal that would allow naturopathic physicians to prescribe Schedules II through V controlled substances of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. As community pharmacists, we witness first hand the devastating effects of ina ppropriate over prescribing of opioids within our local community. We strongly believe that due to the lack of training in both pharmacology and pharmacotherapy, naturopathic physicians are not equipped with the training and experience needed to properly prescribe and monitor patients taking Sche dules II through V controlled substances. By extending their prescriptive authority, we strongly believe there will be a greater danger to patient safety and further contribute to the prescription drug abuse ep idemic in our community. Therefore, we strongly request that the Department of Health reject this proposal due to the overwhelming risks to the public., Duong Bell, PharmD Kavita PharmD Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 165I am writing in support of Naturopathic Physicia ns having prescriptive authority. Naturopathic Physicians are among the most dedicated, ethical, caring and moral practitioners I have ever been acquainted with. It seems to me that since all phys ician/healing professions were at one time nature based the use of prescription medication is a natural extension of the Naturopathic profession. Healing comes in many immeasurable forms, not simply the research ba sed ones; Naturopathic healers are educated, trusted and skilled at many healing forms that humanity has yet to find a way to measure. I wholeheartedly support the use of Naturopathic Doctors having Prescriptive Authority. David Stanzak From my personal and professional experience of working with Naturopathic physicians, I support the expansion sought for their prescriptive authority. I fi nd them to be ethical, well trained and excellent at looking at the physical wellbeing of the whole person which can influence their choice of treatment. They have proven their responsibility to patient care and are certainly qualified to have their scope of practice expanded to include this expanded prescriptive authority. Lynn Stedman, RDH, Director/Associate Professor Dept. of Dental Hygiene Columbia Basin College As a registered pharmacist, I do not feel that Naturopathic Doctors have the training necessary to prescribe the full range of controlled substances accessible to MD, DO, ARNP, and PAs. Jason Rusk, PharmD The WA East Asian Medicine Association (WEAMA ) would like to express concerns about a precedent being set in this Naturopathic Sunrise Review, asserting that acupuncture is cons idered within the scope of practice under the Department of Labor and Industr ies (L & I) classifications for naturopaths. The area of concern is underlined below: WAC 296-17A 6109-04 Naturopaths, N.O.C. Applies to establishments of health practitioners not covered by another classification (N.O.C.) who diagnose, treat, and care for patients, using a system of practice that bases treatment of physiological functions and abnormal conditions on natural laws governing the human body, relying on natural remedies such as, but not lim ited to, acupuncture, sunlight supplemented with diet, and naturopathic corrections and manipulations to treat the sick. This classification includes clerical office and sales personnel, as well as other employees engaged in service in the naturopath's office. We understand that this specific ru le, 296-17A 6109-04, describes the risk class for naturopaths to report work hours and premiums owed for their workers' co mpensation insurance coverage. However, we would like to clarify that naturopaths do not have acupunctu re or dry needling in their scope of practice under their statute (Chapter 18.36A RCW) and have not met the requirements under state law for practicing acupuncture unless they are dual licensed ND and EAMP. In 1999 the Department of Health did a Sunrise Review that specifically prohibited Dry Needling/Acupuncture to be done by naturopaths, and th e Legislature declined to add it to their scope of practice. The legal requirements for performing acupuncture in Washington State can be found under RCW 18.06.050 Applications for examination \u2014 Qualifications. Curtis Eschels, President, WA East Asian Medicine Association Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 166 July 24, 2014 Ms. Sherry Thomas Washington State Department of Health Health Systems Quality Assurance PO Box 47850 Olympia, WA 98504-7850 Re: Sunrise review addressing ND prescriptive authority Dear Ms. Thomas: On behalf of the physician and physician assistant members of the Washington State Medical Asso ciation, the following is our response to staff questions from the July 17 , 2014 public hearing concerning the Sunrise review of naturopathic prescriptive authority. We appreciate this second opportunity to comment, and look forward to working with you and the Department of Health should this proposal move forward. As you'll recall, the WSMA testified in opposition to expanding the scope of practice for licensed NDs that would include the authority to prescribe controlled substances contained in Schedules II-V of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act . Further, we presented our comments in a letter dated July 15, 2014 which included a number of professional medical organizations. No. Opioid medications all carry with them the risk of habituation, addiction, overuse, abuse, and serious complications, including death. Other non-opioid scheduled medications have complex actions in the human body and can result in serious complications i f prescribed for the wrong purpose or prescribed improperly. NDs do not have a background sufficiently based in scientific pathophysiology and pharmacology, or the necessary amount of clinical training in the use of such medications, to prescrib e Schedule III-V. Allowing NDs to prescribe Schedule III-V medications would put patient safety at risk in Washington State. Question : Would WSMA's comments be different if Schedule II was not included? MDs/D Os receive significantly more training in pharmacology than NDs. The Authorization Regarding Controlled Substances, WAC 246-836-211, requires NDs to complete four hours of graduate- level instruction in pharmacology. Question : How many hours of pharmacology do MD/DOs receive compared to NDs? Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 167Ms. Sherry Thomas July 24, 2014 Page Two For MD/DOs, the exact number of hours of pharmacology training completed varies by school. The University of Washington requires its medical students to take two quarters of specific pharmacology instruction , amounting to an estimated 180 hours of class time . In addition, pharmacology is covered as part of many other courses, so medical students learn about pharmacology during the remaining two years of medical school. Equally important, MDs and DOs continue to augment their knowledge of clinical pharmacology, including the indications and contraindications for prescribing medications for diseases and conditions, during their residency training, which may last thre e to five years. Exposure to training in basic pharmacology and clinical pharmacology is more limited for naturopathic students. Furthermore , naturopathic residencies are less common than those for MDs and DOs, are not required, and do not last as long as residencies for MDs and DOs. Thank you for the opportunity to share our comments. If you have questions, please feel free to contact Kath ryn Kolan at (360) 352-4848 or Denny Maher at (206) 956-3640.

At our July 25, 2014 business meeting, the board reviewed the letters submitted by the Washington State Medical Association (WS MA) and the Washington Osteopathic Medical Association (WOMA). As stated in the letter of concern from WOMA, the Bastyr University naturopath curriculum consists of a total of 27.5 contact hours directly related to pharmacology. The board recognizes that this is not enough training to safely and responsibly prescribe scheduled drugs. Compare that, as note d in the WOMA letter, with the 163 contact hours that osteopathic medical students at Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences receive in their first two years.1 Certain allied health professions who have no prescriptive authority have greater than 27.5 hours of pha rmaceutical training. For example, paramedics generally have about 50 hours of pharmacological training in the drugs that they are authorized to administer with no prescriptive authority. The board also recognizes and would like to highlight several key points made in the letter of concern from WSMA: Recent legislative efforts to protect the public from unsafe prescribing practices indicate that granting authority to prescribe scheduled drugs to improperly trained providers is contrary to legislative intent2; Allopathic and osteopathic physicians not only complete didactic courses in pharmacology, but also study the clinical application of pharmacology in their extensive training with relevant medical specialties3; and 1 Letter from WOMA to Ms. Sherry Thomas, DOH dated July 15, 2014, page 1 2 Letter from WSMA to Ms. Sherry Thomas, DOH dated July 15, 2014, page 1 3 Letter from WSMA to Ms. Sherry Thomas, DOH dated July 15, 2014, page 5 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 171 Only ten states allow for limited prescribing authority and none of those ten states allow naturopaths to independently prescribe schedule II - V drugs4. Again, the board shares the concerns previously communicated in letters submitted by WSMA and WOMA and recognizes that the training and education of naturopaths is insufficient to safely exa mine and assess patients who are prescribed schedule II-V medications. Allowing naturopaths to prescribe these scheduled drugs compromises patient safety. Thank you for the opportunit y to comment.

Curtis Thompson Their current scope is more than adequate and I ha ve serious reservations as they are going against the tenants of the practice of Naturopathy. My boss is a past Bastry Grad and completed more post grad education at Harvard in Rheumatology and was a hosp italist at NW Hospital for nearly seven years. He shared that he is getting very concerned as he has ma ny MD and DO friends and he does not feel that the ND's should be Rx'ing pain medication or anxiety meds for which their training is insufficient to accommodate. He also notes serious concerns that the ND community seems to be trying to include in their scope the practice of acupuncture and east asian medicine for which they are not formally trained and are materially and didactically less than the DOH requires in good faith. Thank you kindly, Juliana Mason Prescriptive authority as widely used by M.D.'s, D.O.'s , Physician Ass'ts. are more than adequate for good health care provision in Washington State. N.D.'s should absolutely NOT be allowed to wr ite for controlled substances including narcotic, tranquilizers & CNS stimulants. The N.D.'s should al so be pre-empted from writing for hormonal agents such as estrogenic agents & male hormones including E.D. agents. Let 'em use all the vitamins they want in \"ORAL\" form only. No injections please. Kermit Sheker, M.S., R.Ph. I would greatly appreciate my ND having an expanded scope in prescription writing. I trust my ND for my care, and that includes his prescription writing on my behalf. Pia Marshall Please allow ND's to prescribe medications in the same fa shion as MD's. It is helpful to have this service for patients with their holistic view point. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 179Andrea Dahlman My name is Chris Julien and I have been forced to go to other doctors to obtain prescriptions due to WA law not allowing my naturopath to prescribe me with medication I very much need. I think this is a bad law that needs to be changed. Please change the la w to allow naturopaths to prescribe controlled substances (such as Alprazolam). Chris Julien, CPA, Manager II, Berntson Porter & Company, PLLC I am a practicing naturopathic physician who has ha d first hand experience with the limitations of the current prescriptive authority of ND's. I firmly belie ve patients are hurt by ND's inability to prescribe an equivalent pharmacy to MD's. Below are the negative impacts on my patient's due to my limited prescriptive scope: Financial Impact: Increased costs for visits to another practitioner solely for a prescription Time Inefficiency: Loss of time from work or family or similar inconveniences Quality of Care: Delay of timely care or non-compliance Coordination of Care: Disruption of the doctor patient relationship Please consider recommending expanding ND prescriptive authority. Thank you. Justin Steurich, ND, The Un iversity Health Clinic I would not support expansion of the naturopathic prescr iptive authority, in fact I would support curtailing their authority back to the original basis. They simply do not have the education in pharmacology to adequately protect patient safety with the present protocol. Dave Manning, RPh I believe that if a naturapatic doctor wants to prescrib e controled substances it should be in collaberation with a board certified M.D.. The pur pose behind naturopathic medicine is not to use prescriptive pain meds but to cure with natural substances. If this is allowed I belie ve you will see patients seeking opiate increase with this approval. I do not believe the naturopathic ph ysician to be qualified to presribe anything but naturally occuring substances. Legend drugs and controlle d substances should be left to the M.D. to allow better evaluation of the patient as well as better control of the prescribing of these medications. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 180If you choose to allow this process to continue 10 hours of CE is not enough. There should be a requirement of 10 hours of CE for each class of medication to help insure they are semi-qualified to prescribe. Short of that all prescriptions should be endorsed by a M.D. prior to being filled. Thomas Kloepping D.Ph. R.Ph. I (and my family) have been a patient of an ND (a fe w different doctors) for 17 years now. The fact that they cannot write certain types of prescriptions causes me much trouble in that I have to find another doctor to do that for me. This incurs more time a nd expenses for me and my family. I don't know about you, but extra time and money are pretty tight for us! Please expand ND's prescription writing privileges. Mrs. Tina D. Sander Mr. Daniel G. Sander My name is Aurora Newcomb and I am a schedule coordinator at The Evergreen Clinic, I schedule patients for counseling and medication management. Ti me after time I have had the same issue with patients when I try to explain to them that the clinician that they are requesting cannot prescribe them controlled substances because the state doesn't allow hi m to have that kind of authority. Though he is labelled a clinician who practices naturopathy he does have the same amount of practice and experience that our other clinicians do. Howeve r, he does not have the same authorizations that a doctor of medicine, MD, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner, ARNP, have. One of the most frustrating things is the obstacles pr esented in coordination of care. When there is an emergency patient that needs to see a prescriber, I have a ND with a time slot for the current week and I would be more than happy to get them in, but the car e coordinator does not want to put that patient with someone who cannot prescribe controlled substances. So they have to wait for two weeks to get in with any of the ARNP's or MD's. The delay of care for patient is unbelievable because of the lack of prescribing authority that ND's have. This immediately turns patients away from us becau se of a wait time, and because of the bad experience, it ruins the patient relationship we could have establis hed. We have patients that love our ND and come here from over 40 miles just to see our ND, but they have to go to another prescriber and waste more money if they want to get a controlled substance. It 's an inconvenience in so many ways, it wastes money and time for the patient and that supersedes any notions of ND's approaches to medicine. Patients tend to think an ND's ability to provide care is inhibited by their prescriptive authority because they won't get the medication they need or that they don't know how to handle their problems because they can't go the traditional route of medicine. I know that ultimately, the medical industry is a business when it comes down to the nitty gritty. That doesn't mean we don't have to care about our patients. What good does helping our patients do if it's just going to cost them more money and time to get the help they need just becau se an ND does not have the same prescriptive authority as a ARNP and MD. I rea lly hope the state can do something about this, I know Washington is huge about the naturopathy services that are provided, some other states doesn't even know what that practice is. Just because an ND has a ho listic and natural approach to a helping a patient, Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 181doesn't mean they shouldn't be given the same prescrip tive authority as ARNP's or MD's, they just have a different way of doing things. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I r eally hope it has some impact because our patients and ND's deserve more. If you have any questions feel free to contact me. Aurora Newcomb, Scheduling Coordinator , The Evergreen Clinic I live with a chronic illness that I have been successful at treating and managing with the support of my naturopath. When she lost her ability to prescribe certain drugs, my already hard-to-manage illness became even harder to deal with. All of a sudden, I ha d to travel to and pay for multiple doctors just to get my needs met. Not one of the other doctors could pr ovide the nearly-comprehensive care that my ND was providing. I lost time from work, from family, and from other parts of my life that already were in a fine balance because of my illness. I also was forced to try to develop re lationships with multiple providers who didn't know me like my ND knows me and, frankly, were not as invested in my care because they did not see my illness holistically or see me as regular ly. The medical bills became too heavy for my income level to support. The impacts on my time and finances got to be so heavy that I just stopped taking a couple of my meds and have chosen to \"deal\" when I know that I could be feeling and functioning better. Needless to say, this has had a negative impact on my health - I have had an increase in pain, increase in stress of many kinds. Please expand the prescription authority for NDs in WA so that people like me can have our healthcare and life needs met. Diana Falchuk, Seattle, WA I am against expanding NDs' expansion of licensure to prescribe controlled substances. I am a psychiatric nurse practitioner with 15 years experience in mana ging patients who have a wide range of mental disorders. A number of my patients have worked w ith ND's for various health issues over the years. I have had concerns about a number of clinical issues. On e is the lack of coordination of care. I have never received a call or copy of a progress note from a ND for purposes of care coordination. They seem to work in isolation. Second, many of my patients have told me that their ND has encouraged them to stop taking or reduce dosages of effective medications that I was prescribing. I do not think that as a group of providers they have a good understanding of psychiatric diagnosis and appropriate management that is standard of care in the psychiatric field. Philosophi cally I do not understand w hy they should be able to prescribe any psychiatric medications. Lastly, I worked in a clinic where a naturopath was br ought into the practice. He asked me if I would sign my signature on a prescription for a stimulant that he wrote. He did not seem to understand that I could not write a script for a patient I did not examine. I de clined to do that. My considered his request to be unprofessional. I left the practice shortly thereafter. Janice Stern, ARNP, Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 182 I am writing in support of prescription expans ion privileges for Naturopathic Physicians. I have been a nurse for 18 years and have work ed alongside ND's, MD's, ARNP's and PA's. I believe ND's are very competent and have the e ducation and foreknowledge to write prescriptions safely and manage patients care of contro lled substances, CII through CV. Angela Cotner BS, LPN I work in a private mental health clinic. We have a Naturopath who specializes in Psychiatry in our clinic. I would prefer to send all of my patients to him as I feel a Naturopath has a broader base of knowledge. However I often have to choose another prescriber because the patient is in crisis and needs a controlled substance like Ativan for a few week s. This has caused several of my patients extra waiting time when our Naturopath has availability but can not provide what the patient needs. Please give Naturopaths the ability to prescribe controlle d substances. They of all providers will use these with caution. Jean Hammel, MA, LMHC I am writing on behalf of myself and my primary health care provider, who is a Naturopathic physician. I have a long history of getting kidney stones and while we have reduced the number and frequency of their occurrences, I still, and will probably always be, a 'stone former'. As you probably know, passing kidney stones is ridiculously painful, likened by many to childbirth, and is debilitating to say the least. My physician has been unable to write for any pain meds in these acute situations, forcing me to use an emergency room as a doc tor's office at times. This is a huge expense to me and my insurance company, and a complete waste of my time, as well as those doctors' time, I'm sure they have much better things to do. I did at one time have a Urologist involved with my care as well, having to have had lithotripsy at one point, but she is unwilling to write for pain meds for a patient who she never sees. And frankly, I have no need to see her except to write prescriptions. I trust you will reconsider your decision on this matter for the sake of patient care and the invaluable doctor-patient relationship. My Natu ropathic Doctor seeks to lessen the use of all medications, and I am sure these items will get treated no differently. Shaun Bicknese To Whom it May Concern, it has been brought to my attention that a committee is in the process of considering not expanding ND's prescriptive authority. I have been directly impacted by my naturopath not being able to write a prescription that would ha ve improved my health more quickly and cheaper. What I think the committee forgets is that I have no other doctor for my primary care, and if the committee doesn't approve this authorit y, then the committee is taking away a \"right\" that I have to pick and chose my own doctor. I trust my naturopath, completely, I don't want to have to start the process of picking out a complete stranger to prescribe meds for my husband or myself. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 183Please reconsider giving Naturopaths the rights to prescribe medicines to their patients. Don't force us to go to someone else that will cost precious time, and money that most people can't afford to spend on a doctor visit instead of providing for their families. Jorjan Werry I would like to endorse the expansion of ND prescriptive authority for the following reasons: * Financial Impact: Increased costs for visits to another practitioner solely for a prescription * Time Inefficiency: Loss of time from work or family or similar inconveniences * Coordination of Care: Disrupti on of the doctor patient relationship The current limitations do not make any economic or medical sense and only contribute to decreasing of the quality of care of out-of-network car etakers at the expense of patients Nick Hanzel I am emailing to encourage the expansion of Naturopa thic Doctor's prescription authority. It would save me time, money and allow continuity of care as I won't be required to see multiple doctors simply to obtain prescriptions. I have full faith and trust in the knowledge and care of my ND to provide me the correct prescriptions. Thank you for your consideration. Mark I'm writing to ask the DOH to reconsider their reco mmendation against the expansion of NDs to write prescriptions. As a long-time patient of both NDs and MDs, I have found that our family prefers NDs. It is more than an inconvenience to see our local ND, then have to go to an MD in order to get specific prescriptions, it's has a financial impact on us as well. Multiple doctor visits means multiple co-pays, multip le insurance claims, multiple times spent traveling to different doctors. I've always been proud of our state's healthy view of Naturopathic Doctors as an option for those of us who view health in an holistic way. Seth J. MacGillivray, President, American Railworks I am writing to you with the hope that my word s may have some impact on current legislation surrounding the prescriptive authority of Naturopaths. I am hoping that the Department of Health will expand the prescriptive authority for NDs. As it stands it is not in a patient's best interest. The current legislation makes it so that patient who is in need of a narcotic pain medication must go through a whole extra set of steps that are both a drain on finances and time. It seems to me that patients are punished for choosing to see a Naturopath. Additionally it seems as the Naturopath as a profession is less respected than other doctors due to the limitations that surround them. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 184I feel as though I have received the best care from any doc tor that I have ever seen with my Naturopath. With other doctors, I feel like just another number bei ng pushed in and out the door with as little as time spent on care as possible. It is sad and unfortunate that the majority of MD's are ruled by insurance companies and getting claim. Now what is very unfair is that my ND operates on a different set of standards, yet she can not prescribe the same way another doctor can. It seems like the DOH is saying \"you are not a real doctor, we don't trust you\". So as a result we both suffer. My ND cannot give me the full spectrum of care possible and I have to go and see a second doctor just for their prescriptive authority. Does this seem right? Dose it make sense? I implore you to think about it from a purely logical stand point. It is an odd and expensive game that the DOH makes patients of ND's play. I am in pain and I need something stronger than Ibuprofen 400mg. My ND cannot write for said painkiller. I must spend more money and more time and see an additional doctor in order to get a prescription for a pain medication. This is illogical and insulting. Please review your current legislation and expand the prescriptive authority of Naturopaths. Jessica Roberts We, the naturopathic physicians of Washington St ate, have been informed by the WANP that your preliminary response is against granting NDs the right to prescribe additional controlled substances when necessary. Historically, the Washington DOH has been supportive of efforts to modernize and improve the naturopathic scope of practice to help NDs provide the best patient care possible. I trust with further clarification and understanding, th is will be the case again. From personal testimony working with patients for over ten years, our lack of full prescriptiv e rights has been a detriment to patient satisfaction and continuity of care in many forms. A naturopathic physician has obtained a doctora l degree in medicine\u2014and along with that\u2014the competence, ability, and responsibility to be a lifelong learner in order to stay current with the best practices in medicine and patient care. The philos ophy of naturopathy does not exclude any good method of caring for their patients, including controlled medications when such a prescription is in the best interest of the patient's health. We are governed by our Principles of Naturopathic Medicine and follow a therapeutic order, which means managing our patient s care from least invasive methods toward more intensive ones, which can include controlled medicati ons in certain cases. Each patient and their unique situation dictate this process. NDs are known for taking their time and being thoro ugh with their patients. We do not treat or act recklessly in our care toward our patients. We also u se the proper consultations a nd referrals to specialists as appropriate, as should any other primary care provi der. Personally, as part of my management of patients using controlled medications within our cu rrent scope, I have been accessing the Washington PMP Query since its initiation and I also have patient s sign a controlled substance contract as part of maintaining their treatment safely. I have conti nually educated myself in pharmacology through CME seminars, certification programs, and numerous forms of peer reviewed lite rature. That being said, I treat Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 185my patients with confidence. If I am unsure of something, I know how to take the right next steps in order to provide or refer continued care. Our new patient intake coordinator tells me one hindrance for new patients scheduling with a naturopath is our prescribing limitations. Due to our limited pr escriptive authority, our receptionists need to continually monitor potential patients wanting to schedule with a naturopath for possible services we cannot provide, and certainly should be able to provide. Some patients become very upset after waiting for their appointment and having paid their copay to ju st learn I cannot provide what they require. Patients have said to me numerous times, \"but you're a doctor, why can't you provide a needed prescription?\" Some have come from Oregon for example where NDs can prescribe controlled medications. These limitations have a seriously negative impact on our time, business, and being ab le to grow professionally with the advancements and changes in medicine. It also may create a situation where patient care and safety is compromised due to a delay in obtaining an appropriate and necessary prescription. Patients do not want to be inconvenienced to see a nother provider for a particular prescription their naturopath cannot provide for numerous reasons, incl uding loss of time and added costs. Additionally, medical doctors have told various pa tients of mine many times they do not want to be the provider whose only purpose is to just prescribe the patient's Adderall , Xanax, or Ambien prescription. This definitely frustrates our patients and the providers on both e nds and is a prime example of an inefficient, uneconomical, and potentially unsafe medical practice. Patient safety is compromised by the lack of a therapeutic relationship, which, NDs prioritize on establishing through spending more time with our patients and our philosophy of treating the whole person. This well established relationship with our patients innately supports the patients safety through close monitoring of their treatments. Another issue that frequently arises is a patient l ooking for naturopathic support coming off a controlled medication. Without controlled substance prescriptive authority CII-CV, we cannot titrate a patient off their particular medication while implementing an alternative treatment plan. I have lost many patients that I had an excellent therapeutic relationship with simply because I could not manage one aspect of their care\u2014an example being their ADD stimulant medication. Even when patients l ove their naturopathic physician and have a history of established care, if there is a prescription they need that we cannot provide, they are compelled to move onto another pr ovider who can prescribe it and start all over. Our patients may then need to wait days/weeks to see another provider, who may mistakenly judge them as a drug-seeking unestablished patient. Again, this situati on is simply unfair, frustrates both the patient and the providers, and is a prime example of lost time a nd money due to inefficient patient care and patient safety. In summary, NDs have the knowledge, responsibility, competence, and an established therapeutic relationship with their patients to provide for a setti ng of excellent patient care along with patient safety for the addition of being able to prescribe controlle d medications. These statements are founded in fact, not speculation, as demonstrated by our long history of practicing medicine wit hout harm and maintaining a current medical knowledge through continuing education. NDs are a strong commodity in the state of Washington willing to continue providing primary care medicine to its citizens. Please remove the barrier from Washington NDs scope of practice to optimize our patient care, and accept the expansion of our prescription authority to include schedul ed medications CII-CV. Thank you. Robert Christopher Cotner, ND www.TheEvergreenClinic.com We support the naturopathic docs with FULL prescriptive au thority as they are an integral part of patient care in the systems!! Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 186Kelly Knickerbocker I am a naturopathic patient in Washington State; I ha ve been one for about 20 years. My naturopathic physician has kept my immune system strong and my health stable as I have journeyed through some rather harrowing experiences in the past six years, in cluding two total knee replacements and four years of breast cancer treatment (including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy). The orthopedic surgeon (for the knee replacements) ba rely gave me 10 minutes per visit. He was often unavailable and unsympathetic to my special needs, like the severe pain associat ed with healing bones that had been surgically severed. My naturopathic physician has always given me the time I've needed (as should be the case with any Primary Care Physician) . He shared my frustration when my pain reached an 8 (on the 1-10 pain scale) with no way to alleviate it. Even my pharmacist was appalled at my predicament. My only recourse was to search out a nd visit a pain management specialist (going through additional time and expense) just to get the prescriptions I needed to get through an extremely difficult and temporary situation. In short, the fact that my own naturopathic physic ian could not help me with a needed prescription had the following result: It added to my suffering by delaying needed treatment It caused me to incur additional expenses It cost me additional time away from work when I was already missing extended time for my condition It disrupted the coordination of my total care (and hence the doctor/patient relationship) by requiring that there be another doctor involve d. The time and communication involved in keeping a number of doctors up to speed on the pa tient's current condition is no small feat. Every additional doctor is an add itional burden on the patient. You would be serving the many patients in Washington State who have chosen naturopathic physicians as their Primary Care Physicians (PCP) if you would allow them to prescribe medications as any other physician. Susan M. Rogers I am writing in support of the expanded prescriptive au thority for naturopathic physicians in Washington. I am a patient diagnosed with fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and inflammatory polyarthritis and has been suffering from chronic pain for more than a decade. I am also a nurse for 22 years. I believe that I have a voice to make a recommendation to the legislature to change the law regarding the expanded prescriptive authority for naturopathic doctors. I found that naturopathic medicine works effectively in chronic pain and depression specially if combined with pharmaceuticals including controlled substances. Ho wever, naturopathic doctors could not perform a more integrative approach due to their limited prescriptive authority.This has affected patients like me in many ways such as increased costs for visits to another practitioner solely for prescription, time loss, Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 187delay of timely care, non- compliance and disrupted coordination of care which all adds up to their pain and suffering. I fervently hope for naturopathic physicians to ha ve expanded prescriptive authority so that they can practice the full extent of their education, experien ce and expertise thus providing the highest quality of care. Erlynn Legaspi Currently I see an ND and a MD. I see both because my ND was my primary care doctor and when he transferred to behavioral health, I went with a MD because of my pain medication prescription. I have a somewhat unique story as I have been prescribed narcotic pain medication for 20 years due to car accidents as a youth and sports injuries as a teen. I have never abused the me dication and have taken a very low dosage and low quantity the entire time. I have also of course gone to pain specialists over the y ears. The last one I went to was very clear that if I was only there to have my medication regulated I w as best returning to my primary care doctor but he would be happy to operate and possibly provide temporary relief through an operation on my neck. My frustration with the exclusion of ND's on narcotic pain medication is quiet simply it is an exclusion that requires an individual to either see an ND for a ll primary car and then try to find an MD who is willing to monitor just pain medication. To that I would say good luck. There are few things worse for me than the beginning of a new relationship with a doctor, because of the medication I take I am always viewed with extreme sk epticism, it is hurtful, and humiliating. It is also understandable due to the weight of responsibilit y on every doctor MD or ND that prescribes this medication. In my opinion the current law is a Naturopathic exclusion aimed at reducing the care received by ND's with the final result being a holistic approach to medicine missing a piece of the pie. Thank you for your time, I truly hope you make the decision to allow ND's a better opportunity to completely treat their patients. Jack L Greene I would strongly encourage you to reconsider the current limitations on Naturopaths prescribing controlled substances. I see an incredible Naturopath in Kirkland and her care is invaluable to me! The idea that I would have to go see someone else who doesn't know me and doesn't know my history just for pain medication; if I am need is extremely disappoint ing. A new doctor isn't going to know me or truly know what kind of care works well for me. The relations hip between patient and Doctor is just that a relationship that built overtime gives an incredibly high level quality care. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 188The current restrictions require the view that a Naturopath is incapable of responsibly doing their job which I know is not true. The skill sets my Naturopath has shown me over the past few years has been nothing short of incredible, encouraging, and life changing. Please! Reconsider the unnecessary restriction on Natur opathic doctors and change the law to reflect the trust that I hold for Naturopaths. Kristine Greene I have reviewed the Department of Health draft re port regarding the Sunrise Review and I am concerned that the report doesn't reflect the reality of primary care practice as a naturopathic physician and diminishes our ability to provide appropriate, safe, and cost-effective care to our patients. I have practiced at the Institute of Complementary Me dicine in Seattle for the last 20 years. I am the primary care physician for about 70% of my patie nts. I support the expansion of our prescriptive authority to prescribe, dispense and administ er controlled substances from Schedule II-V. As the naturopathic profession has evolved in Washin gton, it has become essential to the practice of primary care naturopathic medicine to be able to pr escribe these medications to provide the most effective healthcare for our patients and fulfill our responsibiliti es as primary care physicians to our patients. Our holistic approach to treatment emphasizes disease prevention and optimizing wellness. While naturopathic physicians minimize the use of pharmaceuticals by utilizing natural medicines to support the individual's innate self-healing, there are times and ca ses when it is in the patient's best interest to prescribe a controlled substance for a limited period of time. As a profession we are perhaps best educated to minimize these prescriptions exactly in line with the goals of the DOH. Many such cases could be cited but I will just give you two recent instances. In August I diagnosed a primary care patient with 3 kidney stones via CT. I emergently referred her to a urologist and she was scheduled for the next morning. However as the da y progressed her pain increased to the point that she needed narcotic pain control. The urologist couldn't prescribe because she has not seen the patient and I could not due to my license restriction. The only opti on for the patient was to incur the expense and time of an emergency department visit. If I had been able to prescribe an opioid along with the NSAID I recommended, this patient would have had much faster pain control and saved herself and her insurance company considerable money. This past Thursday, I had to tell a patient that I coul d not refill her prescription for the four Tramadol that she uses each month for severe menstrual pain. We have explored many options for this patient and this is the only medication that adequately controls her pa in. I had to convince her to not go to her spine doctor and lie about back pain to get the medication and instead referred her to a gynecologist for the prescription. Another waste of money and it diminishes the patient's view of my ability to care for her. Another instance that requires me to be able to pr escribe these medications is when I am working with a patient to reduce their use of a controlled medication and a new prescription is needed for a lower dose. My experience is that when they go back to the prescribing provider, the provider may not support their efforts to decrease the medication with a goal of discontinuing it. Some patients may not be able to access Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 189their original prescribing provider due to a variety of ba rriers (insurance, distance, financial, etc.), so they are forced to establish with a new provide r solely to obtain the new prescription. Upon request, I could cite more cases for anxiolytics, sedatives and opioids. I am in complete agreement with the DOH that the i ssues of opiate abuse and over-prescription is a very serious issue and have certainly seen patients that have had or do have these issues. I have worked with patients to overcome dependency that resulted fro m inappropriate prescripti ons by other providers. I support the recommendations of the Washington Asso ciation of Naturopathic Physicians (WANP) to expand the education of naturopathic physicians prio r to the ability to prescribe controlled substances. The DOH says we haven't received adequate education to safely prescribe opioid, antianxiety, sedative, hypnotics and amphetamine substances to treat common conditions seen in primary care practice. However, the core naturopathic medical education in this area provides a robust foundation upon which we can add additional training. Our successful use of continuing education in plemented with the last scope of expansion for all legend drugs and the controlled substa nces testosterone and codeine compounds provides sufficient assurance that the mech anism approved by the Washington legislature in 2005 works. The extra CME hours proposed by the the WANP app ear to exceed those required of other primary care providers already with this authority such as the ARNPs. If the DOH disagrees with the education suggestions of WANP, they should respond with a specific recommendation for additional education and hours of continuing education sufficient to overcome any perceived deficiencies to ensure public safety. In summary, please reconsider DOH recommendations agai nst the expansion of naturopathic physicians prescriptive authority. Eileen Stretch ND Essentially the DOH, through their conclusion (attached below) to not recommend expansion of the ND prescriptive authority, is creating an obstacle for patients that entrust Naturopathic Physicians for their primary care medicine. The common primary care issues that specifically are impacted include acute pain, anxiety and sleep dysfunction. This is illogical and ironic given the fact that many allied health providers with significantly less education in sch eduled drug prescribing (Dentists, Podiatrists, Optometrist, PA and as examples, see http://www. doh.wa.gov/portals/1/Documents/Pubs/690158.pdf ) can prescribe a far greater range of controlled substances. Naturopathic physicians have a proven safety record (see: http://www.doh.wa.gov/DataandStatisticalReports/H ealthProfessionsRegulatoryActivitiesUDA.asp) and while the DOH Sunrise Review acknowledges this in the review, it then ignores this in it's recommendation against expanding ND controlled subs tance prescribing. The DOH does not adequately acknowledge the issue of \"dual utilization\", the need to see another primary care provider because the ND PCP cannot prescribe the necessary medication, as \"disr uption of continuity and coordination of care\". That is illogical. Also surprising in the DOH conclusion is the lack of any recommendation for a continuing education/exam path for an ND PCP to be able to provide sufficient evidence of knowledge and safety regarding expanded scheduled drug prescri ption. Note, Oregon allows for NDs to have Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 190expanded scheduled drug prescribing rights, and su pports this with Continuing Medical Education requirements (see: http://www.oregon.gov/obnm/Pages/Pa in-Management.aspx.). My conclusion is that the Naturopathic Scope of Practice Review is flaw ed in it's recommendation and will further hamper efforts of ND PCPs to meet the needs of WA citizens that decide on naturopathic medicine for their primary care. This will only add to unnecessary ED visits, \"dual utiliza tion\" visits to other provider types, more \"fragmented\" care and more burden to the primary care medicine shortage. I would like to formally request that this decision be revisited. Jonathan Bell, ND Ballard Neighborhood Doctors, (a MD/ND integrated primary care clinic that participates in Medicaid and Medicare), Seattle, WA I am Steve Uhrich the owner and executive director of Assessment and Treatment Associates. My medical director is Dr. Amira Ahdut who is a Washington State licensed Naturopathic physician. She sees all our patients for a wellness exam and creates a wellness treatment plan to ensure they have optimal health To success in treatment. Many of these patient have chronic pain and Dr. Ahdut has tremendous success with non-opiate solutions. But, there are cases where medication would be effective and necessary for my patients but due to the current laws regarding ND script rights she cannot Prescribe the proper medications. This means they need to either go to their primary care doctor ( if they even have one) or find a new one to work with. This inefficiency takes time and increases the likelihood that the person may relapse. I would be in full support to allow ND's to have full prescription rights as I am confident that their underlying philosophy would be very responsible and one in which medications are the last resort. I have countless examples of addicted patients over the years who have a \" drug seeking\" attitude seeking out irresponsible doctors who will prescribe them dangerous medications without monitoring and oversight. I see far less risk with ND's versus MD's with respect to the abuse of power over these potentially lethal drugs. Steve Uhrich, Executive Director, Assessment and Treatment Associates I am a Mental Health Therapist here in Seattle Wash ington. There are MANY times that i have needed to refer a client to a physician whom can prescribe medications-many clients wish to go to their Naturopathic Dr. and are not able to because they cannot prescribe the type of medication that many of my clients need. PLEASE consider expanding the prescription rights of these valued physicians. Tracie Carlson MA LMHC Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 191 At the Public Hearing on July 17, 2014, I stated that if controlled substances were added to the prescriptive authority of naturopathic physicians, B astyr would not add additional hours to the current curriculum but would instead adjust the curriculum to include education and training in pharmacology and medication management related to controlled substances. The DOH Draft Sunrise Report also states, \"Bastyr Univer sity, a primary educator of NDs in this region, has indicated it will only revise the current pharmacolog y training to include controlled substances rather than add hours to the training. The additional education and trai ning the applicant proposes is not sufficient to address deficiencies in core training.\" I want to add to these statements that Bastyr University would be willing and able to develop and offer a continuing medical educational program on controlled substances through the University's Department of Certificate, Community and Continuing Education, that could address any current deficiencies in core training to satisfy the new education requirements required by the legislature and the Board of Naturopathy. Bastyr University would also be pleased to offer its assistance in the development of the necessary education and training requirements to ensu re public safety and optimal care by naturopathic physicians in the use of these new medications. Finally, I am submitting a correction in the number of pharmacology hours in the Bastyr University curriculum. The correct number of required didactic hours is 88, not 60.5. Jane Guiltinan, N.D., Dean and Professor, School of naturopathic Medicine, Bastyr University I am a Naturopathic advisor to the Office of Professi onal Regulation in Vermont. I was a contributor to the Vermont Report on Prescriptive Authority for Naturopathic Physicians. I would like to provide comments on Washington's report: 1. In regard to NPLEX, the state of VT did NOT review NPLEX. Rather I was in touch with NPLEX and received information on the exam, which I found to be incomplete after publishing the report. After the VT report was published I revisited the issue w ith NPLEX and received the information that the NPLEX Core Clinical Science Examination DO ES evaluate clinical aspects of pharmacology. I recommend that Washington contact NPLEX directly a nd not rely on the NPLEX information in the VT report. 2. for the table on p 165. Under the column Pharmacology Education/ Continuing Education, this information is from the administrative rules, not the statute. Also, the rules in Vermont will be updated to strike: \"Must pass National Board of Medical Examiners (\"NBME\") pharmacology exam or the exam given in the Medical Pharmacology course in Department of Pharmacology through Continuing Medical Education at the University of Vermont's College of Medicine, or a substa ntially equivalent exam\" Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 192and will be replaced with language stating in effect: \"an examination created by the Office of Professional Regulation\" It was determined that NDs were not eligible to take the NBME and the University of VT exams were not appropriate as they test for introductory pharmaco logy training. The new Naturopathic Physicians Pharmacology Exam has been made available. 3. p 16 paragraph 4 there are two points to correct a. The current formulary will sunset in 2015. NDs in VT will either be able to pursue a license endorsement to prescribe within their scope of training or have no prescribing authority at all. b. I think it would be more appropria te to expand on \"errs on the side of public protection.\" Naturopathic physicians in Vermont as well as other health prac titioners must abide by 3 V.S.A. \u00a7 129a which regulates unprofessional conduct. This is an important component of the issue at hand. Although VT has removed the formulary, NDs still will only be prescribi ng within their scope of training. One reason VT chose this language and a 2 tiered system is to accommodate for the variation in training among ND programs. The Commissioner of Health, Harry Chen MD, even noted that although he has the authority to prescribe and legend or controlled substance, his sc ope of training is emerge ncy medicine, which limits the medications he would prescribe. Likewise, NDs have a variety of training and post graduate training options that will result in variability in prescription drug training. Perhaps Washington c ould consider another level of evaluation for those NDs with adequate training to allow prescribing of controlled substances. 4. Oregon and Arizona both have na turopathic colleges that provide training in controlled substances. However this report only looks at training from one school, Bastyr University in WA. I do not think a survey of one school can adequately describe the scope of training in controlled substances and I think the report is incomplete and deficient if information on the training at NCNM in Oregon and SCNM in AZ is not considered. Thank you for considering my comments.

As the most active association ANMA receives many complaints regarding the prescription practices of this group and is convinced they should not be allowed to prescribe any allopathic medications. Naturopathy has long been considered by many state legislatures as the \"natural practice of healthcare, not a danger to the public\". This is also \"public perception\". A majority of states do not license or allow for the allopathic practice of naturopathy, and certainl y do not allow the inclu sion of writing prescriptions. To grant the right to prescribe any form of drug to the naturopath is very confusing to the public and very dangerous considering the level of education. Requests for expanding their prescriptive rights alone prove their real interest in healthcare is not naturopathic . This group has already proven they cannot be trusted with prescriptive privileges having already misled the states of WA & OR in their use of these rights. These two states have become \" naturopathic prescription mills\". Licensed naturopaths practicing in unlicensed states but holding a state license and possible address in WA or OR write prescriptions causing the pharmacies to unwittingly provide drugs to patients in other states. These naturopaths operate without oversight or authority and admit openly to practicing illegally in state legislative hearings.

Hayhurst , MD, President Fax: 206 -441-5863 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 202 Rebuttal and Suggested Corrections to Draft Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Review Responses from Washington Association of Naturopathic Physicians Contact: Robert May, ND executive@wanp.org 206-547-2130 October 6, 2014 Executive Summary The WANP is committed to the protection of public health and believes that naturopathic medicine offers a unique, valuable perspec tive and model for the Washington healthcare system. We support all efforts to curb and correct the epidemic of opioid over prescription and abuse. We str ongly believe that the naturopath ic model of care can help lessen the use of controlled subs tances and contribute alternatives to the need for opiate medications in particular and c ontrolled substances in general. Naturopathic physicians have a solid f oundation of clinical pharmacology and a well- established history of safe prescribing in Washington at their current authority. With supplemental education, as was implemented in 2007, NDs will be able to utilize all the prescriptive tools appropriate to their primary care scope of practice in a manner that is safe and effective. NDs spend more time with their patients, work from a whole person, comprehensive system of evaluation and are experts in a wi de array of treatment strategies including many that involve diet, lifestyle and non-pharmacologic interv entions. As evidenced in the high ratings of naturopathic clinics in the Washington Health Alliance survey, the public desires naturopathic care and this trend continues to increase. Washington will be well served to recognize the value of natur opathic medicine, the primary care status of NDs and the need for our doctors to have ex panded prescriptive authority in order to provide safe and effective, optimal patient care. Overview The WANP has reviewed the dr aft report released by the De partment of Health (DOH) on 9/23/14 and offers the following comments in response. DOH places primary emphasis in this Sunrise Re view on the issues of opiate abuse, over prescription and public safety. The WANP fully agrees with and shares these priorities and we support DOH efforts to address th em. We also understand that the DOH is concerned about sufficiency of naturopathic medical education and tr aining in relation to expanded prescriptive author ity and public safety. In the following, we offer commentary and rebutta l to specific sections of the draft report that we feel are incomplete and/or inaccura te and we request that DOH reconsider their original recommendation against this Sunrise proposal. If the DOH remains concerned about the WANP's specific recommendations for supplemental education and training, Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 203 we request that they identify and include th e minimum requirements they feel would be sufficient to ensure public safety. WANP Response to DOH Recommendati on Rationales on pages 4 and 23 DOH Rationale #1: The applicant has not proven the current prescriptive authority is inadequate or problematic The WANP provided examples of how current prescriptive authority is problematic in our submission to DOH on July 27, 2014. Th ese examples clearly demonstrate the problematic nature of the current prescripti ve authority for natur opathic physicians and their patients (referenced on pages 70-76 of th e draft Sunrise report.) Furthermore, the WANP cites prior findings of the DOH in the 1992 ARNP Sunrise Review as strong support for our premise that current naturopath ic prescriptive authority is inadequate and problematic. An example from DOH report, page 9: \"Dr. Krumm gave some background on HealthPoint, which is a large, multi-center, community health organization that serves primarily low-income and underserved King Count y patients. HealthPoin t is an important provider of Medicaid services . Many of HealthPoint's pati ents struggle with additional physical, mental and psychosocial stressors th at complicate their care. He shared one recent example where a patient needed pain medication, but the prescription was delayed because Dr. Krumm was not authorized to write a controlled substance prescription; instead, he had to refer the patient to anothe r doctor. He also discussed how reduction in dual utilization and time spent consulting unn ecessarily within a busy primary care practice would be better for the patients. In reporting this, the DOH does not represent the clinical significance of this example and may give the impression that the need fo r a prescription from a nother practitioner was merely a mild inconvenience for the patient. As Dr. Krumm expl ained at the public testimony on July 17, 2014, (page 118 of DOH draft), this case was not about convenience. It was about a patient self-med icating with an inappr opriate drug that had potential to interact with another drug the patient was taking and the consequences could have been fatal. The patient was in pain and was reluctant or resistant to seeing another provider. Dr. Krumm was eventu ally able to get a consult from a prescribing colleague, but by the time the consult and prescription we re secured, the patient's pharmacy closed, and the patient continued to inappropriately self-medicate with a much less appropriate and higher risk drug until the next day. Fortunately, this case ended without a bad outcome, but it demonstrates the potential risk resulting from a delay in medically appropriate treatment. This case is not uni que, and for NDs in smaller practices or isolated areas this collaborative, cross re ferral may not be possible in the time frame needed, and the consequences fo r patients could be severe. This type of issue was identified for nurse pr actitioners and their patients in \"Expansion of ARNP Prescriptive Author ity\" 1992 Sunrise Review, as noted in the following quote from page 8: Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 204 \"Staff concludes that restri cting ARNPs from prescribin g schedule II-IV substances contributes to a lack of access to care, thus representing a serious risk to the public life, health or safety.\" In addition, that report continue s with the following, on page 9: \"Benefit to the public: Prescriptive authorit y expansion will allow/place the full range of drugs within the ARNP scope of practice. This would allow prescribing drugs which may be most appropriate, less costly, better tasting and may have less significant side effects. Staff concurs with this finding. \" The WANP submits that the rationale and conclusion put forward by the DOH for ARNPs in 1992 is reflective of the need an d issues currently facing naturopathic physicians and their patients today. As the DOH noted above, expanded prescriptive authority allows a primary care provider to prescribe drugs 'most appropriate' to a patient's acute condition. The WANP provided a list of common controll ed medications appropriate for primary care and the DOH has not refuted the need fo r these medications in the primary care setting. The fact that NDs do not have acc ess to these medications and that NDs are recognized in statute as primary care provi ders does prove that current prescriptive authority is problematic for natu ropathic providers and patients. The DOH report does not cite the example gi ven by the WANP that the reclassification of the medication Tramadol as a controlled substance by the Washington Board of Pharmacy is another example of how the current limitation of naturopathic prescriptive authority is problematic. NDs have had access to Tramadol, and a history of prescribing it safely, for over 7 years - until August 2014. Because of this change in Tramadol's status, NDs and their patients no longer have access to this effectiv e pain medication. In light of current federal and state attempts to better regulate controlled medications, this type of reclassification will continue to be a problem for NDs and their patients if they are not granted expanded prescriptive authority. DOH Rationale #2: The applicant's proposal does not provide evidence of the disruption of continuity and coordination of care for naturopathic patients that were suggested in the applicant report. The WANP comments above also provide evidence of the disrup tion of continuity of care for naturopathic patients. In addition, current prescriptive authority limitations further disrupt continuity of care and add to increased costs by contributing to unnecessary utilization of emergency room services. This is contrary to goals outlined by the Health Care Authority in the following report: Emergency Department Utilization: Assumed Savings from Best Practices Implementation Third Engrossed Substitute House Bill 2127, Chapter 7, Laws of 2012, 2nd Special Session (Partial Veto) January 15, 2013 Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 205 Washington State Health Care Authority Office of the Chief Medical Officer http://www.hca.wa.gov/documents/legreports/report 3eshb2127emergencydeptutilization.pdf \"Next Steps: The seven best practices adopted by hospitals represent just the first step in reducing unnecessary use of the emergency room. To address the demand side of emergency department care, our state must address th e larger, systemic reasons why Medicaid clients go to the emergency room for their care. ..... In some cases, a lack of adequate or timely access to primary care may co ntribute to unnecessary use of the emergency department. If a client does not have a prima ry care physician, or cannot be seen in a reasonable amount of time for a low acuity need, he or she may turn to the emergency department. .....\" The WANP offers the following statement fr om page 3 from the 1992 ARNP Sunrise report and submits that this well-substantiated characterization of the impact of restricted prescriptive authority on nurse practitioners is pertinent today for natu ropathic physicians and their patients. \"An ARNP's ability to adequate ly practice to his or her full potential has been weakened by the prohibition on prescribing schedules II-IV drugs. This re sults in fragmented, delayed and duplicative care being provided to patients. Delays in receiving necessary medications can lead to incr eased health risks and additi onal costs postponing needed treatment.\" DOH Rationale #3: Full prescriptive authorit y is not necessary for NDs to practice as primary care physicians under Medicaid. On February 15, 2013, after an ex tensive review the Vermont St ate Office of Professional Regulation issued Report on the Education and Clinical Training of Naturopathic Physicians, which included the following statement: \"As the naturopathic profe ssion has evolved, the abilit y to prescribe primary care pharmaceuticals has become essential to the prac tice of naturopathic medicine in order to allow naturopathic physician s to meet patient demand, pr ovide the most effective healthcare for their patients, and fulfill their role in Vermont as primary care physicians. Although naturopathic physicians try to mini mize the use of pharmaceuticals by utilizing natural medicines to su pport the innate self-healing ability of the pa tient, there will be cases where it is in the best interest of the patent in a primary ca re setting to prescribe pharmaceuticals when doing so falls within the scope of a naturopathic physician's education and training.\" The State of Vermont has determined that full prescriptive author ity, including controlled substances II-V, is necessary for NDs to practice as primary care physicians and full prescriptive authority for NDs in VT was enacted in 2014. This finding parallels the recommendation from DOH in 1992 to grant full prescriptive authority for ARNPs. The Washington State Legislature, under SB 5034 - Making 2013-2015 operating appropriations, directed the HCA to \"reim burse for primary care services provided by Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 206 naturopathic physicians\" and recognizes NDs as 'physicians' in th e Medicaid system in the following: WAC 182-500-0085 Health Care Authority, Me dical assistance. definitions\u2014P. \"Physician\" means a doctor of medicine , osteopathy, naturopathy, or podiatry who is legally authorized to perform the functions of the profession by the state in which the services are performed. The HCA began contracting with NDs for participation in Medicaid in January 2014. Passage of the proposed legislation under the Sunrise Review will allow NDs to more effectively provide the primary care serv ices they perform fo r Medicaid clients as required by the legislature. The WANP disagrees with the DOH conclusion that expanded prescrip tive authority is not necessary for NDs to participate in Me dicaid. Primary care is not defined by 'provider type' but by a core set of services, including diagnosis, treatment, and coordination of care, including management of acute conditions. Patients who select a naturopathic physician as th eir primary care provider should not be subject to discrimination regarding delivery of these basic services. Th is includes being able to expect their primary care provider is able to address acute cond itions where the most appropriate care is prescription of a controlled substa nce. Examples of this include acute anxiety, severe sprains and fractures, and kidne y stones. Certain chronic conditions, such as ADHD, may also require the use of a contro lled substance. NDs see all of these types of cases and currently are unable to provide the most appropriate treatment. As ND participation in Medicaid expands and more of our doctors practice in rural and underserved areas, the greater the need will be fo r them to have the ability to manage the range of conditions common to primary care practice. DOH Rationale #4: Referrals for controlled substances are necessary to ensure the most qualified health care professionals a re prescribing these substances, which are controlled because of their significant risks to public health due to overdose, abuse and misuse. Referrals for chronic opioid th erapy, particularly at doses greater than 100-120MED, are well described in the Interagency Guidelin e on Opioid Dosing for Chronic Non-cancer Pain and academic literature and the WANP agrees that these patients should be co-managed between a primary care provider and a board certified pain specialist. However, referrals are not clinically appropriate for most controlled substance prescriptions for acute cases in primary care practices. An acute case, by its very nature, requires appropriate and timely treatment. Any delay in treatment due to referrals can put a patient's care and safety at risk. The WANP agrees that controlled substances pose a significant risk to public health due to overdose, abuse and misuse and that only qualified healthcare professionals should prescribe these substances. However, we believe that with implementation of the WANP's recommended supplemental education a nd increased continuing education that NDs will meet these requirements and will continue the safe prescribing history they Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 207 have had with controlled medications since 2007. That prescribi ng history has included controlled substances testosterone and codeine-containing compounds as well as the recently reclassified drug Tramadol, now a scheduled medication. DOH Rationale #5: The applicant has not shown NDs receive adequate education in clinical pharmacotherapy of prescribing opioid, antianxiety, sedative, hypnotics, and amphetamine substances to treat vario us disease states to safely prescribe controlled substances. The desire to add eight hours of additional education and 10 hours of continuing education is not sufficient to overcome the deficiencies. Naturopathic physicians have had expanded prescriptive authority since 2007 that has included all legend drugs and the controlle d substances testosterone and codeine- containing (opiate) compounds. Accordi ng to the Naturopathy Program at the Department of Health, there ha ve been no complaints against NDs for issues related to prescribing within the current scope of practice. In 2005, the legislature expanded naturopathic pr escriptive authority to include all legend substances and the controlled substanc es testosterone a nd codeine-containing compounds. In response to that scope expansion, DOH developed and implemented WAC 246-836-211 \"Authorization regarding c ontrolled substances\" requiring NDs to complete four hours of supplemental education in order to be able to apply for a DEA number (required for prescribing controlled su bstances.) Since that time, NDs have had a very safe record of prescrib ing with no record of formal disciplinary ac tion against NDs for prescriptions within the current scope of authority. It should be emphasized that NDs have been safely prescribi ng opiate pain medications, li mited to codeine products and tramadol, in the primary care setting si nce 2007 for acute and chronic conditions, including pain. This affirms that the c ontinuing education model introduced by the legislature in 2005 and implemented by DOH in 2007 was successful and that the supplemental education was built upon a strong core naturopathic education in clinical sciences including pharmacology and pharmacot herapeutics. We are confident that application of this same model in impleme nting additional educational requirements in controlled substances will be sufficient to protect the public. The WANP believes the proposed legislat ion, with the addition of recommended amendments to requiring rule-making to de velop adequate educat ion and training in controlled substances, will be sufficient to ensure public safety. If the DOH believes alternate educational require ments would better protect public health, the WANP encourages DOH to identify the minimum amount of education necessary for public safety and include this in the final re port for consideration in rule making. DOH Rationale #6: The department does not see a need to increase access to prescription opioid pain medications that are included in this proposal because: 6.1 Prescription opioid related overdoses and deaths have reached epidemic levels. The WANP recognizes the severi ty of the problem with opiat e overuse and abuse in the US and supports an aggressive strategy to addr ess this problem. Naturopathic medicine Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 208 offers an alternative approach to primary care that focuses on elements of diet, lifestyle, patient education and prevention as well as many non-drug techniques (e.g., naturopathic manipulation and other physical me dicine techniques) that can be a valuable addition to the Washington health care system. However in some acute cases, a short-term opioid prescription for a carefully screened patient may in fact be the most medically appropriate treatment. As primary care providers, NDs need the ability to provide th e most appropriate medication necessary and in a manner that does not put patients at risk due to unnecessary delay. Like every other primary care provider, NDs take great care to follow established guidelines to prevent medication misuse, abuse and diversion, and fo rtunately they have access to systems such as the State's Prescription Monitoring Program, Opiated Dosing Guidelines and the Agency Medical Directors Group Guidelines as a resource and to help screen for drug-seeking patients. 6.2 Data has shown a correlation between the rise in overdose deaths and states that have expanded the use of prescription opioids. The WANP requests the DOH identify the states with an increase in overdose deaths to clarify if any of these stat es have included licensure fo r naturopathic physicians, and assess if this data is relevant to na turopathic physicians in Washington. 6.3 The U.S. Drug Enforcement Admini stration (DEA) on August 22, 2014, announced final rules reclassifying hy drocodone combination products, such as Vicodin, from a Schedule III to Schedule II controlled substance, including tighter restrictions on prescribing these products, citing the \"substantial evidence of potential abuse.\" Reclassification of controlled substances is an appropriate and necessary response on the part of the DEA and is likely to impact addi tional medications in the future. The WANP has shared the example of the reclassification of Tramadol and the impact this has had on naturopathic physicians who no longer have access to this medication under current prescriptive authority. This has interrupted the care of naturopathic patients and could result in use of less effective medications or the need for prescriptive referral to other types of primary care practitioners. Expa nded prescriptive authority for NDs in Washington is necessary to ensure continue d access to other medications that may be reclassified in the future. 6.4 The state is currently engaged in intensive and effective efforts to curb the overuse of opioids in Washing ton. Granting broader prescribing authority for controlled substances is contrary to these efforts. The DOH rationale here suggests that a morato rium on new prescriptive authority for any type of provider is needed in Washi ngton, including MDs, DOs, ARNPs and PAs. However, this clearly would not serv e the public interest. Such an action would compound the primary care shortage, increase dua l utilization, and disrupt continuity of care in the same manner that is occurring for na turopathic physicians and their patients in the current system. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 209 The WANP does not feel that this type of indiscriminate, quantitative approach to the overuse of opioids in Washington is to be recommended. Instead, we believe that a qualitative focus on health promotion, patient education and inclusion of non-pharmaceutical treatments, such as those o ffered by NDs within an integrated and expanded scope of prescriptive authority is be st suited to address this epidemic issue. Naturopathic medical education has a strong core of clinical pharm acology training. It also includes a unique context and perspect ive for healthcare that includes more time with patients, in-depth diagnoses, and an emphasis on alternativ e non-drug therapeutics that will be valuable in countering the current trend towards the over prescription of controlled substances. This whole person, i ndividualized approach to primary care will also lessen the need for controlled substan ce prescriptions and assist those patients currently taking opiates and other controlled substances to decrease or eliminate the need for these drugs. Expanded prescriptive author ity in conjunction with the naturopathic focus on natural therapeutics will enable NDs to offer optimal coordination and continuity of patient care. Efficacy of this 'naturopathic approach' is found in the following studies and provides evidence that naturopathic phys icians can help patients de crease the use of controlled substances: Characteristics of ND practice and comparison to conventional primary care, Integr Med Insights. 2014 May 19;9:7-15. doi: 10.4137/IMI. S14124. eCollection 2014. Naturopathic practice at North American academic institutions: description of 300,483 visits and comparison to conventional primar y care. Chamberlin S, Oberg E, Hanes D, Calabrese C. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4039213/ Summary: Based on survey data from the Center for Disease Control, naturopathic primary care providers spend twice as much time per year with patients as conventional providers. This suggests more face-to-face time between NDs and their patients. The study also reports that NDs routinely employ a ho listic orientation towards diet and physical activity as interventions, which ma y be more appropriate for musculoskeletal pain in which trial data suggests positive outcomes.

Utilization, patient satisfa ction, and cost implications of acupuncture, massage, and naturopathic medicine offered as covered he alth benefits: a comparison of two delivery models. Summary: Survey data from several hundred adu lts in Washington and Oregon indicated approximately 50% of those surveyed perceive d a decrease in their use of pharmaceutical treatments. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 210 \"Attitudes Toward Naturopathic Medicine\" , a telephone survey of 606 individuals, 18+ years of age in Ontario, Canada, conducted by Innovative Research Group, Inc. (Toronto/Vancouver) reports that nearly 3 in 10 (28%) ND patients in Ontario, Canada, feel NDs have either significantly or noti ceably reduced their us e of prescription medication. Sunrise Criteria Review from DOH draft report page 21 First Criterion: Unregulated practice ca n harm or endanger health or safety. DOH: \"NDs are currently a thoroughly regula ted profession. The public health and safety benefit of expanding their prescrip tive authority hasn't been proven, and the potential for harm is present. Controlled substances are often dangerous drugs and are scheduled based on their potential for misuse, abuse and dependence. Opioids are used at epidemic levels, with a correlation shown betw een the rise in overdose deaths and states that have expanded prescription access of th ese substances. The department does not see a need to increase access to these medications. Naturopathic schools include training in pha rmacology that varies in content and length, which must compete for class time with the training provided in botanicals, nutrition, homeopathy and other naturopathic principl es. It does not include sufficient training specific to controlled substances, and Bastyr University, a primary educator of NDs in this region, has indicated it will only revise the current pha rmacology training to include controlled substances ra ther than add hours to the training. The additional education and training the applicant proposes is not sufficient to address defi ciencies in core training.\" WANP : The applicant agrees that naturopath ic medicine is a thoroughly regulated profession. NDs have an established safety re cord for their current prescriptive authority that includes limited controlled substances in schedules III-V. Th e DOH summarizes that, \"The increasing shortage of primary care providers in response to Medicaid expansion and increased coverage under th e Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) is making referrals more challenging. In res ponse to department questions about the primary care shortage and its relationship to this proposal, we have previously provided DOH with numerous references (see Appendix B). It also in cluded references to support the anticipated increased shortage due to th e expansion of Medicaid.\" This evidence (Appendix B) establishes the readily apparent potential for public harm due to lack of access to primary care. Restricting NDs from prescribing schedule II-V substances contributes to a lack of access to care, thus representing a seri ous risk to the public's life, health or safety. Second Criterion: The public needs and will benefit from assurance of professional ability. DOH: \"There are adequate laws and rules in place to assure the public of initial and continued professional ability for the curre nt ND scope of practi ce. The proposal under review does not contain this assurance because the applicant has not shown adequate core training or that the additiona l education proposed will ensu re the public of professional ability to safely prescribe controlled substances.\" Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 211 WANP : WANP agrees that \"there are adequate laws and rules in place to assure the public of initial and continued professi onal ability for the current ND scope of practice.\" These laws and rules have been pr oven effective at protec ting the public as the naturopathic profession and scope of practic e has evolved to better meet Washington healthcare needs. Specifi cally, the use of supplementa l education, approved by the legislature in 2005 and the DOH vi a rules in 2007 for the init ial inclusion of controlled substances in the naturopathic prescriptive authority, has proven effective as evidenced in the safe prescribing history of NDs since 2007. This model forms the basis for the supplemental and continuing education in th is proposal. Furthermore, the proposed additional education meets or exceeds that of other provider types with full prescriptive authority as evidenced in the applicant's submissions (see items 8, 13 and 14 below under WANP comments on specific draft text). Third Criterion: Public protection cannot be met by other means in a more cost beneficial manner. DOH: \"The current naturopathic scope of pract ice protects the public. The applicant has not demonstrated that continuity and coordi nation of care is being unduly disrupted with the current prescriptive author ity. Primary care providers regularly refer patients to other practitioners as needed. In addition, the epidemic of opioid abuses and the correlation to increased prescribing of these substances cl early shows that there is already enough (or too much) access to these medications.\" WANP : We request DOH to consider that in the 1992 ARNP sunr ise it found that prescriptive authority expansion for ARNP s would benefit the public because \"This would allow prescribing drugs which may be most appropriate, less costly, better tasting and may have less significant side effects.\" Furthermore, the DOH concluded \"it seems likely that overall cost of medical care woul d potentially be decreased by elimination of duplication, double billing and reduced emerge ncy referrals for filling of Schedule II-IV prescriptions.\" These facts have not changed and are not dependent on the license type of the provider. The WANP recognizes that appropriate referrals are integral to primary care practice. However, the WANP does not agree that referral to the ER or attempts to refer patients to other PCPs for acute conditions requiring controlled s ubstances would be considered best practice. The WANP supports state efforts to conf ront the opiate abuse epidemic and supports use of all State re sources, including the Prescription Monitoring Program, Opiate Dosing Guidelines, and Agen cy Medical Directors Group Guidelines. WANP Comments on specific Draft Report text 1. DOH reports testimony of Bastyr University on page 9. \"However, Dr. Guiltinan stated that if the pr oposal were enacted by the legislature, she does not think Bastyr would add hours to th e current training but would adjust the existing pharmacology hours to incorporate controlled subs tance training.\" Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 212 WANP: Resources exist to provide supplemen tal education needed to train NDs in expanded prescriptive authorit y. Bastyr University confirms interest and ability in developing and offering supplemental educatio n to fulfill any requirements enacted by the legislature related to this legislation. The WANP understands that Dr. Jane Guiltinan, Dean of Naturopathic Medicine at Bastyr University will be submitting confirmation of this separately. In addition, the WANP has learned that due to a curriculum revision underway at Bastyr University, the correct number of contact hours for ND pharmacology was inaccurately reported to DOH. Rather than 60.5 hours in the core ND curriculum, this total is actually 88 hours - and there is an elective with an additional 20 hours available to ND students. 2. DOH report identifies opposition to Sunrise Review on page 9: \"We received 15 letters in opposition to the proposal from organizations, including the Washington State Medical Association (WSM A) that was undersigned by a number of organizations representing physicians in various specialties; Washington Osteopathic Medical Association (WOMA); Washington Ac ademy of Family Physicians; Providence Health and Services; Washington State Medical Quality Assurance Commission; and other health care providers. We received lett ers with concerns from the Association of Washington Health Plans (AWHP), Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA), and Washington East Asian Medicine Associa tion (WEAMA). (See Appendix D for written comments received.): WANP: It is unclear why DOH included the HCA letter in the paragraph describing letters of opposition. The HCA concluded th eir letter with the fo llowing statement of provisional support for expanding natur opathic prescriptive authority: \"The Authority recognizes the potential bene fit of more convenient and comprehensive health care of clients whose primary care pr ovider is a Naturopat h, if appropriate and clearly defined pharmacology education and training for Naturopaths were required in conjunction with this change in the scope of practice authority for naturopaths.\" In addition, it is unclear w hy DOH included the letter from WEAMA in this category when that letter did not address the topic of controlled substances at all, but rather acupuncture which is not a subj ect of this Sunrise Review. 3. DOH reports implies NDs limited to 'natural therapeutics' on page 10: \"NDs have their place in the health care syst em as providers with a philosophy that seeks to restore and maintain optimum health by emphasizing nature's inherent self-healing process. According to the Am erican Association of Natur opathic Physicians, this is accomplished through education and the ra tional use of natural therapeutics.\" WANP: We are unable to determine the specif ic source for the statement the DOH attributes to the AANP on page 10. However, the current AANP website (http://www.naturopathic.org/content.asp?contentid=60 ) includes the following statement: Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 213 \"NDs are trained to utilize prescription drugs, although th e emphasis of naturopathic medicine is the use of natural healing agents.\" We support this statement and note that it is consistent with WANP perspective that NDs are able to utilize prescription medications in the context of finding more natural, non- pharmaceutical treatments wherever appropriate. In the case of cont rolled substances and opiate medications, this broader emphasis on 'n atural healing agents' will allow NDs to use less opiate medication and to assist pa tients with finding non-opiate treatments for those already taking them. 4. DOH report suggests prescriptive authority for providers with less training than MDs is dangerous on page 10: \"MDs and DOs have substantially more pharmacology training, including the additional years of residency training. Granting providers with less training the authority to prescribe dangerous controlled substances is unnecessary and contrary to the intent in legislative efforts such as ESHB 2876 (Chapter 209, Laws of 2010).\" WANP: This DOH statement does not reference or acknowledge that ARNPs and PAs (as well as Dentists, Podiatrists and Optometrists) currently have prescriptive authority for controlled substances and that both have less education and tr aining than MDs and DOs. Neither ARNPs nor PAs have access to or are required to complete residencies prior to licensure. 5. DOH report cites concerns about na turopathic education on page 10: \"AWHP stated the following: The applicant sh ould be required to provide details about naturopathic educational curriculum, particular ly in relation to controlled substances and dealing with addiction.\" \"The HCA stated its primary concern is that an increase in prescriptive authority for NDs must include adequate pharmacology educatio n and training. It was concerned with the vagueness of the language in the draft bill and suggested the addition of a requirement for a one-year residency.\" WANP: The above comments were submitted to DOH originally without benefit of the details of naturopathic education. These details were submitted by WANP in response to the DOH \"Follow Up Questions to App licant\" on July 9, 2014. Kathryn Kolan, representing WSMA, noted the l ack of distribution of this in formation in her testimony at the public hearing on July 17, 2014 (page 125 of draft Report.) 6. DOH report cites objection to ND s performing acupuncture on page 11: \"WEAMA sent a letter with concerns about one of the references WANP provided to show support of NDs being considered primary care physicians. The reference was to a Department of Labor and Industries definition regarding covera ge of health practitioners not covered by another classi fication who diagnose, treat, and care for patients (WAC 296-17A-6109). It included acupunc ture in the list of reme dies these NDs may use. WEAMA requested to go on record in this report to state that acupuncture is not within naturopaths' scope of practice.\" Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 214 WANP: WEAMA's comments did not address the focus of this Sunrise Review and should not be counted in the tally of letters of opposition. This Sunrise is explicitly limited to expansion of naturopathic prescr iptive authority for controlled substances. 7. DOH report is unclear about Medicaid patient population on pages 11 and 13: Page 11: \" The applicant has speculated that the expansion of Medicaid will include an expanded demographic of patients with me dical conditions that require controlled substances in the naturopathic primary care setting.\" Page 13: \"The Centers for Disease Control and Pr evention (CDC) reports that abuse of prescription and nonprescription opioid painkillers is a public health epidemic that can lead to unintentional poisoning deaths.... Data shows that states with higher sales of prescription opioids have higher rates of overdose deaths. In addition: Medicaid clients are twice as likely to receive an opioid prescription co mpared to non-Medicaid clients and are six times more likely to have a fatal overdose involving prescription opioids.\" WANP: The DOH citation of CDC data confirms that Medicaid expansion will include an increased percentage of patients with me dical conditions requi ring management of opioid prescriptions in the naturopathic pr imary care setting. Naturopathic physicians can offer a valuable contribution to Medica id patient care with emphasis on dietary, lifestyle, prevention, patient education and ot her methods that decrease the need for opioid medications. However, in certain cases a controlled medicati on may indeed be the most medically appropriate treatment. As st ated before, in some cases a delay in a medically necessary prescription can compromi se patient safety. Expanded naturopathic prescriptive authority will allow NDs to manage these patients more safely and effectively and will also reduce costs and disruption of care caused by the need for additional office visits. 8. DOH report criticizes naturopathic core education and WANP recommendation for supplemental education on pages 13 - 14: \"The applicant has not shown that the cu rrent educational standards for clinical pharmacotherapy relating to prescribing op ioid, antianxiety, sedative, hypnotics, and amphetamine substances for various disease st ates is sufficient to provide for patient safety and good clinical outcomes. An additional eight hours of training and additional continuing education for controlled substance prescribing for NDs, without evidence of a strong foundation within the core naturopathic training, will not be sufficient to protect the public. WANP: The naturopathic profession has been evolving over the years to meet the changing needs of Washington citizens. In 2005, the legislature expanded naturopathic prescriptive authority to include all lege nd substances and the controlled substances testosterone and codeine-containing compounds. In res ponse to that scope expansion, DOH developed and implemented WAC 246-836-211 \"Authorization regarding controlled substances\" requiring NDs to comp lete four hours of supplemental education in order to be able to a pply for a DEA number (require d for prescribing controlled substances.) Since that time, NDs have had a very safe record of prescribing with no Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 215 record of formal disciplinary action agains t NDs for prescriptions within the current scope of authority. It should be emphasized th at NDs have been safely prescribing opiate pain medications, limited to codeine products and tramadol, in the primary care setting since 2007 for acute and chronic conditions, including pain. This affirms that the continuing education model introduced by th e legislature in 2005 and implemented by DOH in 2007 was successful and that the supplemental education was built upon a strong core naturopathic educa tion in clinical sciences including pharmacology and pharmacotherapeutics (see WAC details below). WAC 246-836-211 - Authorization regarding controlled substances (1) Upon approval by the board, naturopa thic physicians may obtain a current Federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration. The board may approve naturopathic physicians who have: (a)Provided documentation of a current Federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration from another state; or (b)Submitted an attestation of at least four hours of in struction. Instruction must be part of a graduate level course from a school approved under chapter 18.36A, 18.71, 18.57, or 18.79 RCW. Instruction must include the following: (i) Principles of medication selection; (ii) Patient selection a nd therapeutics education; (iii) Problem identification and assessment; (iv) Knowledge of in teractions, if any; (v) Evaluation of outcome; (vi) Recognition and management of complications and untoward reactions; and (vii) Education in pain management and drug seeking behaviors. (2) The naturopathic physicians must re tain training documentation at least five years from the attestation date. In this Sunrise Review, the WANP ha s recommended 12 hours of supplemental education, not 8 hours according to the DOH Sunrise Draft Report, and an increase of annual continuing competency requirements to 30 hours per year with 10 of those hours in pharmacology. These requirements are comp arable to and exceed the requirements for ARNPs in Washington State. If DOH feels the recommended supplemental educational requirements are insufficient, the WANP requests that they specify what minimum amount of additional education would be sufficient. The WANP shares the concern for public safety in the practice of naturopathic medicine and in pa rticular with regard to the in creased risks associated with controlled substance prescriptions. 9. DOH report suggest no evidence for naturopathic safe prescription record on page 15: \"The applicant states that NDs have been practicing within their current prescriptive authority safely. This authority includes ma ny legend drugs that have significant risks such as potential for drug interactions or seri ous potential side eff ects and complications Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 216 such as Coumadin, lithium, and insulin. WANP speculates that NDs have been prescribing these medications safely (note: no data was provided to support or refute this assertion).\" WANP: The WANP did not speculate on the safety record of ND prescribing. On June 19, 2014, the WANP contacted the DOH Natur opathy program and asked the following: \"...how many, if any, complaints there have be en against NDs for issues related to the currently authorized contro lled substances, i.e. testosterone and codeine?\" We received this response: \"Since the effective date of the expanded scope (November 2, 2007), there haven't been any complaints related to prescribing substances that are in the authorized scope (i.e. legend drugs; codeine and te stosterone products). There have been a total of 216 complaints received since November 2, 2007. Of those, 24 were related to prescribing outside statutory scope of practice. 4 of those were closed without action, 9 ended in the issuance of Stipulation to Informal Dispos itions (STIDs), and there are still 11 in process.\" Further, the Vermont Office of Professional Development found that \"the safety records of NDs in states with licensu re are typically better than those of MDs and DOs in these states.\" The report also not ed, \"the safety record of na turopathic physic ians regarding pharmacologic substances is well demonstrated in the northwest wh ere NDs have broad prescriptive authority. Jury Verdicts Nort hwest, a legal database which records court cases in Washington and Oregon, the area of the country with the largest number of naturopathic physicians, shows no judgments for malpractice against N.D.s since the database was started in 1983 through 2010.\" 10. DOH report states Council on Naturopathic Medical Education has no standard for pharmacology training on page 15: \"There are no CNME standards for pharmacology contacted CNME the followi ng reply from Daniel Seitz, JD, EdD, Executive Director of CNME: \"The report is not entirely accurate. CNME Accreditation Standard VI, \"Program of Study,\" states the following under Section B.5: The academic component provides an in -depth study of the human body, as well as instruction in a variety of therapeutic and clinical subject areas relevant to the practice of naturopathic medi cine; where appropriate, instruction includes related experiences in laboratory settings designed to reinforce and augment students' classroom learning. The following s ubject matter/courses are included: ... f. Pharmacology and pharmacognosy As you can see from this excerpt, we do not specify the depth to which pharmacology must be covered. Interestingly, LCME's [Liaison Committee for Medical Education] Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 217 curriculum standard for MD training doe s not even reference pharmacology..... If you compare the ND and MD curriculum standards, you'll see that the ND standards are far more specific regarding required subject matter.\" 11. DOH report cites Vermont assessment of ND educational standards for clinical pharmacology on page 16: The Vermont report recommended a conservative approach to ND prescribing that \"errs on the side of public protec tion.\" It included a number of recommendations to be completed as a condition of enacting expanded prescriptive authority. These included passage of a naturopathic pharmacology examin ation, a period of prescription review by another authorized prescriber for new practit ioners, and continuanc e of a formulary of substances that may be prescribed for pa tients and the conditions the naturopathic physician is competent to treat based on that ND's training and experience.\" WANP: The WANP recommendations are base d on the successful integration of expanded naturopathic prescriptive authority to include all legend drugs and certain controlled medications, passed by the legislat ure in 2005, and the demonstrated safety record for the profession since that time, with the addition of supplemental education requirements and an increase in the a nnual CEU requirement for naturopathic physicians. As outlined in the Vermont report, other states have adopted various means of implementing expanded naturopathic prescriptive authority. As explicitly stated in the WANP Applicant report, we recommend and w ill ask the legislature to require the Board of Naturopathy to initiate formal rulemaking to develop the most a ppropriate process and regulatory means for Washington state. We request the DOH to identify the recommendations they feel would be suffici ent to protect the public in this regard. 12. DOH report identifies nature of RN pharmacology training on page 17: \"Education to become an RN includes pha rmacology education and principles to appropriately and safely admi nister medications and assess patients' responses to them.\" WANP: In assessing the core nursing educati on, as it relates to pharmacology, it is important to note that Bachelor's level RN education does not appear to include diagnosis or prescription of medications. In compar ison, naturopathic medical education includes diagnosis and prescription of medicati ons, both didactically and clinically. 13. DOH report outlines ARNP continuing education requirements on page 17: \"WAC 246-840-360 requires that ARNPs meet the following requirements to renew their licenses every two years: \"Minimum of 250 hours of independent cl inical practice in the ARNP role; and Completion of 30 continuing education hours re levant to the area of certification and scope of practice. Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 218 Initial application for ARNP prescriptive au thority requires at least 30 contact hours of education in pharmacotherapeutics....\" WANP: Core naturopathic education incl udes 70 - 90 hour s in clinical pharmacology. Revised contact hours from Bast yr University indicate that ND students have a mandatory requirement for 88 hours of pharmacology course work and an elective option for an additional 20 hours. 14. DOH report outlines ARNP p. 17 - 18 \"Renewal of ARNP prescriptive authority is separate and requ ires 15 hours of continuing education in pharmcotherapeutics relevant to the area of certification and scope of practice, in addition to the 30 hours of continuing education requ ired for licensure renewal (WAC 246-840-451). WANP: The WANP is recommending that th e ND requirement for continuing competency be increased from the current 20 hours per year to 30 hour s per year with 10 of those hours specifically in pharmacology. This will exceed the requirements for ARNP licensure renewal that amounts to 15 hours every 2 years in pharmacology in addition to a general requirement for 30 hours of continuing education every 2-year renewal. 15. DOH report cites examples of other ND quality assurance provisions on page 18: \"All four states are uniform in the requirement of continuing education in pharmacology for license renewal. However, each state also has unique requirements, which include: - Arizona, Oregon, and Vermont require ad ditional pharmacology courses and/or pharmacology/formulary examinations for licensure. - Oregon includes a one-time mandatory pain management course. - California requires supervision by an allopa thic or osteopathic physician for Schedule IV-V controlled substances and a patient-specific protoc ol checked by a supervising physician for Schedule II substances. - Vermont requires a period of prescription re view by an authorized prescriber for new providers.\" WANP: As mentioned previously, other states ha ve various prerequisites in place for ND prescriptive authority of controlled substances. WANP recommends and will request the legislature to ensure that legislation includes the provision to require formal rulemaking by the Board of Naturopathy to de termine the most effective and appropriate regulatory process for Washington State. 16. DOH report cites evolution of ARNP prescriptive authority on page 19 \"The prescriptive authority of ARNPs has e volved in response to specific needs in the healthcare system. These have included evidence that ARNPs have filled specific voids in rural and underserved areas, and their num bers and distribution have made them effective in filling these gaps. In contrast, the applicant testified that the vast majority of NDs practice within King, Pierce and Snohom ish counties. A map provided by the applicant shows that more than half of all NDs licensed in Washington are in King County alone, and ten counties have none.\" Naturopathic Scope of Practice Sunrise Page 219 WANP: In the same manner that ARNP scope a nd authority have evolved over time, so has naturopathic practice and prescriptive au thority. The previous expansion of prescriptive authority in 2005 and the additi on of NDs to Medicaid are recent examples of how our profession is changing to more fu lly contribute to the overall health care system and specifically to the care an d well being of Washington residents. We anticipate this will continue with eventual recognition in Medicare and more eligibility for NDs to practice in underser ved areas and with populations dependent on federal programs for their health care. As part of our July 27, 2014 submission to the DOH, the WANP submitted evidence for ND inte rest in rural / underserved practice in the study conducted at Bastyr University. To date, lack of opportunitie s and prior lack of eligibility to participate in Medicaid have constrained the prac tice of NDs to more populous counties.

The DOH Draft Sunrise Report also states, \"Bastyr University, a primary educator of NDs in this region, has indicated it will only revise the current pharmacology trainin g to include controlled substances rather than add hours to the training. The additional education and training the applicant proposes is not sufficient to address deficiencies in core training.\" I want to add to these statements that Bastyr University would be willing and able to develop and offer a contin uing medical educational program on controlled substances through the University's Department of Certificate, Community and Continuing Education, that could address any current deficiencies in core training to satisfy the new education requirements required by the legislature and the Board of Naturopathy. Bastyr University would also be pleased to offer its assistance in the develo pment of the necessary education and training requirements to ensure public safety and optimal care by naturopathic physicians in the use of these new medications. Finally, I am submitting a correction in the number of pharmacology hours in the Bastyr University curriculum. The correct number of required dida ctic hours is 88, not 60.5. Thank you for considering my additional comments. Sincerely, Jane Guiltinan, N.D.
