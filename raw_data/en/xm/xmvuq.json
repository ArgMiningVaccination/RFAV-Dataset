This New Year, we hope this issue will inspire you to break the cycle of failed resolutions and make a new commitment (or recommitment) to putting yourself first! Take time to do the things you love and be with the ones you love. Be kind to yourself. And remember that you are the most important member of your healthcare team. Learn about your treatment and your health conditions so you can be an active participant in your healthcare. In this issue you'll learn how to be prepared for your yearly care plan meetings with your dialysis care team. You'll also learn about medications that are given during dialysis and how to start planning your advanced directives. Ask questions, talk to your healthcare team, and contact our NKF Cares Help Line toll-free (855.653.2273) or email nkfcares@kidney.org for free educational brochures and to learn more.

He has plenty of time on his hands while the dialysis machine cleans his blood. A former amateur painter and art gallery owner, he started sketching as a way to reflect the emotions that he experiences while on dialysis. He also sketched his surroundings, including other patients, nurses, and even the machinery. According to Harv, \"Art is the perfect way to channel my energy and creativity while on dialysis.\" He has acquired a loyal fan club. Fellow kidney patients and dialysis center staff admire his works and this has spurred a dialogue about the power of art and the way it can bring people together. Harv quickly realized that others, too, had an affinity for painting, sketching, photography, collage, and other art forms. Harv is inspired by the friendships he developed within his dialysis kidney community - who he considers \"part of his family,\" and they are inspired by him and his artwork as well. \"I felt an art exhibit would be the perfect way to channel the simultaneously individual and collaborative nature of art, bringing people together from across the unit. Even the Medical Director of the dialysis unit was drawn towards art,\" he says. With the help of the dedicated dialysis unit staff, the art show concept was born. Harv created flyers to bring attention to his idea. Quickly thereafter, patients, nurses, friends, and (and Kidneys!) ART FROM THE HEART Art is the perfect way to channel my energy and creativity while on dialysis.5 Join us for a Walk Find one near you in 2015 family members of those on dialysis all began contributing individual pieces of artwork, and within a two month period, an exhibit was formed. Harv helped cultivate the show, but credits its success to the contributions of everyone who participated and to those who helped him set up the exhibit throughout the dialysis center. He hopes to expand the exhibit to other blank walls within the unit, filling them up on a rotating basis as new pieces are created. kidneywalk.org Harv Toback, kidney patient, artist, and art show organizer. Lito Severino, Nurse Manager.6 National Kidney Foundation Injected Medication People with kidney disease may need medicines that are either injected under the skin (subcutaneous or SC) or in a vein (intravenous or IV). These are ordered by your dialysis doctor or advanced practitioner. These medications treat low red blood cell count (anemia), weak bones, and prevent clotting during treatment. Some medications help prevent you from getting sick while others fight infections. Vaccines The immune system of kidney patients may become weakened, making it easier to get sick. A weakened immune system also makes it hard for the body to fight off diseases. Vaccines are one way to prevent getting sick and fight diseases. Common vaccines given at the dialysis center include those to fight the flu (influenza vaccine), pneumonia (pneumococcal vaccine), and hepatitis B (hepatitis B vaccine). Many patients wonder what medicines are given during dialysis and what each of these medicines does in the body. Knowing what you are given and why will help you be a partner in your care. Here's an overview:by Kristy Washinger, CRNPDialysis Medications ?HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW ? ? ? ?7Anemia medication The kidneys are responsible for producing a hormone called erythropoietin, which helps make red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. When your kidneys cannot make erythropoietin, your body does not have enough red blood cells, and you may develop anemia. Many patients on dialysis have anemia, which can make you very tired. Because the kidneys can no longer make erythropoietin, many dialysis patients receive the man-made form of this hormone called an Erythropoietin Stimulating Agent (ESA). Some patients and healthcare practitioners shorten the name and call it \"Epo.\" This medicine can be given by vein or under the skin at dialysis. Anemia can also result from a lack of iron in the body, so some patients take oral iron and some are treated with IV iron. Vitamin D Kidney disease can also lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), which may affect bone health. This can cause the body's levels of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels to be out of balance. When these levels are out of balance, patients can have joint pains or even broken bones. Because the kidneys are unable to change the vitamin D to its active form, a man-made form of vitamin D called a vitamin D analog can be given at dialysis to decrease parathyroid hormone levels and keep bones strong. Antibiotics Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria or slow their growth. IV antibiotics may be given during dialysis to treat infections related to your dialysis access. These medicines are usually given at the end of a treatment, so that they are not removed from the blood during dialysis. Blood Thinner Sometimes dialysis lines will clot during treatment. This happens when the blood becomes thick and does not flow freely through the dialysis lines. Heparin is a medicine that prevents clotting and allows for better dialysis. It can be given at the beginning of dialysis or during your treatment. Some patients may be unable to take this medicine if they have a bleeding problem or experience active bleeding. You may also ask your healthcare practitioner about medications such as Tylenol and Benadryl that may be requested as needed during dialysis treatment. These medications are given by mouth and are typically to treat headaches, itching, or help with sleep. All of these medications are important for overall health. Make sure you talk to your kidney healthcare practitioner about your medications in order to understand what medications you may be receiving and why you are getting them. Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents DURING DIALYSIS 8 National Kidney Foundation by Gary and Kim Chmielewski Remember hearing the words \"your kidneys have failed?\" Then, your healthcare practitioner probably said dialysis would be in your immediate future. Whether you heard this 20 years or 2 weeks ago, you may have suddenly felt the world was getting darker. I remember feeling that the meaning and purpose of life was rapidly coming to an end! Doom, gloom, and a dismal future seemed imminent. Luckily this was just fear and not reality. Of course, the reality of kidney failure and dialysis did include changes in how you live and your daily routine. However, it is important to remember that how you live and the contributions you make to your job, your family, and your community are still entirely up to you. Continue working. If you're active in your church, community, schools, or with hobbies, fit them into your new routine. Focus on what is important and not on the compromises that come with dialysis. Schedule your treatments with an eye on the calendar, fitting time-consuming activities into your days off. Attend those monthly meetings, schedule your community service activities, and \u2014 above all \u2014 spend time with your family and friends. Try for early morning doctor and dentist appointments, so that you have time for yourself later in the day. Focus on the blessings in your life, and not the \"why is this happening to me?\" If your pre-dialysis routine involved a weekly date night with your significant other, by all means continue this tradition and have fun. Stay flexible, leaving Sunday mornings open, for example, for events you want to attend. If possible, get up early to dialyze so that you have the rest of the day for you. Travel if you want to. Of course this involves extra planning, but after a few getaways, you'll find traveling is not an insurmountable task. Remember, what you do with your life is up to you! A positive attitude and a full schedule of worthwhile commitments will keep you focused on what's important and provide a fulfilling life beyond dialysis.Dialysis & Making Time for Funju linggg 9 An advance directive is a legal document that tells doctors and healthcare providers how you want them to carry out medical decisions you have made, even if you cannot communicate these decisions for yourself. If you have an advance directive in your medical records, your doctor and other healthcare providers can take care of you based on your wishes. An advance directive only goes into effect if and when you are not able to communicate and cannot make your own health care decisions. ASK YOUR HEALTH CARE TEAM Q A & Remember, no one will know about your advance directive unless you tell them. It's important to share a written copy and discuss your wishes with your healthcare team and your family. If you are religious, you may also wish to speak with your religious advisor to understand your religion's views regarding advance directives. It may also be helpful to speak with a lawyer or your social worker in order to better understand your state's specific laws concerning advance directives. You can also obtain a copy of your state's advance directive forms online. To learn more visit: www.kidney.org/kidneyliving. There are two basic kinds of advance directives: 1. A living will tells your doctor or health care provider what type of medical care you want (or do not want) if you should become unable to make these decisions for yourself. 2. A dur able power of attorney or a health care proxy allows you to name a family member or close friend to act on your behalf if you are unable to make medical decisions for yourself. It is important to talk to them about what treatments you would want and those you wouldn't want. With an advance directive, it may be possible to accept all treatments recommended by the healthcare provider, accept some treatments and refuse others, or refuse all recommended treatments. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to restore breathing and blood circulation. This includes heart massage, drugs, electric shocks, and artificial breathing machines. Tube feedings giving food and/or water through a tube into a vein or into the stomach. Artificial respiration (ventilator or respirator) a machine that breathes for a person through a tube in the throat.I've been asked by my healthcare team to have an advance directive. What does this mean? What types of decisions can I make in an advance directive? Treatments to discuss with your family and healthcare team for your advance directive Antibiotics to fight infection. Dialysis for kidney failure, either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.Surgery such as heart bypass, gall bladder, etc. Blood transfusions or blood products.10 National Kidney FoundationYou may not realize this, but YOU are the most important member of your healthcare team. Doctors, advanced practitioners, nurses, dietitians, social workers, and technicians are well trained to provide comprehensive care and provide support. However, no two patients are the same, so it's important that your healthcare team knows YOU! TO HELP YOU TAKE PART IN YOUR 10Tips *This material was prepared by FMQAI: End Stage Renal Disease Network 18 of Southern California's Patient Subject Matter Experts Pharmacist Community Dietitian Clinic Hospital YOUR DR. YOU Social Worker NurseCARE PLAN MEETING*11 Know your care plan . It's your road map to better health. Your care plan is created each year by your doctor and the dialysis staff, and contains medical, nutritional, and social goals specific to you. Request a copy of your careplan and save it with your medical records. Investigate and inquire. Find out why you are receiving certain medications, how well dialysis is cleaning your blood, why certain foods are bad for you, and what foods are best for you to eat and drink. Know your dialysis options. Some dialysis options may suit your needs and schedule better than others. For example, some forms of dialysis make it easier to work or go to school during the day. Express your needs and wishes and find out which types of dialysis may be a better fit. Notice trends. Is your blood pressure high lately? Have you had any changes in appetite? Have you noticed changes in your mood or that you're feeling depressed? Are you cramping more frequently? Are you having trouble sleeping at night? These trends could indicate that your care plan should be adjusted. Tell the staff about them in your care plan meeting. Educate yourself. Don't be shy or afraid to ask for medical terms to be explained in words you can understand. Ask where you can get more information about them. They are important! Know yourself. You know your body better than anyone else. If you don't feel well after taking some medications, tell the doctor and the staff exactly how you feel. They need your feedback to make sure your care plan is working for you. Interrupting is okay. You are the star of your care plan meeting. Don't be shy. Be heard! Everyone benefits when you take an active role in your meeting. It shows that you care. Decide together. Make sure you understand what each part of the care plan means and how it will affect your health. You will be asked to approve the decisions the doctor and staff make, so you need to understand each aspect of them. Enjoy the attention. This meeting is focused entirely on your health and how to improve it, so don't be passive. Be positive! You don't have to go alone. It's okay to bring a loved one, family member, or good friend to help you ask questions and get answers. They can even go in your place, but it's best for you to be there and participate. It is mandatory that your dialysis healthcare team creates and reviews your individual plan of care on at least a yearly basis. You should be invited to attend a meeting with your team to discuss this plan of care. Take advantage of this opportunity by asking questions, learning more about your health, and telling your healthcare team how you are really feeling. 5 6 9 10 8 2 3 1 4 7Tips to help you feel prepared to discuss your plan of care with your dialysis team: 12 National Kidney FoundationKIDNEY KITCHEN INGREDIENTS: Cauliflower diced finely 2 celery stalks, chopped4 hardboiled eggs, chopped 3 oz plain Greek yogurt 6 tbsp. mayonnaise3 tsp. dijon mustard 1 dill pickle, chopped (low sodium) 2 tbsp. dill pickle juice1 tsp. black pepper 1 tsp. chopped Chicken recipe: 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts sliced into cutlets lengthwise 2 cups plain panko bread crumbs 2 oz grated parmesan cheese 1 tsp. ground oregano tsp. paprika dash or two black pepper2 eggs, lightly beaten 3 oz plain Greek yogurt lemon juice, and zest of 1 lemoncanola oil DIRECTIONS: Cauliflower salad: 1.

Tell us what you liked and why others should go! For more Voices, visit www.kidney.org/kidneylivingMy daughter and I attended the kidney walk in Cleveland, Ohio in 2014. It was an awesome experience to witness so much support. We will continue to walk the walk against kidney disease. Carmelina B. This year was my second walk. I had so much fun and met a lot of new friends. If you've never done one, I would recommend it! Patrice The Kidney Walk was amazing, especially with my family and friends supporting me to fight this disease and to raise awareness. I'm only 24 years old and I'm truly blessed to have a twin willing to be my donor and giving me a second chance at life. I couldn't ask for anything more. Victoria P. I've participated in two Kidney Walks in 2014. Walks are a great way to promote kidney disease awareness. Everyone should participate in at least one Kidney Walk. Jervelle F. I spent 2 years on dialysis. Then I got a kidney transplant at Easter. My life has totally changed. I walk to promote living donors, because my wife was my donor. Wayne S.People should join us in honoring those who give so much. They should come out and feel just how rewarding it is to be a part of giving the Gift of Life in any and all ways they feel fit. Bill H. I am 25 years young, and I've been going to the annual Phoenix Kidney Walk since 2011. I am a kidney recipient and dialysis patient. What I love most about the Walks is not only the number of families joining to help, but the great booths that provide fun ways of learning about kidney disease and kidney failure! It also allows you to make new friends who are going through the same issues. Priscilla S. This was my first Twin Cities Kidney Walk. It was an awesome experience to have so many people come together for support, positivity, encouragement, and love. I would definitely do this again and I would encourage others to participate as well. Katie J. I've completed the Kidney Walk every year since I started dialysis. It is a great way to meet other people and a way to give back. It empowered me. I was blessed with a kidney 16 months ago and will continue to participate in my local walk for the rest of my days.
