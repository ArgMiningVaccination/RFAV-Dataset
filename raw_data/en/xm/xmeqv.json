This the bridge energy center that connects between the Throat Chakra and the Third Eye Chakra. In this space, you find the ability to speak with passion and with intuitive insight. Opening this center will aid in establishing healthy boundaries for yourself, effectively communicate your deep spiritual insights and motivate others with your passion. To celebrate this power center we have all of our Mouth Chakra pendants, bracelets and cones on sale for 20% off! Powerful tools for unlocking your Chakras We here at QBC believe there is great power within us to improve and lift ourselves out of negativity and problematic habits. We seek to teach people how to tap into their energy centers and learn self mastery. We believe spirituality is an essential aspect to a healthy life and that it does not have to be complicated for it to work. Each of our pendants, bracelets and cones are made of quartz crystals that are tuned to very specific frequencies. We then encase them in a planet based resin so that while worn, it will help you activate the chakra center. Whether you are a beginner or a Reiki Master, we have something for you here at QBC and we believe crystals are the perfect companion to your spiritual journey. We are very proud to have helped countless people over the last decade feel more empowered and achieve self-actualization. Customized just for you Since we create everything ourselves in our little workshop, we can happily customize a pendant to your exact wishes. We make order so we can create any desired length of necklace, mix in different kinds of beads or even add a couple extra pendants to make very powerful Trinity necklace!
