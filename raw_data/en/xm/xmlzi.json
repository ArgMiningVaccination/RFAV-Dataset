Immunodeficiency Canada endorses Health Canada recommendation to get a flu shot Getting the flu shot is your best defense against the flu. It is a safe and effective way to protect you and those around you, and helps to avoid doctor's visits and unnecessary testing for COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic. It's important to note that the flu shot will not protect you from COVID-19 - you should still wear a mask, wash your hands frequently and maintain physical distancing from others. Protect yourself. Protect your loved ones. Get your flu shot!

With their experience and knowledge this team produced guidelines published in Lymphosign Journal, September 2017. It is now the standard for diagnostic and treatment centres of Primary Immunodeficiency across Canada. \"Immunodeficiency Canada has a direct impact in the care and treatment of patients with Primary Immunodeficiency. Through our network of Immunologists, we brought the expertise together to provide the best treatments for patients based on science.\" [National Immunoglobulin Replacement Expert Committee Guidelines](http://lymphosign.com/doi/10.14785/lymphosign-2017-0008) [Newborn Screening for SCID](https://immunodeficiency.ca/2013/12/severe-combined-immunodeficiency/) Immunodeficiency Canada, a pioneer in bringing newborn screening for SCID to Canada. In 2013, Ontario was the first province to test for SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency). \"This is a monumental triumph to children born with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and their families. Newborn screening will detect this problem early before complications develop, and allow for prompt life-saving interventions such as bone marrow transplantation. Usually the diagnosis of SCID is either missed or delayed until the age of 6-12 months of age, after patients suffer from severe and recurrent infections, and sometimes irreversible damage to organs such as the lungs. Newborn screening for SCID will no doubt save many lives and prevent suffering of children.\" Professor Chaim Roifman, MD, FRCPC Chair and Scientific Director, Immunodeficiency Canada [Latest Province to implement Newborn Screening for SCID - B.C. and Yukon](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2022HLTH0197-001536) [Healthcare Professionals Event Calendar](https://immunodeficiency.ca/2014/09/introducing-our-event-calendar/) Learn about Primary Immunodeficiency scientific events. [LymphoSign Journal](https://immunodeficiency.ca/2019/08/lymphosign-journal/) The official journal of Immunodeficiency Canada. LymphoSign Journal publishes novel clinical, translational, and basic research in the fields of immunology, gastroenterology, neurology, dermatology, rheumatology, hematology, and infectious disease. The aim of the journal is to provide a forum for clinicians and scientists to discuss clinical observations, therapies, and insights into underlying disease mechanisms in immune disorders including immune deficiencies, auto-inflammatory disorders, allergy, bone marrow failure, and lymphoid malignancies. Special consideration will be given, but is not limited to, articles exploring adaptive and innate immunity, mucosal immunity, signal transduction, lymphocyte development and cell death, genomic medicine, gene regulation, DNA repair, and cell cytoskeletal networks. LymphoSign Journal publishes peer-reviewed original research articles, reviews, clinical trials, case reports, novel mutations, and imaging, as well as practice guidelines, algorithms, and protocols.
